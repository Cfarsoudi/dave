          EXT - DAIRY FARM- DAY
          The modest dairy farm in the countryside of Nancy, France (what the
          French call cow country).
          We Read a SUBTITLE in the sky above the farm house;

          CHAPTER ONE

          "ONCE UPON A TIME IN...

          NAZI OCCUPIED FRANCE"
          This SUBTITLE disappears, and is replaced by another one;

          "1941
          One year into the German
          occupation of France".
          The farm consists of a house, small barn, and twelve cows spread
          about.
          The owner of the property, a bull of a man FRENCH FARMER, brings a axe
          up and down on A tree stump blemishing his property. However simply by
          sight, you'd never know if he's been beating at this stump for the last
          year, or just started today.

          JULIE
          One of his three pretty teenage daughters, is hanging up laundry on
          the clothes line. As she hangs up a white bed sheet, she hears a
          noise, moving the sheet aside she see's;

          JULIE'S POV:
          A Nazi town car convertible, with two little nazi flags attached to
          the hood, a NAZI SOLDIER behind the wheel, a NAZI OFFICER alone in the
          back seat, following TWO OTHER NAZI SOLDIERS on motorcycles, coming up
          over the hill on the country road leading to their farm.

          JULIE
          Pappa.
          The French Farmer sinks his axe in the stump, looks over his shoulder,
          and see's the Germans approaching.
          The FARMERS WIFE, CHARLOTTE comes to the doorway of their home,
          followed by her TWO OTHER TEENAGE DAUGHTERS, and see the Germans
          approaching.
          The Farmer yells to his family in FRENCH, SUBTITLED IN ENGLISH;

          FARMER
          Go back inside and shut the door.

          

          

          

          

          IL

          FARMER
          (to Julie)
          Julie, get me some water from the pump
          to wash up with, then get inside with
          your mother.
          The young lady runs to the water pump by the house. She picks up a
          basin, and begins pumping, after a few pumps, water comes out
          splashing into the basin.
          The French Farmer sits down on the stump he was previously chopping
          away at, pulls a handkerchief from his pocket, wipes sweat from off
          his face, and waits for the Nazi convoy to arrive. After living for
          a year with the sword of Damocles suspended over his head, this may
          very well be the end.
          Julie finishes filling the water basin, and places it on the window
          sill.

          JULIE
          Ready Pappa.

          FARMER
          Thank you darling, now go inside and
          take care of your mother. Don't run.
          Julie walks inside the farm house and closes the door behind her.
          As her father stands up from his stump, and moves over to the window
          sill with the water basin...
          .The SOUND of the ENGINES of the two motorcycles and car get LOUDER.
          The Farmer SPLASHES water from the basin on his face and down his
          front. He takes a towel off a nail, and wipes the excess water from
          his face and chest, as he watches the two motorcycles, the one
          automobile, and the four representatives of the National Socialist
          Party come to a halt on his property.
          We don't move into them, but keep observing them from a distance, like
          the Farmer.
          The TWO NAZI MOTORCYCLIST are off their bikes, and standing at
          attention next to them.
          The NAZI DRIVER has walked around the automobile, and opened the door
          for his superior.
          The NAZI OFFICER says to The Driver in UNSUBTITLED GERMAN;

          NAZI OFFICER
          This is the property of Perrier LaPadite?

          

          

          

          

          3

          NAZI DRIVER
          Yes heer Colonel.
          The Nazi officer climbs out of the back the vehicle, carrying
          in his left hand
           n d

          OFFICER
          Herman, until I summon you, I am to be
          left alone.

          NAZI DRIVER
          As you wish Heer Col.
          The S.S. COLONEL yells to The Farmer in FRENCH, SUBTITLED IN ENGLISH;

          NAZI OFFICER
          Is this the property of Perrier LaPadite?

          FARMER
          I am Perrier LaPadite.
          The S.S. Colonel crosses the distance between them with long strides,
          and says in French with a smile on his face;

          NAZI OFFICER
          It is a pleasure to meet you Monsieur
          LaPadite, I am Colonel Hans Landa of
          the S.S.
          COLONEL.HANS LANDA offers the French Farmer PERRIER LAPADITE his hand.
          The Frenchman takes the German hand in his and shakes it.

          PERRIER
          How may I help you?

          COL LANDA
          I was hoping you could invite me inside
          your home and we may have a discussion.

          INT - LAPADITE FARM HOUSE - DAY
          The door to the farm house swings open, andtheaFarmer gesturestfor
          the S.S. COL to enter. Removing his grey S.S. cap,
          inside the Frenchman's home.
          Col Landa is immediately greeted with the sight of the Farmers wife,
          and three pretty daughters standing together in the kitchen, smiling
          in his direction.
          The Farmer enters behind him, closing the door.

          

          

          

          

          VA

          PERRIER
          Colonel Landa, this is my family.
          The S.S. COL clicks his heels together, and takes the hand of the
          French Farmers Wife...

          COL LANDA
          Col Hans Landa of the S.S. madame,
          at your service.
          He kisses her hand, then continues without letting go of his hostess
          hand...

          COL LANDA
          please excuse my rude intrusion on your
          routine.

          FARMERS WIFE
          Don't be ridiculous, heer Col.
          While still holding the French Woman's hand, and looking into her
          eyes, The S.S. Colonel says;

          COL LANDA
          Monsieur LaPadite, the rumors I have
          heard in the village about your family
          are all true. Your wife is a beautiful
          woman.
          His eyes leave the mother, and move to the three daughters.

          COL.LANDA

          (CON' T )
          And each of your daughters is more lovely
          then the last.

          PERRIER
          Merci. Please have a seat.
          The Farmer offers The S.S. Colonel a seat at the families wooden
          dinner table. The Nazi officer excepts the French Farmers offer,
          and lowers himself into the chair. Placing his grey S.S. cap on
          the table, and keeping his black attache case on the floor by his
          feet.
          The Farmer (perfect host) turns to his Wife and says;

           PERRIER
          Charlotte, would you be so good as to get
          The Colonel some wine?

          

          

          

          

          COL LANDA
          Merci be coupe Monsieur LaPadite, but no
          wine. This being a dairy farm one would
          be safe in assuming you have milk?

          CHARLOTTE
          Oui.

          COL LANDA
          Then milk is what I prefer.

          CHARLOTTE
          Very Well.
          The mother of three, takes a craft of milk out of the ice box,
          and pours a tall glass of the fresh white liquid for The Colonel.
          The S.S. Colonel takes a long drink from the glass, then puts it down
          LOUDLY on the wooden table.

          COL LANDA
          Monsieur, to both your family, and your
          cows, I say; Bravo.

          PERRIER
          Merci.

          COL LANDA
          Please, join me at your
          table.

          PERRIER
          Very well.
          The French Farmer sit's at his wooden dinner table across from
          The Nazi.
          The Women remain standing.
          Col Landa leans forward, and says to the Farmer in a low tone of

          CONFIDENTIALLY;

          COL LANDA
          Monsieur LaPadite, what we have to
          discuss,' would be better discussed in
          private. You'll notice, I left my men
          outdoors- if it wouldn't offend them,
          could you ask your lovely ladies to step
          outside.

          PERRIER
          You are right.

          

          

          

          

          G.

          PERRIER
          (to his women)
          Charlotte, would you take the girls
          outside. The Colonel and I need to have
          a few words.
          The Farmers wife follows her husbands orders, and gathers her
          daughter's taking them outside, closing the door behind them.
          The Two Men are alone, at the farmers dinner table, in the Farmers
          humble home.

          COL LANDA
          Monsieur LaPadite, I regret to inform
          you I've exhausted the extent of my
          French. To continue to speak it so
          inadequately, would only serve to
          embarrass me. However, I've been lead
          to believe you speak English quite well?

          PERRIER
          Oui.

          COL LANDA
          Well, it just so happens, I do as well.
          This being your house, I ask your
          permission to switch to English, for the
          remainder of the conversation?

          PERRIER
          By all means.
          They now speak ENGLISH;

          COL LANDA
          Monsieur LaPadite, while I'm very
          familiar with you, and your family.
          I have no way of knowing if you are
          familiar with who I am. Are you aware
          of my existence?
          The Farmer answers;

          PERRIER
          Yes.

          COL LANDA
          This is good. Are you aware of the job
          I've been ordered to carry out in France?

          

          

          

          

          I

          PERRIER
          Yes.
          The Colonel drinks more milk.

          COL LANDA
          Please tell me what you've heard?

          PERRIER
          I've heard, the fuhrer has put you in
          charge of rounding up the Jews left in
          France who are ether hiding, or passing
          for Gentile.
          The S.S.Colonel smiles.

          COL LANDA
          The Fuhrer couldn't of said it better
          himself.

          PERRIER
          But the meaning of your visit, pleasant
          though it is, is mysterious to me.
          The Germans looked through my house nine
          months ago for hiding Jews, and found
          nothing.

          COL LANDA
          I'm aware of that, I read the report on
          this area. But like any enterprise,
          when under new management, there's
          always a slight duplication of efforts.
          Most of it being a complete waste of time,
          but needs to be done nevertheless.
          I just have A few questions Monsieur
          LaPadite, if you can assist me with
          answers, my department can close the
          file on your family.
          Taking his black leather attache case, and placing it on the table, he
          takes out a folder from inside. He also extracts a expensive black
          fountain pen from his uniform front pocket. Opening the folder, and
          referring to it;

          COL LANDA
          Now before the occupation there were
          four Jewish families in this area, all
          dairy farmers like yourself.
          The Loveitts, The Doleracs, The Rollins,
          and The Dreyfus's, is that correct?

          

          

          

          

          8,

          PERRIER
          To my knowledge those were the Jewish
          families among the dairy farmers.
          - Heer Colonel, would it disturb you if
          I smoked my pipe?
          Looking up from his papers.

          COL LANDA
          Please, Monsieur LaPadite, it is your
          house, make yourself comfortable.
          The Farmer gets up from the table, goes to his shelf over the
          fireplace, and removes from it a WOODEN BOX that contains all the
          fixins to his pipe. He sits back down at the table with his Nazi
          guest.
          As The Farmer loads the bowel of his pipe with tobacco, sets a match
          to it, and begins slowly puffing, making it red hot, the S.S. Colonel
          studies the papers in front of him.

          COL LANDA
          Now according to these papers, all
          the Jewish families in this area have
          been accounted for - except, The Dreyfusis.
          Somewhere in the last year it would appear
          they have vanished.
          Which leads me to the conclusion that
          they've ether made good their escape,
          or someone is very successfully hiding
          them.
          (looking up from
          his papers, across
          the table at The

          FARMER)
          What have you heard about The Dreyfusis
          Monsieur LaPadite?

          PERRIER
          Only rumors -

          COL LANDA
          - I love rumors! Facts can be so
          misleading, where rumors, true or false
          are often reveling. So Monsieur LaPadite,
          what rumors have you heard regarding
          The Dreyfusis?
          The Farmerlooks at Landa.

          

          

          

          

          I.

          COL LANDA
          Speak freely Monsieur LaPadite, I want
          to hear what the rumors are, not who told
          them to you.
          The Farmer puffs thoughtfully on his pipe.

          PERRIER
          Again, this is just a rumor - but we
          heard the Dreyfusis had made there way
          into Spain.

          COL LANDA
          So the rumors you've heard have been of
          escape?

          PERRIER
          Yes.

          COL LANDA
          Were the LaPadites and the Dreyfusis
          friendly?
          As the Farmer answers this question, the CAMERA LOWERS behind his
          chair, to the floor, past the floor, to a small area underneath the
          floorboards revealing;

          FIVE HUMAN BEINGS
          lying vertically underneath the farmers floorboards. These human
          beings are The DREYFUSIS, who have lived lying down underneath the
          dairy farmers house for the past year. But one couldn't call what The
          Dreyfusis have done for the last year living. This family has done the
          only thing they could, hidden from a occupying army that wishes to
          exterminate them.

          PERRIER
          We were families in the same community,
          in the same bussiness. I wouldn't say
          we were friends, but members of the same
          community, we had common interest.
          The S.S. Colonel takes in this answer, seems to except it, then moves
          to the next question.

          COL LANDA
          Having never met the Dreyfusis, would
          you confirm for me the exact members of
          the household and their names?

          

          

          

          

          10.

          PERRIER
          There were five of them.
          The father, Jacob... .wife, Miram...
          her brother, Bob ...

          COL LANDA
          - How old is Bob?

          PERRIER
          Thirty - thirty one?

          COL LANDA
          Continue.

          PERRIER
          And the children... Amos... and Shoshanna.

          COL LANDA
          Ages of the children?

          PERRIER
          Amos - six - I believe. And Shosanna,
          was fifteen or sixteen, I'm not really
          sure.

          CUT TO

          UXT - DAIRY FARM - DAY
          The Mother and her three Daughters finish taking the laundry off the
          clothes line.
          They can't hear anything going on inside.
          e three Nazi Soldiers watch the three Daughters.

          SACK TO LANDA AND PERRIER

          COL LANDA
          Well I guess that should do it.
          Be begins gathering up his papers, and putting them back into his
           ttache case.
          the Farmer, cool as a cucumber, puffs on his pipe.

          COL LANDA
          However, before I go, could I have another
          glass of your delicious milk?

          

          

          

          
          it.

          PERRIER
          But of course.
          Farmer stands up, goes over to the ice box, and takes out the
          aft of milk. As he walks over and fills the Nazi Colonel's glass,
          German Officer talks.

          COL LANDA
          Monsieur LaPadite, are you aware of the
          nickname the people of France have given
          me?

          PERRIER
          I have no interest in such things.

          COL LANDA
          But you are aware of what they call me?

          PERRIER
          I'm aware.

          COL LANDA
          What are you aware of?

          PERRIER
          That they call you, "The Jew Hunter".

          COL LANDA
          Precisely! Now I understand your
          trepidation in repeating it.
          Before he was assassinated, Heydrich
          apparently hated the moniker the good
          people of Prague bestowed on him.
          Actually why he would hate the name,
          "The Hangman", is baffling to me
          It would appear he did everything in
          his power to earn it. But I, on the
          other hand, love my unofficial title,
          precisely because I've earned it.
          As "The Jew Hunter" enjoys his fresh milk, he continues to theorize
          with the french farmer.

          COL LANDA
          The feature that makes me such a effective
          hunter of the Jews, is, as opposed to most
          German soldiers, I can think like a jew.
          where they can only think like a German,
          or more precisely, a German soldier.
          Now if one were to determine what attribute
          the German people share with a beast, it
          would be the cunning and predatory instinct
          of a hawk.

          Negro's - gorilla's - brain - lips -
          smell - physical strength - penis size.
          But, if one were to determine what attributes
          the jews share with a beast, it would be
          that of the rat.
          Now the Fuhrer and Gobbles propaganda
          have said pretty much the same thing.
          Where our conclusions differ, is I don't
          consider the comparison a insult.
          Consider for a moment, the world a rat
          lives in. It's a hostile world indeed.
          If a rat were to scamper through your
          front door right now, would you greet it
          with hostility?

          PERRIER
          I suppose I would.

          COL LANDA
          Has a rat ever done anything to you to
          create this animosity you feel toward
          them?

          PERRIER
          Rat's spread disease, they bite people -

          COL LANDA
          - Unless some fool is stupid enough to
          try and handle a live one, rats don't
          make it a practise of biting human beings.
          Rats were the cause of the bubonic plague,
          but that was some time ago. In all your
          born days, has a rat ever caused you to
          be sick a day in your life? I purpose to
          you, any disease a rat could spread,
          a squirrel could equally carry.
          Yet I assume you don't share the same
          animosity with squirrels that you do with
          rats, do you?

          PERRIER
          No.

          COL LANDA
          Yet, they are both rodent's, are they
          not? And except for the fact that one
          has a big bushy tail, while the other
          has a long repugnt tail of rodent skin,
          they even rather look alike, don't they?

          It is a interesting thought,
          beer Colonel.

          COL LANDA
          However, interesting as the thought may
          be, it makes not one bit of difference
          to how you feel. If a rat were to scamper
          through your door, this very minute,
          would you offer it a saucer of your
          delicious milk?

          PERRIER
          Probably not.

          COL LANDA
          I didn't think so. You don't like them.
          You don't really know why you don't like
          them. All you know is, you find them
          repulsive.
          (let's the

          METAPHOR
          sink in)
          What a tremendously hostile world a rat
          must endure. Yet, not only does he
          survive, he thrives. And the reason for
          this, is because our little foe has a
          instinct for survival and presavation
          second to none. And that Monsieur, is
          what a jew shares with a rat.
          Consequently, a German soldier, conducts
          a search of a house suspected of hiding
          jews. Where does the hawk look? He looks
          in the barn, he looks in the attic,
          he looks in the cellar - he looks
          everywhere, he would hide. But there are
          many places it would never occur to a
          hawk to hide. However the reason the
          Fuhrer brought me off my Alps in Austria,
          and placed me in French cow country today,
          is because it does occur to me. Because
          I'm aware what tremendous feats human
          beings are capable of once they abandon
          dignity.

          Th e Farmer's cool facade is little by little eroding.

          The Jew Hunter, removes both a pipe and a bag of tobacco fixings.
          The pipe, strangely enough, is a Calabash, made from a "S" shaped goard

          The other mistake the German soldier
          make is their severe handling of the
          citizens who give shelter and aid to
          the Jews. These citizens are not enemies
          of the state. They are simply confused
          people, trying to make some sense out of
          the madness war creates.
          These citizens do not need punishing.
          They simply need to be reminded of their
          duty in war time.
          Let's use you as a example Monsieur
          LaPadite. In this war, you have found
          yourself in the middle of a conflict
          that has nothing to do with yourself,
          your lovely ladies, or your cows - yet,
          here you are.
          So Monsieur LaPadite, let me purpose
          a question. In this time of war, what is
          your number one duty? Is it to fight the
          Germans in the name of France to your
          last breath? Or, is it to harass the
          occupying army to the best of your
          ability? Or, is it to protect the poor
          unfortunate victims of warfare who can
          not protect themselfs?
          Or, is your number one duty in this time
          of bloodshed, to protect those very
          beautiful women who constitute your
          family?
          The Colonel lets the last statement stand.

          COL LANDA
          That was a question Monsieur LaPadite.
          In this time of war, What do you consider
          your number one duty?

          PERRIER
          To protect my family.

          COL LANDA
          Now, my job dictates, that I must have
          my men enter your home, and conduct a
          thorough search, before I can officially
          cross your families name off my list.

          (CON'T)
          And if there are any irregularities to be
          found, rest assured, they will be.
          That is unless, you have something to tell
          me that will make the conducting of a
          search unnecessary.

          (PAUSE)
          I might add also, that any information
          that makes the preforming of My duty
          easier, will not be met with punishment.
          Actually quite the contrary, it will be
          met with reward.
          And that reward will be, your family
          will cease to be harassed in anyway,
          by the German military during the rest
          of our occupation of your country.
          The Farmer, pipe in mouth, stares across the table at his German
          opponent.

          COL LANDA
          You are sheltering enemies of the state,
          are you not?

          underneath.

          Since I haven't heard any disturbance,
          I assume that while their listening,
          they don't speak english?

          With a hand motion from the Colonel, the Soldiers cut off their

          her to escape, our not nessessarlly
          the same thing. She's a young girl, no food,
          no shelter, no shoes, who's just witnessed
          the massacre of her entire family.
          She may not survive the night. And after
          word spreads about what happened today,
          it's highly unlikely she will find any
          willing farmers to extend her aid.
          If I had to guess her fate, I'd say she'll
          probably be turned in by some neighbour.
          Or, she'll be spotted by some German
          soldier. Or, we'll find her body in the
          woods, dead from starvation or exposure.
          Or, perhaps-she'll survive. She will
          elude capture. She will escape to America.

          of filthy degenerates, are doing what
          the Russian army didn't, and Patton's
          army couldn't. Turning soldiers of
          The Third Reich, into superstitious
          old women!

          GERMAN GENERAL
          Just the cowards among them mine
          Fuhrer.
          Hitler pounds furiously on the desk with his fist.

          HITLER
          No, no, no, no, no, no! I have heard
          the rumors myself! Solders of The Third
          Reich, who have brought the world to
          there knee`s, now pecking and clucking
          like chickens. Do you know the latest
          rumor they've conjured up, in their fear
          induced delirium? The one that beats
          my boys with a bat. The one they call
          "The Bear Jew"...is a Golem.
          A avenging jew angel, conjured up by
          a vengeful rabbi, to smite the Aryans!

          GENERAL
          Mine Fuhrer, this is just soldiers
          gossip, no one really believes The
          Bear Jew is a golem.

          HITLER
          Why not? They seem to be able to elude
          capture like a aberration.
          They seem to be able to appear and
          disappear at will.

          You want to prove their flesh and

          I will hang them naked, by their
          heels, from the eiffel tower!
          And then throw their bodies in
          the sewers, for the rats of Paris
          to feast!
          The Fuhrer sits down at the table to compose himself, and
          wipe his greasy black hair out of his face.

          HITLER

          (DISGUSTED)
          The Bear Jew.
          He hits the button on the intercom on his desk.

          KLIEST1
          KLIEST VOICE comes out of the intercom;

          KLIEST'S VOICE(OS)
          Year mine Fuhrer.

          HITLER
          I have a order I want relayed to all
          German soldiers stationed in France.
          The Jew degenerate known as The Bear
          Jew, hence forth, is never to be
          referred to as The Bear Jew again.
          We will cease to aid the Americans
          any longer in there attempt to
          undermine the German soldier psyche.
          Did you get that Kliest?

          KLIEST'S VOICE(OS)
          Yes mine Fubrer. Do you still wish
          to see Private Butz?

          HITLER
          Who and what is a private Butz?

          KELIST'S VOICE(OS)
          He's the soldier you wanted to see
          personally. His squad was ambushed
          by Lt.Raines Jews. He was it's only
          survivor.

          HITLER
          Indeed I do want to see him, thank
          you for reminding me. Send him in.

          CU FACE OF DEAD GERMAN SOLDIER
          His head lies on the ground horizontal. A HAND reaches into
          FRAME, KNOCKS aside the dead German patriots helmet, and
          grabs a handful of the cadavers blonde hair. A LARGE KNIFE
          ENTERS FRAME, and begins SLICING ALONG THE HAIRLINE.
          This process is called SCALPING.
          After SLICING is complete, the SCALP easily peels off like a
          banana.

          GERMAN PRISONERS PVT.BUTZ AND SGT.RACHTMAN

          Private Butz NARRATES the scene in GERMAN SUBTITLED into

          PVT.BUTZ(VO)
          Werner and I were the only ones left
          alive after the ambush. While one man
          guarded us, the rest removed the hair.
          All The Basterds wore German scalps
          tied to their belts.

          CU SCALPS
          hanging from belts.

          PVT.BUTZ(VO)
          They not only took valuables...

          WE SEE QUICK CUTS OF
          Rings, Weapons, Iron Cross, and somebody digging out a Gold
          Tooth with a knife, being removed from Dead Germans.

          PVT.BUTZ(VO)
          ..They also took their identification
          papers.

          CU IDENTIFICATION PAPERS
          taken from the inside pocket of a dead German uniform.

          BASTERD PFC.UTIVICH
          flips through the I.D. papers till he gets to the page that
          contains the German soldiers, name, statistics, and photo.

          PVT.BUTZ(VO)

          PVT.BUTZ(VO)
          The Basterds, took their lives, their
          hair, their valuables, their identity,
          and finally their dignity in death.
          True that. The sight of the dead soldiers with bare feet
          does rob the tableaux of a certain dignity, that is normally
          felt in battlefield shots.

          BACK TO THE BASTERDS
          Aldo screams to The Basterd who's guarding the two German
          prisoners.

          LT.ALDO
          Hey Hirschberg, send that kraut
          sarge over.

          BASTERD PFC.HIRSCHBERG
          KICKS Sgt.Rachtman in the back.

          

          

          

          
          zw.

          PFC.HIRSCHBERG
          You! Go!
          Sgt.Rachtman is a little slow to respond. So Hirschberg
          grabs him by the hair, YANKS him to his feet, and KICKS him
          in the ass, sending him on his way.
          Most of The Bastreds sit in a circle, Indian style, with
          Aldo in the middle.
          As Sgt.Rachtman walks towards this circle of Basterds,
          A OFF SCREEN LITERARY NARRATOR (not Pvt.Butz) speaks over
          the SOUNDTRACK in ENGLISH;

          NARRATOR(VO)
          Sgt.Werner Rachtman has seen many
          interrogations since Germany decided
          it should rule Europe. But this is
          the first time he's ever been on the
          wrong end of the exchange.
          It's always been his belief, only a
          weakling, in mind, body, and spirt
          complies with the enemy under threat
          of consequence.
          As Werner watched men cry like women,
          pleadingly offer their knowledge, in
          exchange for their worthless lives,
          he made a vow to himself.
          If his role is to die in this conflict.
          When they put him under the earth, his
          dignity would be buried with him.
          For in the other world, the gods only
          respect the ones they test first.
          Well Sgt, this is your test.
          And the gods are watching.
          The captured German Sgt, enters the circle of Basterds,
          stands straight before the sitting southern Lieutenant, and
          salutes his captor.

          SGT.RACHTMAN

          (ENGLISH)
          Sgt.Werner Rachtman.
          Aldo returns the salute, looking up at him.

          LT.ALDO
          Lt.Aldo Raine, pleased to meet cha.
          You know what sit down means Werner?

          SGT.RACHTMAN
          Yes.

          LT.ALDO
          Then sit down.

          

          

          

          

          2.5.
          The German Sgt does.

          LT.ALDO
          Hows your English Werner? Cause if
          need be, we gotta a couple fellas
          can translate.
          Aldo points at one of The Basterds in the circle,

          CPL.WILHELM WICKI.

          LT.ALDO
          Wicki there, a Austrian Jew, got the
          fuck outta Saltzberg, while the
          gettin was good. Became American,
          got drafted, and came back to give
          y'all what for.
          Then Aldo points to another Basterd. A big scary looking
          Basterd, in a German Sgt's uniform, named, SGT.HUGO STIGLITZ

          LT.ALDO
          And another one over there, you
          might be familiar with, Sgt.Hugo
          Stiglitz. Heard of 'em.
          The two German Sgt's look at each other.

          SGT.RACHTMAN
          Everybody in the German army's heard
          of Hugo Stiglitz.
          The Basterds laugh, a couple pat Hugo on the back.
          The NARRATOR comes back on the SOUNDTRACK.

          NARRATOR(VO)
          The reason for Hugo Stiglitz's
          celebrity among German soldiers
          is simple.
          WE SEE A PHOTO OF HUGO on the front page of the Nazi version
          of Stars and Stripes (the military newspaper).

          NARRATOR(VO)
          As a German enlisted man, he killed
          thirteen Gestapo officers, mostly
          Majors.

          WE SEE THE MILITARY PHOTOS OF ALL THIRTEEN GESTAPO OFFICERS.

          

          

          

          

          ZC.

          NARRATOR(VO)
          Instead of putting him up against a
          wall, the High Command decided to
          send him back to Berlin, to be made
          a example of.
          Hugo in chains, being put in a lone troop truck, part of a
          prison convoy, enroute to Berlin.

          NARRATOR(VO)
          Needless to say, once The Basterds
          heard about him, he never got there.

          EXT- FRENCH COUNTRYSIDE - DAY
          The Basterds AMBUSH the prison convoy, killing everybody.
          They walk to the back of the troop truck, inside Hugo in
          chains, stares back at them.

          LT.ALDO
          Sgt.Hugo Stiglitz?
          Hugo nods.

          LT. ALDO
          I'm Lt.Aldo Raine, and these are
          The Basterds. Ever heard of us?
          Hugo nods his head, yes.

          LT.ALDO
          We just wanna say, we're a big fan
          of your work. When it comes to killin
          Nazi's, I think you show great talent,
          and I pride myself on havin a eye for
          that kind of talent. But your status
          as a Nazi killer, is still amateur.
          We all came here to see, if you wanna go pro?

          BACK TO THEBASTERD CIRCLE.

          LT.ALDO
          Now Werner, I'm gonna assume you know
          who we are?

          SGT.RACHTMAN
          Aldo the Apache.
          The circle of Basterds giggle.

          

          

          

          

          Z7.

          LT.ALDO
          Well Werner, if you heard of us, you
          probably heard, we ain't in the
          prisoner takin business. We in the
          killin Nazi business. And cousin,
          business is boomin.
          The Basterds laugh.

          LT. ALDO
          Now that leaves two ways we can play
          this out. Either kill ya, or let ya
          go. Now weather or not you gonna
          leave this circle alive, depends
          entirely on you.
          Aldo takes out a map of the area, and lays it out in front
          of his prisoner.

          LT.ALDO
          Up the road a piece, there's a
          orchard. 'sides you, we know there's
          another kraut patrol fuckin around
          here somewhere. Now if that patrol
          were to have any crackshots, that
          orchard, would be a goddamn snipers
          delight. Now if you ever wanna eat
          a sauerkraut sandwich again, you
          gotta show me on this map, where
          they are, you gotta tell me how many
          they are, and you gotta tell me,
          what kinda artillery they carrying
          with 'em?

          SGT.RACHTMAN
          You can't expect me to divulge
          information that would put German
          lives in danger?

          LT.ALDO
          well, Werner that's where your wrong.
          Because that's exactly what I expect.
          I need to know about Germans hidin
          in trees? And you need to tell me?
          And you need to tell me, right now?
          Now take your finger, and point out
          on this map, where this partys bein
          held, how manys comin, and what they
          brought to play with?
          Werner site, head held high, back straight, chin up, every
          inch the German hero facing death.

          

          

          

          

          2S.

          SGT.WERNER
          F I respectfully refuse, sir.
          Aldo jerks his thumb behind him.

          LT.ALDO
          You see that ole boy battin rocks?
          WE RACK FOCUS to a one of The Basterds not in the circle.
          He's wearing a wife beater, and power hitting stones
          with a baseball bat.
          Werners eyes go to the ballplayer.

          LT.ALDO
          That's Sgt.Donny Donowitz. But you
          might know him better by his nickname,
          The Bear Jew. Now if you heard of
          Aldo the Apache, you gotta heard about
          The Bear Jew?

          SGT.RACHTMAN
          I heard.

          LT.ALDO
          What did you hear?

          SGT.RACHTMAN
          He beats German soldiers with a club.

          LT.ALDO
          He bashes their brains in with a
          baseball bat, what he does.

          SGT.DONOWITZ
          back to us, still haven't seen his face. He Babe Ruths a
          rock soaring into the atmosphere.

          LT. ALDO
          Now Werner, I'm gonna ask you one
          last-goddamn-time, and if you still,
          "respectfully refuse", I'm callin The
          Bear Jew over here, and he's gonna take
          that big bat of his, and he's gonna
          beat your ass to death with it.
          Now take your wennersitnitzel lickin
          finger, and point out on this map
          what I want to know.

          SGT.RACHTMAN

          LT.ALDO
          Actually Werner, we're all tickled
          ya said that. Frankly, watchin Donny

          What can I do you for, Donny?

          DONNY
          I need a baseball bat.
          The store owner leads him to a basket with eight bats init.
          Donny starts going through them without saying anything.

          MR.GOOROWITZ
          You gettin your little brother a
          present before you ship out?
          Donny, concentrating on the bats, not looking up;

          DONNY
          No.
          Donny's "no", silences the gabby Goorowitz. He seems to
          settle on one, feeling it's weight in his hands.

          DONNY
          Can I try this one on for size, outside?

          

          

          

          

          31.
          Extending his arm;

          MR.GOOROWITZ
          Be my guest.
          The phone rings.

          MR.GOOROWITZ
          I'll get that, you go right ahead.
          The proprietor answers the phone, and gets into a
          conversation with his OFF SCREEN Mother.
          Donny walks outside, WE STAY IN STORE, but can see him
          clearly through the stores big picture window.
          However, Mr.Goorowitz instinctively, turns his back to Donny
          to speak with his mother.
          Donny starts swinging the bat. It's pretty obvious he's
          pantomiming beating somebody to death with it. Then the
          he starts yelling;

          DONNY
          Take that ya Nazi basterd! You like fuckin
          with the Jews? Wanna Fuck with the Jews?
          The American jews are gonna FUCK with
          you... ..!
          Mr.Goorowitz, see's none of this, as he speaks to his
          mother. He hangs up the phone, just as Donny walks back into
          the store. Store owner turns to store customer.

          DONNY
          Is this the heaviest ya got?

          CUT TO

          INT - HALLWAY APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY
          Donny, dressed nice, in a apartment building in his Jewish
          Bastin neighbourhood. He knocks on a door.
          A VERY OLD JEWISH WOMAN opens the door, only a little,
          peering out at the young man.

          OLD WOMAN
          How can I help you?

          DONNY
          Mrs.Himmelstein?

          MRS.HIMMELSTEIN
          State your business young man.

          

          

          

          

          3Z..

          DONNY
          Mrs.Himmelstein, I'm Donny Donowitz,
          my father Sy Donowitz, owns the barber
          shop on Greeny Ave, "Sy's Barber Shop".

          MRS.HIMMELSTEIN
          I've seen it. Do you live in the
          neighbourhood?

          DONNY
          All my life.

          MRS.HIMMELSTEIN
          Again, state your business?

          DONNY
          May I have a word with you?

          MRS.HIMMELSTEIN
          What about?

          DONNY
          Our people in Europe.
          She thinks for a beat, then holds the door open for the
          young man.

          MRS.HIMMELSTEIN
          Come in. Would you like some tea?

          INT - MRS.HIMMELSTEIN'S APARTMENT - DAY
          Donny sits on a overstuffed sofa, holding a tea cup and
          saucer in his hand. Mrs.Himmelstein sits on a overstuffed
          chair, holding her tea, looking across at her visitor.

          DONNY
          (Sipping tea)
          Very good.

          MRS.HIMMELSTEIN
          If you like tea.
          Donny chuckles at her little joke. The old woman remains
          stone. She wasn't joking. He places his saucer on the coffee
          table and begins;

          DONNY
          Mrs.Himmelstein, do you have any love
          ones over in Europe who your concerned
          for?

          

          

          

          

          33.

          MRS.HIMMELSTEIN
          What compels you young man, to ask a
          stranger such a personal question?

          DONNY
          Because I'm going to Europe. And I'm
          gonna make it right.

          MRS.HIMMELSTEIN
          And just how do intend to do that, Joshua?

          DONNY

          MRS.HIMMELSTEIN
          And what exactly do you intend to do
          with that toy?

          DONNY
          I'm gonna beat every Nazi I find to
          death with it.

          MRS.HIMMELSTEIN
          I thought we were having tea together?

          MRS.HIMMELSTEIN
          And in this pursuit, how is it that I
          can be of service?

          DONNY
          I'm going through the neighbourhood.
          If you have any love ones in Europe,
          who's safety you fear for, I'd like
          you to write their name on my bat.

          BACK TO BASTERDS
          Donny takes a long walk to Werner...
          As WE CUT BACK and FORTH BETWEEN DONNY WALKING and WERNER
          WAITING, WE ALSO CUT BACK and FORTE BETWEEN DONNY and

          MRS.HIMMELSTEIN...

          MRS.HIMMELSTEIN
          You must be a real BASTERD, Donny?

          

          

          

          

          DONNY
          You bet your sweet ass I am.

          MRS.HIMMELSTEIN
          Good. A Basterds work is never done.
          Specially in Germany.
          Donny steps up to the plate, looking down at the Nazi;

          DONNY
          Gimmie your papers.
          Werner hands Donny up his papers.
          Donny RIPS the identity page out, and sticks it in his
          pocket.

          MRS.HIMMELSTEIN
          Hand me your sword Gideon. I do believe
          I will join you on this journey.

          INSERT
          she signs the BAT, "MADELEINE"

          BACK TO BASTERDS
          Donny BEATS Werner TO DEATH WITH THE BAT, to the cheers of
          The Basterds.

          PVT.BUTZ
          watches. Hirschberg says to him;

          PFC.HIRSCHBERG
          About now, I'd be shittin my pants, if
          I was you.
          Aldo points a finger at Butzsr and crooks it toward him.

          PFC.HIRSCHBERG
          That means you, cup cake.
          A crying, visibly shaken, Butz site down in front of Aldo.

          LT.ALDO
          You wanna live?

          PVT.BUTZ
          Yes, sir.

          LT.ALDO
          Point out on this map, the German
          position.
          His arm shoots out like a rocket, and points out the
          positions.

          

          

          

          
          3 s.

          PVT.BUTZ
          This area here.

          LT.ALDO
          How many?

          PVT.BUTZ
          Maybe twelve.

          LT.ALDO
          What kinda of artillery?

          PVT.BUTZ
          They have a machine gunn dug in here
          pointing north.

          HITLER
          How did you survived this ordel?
          WE SEE Pvt.Butz in The Fuhrer's room for the first time.
          He wears a Nazi cap, which is unusual in the presence of The
          Fuhrer, but he seems okay with it.

          PRVT.BUTZ
          They let me go.

          FROM HERE ON WE GO BACK AND FORTH BETWEEN ALDO AND HITLER.

          LT.ALDO
          Now when you report what happened here,
          you can't tell 'em, you told us, what you
          told us. They'll shoot ya. But there gonna
          wanna know, why you so special, we let you
          live? So tell 'em, we let ya live, so you
          could spread the word through the ranks,
          what's gonna happen to every Nazi we find.

          HITLER
          You are not to tell anybody anything!
          Not one word of detail! Your outfit
          was ambushed, and you got a away.
          Not one word more.

          PVT.BUTZ
          Yes mine Fuhrer.

          HITLER
          Did they mark you like they did the
          other survivors?

          

          

          

          

          36Ã¢Â¬Â¢

          PVT.BUTZ
          Yes mine Fuhrer.

          HITLER
          Remove your hat and show me.

          LT.ALDO
          Now say we let ya go, and say you
          survive the'war? When you get back
          home, what'eha gonna do?

          PVT.BUTZ
          I will hug my mother like I've never
          hugged her before.

          LT.ALDO
          Well, ain't that's a real nice boy. Are you
          going to take off your uniform?

          PVT.BUTZ
          Not only shall I remove it, but I intend
          to burn it!
          The young German is telling Aldo, what he thinks, Aldo wants
          to hear. But the last answer didn't go down as well as he
          thought it would, evident by the frown on Aldo's face.

          LT. ALDO
          Yeah, that's what we thought. We don't
          like that. You see, we like our Nazi's
          in uniforms. That way, you can spot 'em,
          just like that.
          (Snaps his fingers)
          But you take off that uniform, ain't
          nobody gonna know you was a Nazi.
          And that don't sit well with us.
          Aldo removes a LARGE KNIFE from a sheath on his belt.

          LT.ALDO
          So I'm gonna give ya a little somethin,
          you can't take off.

          BACK TO HITLER
          Pvt.Butz removes his combat helmet, hair hangs in his face,
          his moves it aside, and WE SEE a SWASTIKA has been HAND

          CARVED INTO HIS FOREHEAD.

          BACK TO BASTERDS

          BUTZ'S POV:
          on ground, looking up at them. Aldo has just carved the
          swastika, and he's holding the bloody knife. All The
          Basterds crowd around to admire his handy work.

          

          

          

          

          37.

          SGT.DONOWITZ
          You know Lieutenant, your getting pretty
          good at that.

          LT. ALDO
          You know how you get to Carnegie Hall,
          don't 'ch? Practice.

          CHAPTER TITLE APPEARS:

          CHAPTER THREE

          "GERMAN NIGHT IN PARIS"
          NOTE: This whole Chapter will be filmed in French New Wave
          Black and White.

          INT - CINEMA AUDITORIUM - NIGHT
          We're in the auditorium of a cinema in Paris. However the
          CAMERA is pointed in the direction of the audience, not the
          screen. We start CLOSE on the projector beam, emanating from
          the little glass window in the back of the theatre
          The CAMERA continues to DOLLY back, making the Shot Wider and
          Wider, bringing in more and more the German occupied citizens
          of Paris, who stare at the OFF SCREEN silver screen in the dark
          We can hear the OFF SCREEN SOUNDTRACK of a Goebbels produced
          German omm paw paw musical movie being projected.
          The Shot continues to pull further and further back, and the
          German dialogue continues to fill the auditorium...

          TILL...
          .The DOLLY SHOT LANDS on a CLOSE UP of Shosanna,. watching the
          movie.

          A SUBTITLE APPEARS:

          "1941

          PARIS

          TWO WEEKS AFTER THE MASSACRE

          OF SHOSANNA'S FAMILY"
          We hear the sound of the German musicals climax.
          The lights go up in the auditorium.
          Shosanna, dressed in a NURSES UNIFORM she swiped from
          somewhere, remains seated, as the rest of the PATRONS, gather
          their coats, and file out.

          

          

          

          

          3P.

          EXT - LITTLE CINEMA (PARIS)- NIGHT
          Patrons exit under the cinema marquee, as someone from inside
          SHUTS OFF the marquees lights.
          The MARQUEE READS in French:
          "GERMAN NIGHT BRIDGET VON HAMMERSMARK in MADCAP IN MEXICO".

          EXT - PROJECTION BOOTH (LITTLE CINEMA)
          A French Black Man, who we will learn later is named MARCEL,
          is the cinema's projectionist. We see him for a moment, taking
          the film reels off the projector, and placing them on rewinds.

          INT - AUDITORIUM

          CU SHOSANNA
          still sitting in her seat. Except for her, the auditorium is
          empty.
          The owner of the Cinema, a attractive looking French woman,
          who we will later know as MADAME MIMIEUX, appears in
          one of the cinema's opera box balconies.
          Looking down from her perch at the young girl, sitting in
          the empty cinema.
          The DIALOGUE will be spoken in FRENCH, and SUBTITLED into

          ENGLISH.

          MADAME MIMIEUX
          So young woman, since it's beyond obvious
          we're closed for the evening. I must assume
          you want something. What can I do for you?

          SHOSANNA
          May I sleep here tonight?

          MADAME MIMIEUX
          So I gather your not a nurse?

          SHOSANNA
          No.

          MADAME MIMIEUX
          But your a bright little thing, that's
          clever disguise. Where is your family?

          SHOSANNA
          Murdered.

          

          

          

          

          3 1.

          MADAME MIMIEUX
          So your a war orphan?

          SHOSANNA
          We were from Nancy. The Bosch found us

          MADAME MIMIEUX
          Is this a sad story?

          SHOSANNA
          Oui.

          MADAME MIMIEUX
          Sad stories bore me. These days everyone
          in Paris has one. I haven't bore you
          with mine, don't bore me with yours.

          SHOSANNA
          You can run the machines?

          MADAME MIMIEUX
          What machines?
          Using her hands to pantomime the rotating film reels on a
          projector, she says;

          SHOSANNA
          The machines that show the film?

          MADAME MIMIEUX
          The projectors? Yes, I own a cinema,
          of course I can operate them.

          SHOSANNA
          I know, I saw you.

          FLASH ON:

          CU SHOSANNA
          eyes creeping up the stairway in the projection booth,
          watching...

          MADAME MIMIEUX
          expertly working the projectors...

          BACK TO SHOSANNA

          SHOSANNA
          Teach me. Teach me to run the machines,
          that show the film. It's only you and
          the negro. I know you could use some help.

          

          

          

          

          40.

          MADAME MIMIEUX
          I know at least six people who've been
          put up against a wall, and machine
          gunned for sheltering enemies of the
          state. I have no intention of being
          unlucky number seven. How long have
          you been in Paris?

          SHOSANNA
          A week, and a few days.

          MADAME MIMIEUX
          How have you survived the curfew
          without capture?

          SHOSANNA
          I sleep on rooftops.

          MADAME MIMIEUX
          Again, I'm forced to admit, clever
          girl. How is it?

          SHOSANNA
          Cold.

          MADAME MIMIEUX

          (LAUGHS)
          I can imagine.

          SHOSANNA
          Respectfully, no you can't.

          MADAME MIMIEUX
          Fair enough.

          MADAME MIMIEUX
          So you can't operate a 35mm film projector,
          you want me teach you, in order to work
          here, in order to use my cinema, as a hole
          to hide in, is that correct?

          SHOSANNA
          Oui.

          MADAME MIMIEUX
          Whats your name?

          SHOSANNA
          Shosanna.

          

          

          

          

          MADAME MIMIEUX
          I'm Madame Mimieux. You may call
          me Madame. This is a cinema. Not a
          home for wayward war orphans.
          Having said that, what you say is true.
          If you were truly exceptional, I could
          find use for you. So Shosanna, are you
          truly exceptional?

          SHOSANNA
          Oui Madame.

          MADAME MIMIEUX
          I will be the judge of that.

          DISSOLVE TO

          TITLE CARD:
          Which shows a lovely PENCIL SKETCH of the CITY OF PARIS,
          complete with Eiffel Tower.

          ABOVE IT READS:

          "1944

          PARIS"

          THEN...
          The CAMERA PULLS BACK, and we see we're not looking at a TITLE
          CARD at all, but a CALENDER stuck on the wall of the Little
          Cinema's Projection Booth. Before we leave it, WE SEE the
          Month is JUNE.
          ..The CAMERA finds, the THREE YEARS OLDER SHOSANNA, working
          as the PROJECTIONIST. It would appear, that Shosanna passed
          Madame Mimieux's exceptional test.
          A lyrical Morriconie-like tune PLAYS on the SOUNDTRACK, this
          will be "Shosanna's Theme".
          A Little Bell, begins RINGING, on one of the projectors,
          alerting Shosanna it's time for a REEL CHANGE.
          Shosanna stands at the projector, watching the old German film
          she's projecting, waiting for the1st REEL CHANGE MARK...

          of the little cinema. On Screen LENI REFENSHTAL lies
          horizontal as a ice sickle drips on her head in the old
          German film, "The White Hell Of Piza Palu",
          The 1st REEL CHANGE MARK POPS ON in the upper right
          hand corner of the FRAME...(That tells the projectionist
          to get ready).

          

          

          

          
          As the FILM REEL on the lst PROJECTOR rolls out, Shosanna
          stands ready, waiting by the 2nd PROJECTOR...

          WHEN...

          the 2nd REEL CHANGE MARK POPS ON in the same place(That's the
          one).

          SHOSANNA
          THROWS the lever on the 2nd PROJECTOR, switching the film from
          projector 1# to projector 2#, executing a perfect REEL CHANGE.
          As Shosanna's Theme plays on the Soundtrack, we watch viva
          MONTAGE, her go through her daily chores. Carry heavy film cans
          up the stairs, empty the rat traps, ect,ect...

          EXT - CINEMA - NIGHT
          The MARQUEE READS in French:
          "GERMAN NIGHT LENI REFENSHTAL in PABST WHITE HELL OF PIZA PALU"
          Shosanna emerges from the cinema carrying two buckets of
          LETTERS (for the marquee), and a tall ladder. Her chore here,
          obviously, is to change the show on the marquee.
          The LITERARY NARRATOR comes on the Soundtrack in ENGLISH;

          NARRATOR(VO)
          To operate a cinema in Paris during
          the occupation, one had two choices.
          Ether you could show new German propaganda
          films, produced under the watchful
          eye of Joseph Goebbels. Or... .you
          could have a German night in your
          weekly schedule, and show allowed
          German classic films.
          Their German night was Thursday.
          Shosanna, by herself, perched up high on the ladder, changing
          the letters on the marquee.
          A YOUNG GERMAN SOLDIER(about the same age as Shosanna), walks
          out of the cinema. He sees the ladder with the young French
          girl on top, and walks over.
          They speak FRENCH, SUBTITLED into ENGLISH;

          GERMAN SOLDIER
          What starts tomorrow?
          Shosanna looks down, seeing the young German Solder smiling up
          at her from below.

          

          

          

          

          LC 3.

          SHOSANNA
          A Max Linder festival.

          GERMAN SOLDIER
          Ummmm, I always preferred Linder to
          Chaplin. Except Linder never made a
          film as good as "The Rid". The chase
          climax of "The Kid", superb.
          Shosanna continues working, not adding to the conversation.

          GERMAN SOLDIER
          I suppose now you could use a "M"
          a "A" and a "X"?

          SHOSANNA
          No need, I can manage.

          GERMAN SOLDIER
          Don't be ridiculous, it's my pleasure.
          He hands the French damsel the letters spelling MAX.

          SHOSANNA
          Merci.

          GERMAN SOLDIER
          I adore your cinema very much.

          SHOSANNA
          Merci.
          She busies herself with the marquee letters...

          GERMAN SOLDIER

          SHOSANNA

          GERMAN SOLDIER

          SHOSANNA

          GERMAN SOLDIER
          How does a young girl, such as yourself,
          own a cinema?
          Do to his uniform, and Shosanna's situation, all his efforts
          at trying to make small talk, strikes the young Jewess in
          hiding as a Gestapo interrogation.

          

          

          

          

          SHOSANNA
          My aunt left it to me.

          GERMAN SOLDIER
          Lucky girl.
          Shosanna makes no reply back.

          GERMAN SOLDIER
          Merci for hoisting a German night.

          SHOSANNA
          I don't have a choice, but your welcome.

          GERMAN SOLDIER
          Do you chose the German films yourself?

          SHOSANNA
          Oui.

          GERMAN SOLDIER
          Then my merci stands. I love the
          Refensthal mountain films, especially,
          "Pizu Palu". It's nice to see a French
          girl who's a admirer of Refensthal.

          SHOSANNA
          "Admire", would not be the adjective
          I would use to describe my feelings
          towards Fraulein Refensthal.

          GERMAN SOLDIER
          But you do admire the director. Pabst,
          don't you? That's why you included
          his name on the marquee.
          She climbs down from the ladder and faces the German
          Private.

          SHOSANNA
          I'm French. We respect directors
          in our country.

          GERMAN SOLDIER
          Apparently even Germans.

          SHOSANNA
          Even Germans. Merci for assistance,
          Private. Adieu.
          She turns to go back inside.

          GERMAN SOLDIER
          Your not finished?

          

          

          

          

          SHOSANNA
          I'll finish in the morning.
          She opens the door to go inside.

          GERMAN SOLDIER
          May I ask your name?

          SHOSANNA
          You wish to see my papers?
          She hands him her excellently forged papers.
          That's obviously not what he meant, but he takes them anyway
          to read her name.

          GERMAN SOLDIER
          Emmanuelle Mimieux. That's a very
          pretty name.

          SHOSANNA
          Merci. Are you finished with my papers?
          He hands them back.

          GERMAN SOLDIER
          Mademoiselle. My name is Fredrick Zoller.
          She gives no response.

          GERMAN SOLDIER
          It's been a pleasure chatting with a
          fellow cinema lover. Sweet dreams,
          Mademoiselle.
          He gives her a little salute, and walks into the black of a
          curfew imposed night.
          She looks after him. She didn't show it, but he kinda got to
          her. After all, for any true cinema lover, it's hard to hate
          anybody who, CINEMA MON AMOUR.

          EXT - ROOFTOP CINEMA - NIGHT
          Shosanna stands on the roof of her cinema, late at night,
          lighting up a cigarette. As she takes her first big drag,
          she remembers a voice.

          FLASH ON
          MADAME MIMIEUX, the younger Shosanna, and the black
          projectionist Marcel, in the projection booth. Shosanna
          lights up a cigarette, and Madame Mimieux SLAPS her face
          HARD, knocking the cigarette out of her mouth. Marcel
          quickly STAMPS it out on the floor.

          

          

          

          
          If-7.

          MADAME MIMIEUX
          if I ever see you light up a cigarette
          in my cinema again, I'll turn you into
          the Nazi's, do you understand?
          Shosanna is shocked by this statement.

          SHOSANNA
          Oui, Madame.

          MADAME MIMIEUX
          And for bringing a open flame in my
          cinema, you deserve far worse then
          a Nazi jewish boxcar. With your thick
          head, what do you think the highest
          priority of a cinema manager is?
          Keeping this fucking place from burning
          down to the ground, that's what!
          In my collection, I have over 350,
          35mm, nitrate film prints, which are
          not only immensely flammable, but
          highly unstable. And should they
          catch fire, they burn three times
          faster then paper. If that happens..
          .POOF...all gone, cinema no more,
          every body burned alive. If I ever
          see you with a open flame in my cinema
          again, I won't turn you into the Nazi's
          I'll kill you myself. And the fucking
          Germans will give me a curfew pass.
          Do you understand me?

          SHOSANNA
          Out, Madame.

          MADAME MIMIEUX
          Do you believe me?

          SHOSANNA
          Out, Madame.

          MADAME MIMIEUX
          You damn well better.

          BACK TO ROOF
          Shosanna exhales cigarette smoke.
          Marcel comes onto the roof.

          MARCEL
          Are you well?

          

          

          

          

          SHOSANNA
          Even on the roof I can't smoke a
          cigarette without hearing Madames
          voice yelling at me. That's why I
          do it. To hear Madames voice again.

          MARCEL
          We both miss her.

          SHOSANNA
          I know. I'm fine, darling. I'll be
          to bed soon.
          Marcel goes back inside, Shosanna smokes.

          INT - FRENCH BISTRO - AFTERNOON
          Shosanna sits in the back of a French bistro, reading a
          book, "The Saint in New York" by Leslie Charteris, drinking
          wine. When the young German Private from the other day,
          FREDRICK ZOLLER, walks in. He gets a beer, then notices the
          French girl sitting in the back. He smiles, and heads over
          to her. "Oh no, not this guy again", she thinks.
          Again they speak in FRENCH SUBTITLED into ENGLISH;

          FREDRICK
          May I join you?

          SHOSANNA
          Look Fredrick -

          FREDRICK

          (SMILING)
          - You remember my name?

          SHOSANNA
          Yes....Look, you seem a pleasant
          enough fellow -

          FREDRICK
          - Merci.

          SHOSANNA
          Your welcome. - regardless, I want
          you to stop pestering me.

          FREDRICK
          I apologize mademoiselle, I wasn't
          trying to be a pest. I was simply
          trying to be friendly.

          SHOSANNA
          I don't wish to be your friend.

          

          

          

          

          FREDRICK
          Why not?

          SHOSANNA
          Don't act like a infant. You know why.

          FREDRICK
          I'm more then just a uniform.

          SHOSANNA
          Not to me. If you are so desperate for
          a French girlfriend, I suggest you try
          Vichy?
          Just then TWO OTHER GERMAN SOLDIERS come over, obviously
          very impressed with Fredrick. They make a fuss over him in
          UNSUBTITLED GERMAN, which nether Shosanna, or the non German
          speaking members of the movies audience, can understand.
          He signs autographs for them, shakes their hands, and they
          go on their way.
          Shosanna's eyes narrow.

          SHOSANNA
          Who are you?

          FREDRICK
          I thought I was just a uniform?

          SHOSANNA
          Your not just a German soldier, are
          you somebodies son?

          FREDRICK
          Most German soldiers are somebodies son.

          SHOSANNA
          Yeah, but your not just somebody. What
          are you, Hitlers nephew?
          He leans in across the table, she leans in too, and he says;

          FREDRICK
          Yes.

          SHOSANNA
          Really?

          FREDRICK
          No not really, I'm just teasing you.
          She leans back annoyed.

          SHOSANNA
          Then what is it? What are you, a German
          movie star?

          

          

          

          

          6'O

          FREDRICK
          Not exactly.

          SHOSANNA
          (Pfuit), what does that mean, "not exactly".
          I asked if you were a movie star, the
          answer to that question, is yes or no.
          Fredrick laughs at that line.

          FREDRICR
          When you said that just now, you
          reminded me of my sister.
          This catches young Shosanna off guard.

          FREDRICR
          I come from a home of six sisters.
          We run a family operated cinema in Munich.
          Seeing you run around your cinema,
          reminds me of them. Especially my sister
          Helga. She raised me, when our father
          wasn't up to the job. I admire her very
          much. You'd like her, she doesn't wear a
          German uniform.

          SHOSANNA
          You were raised by Helga?

          FREDRICK
          All my sisters, I'm the baby, but Helga
          was the bossiest.

          SHOSANNA
          And your mother and father?

          FREDRICK
          My mother died. And my father was a
          loser. My fathers moto; "If at first
          you don't succeed, quit". The day he
          left, good riddance. My sisters are
          all I need. It's why I like your cinema.
          It makes me feel both closer to them,
          and a little homesick at the same time.

          SHOSANNA
          is your cinema still operatiing?

          FREDRICR
          Oui.

          SHOSANNA
          What's it called?

          

          

          

          

          5!

          FREDRICK
          The Kino Haus.

          SHOSANNA
          How has it done durring the war?

          FREDRICK
          Actually, in Germany, cinema
          attendance is up.

          SHOSANNA
          No doubt, you don't have to operate
          under a curfew.

          FREDRICK
          How often do you fill your house?

          SHOSANNA
          (Pfuit), not since before the war.

          FREDRICK
          So if you had one big engagement, that
          would help you out?

          SHOSANNA
          Of course, but that's not likely to
          happen.
          TWO MORE GERMAN SOLDIERS and their TWO FRENCH DATES approach
          the table. They ask for Fredricks autograph, he signs it for
          them. One of the French Girls says in FRENCH, how exciting
          it is to meet a real live German war hero. Shosanna hears
          it. They leave. So that's it, she thinks.

          SHOSANNA
          So your a war hero? Why didn't you tell me?

          FREDRICK
          Everybody knows that, I liked you didn't.

          SHOSANNA
          What did you do?
          He takes a sip of beer.

          FREDRICK
          I've shot the most enemy soldiers
          in world war two...so far.
          You bet your sweet ass that got her attention.

          SHOSANNA
          Wow.

          

          

          

          

          52

          FREDRICK
          I was alone in a bell tower in a
          walled off city in Russia. It was
          myself, and a thousand rounds of ammo,
          in a bird's nest, against three
          hundred Soviet soldiers.

          SHOSANNA
          What's a bird's nest?

          FREDRICK
          A bird's nest is what a sniper would call
          a bell tower. It's a high structure,
          offering a three hundred and sixty degree
          view. Very advantageous for marksmen.

          SHOSANNA
          How many Russian's did you kill?

          FREDRICK
          Sixty-eight.

          (BEAT)
          The first day. A hundred and fifty the
          second day. Thirty-two, the third day.
          On the forth day, they exited the city.
          Naturally my war story received alot of
          attention in Germany, that's why they
          all recognize me. They call me the
          German Sgt.York.

          SHOSANNA
          Maybe they'll make a film about
          your exploits.

          FREDRICK
          Well, that's just what Joseph Goebbels
          thought. So he did. It's called "Nation's
          Pride", and guess what, they wanted me to
          play myself, so I did. They have posters
          for it in kiosks all over Paris. That's
          another reason for all the attention.

          SHOSANNA
          "Nation's Pride" is about you? "Nation's
          Pride" is starring you?

          FREDRICK
          I know, comical, huh?

          SHOSANNA
          Not so comical. So what are you doing
          in Paris, enjoying a rest?

          

          

          

          

          53.

          FREDRICK
          Hardly. I've been doing publicity,
          having my picture taken with different
          German luminaries, visiting troops,
          that sort of thing. Goebbels wants the
          film to premier in Paris, so I've been
          helping them in the planning.
          Joseph is very keen on this film.
          He's telling anybody who will listen,
          when "Nation's Pride" is released,
          I'll be the German Van Johnson.
          Shosanna, wasn't falling for the young German, by any stretch.
          However his exploits, as well as his charming manner, can't
          help but impress. But his referring to Goebbels as "Joseph",
          like their friends, is all she needed to get on the right side
          of things. This young man is trouble with a capital "T", and
          she needs to stay far fucking away from him.
          She abruptly rises, and says;

          SHOSANNA
          Well, good luck with your premier
          Private. I hope all goes well for
          Joseph and yourself. Au revoir.
          And with that, she disappears. Leaving the perplexed private
          alone.

          EXT - CINEMA MARQUEE - DAY
          It's the next day.
          Shosanna and Marcel are changing the letters on the marquee.
          Marcel excuses himself to visit the toilet.
          $hosanna is alone outside the little cinema, perched up on her
          ladder.

          WHEN...
          .A BLACK NAZI SEDAN pulls up in front of the little cinema.
          A GERMAN MAJOR in a black Gestapo uniform steps out of the back
          of the sedan.
          The DRIVER, a German Private, steps out as well.
          Yelling to the young girl up high on the ladder;
          Both GERMAN and FRENCH will be SUBTITLED into ENGLISH.

          

          

          

          
          5 q.

          GESTAPO MAJOR
          Mademoiselle Nimieux?

          SHOSANNA
          Oui?
          Telling his Driver in German to ask her in French;

          GESTAPO MAJOR
          Ask her if this is her cinema?
          in French The Driver asks Shosanna;

          DRIVER
          is this your cinema?

          SHOSANNA

          GESTAPO MAJOR
          Tell her to come down.

          DRIVER
          Come down please.
          She climbs down the ladder.
          The Driver opens the back door of the sedan, indicating for her
          to get in.

          SHOSANNA
          I don't understand, what have I done?

          DRIVER
          (to Major)
          She wants to know what she's done?

          GESTAPO MAJOR
          Who says she's done anything?

          DRIVER
          Who says you've done anything?
          Then in her best imitation of Madame Mimeux's arrogantmanner.

          SHOSANNA
          Then I demand to know what this is about,
          and where do you propose to take me?
          The Driver begins to translate, when the Gestapo Major holds up his
          hand, telling him not to bother. The Major looks at the young
          French girl and tells her in German;

          

          

          

          

          55.

          GESTAPO MAJOR
          Get your ass in that car.
          No translation necessary. She climbs into the back of the car,
          followed by the Germans. The sedan takes off.

          INT - SEDAN(MOVING) - DAY
          The Nazi sedan drives through the early afternoon Paris
          streets.

          WE HOLD SHOSANNA IN TIGHT CU
          the whole ride, never showing her Nazi oppressor sitting beside
          her. We just hold on her face trying not to revel anything.
          The sedan stops.
          The car door opens and the Driver offers Shosanna his hand.

          EXT/INT- MAXIUM'S (FAMOUS PARIS CAFE) - DAY
          She steps out of the car, and is lead into a Paris cafe by the
          Gestapo Officer. It takes the young Jewess a moment or two before
          she realizes she's not being led to a Gestapo interrogation
          room, a railroad car, or a concentration camp, but to lunch.
          The best table at Maxims. Three people, and two dogs, sit at it.
          Germany's Minister of Propaganda, and the number two man in
          Hitlers Third Reich, JOSEPH GOEBBELS, his female French translator
          (and mistress), FRANCESCA MONDINO, and young Private Zoller,
          are the people. TWO BLACK FRENCH POODLES, belonging to
          Mademoiselle Mondino, sit together in another chair at the
          table.
          We join them in mid-conversation;
          They all speak GERMAN, SUBTITLED into ENGLISH;

          GOEBBELS
          - it's only the off spring of slaves that
          allows America to be competitive athletically.
          America olympic gold can measured in Negro
          sweat.
          Shosanna is lead through the French eatery by the Gestapo Major.
          Private Zoller see's her, and stands up, excuse's himself,
          and greets her before she reaches the table.
          Fredrick says in French, SUBTITLED in ENGLISH;

          FREDRICK
          Good you came. I wasn't sure weather or
          not you'd except my invitation.

          

          

          

          

          SHOSANNA
          Invitation?

          THEN...
          .Goebbles Voice says OFF SCREEN;

          GOEBBLES(OS)
          Is that the young lady in question,
          Fredrick?
          Private Zoller turns in his direction, takes Shosanna by the
          arm, and leads her to him.

          FREDRICK
          Yes it is, beer Goebbels. Emmanuelle,
          there is somebody I want you to meet.
          Joseph Goebbels, remaining seated, looks up at the young French
          girl, scrutinizing her as he spoons creme brule into his mouth.
          The excited Fredrick introduces Shosanna to the propaganda
          minister formally.

          FREDRICK
          Emmanuelle Mimieux, I'd like to
          introduce you to the minister of
          propaganda, the leader of the entire
          German film industry, and now I'm a
          actor, my boss, Joseph Goebbels.
          Goebbels offers up his long spider-like fingers for Shosanna to
          shake. She does.

          GOEBBELS
          Your reputation precedes you Fraulein
          Mimieux.
          He looks to Francesca to translate, but she's just taken a big
          bite of terri misu.
          They all laugh.
          Fredrick jumps in...

          FREDRICK
          And normally, this is beer Goebbels French
          interpreter, Mademoiselle Francesca
          Mondino.

          FRANCESCA
          looks up at Shosanna.

          

          

          

          

          5'?
          NARRATOR'S VOICE comes on soundtrack;

          NARRATOR (VO)
          Francesca Mondino is much more then
          Goebbels French Interpreter.
          She's also Goebbels favorite French
          actress to appear in his films...

          FLASH ON:

          FILM CLIP
          from one of Francesca's B/W Goebbels produced productions.
          Francesca, dressed as a French peasant girl, with a YOUNG

          GERMAN (MOVIE) SOLDIER.
          She speaks in FRENCH, SUBTITLED in to ENGLISH;

          FRANCESCA/PEASANT GIRL
          I love you, I can't help it. My country
          or my heart, which do I betray?
          A SUBTITLE APPEARS below naming the films title;

          DOGGY STYLE.

          FRANCESCA

          (ANIMAL-LIKE)
          Do it! Do it! Fuck me - fill me!

          BACK TO FRANCESCA
          looking at Shosanna.

          FRANCESCA
          Bon jour.

          SHOSANNA
          Bon jour.

          

          

          

          

          I
          f.

          FREDRICK
          And you've met the Major.
          The Gestapo officer steps up and says, to Fredrick in German;

          GESTAPO MAJOR
          Actually, I didn't introduce myself.
          (to Shosanna)
          Major Deiter Helistrom of the Gestapo, at
          your service mademoiselle.
          (he clicks
          his heels)
          Please allow me, have a seat.
          The Gestapo Officer pulls out a chair, for the young lady to sit
          down. Shosanna takes the hot seat. Seated to her right is
          Private Zoller. To her left are the two curly pampered
          poodles. Major Helistrom pours Shosanna a glass of red wine
          from a small craft on the table.

          MAJOR HELLSTROM
          Try the wine mademoiselle, it's quite good.
          Goebbels looks across the table at her.

          GOEBBELS
          well I must say, you've made quite a
          impression on our boy.
          Francesca interprets Goebbels German for Shosanna.

          GOEBBELS
          I must say fraulein, I should be rather
          annoyed with you.
          Francesca interprets..

          GOEBBELS
          I arrive in France, and I wish to have
          lunch with my star...
          Francesca interprets...

          GOEBBELS
          Little do I know Be's become
          the toast of paris, and now he
          must find time for me.
          Francesca interprets...

          

          

          

          
          c9 Ã¢â¬Â¢

          GOEBBELS
          People wait in line hours, day's,
          to see me. For the Fuhrer and
          Private Zoller, I wait.
          Francesca interprets...

          GOEBBELS
          So finally, I'm granted a audience
          with the young Private, and he spends
          the entire lunch speaking of you
          and your cinema.
          Francesca interprets...

          GOEBBELS
          So Fraulein Mimieux, let's get down
          to business.
          Private Zoller interrupts -

          FREDRICK
          - Heer Goebbels, I haven't informed
          her yet.

          GOEBBELS
          Unless the girls a simpleton, I'm
          sure she's figured it out by now,
          after all she does operate a cinema.
          Francesca, tell her.
          Francesca tells Shosanna in French;

          FRANCESCA
          What they're trying to tell you
          Emmanuelle, is Private Zoller has
          spent the last hour at lunch,
          trying to convince Monsieur Goebbels
          to abandon previous plans for Private
          Zollers film premier, and change the
          venue to your cinema.
          Zoller reacts.

          FRANCESCA

          (FRENCH
          to Zoller)
          What?

          FREDRICK
          I wanted to inform her.

          FRANCESCA
          Shit. I apologize Private, of
          course you did.

          

          

          

          

          60.

          GOEBBELS

          (GERMAN
          to Francesca)
          What's the issue?

          FRANCESCA
          The Private wanted to inform the
          mademoiselle himself.

          GOEBBELS
          Nonsense. Until I ask a few
          questions, he has nothing to inform.
          Let the record state, I have not
          agreed to a venue change.

          MAJOR HELLSTROM
          Duly noted.
          Goebbels speaks German to Shosanna;

          GOEBBELS
          You have opera boxes?

          SHOSANNA

          GOEBBELS

          SHOSANNA

          GOEBBELS
          More would be better. How many
          seats in your auditorium?

          SHOSANNA
          Three hundred and fifty.

          GOEBBELS
          That's almost four hundred less
          then The Ritz.
          Fredrick jumps in...

          FREDRICK
          But beer Goebbels, that's not such
          a terrible thing. You said yourself
          you didn't want to indulge every
          two faced french bourgeois taking
          up space currying favor. With less
          seat's it makes the event more
          exclusive. Your not trying to fill
          the house, their fightin g for seats.

          

          

          

          

          61.

          FREDRICK

          (CON'T)
          Besides, to hell with the French.
          This is a German night, a German
          event, a German celebration. This
          night is for you, me, the German
          military, the high command, their
          family and friends. The only people
          who should be allowed in the room,
          are people who will be moved by
          the exploits on screen.
          Goebbels listens silently, then after a bit of a pause;

          GOEBBELS
          I see your public speaking has
          improved. It appears I've created
          a monster. A strangely persuasive
          monster. When the war's over,
          politics awaits.
          Table chuckles.

          GOEBBELS
          Well Private, though it is true,
          I'm inclined to indulge you anything.
          I must watch a film in this young
          ladies cinema before I can say,
          yes or no.
          (to Shosanna)
          So young lady, you are to close
          your cinema tonight, and have
          a private screening me.
          Francesca interprets...

          GOEBBELS
          What German films do you have?
          Francesca asks..

          SHOSANNA
          My cinema , on German night, tends
          to show older German classics.
          Francesca interprets...

          GOEBBELS
          Why not my films?
          Francesca asks...

          

          

          

          

          6Z.

          SHOSANNA
          I draw a older German audience in
          my cinema, that appreciate the
          nostalgia of the earlier time.
          Francesca interprets...

          GOEBBELS
          That's nonsense fraulein. Us Germans
          are looking forward, not backwards.
          That era of German cinema is dead.
          The German cinema I create, will not
          only be thee cinema of Europe. But
          the worlds only alternative to the
          degenerate Jewish influence of
          Hollywood.
          Fredrick Jumps in...

          FREDRICK
          Along with being a cinema owner,
          Emmanuelle is quite a formidable
          film critic.
          He chuckles, but alone.

          GOEBBELS
          WSo it would appear. Unfortunately
          for the fraulein, I've outlawed
          film criticism.
          Zoller, thinking fast, says;

          FREDRICK
          Why don't you screen "Lucky Kids"?
          I'm sure Emmanuelle hasn't seen. it.
          And it's so funny, I've been meaning
          to recommend it to her, for her
          German night. That's a great idea,
          let's watch "Lucky Kids" tonight.

          GOEBBELS
          Ahhh, "Lucky Kids", "Lucky Kids",
          "Lucky Kids". When all is said and
          done, my most purely enjoyable
          production. Not only that, I
          wouldn't be surprised, if sixty
          years from now, It's "Lucky Kids"
          that I'm the most remembered for.
          I know it doesn't seem like it now,
          but mark my words.
          Very well, I'll have a print sent
          over to the fraulein'.s cinema.
          We'll screen "Lucky Kids" tonight.

          

          

          

          

          63
          As Francesca interprets this for Shosanna...
          ...the empty chair next to the young Jewish girl is suddenly
          filled with the bottom half of a grey S.S. officer uniform.

          GOEBBELS
          Ah Landa, your here, this is the
          young lady in question.
          The S.S. Officer sits down, and it's our old friend from the
          first scene COL HANS LANDA.

          FREDRICK
          Shosanna, this4pol Hans Landa of
          the SS., he'll be running security
          for the premier.

          CU SHOSANNA
          A bomb is dropped and detonated behind her eyes. But if she
          gives any indication of this, her war story ends here.
          The S.S. OFFICER
          that murdered her family, takes her hand and kisses it,
          saying in perfect French;

          COL LANDA
          Charmed Mademoiselle.

          MAJOR HELLSTROM
          Better known as "The Jew Hunter".
          The table laughs.

          GOEBBELS
          Oh Francesca, what was that funny
          thing the Fuhrer said about Hans?

          FRANCESCA
          What thing?

          GOEBBELS
          You know, you were there, it was a
          funny thing the Fuhrer said,
          about Hans...Something about a pig?
          Francesca's memory is jogged.

          FRANCESCA
          Oh, yes of course.
          She repeats it by whispering it in Goebbels ear.

          

          

          

          

          6 "F

          GOEBBELS
          Oh, yes of course, that's it. So
          the Fuhrer said, he wouldn't be
          surprised if Hans weren't rooting
          out Jews like a truffle pig from
          the play pen.

          FRANCESCA
          That's what we need, pigs that can
          root out Jews.

          COL LANDA
          Who needs pigs when you have me?
          Big hearty laugh around the table.

          GOEBBELS
          Do you have a engagement tonight?

          COL LANDA
          Well, as a matter of fact, I do -

          GOEBBELS
          - Break it. We're all going to the
          Fraulein's cinema tonight to view
          "Lucky Kids".

          COL LANDA
          Splendid.
          Then Reich Ministers companion mademoiselle Mondino,

          INTERRUPTS;

          FRANCESCA
          And now I must get Reich Minister Goebbels
          to his next appointment.

          GOEBBELS
          Slave driver! French slave driver!
          They all chuckle.
          Everybody begins to stand up from the table...
          ..Francesca gathers the stupid dogs...
          .as Col Landa stands, he says;

          COL LANDA
          Actually, in my role as security
          chief of this joyous German occasion,
          I'm afraid I must have a word with
          Mademoiselle Mimieux.

          

          

          

          

          C. 5.
          Mademoiselle Mimieux eyes go to Private Zoller, who responds.

          FREDRICK
          What sort of discussion?

          COL LANDA
          That sounded suspiciously like a
          Private questioning the order of a
          Colonel? Or am I just being sensitive?

          FREDRICK
          Nothing could be further from the
          truth Colonel. Your authority is
          beyond question.
          But your reputation does proceed
          you. Should Mademoiselle Mimieux
          or myself be concerned?

          GOEBBELS
          Hans, the boy means no harm, he's
          simply smitten. And he's correct.
          Your reputation does proceed you.
          Laughter all around. The Reich Minister and his axis entourage,
          make their way to front of the cafe, with the two dumb dogs on
          a leash, leading the way.

          COL LANDA
          No need for concern, you two.
          As security chief, I simply need
          to have a chat with the possible
          new venue's property owner.

          FREDRICK
          I was just hoping to escort
          Mademoiselle Mimieux back to her
          cinema.

          GOEBBELS
          Nonsense! You can eat ice cream,
          and walk along the Sienne another
          time. Right now, allow Col Landa
          to do his job.
          Everybody saystheir farewells.
          Col Landa offers the young jew in hiding a seat at a small
          table in the outside patio area of Maxims.
          The fluency and poetic proficiency of the S.S. jew hunters
          french, revels to the audience, that his feigning clumsiness at
          french with Monsieur Lapadite in the films first scene, was
          simply a interrogation-technique.

          

          

          

          
          bd.
          They speak FRENCH SUBTITLED into ENGLISH;

          COL LANDA
          Have you tried the strudel here?

          SHOSANNA
          No.

          COL LANDA
          It's not so terrible. So how is it
          the young Private and yourself came
          to be acquainted?
          She's about to answer, when a WAITER approaches.

          COL LANDA
          Yes, two strudels, one for myself,
          and one for the mademoiselle. A cup
          of espresso, with a container of.
          steamed milk, on the side.
          For the Mademoiselle, a glass of milk.
          Considering Shosanna. grew up on a dairy farm, and the last time
          she was on a dairy farm, her strudel companion murdered her
          entire family, his ordering her milk is, to say the
          least... . disconcerting.
          The key to Col Landa's power, and or charm, depending on the
          side ones on, lies in his ability to convince you he's privy to
          your secrets.

          COL LANDA
           So Mademoiselle, you were beginning
          to explain....?

          SHOSANNA

          (ANXIOUSLY)
          Up untill a couple of days ago,
          I had no knowledge of Private Zoller,
          or his exploits. To me, the Private
          was simply just a patron of my cinema.
          We spoke a few times, but -

          COL LANDA
          - Mademoiselle, let me interrupt you.
          This is a simple formality, no
          reason for you to feel anxious.
          The Colonel takes one look at it, and says to the Waiter;

          

          

          

          

          67

          COL LANDA
          I apologize, I forgot to order the
          cream fresh.

          WAITER
          One moment.
          He exits.

          COL LANDA
          (Refuring to
          the apple pie)
          Wait for the cream.
          (Back to

          BUSINESS)
          So Emmanuelle - May I call you
          Emmanuelle?

          SHOSANNA
          Oui.

          COL LANDA
          So Emmanuelle, explain to me how
          does it happen, that a young lady
          such as your self, comes to own a
          cinema?
          The Waiter returns, applying cream fresh to the two strudels.
          The S.S. Colonel looks across the table at his companion, picking
          up his fork, he says;

          COL LANDA
          After you.
          Shosanna takes Ã¢â¬Â¢a whip creamy bite of strudel, Landa follows her
          lead.

          COL LANDA

          (MOUTHFULL
          of pie)
          Success?
          Shosanna, mouth full of pie, indicates she approves.

          .COL LANDA
          Like I said, not so terrible.
          (Back to

          BUSINESS)
          So you were explaining the origin of
          your cinema ownership?

          

          

          

          

          69.

          SHOSANNA
          The cinema originally belonged to
          my aunt and uncle -
          Col Landa removes alittle black book from his pocket.

          COL LANDA
          - What is there names?

          SHOSANNA
          Jean-Pierre and Ada Mimieux.
          He records the names in his little book.

          COL LANDA
          Where are they now?

          SHOSANNA
          My uncle was killed during blitzkrieg.

          COL LANDA
          Pity... . Continue.

          SHOSANNA
          Aunt Ada passed away from fever
          last spring.'

          COL LANDA
          Regrettable.

          (RESPECTFUL

          PAUSE)
          It's come to my attention you have
          a negro in your employ, is that true?

          SHOSANNA
          Yes, he's a Frenchman. His name is
          Marcel. He worked with my aunt and
          uncle since they opened the cinema.
          He's the only other one who works
          with me.

          COL LANDA
          Doing what?

          SHOSANNA
          Projectionist.

          COL LANDA
          Is he any good?

          SHOSANNA
          The best.

          

          

          

          

          61.

          COL LANDA
          Actually one could see where that
          might be a good trade for them.
          Can you operate the projectors?

          SHOSANNA
          Of course I can.

          COL LANDA
          Knowing the Reich Minister as I do,
          I'm quite positive he wouldn't want
          the success or failure of his
          illustrious evening, dependent on
          the prowess of a negro. So if it
          comes to pass we hold this event
          at your venue, talented no doubt,
          as your negro may be, you will
          operate the projectors. Is that
          exceptable?
          As if she has any say.

          SHOSANNA
          Oui.
          Col Landa takes another bite of strudel, Shosanna follows suit.

          COL LANDA
          So it would appear our young hero is
          quite smitten with you?

          SHOSANNA
          Private Zollers feelings for me
          aren't of a romantic nature.

          COL LANDA
          Mademoiselle...?

          SHOSANNA
          Colonel, his feelings are not
          romantic. I remind him of his sister.

          COL LANDA
          That doesn't mean his feelings
          aren't romantic.

          SHOSANNA
          I remind him of his sister who
          raised him.

          

          

          

          

          70

          COL LANDA
          It's sounding more and more romantic
          by the minute.
          Landa takes out a handsome looking cigarette case, with a S.S.
          LOGO on it. Removing on of the fags, he lights it up with a
          fancy S.S. gold lighter. He offers one to Shosanna.

          COL LANDA
          Cigarette?

          SHOSANNA
          No thank you.

          COL LANDA
          Do you smoke?

          SHOSANNA
          Yes.

          COL LANDA
          Then I insist, you must take one.
          There not French, there German.
          I hope your not nationalist about
          your tobacco, to me French cigarettes
          are a sin against nicotine.
          She takes one, but makes no move to light it.
          He inhales deep, and says;

          COL LANDA
          I did have some thing else I wanted
          to ask you, but right now, for the
          life of me, I can't remember what it
          is. Oh well, must not of been important.
          Col Landa stands up, throws some French francs on the table,
          puts on his grey S.S. cap, touches his finger to his visor,
          saluting Shosanna, and saying:

          COL LANDA
          Till tonight.
          And with that he's gone.
          Shosanna breaths a sigh of relief.
          The CAMERA begins to slowly lower from a MEDIUM CU to her feet
          ankles and floor. We see her shoes are in a puddle of urine.
          During her conversation and strudel with the man that
          exterminated her entire family, shosanna pissed herself.
          She drops the German cigarette in to the piss puddle by her
          feet.

          

          

          

          

          7 1.

          INT - CINEMA AUDITORIUM - NIGHT
          The SILVER SCREEN
          on screen is the German screwball comedy "LUCKY KIDS".
          We hear OFF SCREEN laughter at the on screen aryan antics.

          CU GOEBBELS
          Watching the screen, basking in his own toxic genius.

          CU FRANCESCA
          Laughing at the comedy, hand covering her mouth.

          CU TWO BLACK POODLES
          Pantingly watching the screen.

          CU MAJOR HELLSTROM
          Smiling, smoking a French cigarette.

          CU COL LANDA
          Smoking his calabash, amused.

          CU FREDRICK ZOLLER
          Truly enjoying himself.

          CU SHOSANNA
          watching the screen.
          The LITERARY NARRATOR comes on the soundtrack.

          NARRATOR (VO)
          While Shosanna sits there pretending
          to be amused by the aryan antics of
          Goebbels Frank Capra copy, "Lucky
          Kids", a thought suddenly comes to
          her.
          We see her face get slightly distracted behind the eyes.

          NARRATOR (VO)
          What if tonight, accidently, the
          cinema burned down? The Third Reich
          would lose it's Minister of
          propaganda, it's national hero, and
          it's top jew hunter, all in one fell
          swoop.
          She chuckles at the thought, though it looks like she's
          laughing at the German comedy.

          SILVER SCREEN
          "The END" card for "Lucky Kids" is projected.
          The Nazi rouges gallery, and Shosanna, applaud the film.

          

          

          

          

          IZ
          The lights go up.

          P
          Goebbels excepts congratulations, as they stand and begin to
          file out into the lobby.

          NARRATOR(VO)
          The screening of "Lucky Kids" was a
          complete success. And Heer Goebbels
          conceded to have the venue changed
          to Shosannas cinema. Not only that,
          in a moment of inspiration, Heer
          Goebbels had a idea.
          Goebbels speaks GERMAN, and Francesca translates;

          GOEBBELS
          I must say, I appreciate the modesty
          of this auditorium. Your Cinema
          has real respect, almost church like.
          Not to say we couldn't spruce the
          place up a bit. In Versailles
          there's a crystal chandelier hanging
          in the banquet hall that is
          extraordinary. we're going to get it,
          and hang it from the very middle of
          auditorium roof. Also I want to go to
          Louvre, pick up a few Greek nudes,
          and just scatter them about the lobby.

          MONTAGE
          we see a quick series of shots that show all that happening.
          The chandelier being removed from the ceiling of Versailles.
          Greek nude statues being hand trucked out of the Louvre.
          A truck driving through the french countryside with the
          enormous crystal chandelier in the back.
          The lobby of Shosanna's cinema, pimped out in Nazi iconography.
          WORKERS buzz around decorating. The Greek statues are moved
          into place.
          We see Workers trying with incredible difficulty, to hoist the
          huge, heavy, and twinkingly fragile chandelier, in Shosannas
          auditorium, which now resembles something out of one of Tinto
          Brass's Italian B-movie rip off's of Visconti's "The Damned".

          SHOSANNA
          watches all this from a opera box, she shakes her head in
          disbelief.

          

          

          

          

          73

          BACK TO SHOSANNA AND THE NAZI "S
          in the lobby, post screening of "Lucky Rids", she's soundlessly
          escorting them to the door, as they make their goodbyes.

          NARRATOR (VO)
          As they left the little French
          cinema that night, all the Germans
          were very happy...
          We see Private Zoller hanging back, so he.can say goodbye.

          NARRATOR (VO)
          None more so then Private Zoller.
          She closes the door on him. Watching the Nazi's walk into the
          Paris night. Their shadows, for a moment onAwall, look
          like grotesque Nazi charcthers. 4644
          The Nazi's are gone.
          Marcel sits at the top of the staircase of the lobby, looking
          down at Shosanna.
          They speak in FRENCH SUBTITLED into ENGLISH;

          MARCEL
          What the fuck are we suppose to do?

          SHOSANNA
          It looks like we're suppose to have
          a Nazi premier.

          MARCEL
          Like I said, what the fuck are we
          suppose to do?

          SHOSANNA
          Well, I need to speak with you
          about that.

          MARCEL
          About what?

          SHOSANNA
          About these Hun swine, commandeering
          our cinema.

          MARCEL
          What about it?
          She slowly walks up the stairs to Marcel. She makes him part
          his legs, and sits on the lower step, between his legs. Her
          back up against his chest, his arms around her shoulders.
          Shosanna has only known this type of intimacy with Marcel.

          

          

          

          

          SHOSANNA
          Well, when I was watching the bosch
          (Said in

          ENGLISH)
          Capra-corn abomination,
          (Back to

          FRENCH)
          I got a idea.

          MARCEL
          I'm confused, what are we talking
          about?

          SHOSANNA
          Filling the cinema with Nazi's and
          their whores, and burning it down
          to the ground.

          MARCEL
          I'm not talking about that, your
          talking about that.

          SHOSANNA
          No, we're talking about that,
          right now. If we can keep this
          place from burning down by
          ourselves, we can burn it down
          by ourselves.

          MARCEL
          Shosanna -

          SHOSANNA
          No, Marcel, just for sake of argument,
          if we wanted to burn down the cinema,
          for any number of reasons, you and I
          could physically accomplish that, no?

          MARCEL
          Oui Shosanna, we could do that.

          SHOSANNA
          And with Madame Mimieux's 350 nitrate
          film print collection, we wouldn't
          even need explosives, would we?

          MARCEL
          You mean we wouldn't need any more
          explosives?

          SHOSANNA
          Oui, that's exactly what I mean.
          She begins kissing his hands.

          

          

          

          

          75.

          SHOSANNA

          (CON'T)
          I am going to burn down the cinema
          on Nazi night.
          One of his fingers probes her mouth.

          SHOSANNA

          (CON'T)
          And if I'm going to burn down the
          cinema, which I am, we both know,
          your not going to let me do it
          by myself.
          The back of her head presses up hard against him, as his hand
          both caresses, and grips her lovely neck.

          SHOSANNA

          (CON'T)
          Because you love me. And I love you.
          And your the only person on this earth
          I can trust.
          She then TWISTS around, so she's straddling him. They are now,
          face to face.

          SHOSANNA

          (CON'T)
          But that's not all we're going to do.
          Does the filmmaking equipment it the
          attic still work? I know the film
          camera does. How about the sound
          recorder?

          MARCEL
          Quite well, actually. I recorded a
          new guitarist I met in a cafe last
          week. It works superb. Why do we
          need filmmaking equipment?

          SHOSANNA
          Because Marcel, my sweet, we're
          going to make a film. Just for the
          Nazi's.

          FADE OFF

          INT - ENGLISH COUNTRY ESTATE - DAY
          A young MILITARY ATTACHE, opens the sliding double doors
          that serve as a entrance to the room.

          MILITARY ATTACHE
          Right this way, Lieutenant.
          A snappy handsome British Lieutenant in dress browns, steps inside
          the room. This officer, who has been mixing it up with
          the Gerrys since the late thirties, is named LT.ARCHIE HICOX.
          A young George Sanders type(The Saint and Private affairs of
          Bel Ami, years).
          Upon entering the room, Lt.Hicox is gobsmacked.
          Standing before him is legendary military mastermind,
          GENERAL ED FENECH, a older George Sanders type (Village of the
          Dammed).
          But in the back of the room, sitting behind a piano,
          smoking his ever present cigar, is the unmistakable
          bulk of WINSTON CHURCHELL.

          LT. HICOX
          Lt. Archie Hicox, reporting sir.

          GEN FENECH
          (Salutes back)
          General Ed Fenech, at ease Hicox.
          Drink?
          Hicox's eye's go to the formidable bulldog behind the piano,
          who's scrutinizing him behind his cigar. However the man behind
          the cigar makes no gesture, and the General, makes no
          acknowledgment of the three hundred pound gorilla in the room.
          Which Lt.Hicox knows enough to mean, if Churchell isn't
          introduced, he ain't there.

          LT.HICOX
          if you offered me a scotch and plane
          water, I could drink a scotch and
          plain water.

          

          

          

          

          ?7.

          GEN.FENECH
          That a boy, Lieutenant. Make it
          yourself, like a good chap,
          will you? Bars in the globe.
          Hicox heads over to the bar globe.

          LT.HICOX
          Something for yourself, sir?

          GEN.FENECH
          Whiskey straight. No junk in it.
          The Lieutenant moves over to the Columbus-style globe bar, and
          busies himself mixing spirits, playing bartender chappy.
          Fenech, eyeing the Lieutenant's file.

          GEN.FENECH
          It says here you've run three
          undercover commando operations in
          Germany, and German occupied
          territories? Frankfaurt, Holland,
          and Norway to be exact?
          Back to them, mixing drinks, he says;

          LT.HICOX
          Extraordinary people, the Norwegian's.

          GEN.FENECH
          It says here you speak German fluently?

          LT.HICOX
          Like a Katzenjammer Kid.

          GEN.FENECH
          And your occupation before the war?
          His back still to us, as he bartends...

          LT. H I COX
          I'm a film critic.

          GEN.FENECH
          List your accomplishments?

          LT.HICOX
          Well sir, such as they are, I write
          reviews and articles, for a publication
          called; "Films and Filmmakers".
          As well as our sister publication.

          

          

          

          
          7f .

          GEN.FENECH
          What's that called?

          LT.HICOX
          "Flickers Bi-Monthly". And I've had
          two books published.

          GEN.FENECH
          Impressive. Don't be modest Lieutenant,
          what are their titles?

          LT. HI COX
          The first book was called; "Art Of The
          Eye's, The Heart, and The Mind:A Study
          of German Cinema in the Twenties".
          And the second one was called; ...
          He turns around with his whiskey and plain water, and the
          Generals whiskey no junk. He finishes what he was saying, as
          he walks toward the General, handing him his drink.

          LT.HICOX
          "Twenty-Four Frame Da Vinci".
          It's a subtexual film criticism
          study of the work of German director
          G.W. Pabst.

          LT. HI COX
          What should we drink to, sir?

          GEN.FENECH
          (Thinking, for
          a moment)
          Down with Hitler.

          LT.HICOX
          All the way down, sir.

          GEN.FENECH
          Are you familiar with German cinema
          under the Third Reich?

          LT. HI COX
          Yes. Obviously I haven't seen any of
          the films made in the last three
          years, but I am familiar with it.

          GEN.FENECH
          Explain it to me.?

          

          

          

          

          77

          LT.HICOX
          Pardon sir?

          GEN.FENECH
          This little escapade of ours,
          requires a knowledge of the German
          film industry under the Third Reich.
          Explain to me UFA, under Goebbels?

          LT.HICOX
          Goebbels considers the films he's
          making to be the beginning of a new
          era in German cinema. A alternative
          to what he considers the Jewish
          German intellectual cinema of the
          twenties. And the Jewish controlled
          dogma of Hollywood.
          SUDDENLY... Bellowing from the back of the room;

          CHURCHELL
          How's he doing?

          LT. H I COX
          Frightfully sorry sir, once again?

          CHURCHELL
          You say he wants to take on the Jews
          at their own game? Compared to say
          .Louis B.Mayer...how's he doing?

          LT.HICOX
          Quite well, actually. Since Goebbels
          has taken over, film attendance has
          steadily risen in Germany over the
          last eight years. But Louis B.Mayer
          wouldn't be Goebbels proper opposite
          number. I believe Goebbels see's himself
          closer to David O.Selznick.
          Gen.Fenech looks to the Prime Minister.
          With a puff of cigar smoke, Churchell says;

          CHURCHELL
          Brief him.

          GEM.FENECH
          Lt.Bicox, at this point in time I'd
          like to brief you on, Operation Kino.
          Three days from now, Joseph Goebbels is
          throwing a gala premier of one of his
          new movies in Paris -

          

          

          

          

          80.

          LT.HICOX
          - What film sir?
          The General has to resort to peeking at his file.

          GEN.FENECH
          The motion pictures called; "Nation's
          Pride".

          LT.HICOX
          Oh, you mean the film about Private
          Zoller?

          GEN.FENECH
          We don't have any intelligence, on
          exactly, what the film that night
          will be about.

          LT.HICOX
          But it's called "Nation's Pride"?

          GEN.FENECH
          Yes.

          LT.HICOX
          I can tell you what it's about,
          it's about Private Fredrick Zoller.
          He's the German Sgt.York.
          Fenech can't help suppress a smile, they have the right man.

          GEN.FENECH
          In attendance at this joyous Germatic
          occasion, will be Goebbels, Gerring,
          Boorman, and most of the German High
          command, including all high ranking
          officers of both The S.S., and, The
          Gestapo. As well as luminaries of the
          Nazi propaganda film industry.

          LT.HICOX
          The master race at play, aye?

          GEN.FENECH
          Basically, we have all our rotten
          eggs in one basket. The objective of
          Operation Kino.... Blow up the basket.

          LT.HICOX
          (Reciting a
          a poem)
          "...and like the snows of yesteryear,
          gone from this earth". Jolly good, sir.

          

          

          

          

          GEN.FENECH
          An American Secret Service outfit,
          that lives deep behind enemy lines,
          will be your assist. The Germans call
          them; "The Basterds".

          LT.HICOX
          "The Basterds", never heard of them.

          GEN.FENECH
          Whole point of the secret service,
          old boy, you not hearing of them.
          But the Gerrys have heard of them,
          because these yanks have been them
          the devil. Their leader is a chap
          named Lt.Aldo Raine. The Germans
          call him, "Aldo the Apache".

          LT.HICOX
          Why do they call him that?

          GEN.FENECH
          Best guess, is because he removes the
          scalps of the Nazi dead.

          LT.HICOX
          Scalps, sir?

          GEN.FENECH
          The hair.
          He runs his finger along his hairline.

          GEN.FENECH
          Like a red Injun.

          LT.HICOX
          Rather gruesome sounding little
          Dicky bird, isn't he?

          GEN.FENECH
          No doubt the whole lot, a bunch a
          nutters. But you've heard the
          expression, "It takes a thief".

          LT.HICOX
          Indeed.
          General Fenech continues on with his exposition, moving over
          to a military map.

          

          

          

          
          9i.

          GEN.FENECH
          You'll be dropped into France, about
          twenty four kilometers outside of Paris.
          The Basterds will be waiting for you.
          First thing, you go to a little village
          called, "Nadine".
          (He points it
          out on the map)
          Apparently the Gerrys never go there.
          In Nadine, there's a tavern, called,
          "La Louisiane", you'll rendez-vous
          with our double agent, and she'll take
          it from there. She's the one who's
          going to get you in the premiere.
          It will be you, her, and two German
          born members of the Basterds. She's
          also made all the other arrangements
          your going to need.

          LT.HICOX
          How will I know her?

          GEN.FENECH
          I suspect that won't be too much
          trouble for you. Your contact is
          Bridget Von Hammersmark.

          LT.HICOX
          Bridget Von Hammersmark? The German
          movie star is working for England?

          GEN.FENECH
          For the last two years now. one could
          even say Operation Kino was her
          brainchild.
          In the back of the room the bulldog barks;

          CHURCHELL
          Extraordinary women.

          LT.BICOX
          Quite.

          GEN.FENECH
          You'll go to the premiere as her
          escort, lucky devil. She'll also
          have the premiere tickets for the
          other two. Got the gist?

          LT.HICOX
          I think so, sir. Paris when it sizzles.
          The three British bulldogs laugh.

          

          

          

          

          9 3

          EXT - CINEMA ROOFTOP - DAY
           Shosanna and Marcel are on the rooftop of their cinema,
          literally, making a movie.
          Marcel is behind a old (even then) BOLEX 35MM MOVIE CAMERA,
          positioned low looking up.
           Shosanna, the camera subject, stands on boxes looking down
          into it.
          A old timey MICROPHONE is positioned out of frame.
          As they always do, and always will, they speak FRENCH
          SUBTITLED into you know what.

          MARCEL
          We need a sync mark.

          SHOSANNA
          What is a sync mark?

          MARCEL
          A action and noise put together,
          So we can sync up the picture
          and sound.

          SHOSANNA
          How do we do that?

          MARCEL
          Clap your hands.
          She does.

          MARCEL
          In frame imbecile.
          She claps her hands in front of her face.

          MARCEL
          Ready?
          Shosanna takes a deep breath, then;

          SHOSANNA
          Ready.

          MARCEL
          Action.

          WE CUT BEFORE SHE SPEAKS TO...

          

          

          

          

          GIR

          .THE SCENE EARLIER BETWEEN MARCEL AND SHOSANNA IN THE

          LOBBY, ON THE STAIRS, TALKING ABOUT BURNING DOWN THE CINEMA.
          Big diffrence this time, it's in COLOR.

          MARCEL
          But how do we get it developed?
          Only a suicidal idiot like us would
          develop that footage. How do we get
          a35mm print with a soundtrack?

          SHOSANNA
          Do you know one person who can do
          both things?

          MARCEL
          Of course Gaspar, very nice man,
          took care of all the experimental
          filmmakers. But nobody in their
          right mind would strike a print of
          what your talking about. If the
          Nazi's found out, their life wouldn't
          be worth this.
          He snaps his fingers.

          SHOSANNA
          In a wolf fight, you ether eat the
          wolf, or the wolf eats you. If we're
          going to obliterate the Nazi's,
          we have to use their tactics.

          MARCEL
          What does that mean?

          SHOSANNA
          We find somebody who can develop
          and process a35mm print. And we
          make them do it, or we kill them.
          Once we tell them what we want to
          do, if they refuse, we have to kill
          them anyway, or they'll turn us in.

          MARCEL
          Would you do that?

          SHOSANNA
          Like that.
          Snaps her fingers.

          

          

          

          

          ?S,

          INT - SMALL FILM PROCESSING LAB- LATE NIGHT
          A old mom and pop film processing lab circa the Thirties.
          Late late at night.
          GASPAR, the fatherly figure of all the experimental French
          filmmakers in the decade before German rule, takes a SAVAGE
          BEATING at the hands of his friend Marcel.
          Shosanna watches, pitiless.

          SHOSANNA
          Bring that fucker over here!
          Put his head down on that table.
          Marcel, holds his arm behind him, as he forces his head flat
          against the table top.
          Shosanna brings a HATCHET DOWN DEEP into the table, just by
          his face.

          SHOSANNA
          You ether do what the fuck we tell
          you to, or I'll bury this axe in your
          collaborating skull.

          GASPAR
          I'm not a collaborator!

          SHOSANNA
          Then prove it! Or does your manhood
          go no deeper, then standing to piss?
          Marcel, does his wife, and children
          know you?

          MARCEL
          Oui.

          SHOSANNA
          Then after we kill this dog for
          Germans, we'll go and silence them.
          She lifts up the hatchet, raises it high...

          SHOSANNA
          Prepare to die, collaborator fucker!

          CUT TO

          GASPAR
          hands the couple a SMALL SILVER CAN OF 35mm FILM. Outside
          the shop window, it's morning.

          

          

          

          

          INT - PROJECTION BOOTH-
          WE SEE the five heavy silver film cans of Fredrick Zollers
          life story "Nations Pride"(clearly marked) on the floor of
          the projection booth.
          The can for REEL 4is open and empty.
          Shosanna's at the editing bench, REEL 4, is up on the
          rewinds...
          Shosanna SPLICES her and Marcels footage into REEL 4 of
          Fredricks film. Rewinds it, puts it back in the can, and
          puts a piece of RED TAPE on REEL 4 CAN.
          She walks out of the booth, turning off the lights behind
          her, PLUNGING THE SCREEN INTO DARKNESS.

          BLACK FRAME

          FROM BLACK DISSOLVE TO

          EXT - LA LOUISIANE (TAVERN) - NIGHT
          We see a small basement tavern, with a old rustic sign out
          front that reads, "La Louisiane".

          A SUBTITLE APPEARS:
          "The Village of

          NADINE, FRANCE"
          TWO SHOT LT.HICOX and LT.ALDO RAINE
          Aldo is dressed like a French civilian. Hicox is dressed in a
          German grey S.S. Cap't uniform. They look out of a window, in a
          apartment, in the village of Nadine, overlooking the tavern.

          LT.ALDO
          You didn't say the goddamn rendez-vous
          was in a fuckin basement.

          LT.HICOX
          I didn't know.

          LT.ALDO
          You said it was in a tavern?

          LT.HICOX
          it is a tavern.

          

          

          

          

          LT.ALDO
          Yeah, in a basement. You know,
          fightin in a basement offers a lot
          of difficulties, number one being,
          your fighting in a basement.
          Wilhelm Wicki, joins the SHOT, dressed in a German S.S.
          Lieutenant uniform.

          WICKI
          What if we go in there, and she's
          not even there?

          LT.HICOX
          We wait. Don't worry, she's a British
          spy, she'll make the rendez-vous.
          WE SEE the other Basterds, dressed in French civilian clothes,
          are in the room as well, they are, Donowitz, Hirschberg,
          and Utivich. And in the back of the room, dressed in the grey
          uniform of a S.S. Lieutenant, Hugo Stiglitz sits off by himself,
          sharpening his S.S. DAGGER on his leather belt looped around his
          boot. Anybody not in the scene from the Basterds opening
          chapter, is dead.
          Lt.Hicox watches Stiglitz off by himself on the other side of
          the room, SHARPENS his dagger menacingly.
          .Stiglitz is fucking werid...
          Lt.Hicox approaches Stiglitz...

          LT.NICOX
          Stiglitz, right?

          STIGLITZ
          That's right, sir.
          He continues bringing the blades edge, up, then, down on the
          leather strap.

          LT.HICOX
          I hear your pretty good with that?
          Meaning the blade. Stiglitz doesn't answer.

          LT.HICOX
          You know, we're not looking for
          trouble, right now. We're simply
          making contact with our agent.
          Should be uneventful. However, on
          the off chance I'm wrong, and things
          prove eventful. I need to know, we can
          all remain calm.

          

          

          

          

          99.
          The renegade Gerry Sergeant, stops his blades progress, and
          looks up at the limy Lieutenant.

          STIGLITZ
          I don't look calm to you?

          LT.HICOX
          Well, now you put it like that,
          I guess you do.
          He turns his attention back to his blade.
          Hicox moves over to Aldo, and asks him privately;

          LT. HI COX
          This Gerry of yours, Stiglitz?
          Not exactly the loquacious type,
          is he?
          Aldo just looks at him.

          LT.ALDO
          Is that the kinds man you need, the
          loquacious type?

          LT.HICOX
          Fair point, Lieutenant.

          LT.ALDO
          So y'all git in trouble in there,
          what are we suppose to do?
          Make bets on how it all comes out?

          LT.HICOX
          If we get into trouble, we can
          handle it. But if trouble does
          happen, we need you to make damn
          sure no Germans, or French, for
          matter, escape from that basement.
          If Frau Von Hammersmark's cover is
          compromised, the mission is kaput.

          SGT.DONOWITZ
          Speaking of Frau Von Hammersmark,
          who's idea was it for the death trap
          redez-vous?

          LT.HICOX
          She chose the spot.

          SGT.DONOWITZ
          Well isn't that just dandy?

          

          

          

          

          LT.HICOX
          Look, she's not a military strategist.
          She's just a actress.

          LT.ALDO
          Ya don't got to be Stonewall
          Jackson to know you don't want to
          fight in a basement.

          LT.HICOX
          She wasn't picking a place to fight.
          She was picking a place, isolated,
          and without germans.

          PFC.HIRSCHBERG
          Lieutenant, I hate to be contrary,
          but I got me a Nazi pissin on
          Louisianna two-o'clock.
          They move to the window, and sure enough, ONE LONE NAZI
          PRIVATE, relieves himself against the side wall.
          Lt.Bicox, this was definitely, not the plan.

          LT.HICOX
          Shit.
          Sgt.Donowitz chides him;

          SGT.DONOWITZ
          So what do you think your fraulein
          Von Hammer -

          LT.HICOX
          - Obviously, I don't know,Sgt.
          The British officer watches the German soldier, who's not
          suppose to be there. When Hugo Stiglitz joins him at the
          window. Stiglitz looks down at the urinating Nazi, S.S. dagger
          in hand.

          STIGLITZ
          If we're going, let's go.
          He sheaths the dagger.

          EXT - LA LOUISIANE (BASEMENT TAVERN) - NIGHT
          The GERMAN PISSING PRIVATE, sloppily finishes his task.
          Craming his noodle back in his pants, he descends the stairs
          that lead him back into the basement tavern. We Follow him...

          

          

          

          INT - LA LOUISIANE (BASEMENT TAVERN)- NIGHT
          .Inside the basement tavern, La Louisiane. it has a very low
          hanging basement ceiling. A old looking wood bar off to the
          right. And the only other space in the little tavern, is taken
          up by two large(at least in here) tables, which take up both
          half's of the room. And despite rumors to the contrary, one of
          the two tables, is completely filled with drunken celebrating
          Nazi enlisted men, of which our urinating friend is one of
          five.

          FIVE NAZI'S
          ONE GERMAN MASTER SGT, ONE FEMALE GERMAN SGT (a powerfully built
          stocky type), and THREE MALE GERMAN PRIVATES.
          The Five Nazi's are sitting around the table, drinking, and
          playing a very fun game with none other then the fraulein of
          the hour, UFA diva, BRIDGET VON HAMMERSMARK. Dressed to the
          nines in a chic Forties style women's suit, complete with
          fedora. The game their playing consists of each player having
          a card with the name of a famous person, real or imaginary,
          stuck to their forehead. The player doesn't know what name is
          on their forehead. So they ask the others questions to figure
          out who they are.
           The Five Germans, five cards read; MASTER SGT #1(POLA NEGRI),

          FEMALE SGT #2(BEETHOVEN), GERMAN PRIVATE #3(MATA HARI),

          GERMAN PRIVATE #4 (EDGAR WALLACE), GERMAN PRIVATE #5
           (WINNETOU). And Bridget Von Hammersmark, who wears her card in
          the brim of her fedora, has GENGHIS KHAN.
          It's German#5 (WINNETOU) turn to ask questions.
           The DIALOGUE will be in GERMAN, and SUBTITLED into ENGLISH.
          Also, while some dialogue will be written for the German
          Soldiers, it will be mostly made up from the exuberance
          of their game playing, and celebrating.

          WINNETOU
          .okay, I'm not German. Am I American?
          The whole table bursts out laughing.

          FEMALE SGT/BEETHOVEN
          Yes you arel

          EDGAR WALLACE
          Well, not really.

          SGT.POLA NEGRI
          What do you mean, not really? Of
          course he is.

          

          

          

          

          91

          EDGAR WALLACE
          Well if he's so American, how come
          he's never been translated into
          English? He's not American. He's
          suppose to be American, but he's not
          a American creation. In fact, he's
          something very different.

          WINNETOU
          Okay, I'm a fictional, literary
          character, from the past, I'm American,
          and that's controversial.

          BRIDGET/GENGUS
          No it's not controversial. The nationally
          of the author, has nothing to do with
          the nationally of the character.
          The Character is the character.
          Hamlet's not British, he's Danish.
          So yes, this character was born in
          America.

          WINNETOU
          Well I'm glad that's settled. If I had
          a wife, would she be called a squaw?
          He's got it.
          The table Laughs.
          The TABLE

          YES!

          WINNETOU
          Is my bloodbrother, Old Shatterhand?
          The TABLE
          Yes!

          WINNETOU
          Did Karl May write me?
          The TABLE
          Yes!
          In the BACKGROUND, WE SEE, our three counterfeit German
          Officers, Hicox, Wicki, and Stiglitz, enter the basement
          tavern. They obviously. see the five German soldiers, but their
          too far away for us (the audience) to read their face. No
          doubt their less then happy. Fraulein Von Hammersmark
          see's them as well. Without getting up, she waves to them.

          

          

          

          

          QZ

          BRIDGET
          Hello, my lovelies, I will join you
          in moments. I'm finishing up a game
          with my five new friends here.

          LT.HICOX
          No hurry, Frau Von Hammersmark.
          Take your time, enjoy yourself.

          BRIDGET
          (To Winnetou)
          So who are you?

          WINNETOU
          I am WINNETOU, CHIEF of the APACHES!
          The table CHEERS, and APPLAUD the Apache Chief, as he takes
          the card off his forehead.
          The other Four German Soldiers drink down there beer(part of
          the game).
          Bridget Von Hammersmark knock backs her champagne.

          MATA HARI
          Frau Von Hammersmark, when your
          friends came in, did you realize
          you did a double take, like in the
          movies?

          BRIDGET
          Really? No, I wasn't aware of that
          at all.

          MATA HARI
          They must be second nature to you now?
          Did they teach you how to do a double
          take in the movies?

          BRIDGET
          Well, yes they did, but it's not really
          that difficult.

          SGT.POLA NEGRI
          Do one for us.
          The Tableheartily agrees.
          Bridget looks directly at the Master Sgt, and does a perfect,
          and perfectly funny, Double Take.
          The Table loves it.

          

          

          

          
          q3.

          MATA HARI
          My turn, I want to try.
          Mata Hari, looks directly at Beethoven, and does a Double
          Take.

          EDGER WALLACE
          I want to try.
          He does.
          Soon the whole Table is doing dueling Double Takes.

          HICOX - WICKI - STIGLITZ
          watch the table do dueling Double Takes. Obviously, they don't
          understand.

          THEN...
          .Bridget Von Hammersmark rises, and excuses herself from the
          Table. She removes the card stuck in her fedora, looking at
          the name Gengus Khaun for the first time.

          BRIDGET
          Gengus Khaun! I would never of gotten that.
          She walks over, and joins the masquerading Germans table, the
          Gentlemen rise. She greets each warmly with a french cheek
          kiss, as if she knows them well.
          They all take a seat. The two Basterds, and one Brit, drink
          Whiskey. The taverns PROPRIETOR, a older, big bellyed
          Frenchman named EARL, comes over to the table, and pours more
          champagne into Bridget's Champagne glass. He leaves, returning
          back behind the bar, with the YOUNG FRENCH BARMAID, the only other
          person in the establishment.
          Obviously, they speak GERMAN, SUBTITLED into ENGLISH;

          LT.HICOX
          I thought this place was suppose to
          have more French then Germans?

          BRIDGET
          Normally that's true. The Sgt over
          there's wife, just had a baby. His
          commanding officer gave him, and his
          mates the night off to celebrate.

          WICXI
          We should leave.

          

          

          

          

          BRIDGET
          F No, we should stay. For one drink at
          least. I've been waiting for you in a
          bar, it would look strange if we left
          before we had a drink.

          LT.HICOX
          She's right, just be calm, and enjoy
          your booze.

          BACK TO THE GERMAN TABLE
          The French Barmaid, has taken Bridget's place in the rousing,
          rowdy game. She tells them, her person must be French, or she
          won't know them. Winnetou thinks for a moment, then writes a
          name on a card. The Barmaid puts it on her forehead, It says;

          NAPOLEON.
          The Germans all laugh.

          BACK TO THE BASTERDS TABLE

          BRIDGET
          There's been some new developments.
          The cinema venue has changed.

          LT.HICOX
          Why?

          BRIDGET
          No one knows. But that in itself
          shouldn't be a problem. The cinema
          it's been changed to is considerably
          smaller then The Ritz. So whatever
          materials you brought for The Ritz,
          should be doubly effective here.
          Now this next piece of information
          is colossal, try not to over react.
          The Fubrer, will be attending tomorrow.
          Hugo Stiglitz does a SPIT TAKE.
          Bridget's eyes bore holes in him.

          BACK TO THE REAL GERMANS
          They see Hugo do the spit take, and burst out laughing.
          Keeping it up, they begin to do dueling spit takes, like they
          did dueling double takes earlier. Needless to say, they all
          get wet.

          

          

          

          

          9

          BACK TO BASTERDS

          BRIDGET
          (To Hicox)
          You'll be going as Ernst Schuller.
          You'll say your a associate producer
          on Riefenstahl's "Tiefland". It's the
          one German production not under Goebbels
          control, and Leni wouldn't be caught dead
          at a Goebbels film affair.

          BACK TO REAL GERMAN TABLE
          Master Sgt.Pola Negri, drinks his beer, as he looks over,
          dreamily, at Bridget Von Hammersmark at the other table.

          BACK TO BASTERDS
          We See in Bridget continues to brief Hicox on his identity.
          the B.G., the German Master Sgt stand up from his table, and
          head toward Fraulein Von Bammersmark.

          BRIDGET
          .the films gone through many delays,
          and Leni's heath is deteriorating, so
          if you have to speak...
          Hicox, seeing the German Master Sgt approach, signals for her
          to cool it.

          SGT.POLA NEGRI
          Frau Von Hammersmark, I was just
          thinking, could you sign a autograph
          to my son on his birthday?

          BRIDGET
          I'd love to Wilhelm.
          (To the Table)
          This handsome happy Sgt, just became
          a father today.
          The Pretend Officers offer congratulations to the Sgt.
          The German Master Sgt, CLICKS his heels, and bows before his
          superior officers.

          SGT.POLA NEGRI
          Thank you, heil Hitler.
          He raises his hand .... as do the seated phony officers; "Heil
          Hitler".
          As she takes a rather fancy fountain pen from her clutch..

          BRIDGET
          So Wilhelm, do you know the name of
          this progeny yet?

          

          

          

          

          SGT.POLA NEGRI
          I most certainly do, fraulein. His
          name is Maximilian.
          Even the slightly psychotic Stiglitz, likes this German Sgt.

          STIGLITZ
          Wonderful name, Sgt.

          SGT.POLA NEGRI
          Thank you, Lieutenant. When he's old
          enough to ride a bicycle, I will buy
          him a blue one. And I will paint on
          the side "The Blue Max".
          He thrusts out his beer stein, for the officers to cheers.
          They do.
          Bridget finishes signing her autograph, with a big flourish.

          BRIDGET
          There you go. But wait, I'm not finished yet.
          She reaches into her clutch, and pulls out some lipstick.
          Applies some ruby red color to her lips, and then kisses the
          napkin, leaving a big red lip print. Then hands the treasured
          item to the young father.

          BRIDGET
          Nothing but the best for little Maximilian.

          SGT.POLA NEGRI
          Thank you fraulein, thank you. Max may
          not know who you are now. But he will.
          I will show him all of your movies.
          He will grow up with your films,
          and this napkin on his wall.
          Then, to the whole tavern...

          SGT.POLA NEGRI
          I purpose a toast to the greatest actress
          in Germany! There is no Dietrich, there is
          no Riefenstahl, only Von Hammersmark!
          The whole room toasts.
          This would be a good time for the German Sgt to go back to his
          table, and his men. And he almost does.... but... since he is
          drunk, and star struck, he out wears his welcome.

          SGT.POLA NEGRI
          So, Frau Von Hammersmark, what brings
          you to France?

          

          

          

          

          97 .
          Feeling any good Nazi officer's patience would of been
          exhausted long ago, Lt.Hicox butts in.

          LT.HICOX
          None of your business,Sgt.
          You might not have worn out your welcome
          with the fraulein, with your drunken
          boorish behavior, but you have wore out
          your welcome with me.
          The Table of game playing Soldiers, hear this, and get quiet.

          LT.HICOX
          Might I remind you Sgt.,your a enlisted
          man. This is a officers table. I suggest
          you stop pestering the fraulein, and
          rejoin your table.
          The German Master Sgt., looks quizzically at the officer.

          SGT.POLA NEGRI
          Excuse me Cap't, but your accent is
          is very unusual.
          The whole room pauses-for different reasons...

          SGT.POLA NEGRI
          Where are you from?
          A silent moment passes between the two tables, then the two
          German born impostors spring into action.

          WICKI
          Sgt.! You must be ether drunk or mad,
          to speak to a superior officer with
          such impertinentness!
          Stiglitz, STANDS and YELLS to the other table;

          STIGLITZ
          I'm making YOU,...
          (Pointing at

          WINNETOU)
          .and YOU,..
          (Pointing at
          Edgar Wallace)
          .responsible, for him.
          (Pointing at
          Sgt.Pola)
          I suggest you take hold of your friend,
          or he'll spend Max's first birthday
          in jail for public drunkenness!

          

          

          

          

          78
          The Germans SPRING UP, and take hold of Sgt.Pola...

          1W

          WHEN...
          A GERMAN VOICE rings out;

          GERMAN VOICE (OS)
          Then might I inquire?
          The Five known Germans move aside, reveling the unknown German
          in the room, unseen till now, our old friend from before
          MAJOR DEITER HELLSTROM of the GESTAPO. The Major stands from
          the little table he was sitting at.

          MAJOR HELLSTROM
          Like the young newly christened father,
          I too have a acute ear for accents.
          And like him, I too find yours odd.
          From where do you hail, Cap't?
          Wicki jumps in;

          WICKI
          Major, this is highly inappr -

          MAJOR HELLSTROM
          T wasn't speaking to you
          Lt.Saltzberg,
          (Turning to

          STIGLITZ)
          or you ether, Lt.Berlin.
          (Looking at

          HICOX)
          I was speaking to Cap't I--don't-know-what.
          The Gestapo Major is now standing beside Sgt.Pola, before the
          impostors table.
          Lt.Hicox, calmly explains his origin.

          LT.HICOX
          I was born in the village that rests
          in the shadow of Piz Palu.

          MAJOR HELLSTROM
          The mountain?

          LT.HICOX
          Yes. In that village we all speak like
          this. Have you seen the Riefenstahl film?

          MAJOR HELLSTROM
          Yes.

          

          

          

          
          f q s

          LT. HICOX
          Then you saw me. You remember the skiing
          torch scene?

          MAJOR HELLSTROM
          Yes I do.

          LT.HICOX
          In that scene was myself, my father,
          my sister, and my two brothers. My
          brother is so handsome, the director
          Pabst, gave him a Close Up.
          As Bridget Von Hammersmark places a cigarette in a ivory
          cigarette holder, which Hicox, as if on cue, lights for her,
          she says;

          BRIDGET
          Major, if my word means anything, I can
          vouch for everything the Young Cap't has
          just said. He does hail from the bottom
          of Piz Palu, he was in the film,
          and his brother is far more handsome
          then he.
          The impostors laugh.
          Then....so does the Gestapo Major. He turns to the Sgt.

          MAJOR HELLSTROM
          You should rejoin your friends.
          Which the young Sgt is more then happy to do. That table
          begins playing there game again.
          Major Hellstrom, the highest ranking officer in the room, bows
          graciously to the female German celebrity.

          MAJOR HELLSTROM
          May I join you?

          BRIDGET
          By all means, Major.
          The Gestapo Major sits at the table, opposite Lt.Hicox, and
          Wicki. The French Barmaid brings over the Majors beer stein.

          MAJOR HELLSTROM
          So that's the source of your bazaar
          accent? Extraordinary. So what are
          you doing here Cap't?

          LT.HICOX
          Aside from having a drink with the lovely
          fraulein?

          

          

          

          

          ,00 .

          MAJOR HELLSTROM
          Well that pleasure requires no explanation.
          Chuckle...Chuckle

          MAJOR HELLSTROM
          I mean in country. Your obviously not
          stationed in France, or I'd know who
          you are.

          LT Ã¢â¬Â¢ I'! I COX
          You know every German in France?

          MAJOR BELLSTROM
          Worth knowing.

          LT.HICOX
          Well, there in lies the problem. We
          never claimed to be worth knowing.
          Chuckle... Chuckle.

          MAJOR HELLSTROM
          (Chuckling as
          he asks)
          All levity aside, what are you doing
          in France?

          LT.HICOX
          Attending Goebbels film premiere as
          the frauleins escort.

          MAJOR HELLSTROM
          Your the frauleins escort?

          LT.HICOX
          Somebody has to carry the lighter.
          Chuckle chuckle.

          BRIDGET
          The Captain is my date, but all three
          are my guests. We're old friends Major,
          who go back along time. Longer then
          a actress would care to admit.
          Chuckle chuckle.

          MAJOR HELLSTROM
          Well, in that case, let me raise a glass
          to the three luckiest men in the room.

          BRIDGET
          I'll drink to that.

          

          

          

          

          101
          They cheers.

          BACK TO THE REAL GERMAN TABLE
          They continue to have alot of fun playing their game.

          BACK TO OFFICERS TABLE

          MAJOR HELLSTROM
          I must say, that game their playing
          looks like a good bit of fun. I didn't
          join them, because your quite right Cap't,
          officers and enlisted men shouldn't
          fraternize. But seeing as we're all
          officers here,
          (Bowing to

          BRIDGET)
          .and sophisticated lady friends of
          officers. What say we play the game?
          Lt.Hicox begins to refuse, when Bridget (feeling she knows
          better), interrupts him;

          BRIDGET
          okay, one game.

          MAJOR HELLSTROM

          WUNDERBAR
          The Major borrows five cards from the other table, and lays
          them out in front of Bridget and the officers.

          MAJOR HELLSTROM
          So the object of the game, is to write
          the name of a famous person on your card.
          Real or fictitious, doesn't matter. For
          instance, you could write Confucius or
          Fu Manchu.
          (He SNAPS his

          FINGERS)
          Eric' More pens.
          (Back to players)
          And they must be famous. No Aunt Inga's.
          When you finish writing, put the card
          face down on the table, and move it to
          the person to your left. The person to
          your right, will move their card in
          front of you. You pick up the card
          without looking at it, lick the back,
          and stick it on your forehead like so.
          He demonstrates.

          

          

          

          
          )oz.

          MAJOR HELLSTROM

          (CON'T)
          And in ten yes or no questions, you must
          guess who you are...
          As Major Hellstrom finishes explaining the finer points of the
          game, The CAMERA PANS OFF HIM, and BEGINS SLOWLY ZOOMING INTO
          STIGLITZ. The Majors dialogue begins to FADE AWAY.
          Untill we're in a SPAGHETTI WESTERN FLASHBACK. Which is RED
          FILTERED FOOTAGE of Hugo being savagely WHIPPED by somebody
          wearing a GESTAPO UNIFORM, SUPERIMPOSED over his CLOSE UP.
          The Flashback disappears. It's driving Stiglitz crazy, being
          this close to a Gestapo uniform, and not plunging a knife into
          it.
          The Majors Voice comes back on the soundtrack.

          MAJOR HELLSTROM
          .So let's give it a try, shall we?
          Everybody write your names.
          The Five players write their names...
          Then move their cards to the right...
          Everybody sticks their cards on their forehead...

          MAJ.KING KONG
          So... . I visited America, aye?
          The Table says; "Yes".

          MAJ.KING KONG
          Was this vist...fortuitous?

          WICKI
          Not for you.

          MAJ.KING KONG
          .Bummm. My native land, is it what
          one would call, exotic?
          The Table confers, and decides, yes it is exotic.

          MAJ.KING KONG
          Hummmm. That could be ether a reference
          to the jungle, or the Orient. I'm going
          to let my first instinct take over, and
          ask, am I from the jungle?
          The Tablesays; "Yes you are".

          MAJ.KING KONG
          Now gentlemen, around this time you could
          ask, weather your real or fictitious.
          I however, think that's too easy, so I
          won't ask that, yet. Okay, my native land
          is the jungle? I visited America, but my
          visit was not fortuitous to me, but the
          implication is that it was to somebody
          else. When I went from the jungle to
          America,... .Did I go by boat?
          "Yes".

          Now, who's next?

          LT.HICOX
          Major, I don't mean to be rude. But the
          four of us are very good friends. And
          the four of us haven't seen each other
          in quite a while. So...
          Major, I'm afraid, you are intruding.

          MAJOR HELLSTROM
          I beg to differ Cap't. It's only if the
          fraulein considers my presence a
          intrusion, that I become a intruder.
          How about it fraulein? Am I intruding?

          BRIDGET
          Of course not, Major.

          MAJOR HELLSTROM
          I didn't think so. It's simply the young
          Cap't is immune to my charms.
          The Table's not sure what to do, is this a confrontation?
          Then, the Major laughs.

          MAJOR HELLSTROM
          I'm just joking, of course I'm intruding.

          

          

          

          

          MAJOR HELLSTROM
          Allow me to refill your glasses gentlemen,
          and I will bid you and the fraulein adieu.

          Eric has a bottle of thirty-three year old
          single malt scotch whisky from the

          gentlemen?

          LT.HICOX
          Your most gracious, sir.

          MAJOR HELLSTROM
          Eric, the thirty-three, and new glasses!
          You don't want to contaminate the thirty-
          three with the swill you were drinking.

          ERIC
          How many glasses?

          LT.HICOX
          Five glasses.

          MAJOR HELLSTROM
          Not me. I like scotch, scotch doesn't like
          me.

          BRIDGET
          Nor I. I'll stay with bubbly.
          Lt.Bicox, hold up three fingers(pinky to index), to Eric the
          owner.

          LT.HICOX
          Three glasses.
          Eric brings the three glasses, and the old bottle, pouring for
          the three soldiers.
          Major Helistrom lifts up his beer stein, and toasts;

          MAJOR HELLSTROM
          To a thousand year Reich!
          They all mutter, "a thousand year reich", and toast glasses.
          The Gestapo Major puts down his beer stein, and then WE HEAR a
          CLICK, under the table.

          MAJOR HELLSTROM
          Did you hear that? That's the sound of
          my Luger pointed right at your testicles.

          That makes three of us.

          UNDERTABLE
          We See all three guns pointed at appropriate crotches. As well
          as Bridget's legs, right besides the Nazi Major's. Her pretty
          gams are sure to be chewed up in the possible crossfire.

          SGT.STIGLITZ
          And at this range, I'm a real
          Fredrick Zoller.

          MAJOR HELLSTROM
          Hummmmm ... Looks like we have a bit
          of a sticky situation here.

          LT. H ICOX
          What's going to happen, Major, is your
          going to stand up, and walk out that
          door with us.

          MAJOR HELLSTROM
          No no no no no no, I don't think so.
          I'm afraid you and I both know, no matter
          what happens to anybody else in this room,
          the two of us aren't going anywhere.

          Too bad about them though. They seem
          like a likeable
          (referring to
          Stiglitz and Wicki)
          You two will have to shoot them.

          BRIDGET
          Then Major, i implore you. For the
          sake of those German troops, will
          you please leave with us?

          MAJOR HELLSTROM
          Oh Bridget, your concern for German
          troops, gets me
          (Pointing at
          his heart)
          .right here. You mean for the sake
          your whore legs, don't you? You can't
          afford to get any bullet holes in them,
          your not finished spreading them for

          The English film critic, commando, picks up the thirty-three

          LT.HICOX
          There's a special rung in hell reserved
          for people who waste good scotch.
          And seeing as I might be rapping on

          to DISSIPATE... The only one in the room left alive, is the
          young German Sgt, with the machine gunn.
          WE HEAR the feet of the soldiers outside, reach the basement
          entrance.
          The door opens...
          , .The German Sgt, sends FIFTY BULLETS in the doors

          No one goes through it.
          What we have here, is a rabbit hole like situation. No one
          inside is getting out, no one outside is getting in.

          Okay, talk!

          GERMAN SGT
          I'm a father! My baby was born today
          in Frankfurt! Five hours ago! His name
          is Max! We were in here drinking and
          celebrating! They're the ones that
          came in shooting and killing!
          It's not my fault!

          What's your name soldier?

          GERMAN SGT

          ALDO'S VOICE(OS)
          Okay Wilhelm... .is anybody alive
          on our side?

          WILHELM
          No!
          We hear a VOICE OFF SCREEN, yell out;

          BRIDGET'S VOICE(OS)
          I'm alive!
          Wilhelm spins in the direction of the voice.

          STILL

          R
          On the floor, with a bullet in her BLOODY LEG, lies the
          alive Bridget Von Hammersmark.
          The German Sgt points the muzzle of the machine gunn at
          the German celebrity; with hate in his eyes.

          ALDO'S VOICE(OS)
          Who's that?

          WILHELM
          (To BRIDGET,

          LOW)
          Make a sound whore, and I spit!
          Meaning the muzzle.

          ALDO'S VOICE(OS)
          Wilhelm, who is that?

          WILHELM
          is the girl on your side?
          Pause.

          ALDO'S VOICE(OS)
          Which girl?

          WILHELM
          (To Bridget
          LOW in GERMAN)
          I thought so. So you run with the
          American's now, huh? Now times are
          bad?

          ALDO'S VOICE(OS)
          Is she okay?

          WILHELM
          (To Bridget
          LOW in GERMAN)
          You despicable traitor.
          (To Aldo)
          She's been shot, but she's alive.
          (To Bridget
          LOW in GERMAN)
          For now.
          We hear The Basterds Curse their luck Off Screen.

          ALDO'S VOICE(OS)
          Okay Wilhelm, what'd ya say we
          make a deal?

          WILHELM
          What's your name?

          ALDO'S VOICE(OS)
          Aldo. Wilhelm, can I call yap Willi?

          WILHELM
          Yes.

          ALDO'S VOICE(OS)
          So Willi, you know we could lob three
          or four or five or six grenades down
          there, and your little war story ends
          here. But good fer you, bad fer her,
          you die, she dies. So what say we
          make a swap?

          WILLI
          Keep talking?

          

          

          

          

          112.

          ALDO'S VOICE(OS)
          Okay, Willi here's my deal! You let
          me and one of my men come down to
          take the girl away! And we take the
          girl, and leave! That simple, Willi!
          You go your way, we go ours! And little
          Max, gets to grow up playing catch with
          his daddy! So what'ya say, Willi, we
          got a deal?
          Willi thinks...
          Bridget watches Willi think...

          WILLI
          Aldo?

          ALDO'S VOICE(OS)
          I'm here Willi!

          WILLI
          I want to trust you.... But howcanI?

          ALDO'S VOICE(OS)
          What choice ya got?

          WILLI
          I could kill the girl!

          ALDO'S VOICE(OS)
          Well now, Willi, that's true enough.
          But something you need to know, so
          you don't get the wrong idea. Ain't
          none of us give a fuck bout that
          girl. But, admittedly, if you kill
          her, it would fuck up our plans. But
          you'll be dead by then anyway, so
          what'd you care? And lets not
          forget that little gatzenjammer
          Max, growin up without a pop. So in
          the spirit of gettin you home to
          him, we got a deal, Willi?

          WILLI
          Okay Aldo, I'm going to trust you!
          Come down, no guns!
          Aldo and Hirschberg come down the stairs, showing open hands.
          Willi keeps his machine gunn trained on them.
          Aldo with his hands up, says;

          A

          

          

          

          

          ALDO
          Hey Willi, what's with the machine
          gunny I thought we had a deal?

          WILLI
          We do have a deal, now git the girl
          and go.

          ALDO
          Not so fast, Willi, we only have a
          deal, we trust each other. A Mexican
          stand off ain't trust.

          WILLI
          You need guns on me for it to be
          a Mexican stand off.

          ALDO
          you got guns on us, you decide to
          shoot, we're dead. Up top, they got
          grenades, they drop 'em down here,
          your dead. That's a Mexican stand
          off, and that wasn't the deal.

          WILLI
          Just take that fucking traitor, and
          go! See? Now your down here
          Now you get tricky - t

          ALDO
          - No tricks!- Ain't nobody gittin
          tricky, Willi; I swear to god, I'm
          too damn dumb toget tricky. But

          (MEANING

          HIRSCHBERG)
          him and I lived upto the deal. We
          came down without guns. Now it's
          your turn. No trust,no deal.
          Willi pointing gunn at them.,,, -thinking...

          ALDO
          i know your scarred. I'm scarred,
          he's scarred, we're all scarred.
          So what's it gonnabe Willi?
          Ether we got a deal, or you might
          as well just shoot us now.
          Willi decides...
          He puts the machine gunn down on the bar.

          

          

          

          

          WILLI
          Fine. Take that fucking traitor and
          get her out of my sight.

          ALDO
          Danka, Willi, danka. okay, Hirschbeg,
          you grab her shoulder -

          WHEN...
          From behind Aldo and Hirschberg, Bridget lifts up Major
          Hellstroms Luger, and EMPTIES the remaining bullets into
          Sgt.Willi, who FALLS to the floor, DEAD.
          Aldo and Hirscberg spin around shocked.

          ALDO
          You fuckin bitch! I had a deal with
          that man!
          From the floor, the bloody, sweaty, and in excoriating pain
          (she'll probably lose that leg), German movie star, says to the
          two American soldier's she's just meeting for the first time;

          BRIDGET
          He was a enemy soldier, who knew who
          I was. He couldn't live.

          3
          Hirscberg loses control, and RICKS the woman on the floor,
          hard in the side.

          HIRSCHBERG
          I ought'a beat your fuckin head in

          ALDO
          Stop it. Just pick her up, and get
          that bitch outta here.

          HIRSCHBERG
          Aldo, she just-

          ALDO
          - She's right.

          HIRSCHBERG
          What?

          ALDO
          I said, she's right. He was a Nazi
          soldier. If he lived, he would doomed
          the mission.

          ELI

          ALDO

          (CON'T)
          Don't mean I like it, don't mean I
          like her, but she's right. Now as
          Willi said, "take this fuckin
          traitor, and get 'er outta my sight".

          Hirschberg, carrying Fraulein Von Hammersmark, and Aldo emerge
          from the bowels of the basement.
          Bridget points at a fancy black sedan, telling them it's her's.

          NOTE:In this entire scene, no French spoken will be SUBTITLED.
          A OLD MAN lies asleep under the covers of his blankets, in his
          bed, in his bedroom...

          WHEN...
          OFF SCREEN the sound of a DOOR BEING KICKED OPEN...
          r .The SOUND of what sounds like EIGHT DOGS BARKING .... and the

          head, shocking, Donny SLAMS the 45. hard against the Old Man's
          scarring, and bringing the old gent to attention.

          SGT.DONOWITZ

          Doctor? Are you a fucking doctor?
          He nods his head, yes.

          Donny YANKS/DRAGS the Old Man out of bed, in his almost
          comical nightshirt (which makes him cuter, thus the brutality
          against him hurts more) towards the door...

          INT - DOCTORS EXAMINING ROOM - NIGHT
          .Into a doctors examining room, built into a French country
          house, with a examining table, and medical instruments.
          However, it's obviously the medical examining room
          of a veterinarian.
          Along the walls are different cages with eight excited BARKING
          dogs in it.
          The Soldiers are putting the shot in the leg, bleeding, and in
          excruciating pain, Bridget on the examining table.
          Donny, still holding on to the Old Man, points in the girls
          direction...

          SGT.DONOWITZ

          SGT.DONOWITZ

          It's still a doctor. If he can get
          a bullet out of a cow, he can get
          a bullet outta you.

          LT.ALDO
          Right now, we just need morphine.
          Donny yells at the Old Man;

          SGT.DONOWITZ
          Morphine! We need morphine!
          The Old Man tries to explain in French, that he's not a human
          doctor...

          WHEN...
          ..Donny takes the 45. and SHOOTS one of the DOGS in the
          cages.
          Everybody jumps.
          Donny SCREAMS at the Old Man;

          SGT.DONOWITZ

          MORPHINE!!!

          BANG
          He SHOOTS another dog...

          SGT.DONOWITZ

          MOREPHINE!!!
          The Old Man begs him to stop, and goes to get the morphine.

          CUT TO
          The BODY of Gestapo Major DEITER HELLSTROM dead on the floor.

          INT - LA LOUISTANE- NIGHT
          Were back in the basement tavern. Colonel Hans Landa stands
          over the corpse. He moves over to the next corpse, a smile
          breaks out on his face.
          He says in GERMAN SUBTITLED into ENGLISH;

          COL.LANDA
          Ahhh Hugo, you've moved up in the
          world I see. Lieutenant. And with
          your record of insubordination.
          Truly remarkable.

          .name is Weiheim Wicki. Bets
          Austrian born jew, who immigrated
          to the United States when things
          began turning sour for the Israelites.
          They are the two German born members of
          The Basterds. They've been known
          to don german uniforms, to ambush squads.

          FLASH ON
          Three Nazi Soldiers walking towards a company of other German
          Soldiers. The Three Soldiers backs are to us. Dried bloody
          bullet holes cover the backs of the three uniforms.
          The SGT of the German company, yells to the trio;

          SGT.GERMAN COMPANY
          What brings you all the way out here?
          The TRIO MOW DOWN the GERMAN COMPANY with their machine gunns.

          COL LANDA
          But that doesnt look like this.
          This is odd.
          Looking down he see's something...
          .bending down, he examines fraulein von Hammersmarks two
          pretty dress shoes lying on the floor.
          One shoe is covered in blood.
          The other, while blood speckled, is fairly clean.
          Picking up the clean shoe, and holding it in his hand.

          COL.LANDA
          It would appear somebodies missing.
          Somebody fashionable.
          A OFF SCREEN SOLDIER'S VOICE cries out;

          SOLDIERS VOICE(OS)
          Col, this ones still alive!
          We follow Hans to the spot on the floor where Sgt.Willi lies.
          He's shot in the chest, but it looks like Max's daddy is still
          alive.

          INT - EXAMINING ROOM -ÃÂ° NIGHT
          Bridget on the examining table, post morphine shot.
          The other Basterds in the room watch Aldo interrogate the
          German lady.

          LT.ALDO
          Now 'fore we yank that slug outta ya,
          you need to answer a few questions

          BRIDGET
          Few questions about what?

          LT.ALDO
          About I got three men dead back there,
          and why don't you try tellin us what
          the fuck happened?

          BRIDGET
          The British officer blew his German
          act, and a Gestapo Major saw it.

          LT.ALDO
          'fore we get into who shot John,
          why did you invite my men to a
          rendez-vous in a basement with a bunch
          of Nazis?

          BRIDGET
          I can see, since you didn't see
          what happened inside, the Nazi's
          being there must look odd.

          LT.ALDO
          Yeah, we gotta word for that kinda
          odd in English, it's called,
          suspicious.

          BRI DGET
          Don't let your imagination get the
          better of you, Lieutenant. You met
          the sergeant, Willi. He had a baby
          tonight. His commanding officer gave
          him and his friends the night off to
          celebrate. The Germans being there
          was just a tragic coincidence.
          Aldo thinks for a moment...

          LT. ALDO
          Okay, I'll buy that. He was ether
          there with his men waiting for us,
          or he was there celebrating his
          sons birthday, he wasn't doin both.

          

          

          

          

          120.

          LT.ALDO
          How did the shootin start?

          BRIDGET
          The English man, gave himself away.

          LT. ALDO
          How did he do that?

          BRIDGET
          He ordered three glasses.
          She holds up three fingers, index to pinky.

          BRIDGET
          We order, three glasses.
          She holds up three fingers, thumb to index.

          BRIDGET
          That's the German three. The other
          is odd. Germans would, and did notice it.

          LT. ALDO
          Okay, let's pretend there were no
          Germans, and everything went exactly
          the way it was suppose to. What would
          of been the next step?

          BRIDGET
          Tuxedos. To get them into the
          premiere, wearing military uniforms,
          with all the military there, would
          of been suicide. But going as
          members of the German film industry,
          they wear tuxedos, and blend in with
          everybody else. I arranged a tailor
          to fit three tuxedos tonight.

          LT.ALDO
          How did you intend to get them into
          the premiere?

          BRIDGET
          Hand me my purse.
          They do. And she opens it, and takes out three tickets to the
          film premiere.

          BRIDGET
          Lt.Hicox was going as my escort.
          The other two were going as a German
          cameraman and his assistant.

          

          

          

          

          INN ÃÂ®

          LT. ALDO
          Can you still get us in that
          premiere?

          BRIDGET
          Can you speak German better then your
          friends, no. Have I been shot, yes.
          I don't see me tripping the light
          fantastique up the red carpet any
          time soon. Least of all by tomorrow
          night.

          (PAUSE)
          However, there's something you don't
          know. There's been two recent
          developments regarding Operation
          Kino. One, the venue has been
          changed from The Ritz, to a much
          smaller venue.

          LT.ALDO
          Enormous changes at the last minute?
          That's not very Germatic. Why the
          hell is Goebbels doin stuff so damn
          peculiar?

          BRIDGET
          It probably has something to do with
          the second development.

          LT. ALDO
          Which is?

          FLASH ON
          IN A PRIVATE DINNING ROOM IN GERMANY, The FUHRER, aka Adolph
          Hitler, aka Adolph Shicklegroover, aka The Bohemian Corporal,
          having dinner with Goebbels, only a few short days ago.
          The FUHRER

          (GERMAN)
          I've been rethinking my position in
          regards to your Paris premiere of
          "Nations Pride". As the weeks have
          gone on, and the Americans are on
          the beach, I do find myself thinking
          more and more about this Private
          Zoller. This boy has done something
          tremendous for us. And I'm beginning
          to think my participation in this
          event could be meaningful.

          BACK TO BRIDGET

          BRIDGET
          The Fuhrer's attending the premiere.

          

          

          

          

          1 2 Z.
          Donny breaks the teams silence;

          SGT.DONOWITZ
          What?

          LT.ALDO
          When the hell did this happen?

          BRIDGET
          The venue change, two weeks ago.
          The Fuhrer's attendance, four days
          ago.

          LT. ALDO
          And how come London don't know
          nothing about that?

          BRIDGET
          We need to get something straight,
          once and for all. Everything London
          knows, it learned from me. If I
          don't know, London doesn't know.
          So now, this is me, informing you,
          Hitler's coming to Paris.

          SGT.DONOWITZ

          FUCK A DUCK?
          Aldo stands up from the chair, pacing as he takes in this new
          information.

          BRIDGET
          What are you thinking?

          LT.ALDO
          I'm thinking getting a wack at
          plantin ole Uncle Adolph makes
          this a horse of a different color.

          BRIDGET
          What's that suppose to mean?

          LT.ALDO
          It means, your gettin us in that
          premiere.

          BRIDGET
          I'm going to probably end up losing
          this leg, bye bye acting career,
          fun while it lasted. How do you
          expect me to walk up a red carpet?

          

          

          

          

          X73

          LT.ALDO
          The doggie docs gonna dig that slug
          outta your gam. Then he's gonna wrap
          it up in a cast, and you gotta good
          how I broke my leg mountain climbing
          story. That's German, ain't it?
          Y'all like climbin mountains,
          don'tch?

          BRIDGET
          I don't. I like smoking, drinking,
          and ordering in restaurants, but I
          see your point.

          LT. ALDO
          We fill ya up with morphine, till
          it's comin out ya ears. Then just
          limp your little ass up that
          rouge car-pet.

          BRIDGET
          Splendid. When the Nazi's put me up
          against a wall, it won't hurt
          so much.
          (Changing tone)
          I know this is a silly question
          before I ask it, but can you
          American's speak any other language
          then English?

          HIRSCHBERG
          Other then Yiddish?

          BRIDGET
          Preferably.
          Donny referring to Aldo and himself.

          SGT.DONOWITZ
          We both speak alittle Italian.

          BRIDGET
          With a atrocious accent, no doubt.
          But that doesn't exactly kill us
          in the crib. Germans don't have a
          good ear for Italian. So you mumble
          Italian, and brazen through it, is
          that the plan?

          LT. ALDO
          That's about it.

          

          

          

          

          BRIDGET
          That sounds good.

          LT. ALDO
          it sounds like shit, but what else
          we gonna do, go home?

          BRIDGET
          No, it's good. If you don't blow it,
          with that, I can get you in the
          building.
          (Change tone)
          So, who does what?

          LT.ALDO
          Well I speak the most Italian, so
          I'll be your escort. Donowitz speaks
          the second most, so he'll be your
          Italian cameraman. And Hirschberg
          third most, so he'll be Donnys
          assistant.

          HIRSCHBERG
          I don't speak Italian.

          LT. ALDO
          Like I said, third best. Just keep
          your fuckin mouth shut. In fact why
          don't you start practising, right now.

          BRIDGET
          (Meaning Utivich)
          What about the little one?

          UTIVICH
          Do you mean me?

          BRIDGET
          I didn't mean any offence.

          UTIVICH
          None taken you German cunt.

          LT.ALDO
          Utivich is the chauffeur.

          UTIVICH
          I can't drive.
          Bridget SCREAMS in frustration;

          BRIDGET
          You Americans are fucking useless!

          

          

          

          

          UTIVICH
          IVGimmie a break, I'm from Manhattan.

          LT.ALDO
          No worries, son. We got over fourteen
          hours before the movie tomorrow.
          More then enough time for you to learn
          to drive.

          UTIVICH
          NO no no no, Lieutenant, it's not!

          LT.ALDO
          Oh yes yes yes yes, Private, it is.
          And yes yes yes yes, you will.
          (Changes tone)
          Look Utivich, you and I both know,
          if we went to grade school together,
          you damn sure ain't copyin off of my
          test. Well I lern't to drive in four
          hours on a Tennessee mountain road.
          And I'm a shit for brains coal miner
          bootlegger. Hirschberg, you know how
          to drive, right?

          HIRSCHBERG
          Yes.

          LT.ALDO
          Teach 'em.

          BRIDGET
          But there is a problem. I'm a movie
          star. This is a movie premiere.
          I can't show up looking like I was
          just in a Nazi gun fight. Now I
          have a dress for the premiere at my
          hotel. But sometime tomorrow, I
          have to get my hair done.
          All The Basterds, except Donny, burst out laughing.

          LT. ALDO
          Sister, you must got wunderbar luck.
          Guess who went to beauty school?

          "REVENGE OF THE GIANT FACE"

           FADE OFF

          INT - SHOSANNAS AND MARCELS LIVING QUARTERS - NIGHT
          We're in Shosannas and Marcels living quarters, above the
          cinema. We've never been in here before.

          A SUBTITLE APPEARS ON SCREEN:

          NIGHT OF "NATION'S PRIDE" PREMIERE
          She's standing before a full length mirror, in a real
          attractive Forties style dress for the premiere. She's stunning.
          This is the first time in her life she's had the opportunity,
          or the occasion to wear something like this. Since she knows
          this is the last night of her life, no time like the present.
          SOUNDS of the hub-bub of the premiere, not to mention the
          German brass band that's blaring Third Reich Marches, can be
          heard coming from below.
          Shosanna walks to her apartment window, and looks down at the
          Germatic miasma below.
          SHOSANNAS POV: WE SEE all the pageantry below. Tons of
          SPECTATORS. Tons of guests dressed in Nazi uniforms, tuxedos,
          and female finery, walking up the long red carpet(with a big
          Swastika in the middle, naturally) leading into Shosannas
          cinema. The German brass band omm-pa-pa-ing away. German Radio
          and Film crews covering the event for the fatherland back
          home. And of course, MANY GERMAN SOLDIERS providing security
          for this joyous Germatic occasion.
          Shosanna COUGHS up a lugi, and HOCKS it.
          A GERMAN S.S. GENERAL, being interviewed by a RADIO COMMENTATOR,
          the lugi HITS him right on his bald head.
          Shosanna goes back to the full length mirror, places a very
          fashionable Forties style hat on her head, then lowers the
          period style black fish net veil over her face. She takes out
          a small GUN, and puts it in the pocket of her dress., and it's
          on. She exits the apartment door, to join the premiere.
          From this point on, there's no turning back, it's all the way
          baby, all the fucking way!

          through a door that puts her next to the projection booth
          door. She takes out a key and opens it.

          INT - PROJECTION BOOTH - NIGHT
          Marcels prepping the film reels for tonight. The five silver

          out. The cans for reels one and two are empty. Cans for reel
          three, our specially marked can for reel four, and can for
          reel five(which should never see the light of a projector)
          lie in wait.
          Shosanna, looking like a Forties movie star, enters the
          projection booth.
          The scene in FRENCH SUBTITLED in ENGLISH;

          MARCEL
          Ooh lala, Danielle Darrieux, this
          is so exciting. Pleased to meet you.

          SHOSANNA
          Shut up fool.
          Marcel lifts up the veil covering her face, and their lips
          meet.

          SHOSANNA
          Cheeky black bugger. I have to go
          down and socialize with these Hun
          pigs. Let's go over it again?

          MARCEL
          Reel one is on the first projector.
          Reel two is on the second. Three
          and four are ready to go.

          SHOSANNA
          Okay, the big sniper battle in the
          film begins around the middle of
          the third reel. Our film, comes on
          in the forth reel, so Somewhere
          towards the end of the third reel,
          go down and lock the doors of the
          auditorium. Then take your place
          behind the screen, and wait for my
          CUE, when I give it to you, BURN IT DOWN!

          INT - CINEMA LOBBY - NIGHT
          The pageantry of the evening is in full swing, as all the
          German beautiful people, enter the cinema. They mingle in the
          swastika covered, greek nude statue peppered lobby. Nazi
          Military Commanders, High Ranking Party Officials, and German
          Celebrities(Emil tannings, Veit Harlin), hob knob and drink
          Champagne from passing WAITERS who carry glasses on silver
          trays.
          We see Shosanna enter from the area at the top of the big
          staircase in the lobby that overlooks the lobby parlor
          entrance. She descends the staircase, and busies herself with
          theatre stuff.
          At the top of the staircase, looking down at the master race
          in all there finery, is Colonel Hans Landa, dressed in his
          finest SS Uniform, smoking on his Calabash.

          CAMERA FRAME
          directly behind him. On the right side, we see the figure of
          Col.Landa, from behind, watching the guests entering the
          cinema. On the left side of frame, is the cinema entrance,
          from a looking down perspective of the guests entering the
          building.

          THEN...
          .A THINK BUBBLE, like in a comic book, appears on the left
          side of frame, obscuring the cinema entrance. Inside of Landas
          think bubble, a little scene plays out.

          THINK BUBBLE
          Inside a hospital room filled with DOCTORS, NURSES, and a
          PATIENT in a hospital bed. Then Col.Landa enters the room, and
          screams at everybody;

          COL.LANDA
          I want everybody out of this room!
          They start to leave.

          COL.LANDA
          That means now, goddamnit!
          They RUSH OUT.
          He walks over to the Patient in the hospital bed, Its none
          other then SGT.WILLI, and yes, he's still alive.
          Landa pulls up a chair next to the bed, sits down.

          COL.LANDA
          Can you speak, Sgt?

          

          

          

          

          L - )1.

          SGT.WILLI

          (WEAKLY)
          Yes Colonel.

          COL.LANDA
          Tell me everything that happened in
          there?
          The THINK BUBBLE DISSOLVES away, reveling the entrance again,
          and as if on perfect cue, in walks Bridget Von Hammersmark,
          dressed lovely, leg in a big white cast. The three basterds in
          their tuxedos, flank her.

          CU COL.LANDA
          smiles.
          He descends the stairs, towards the four saboteurs...
          They speak in GERMAN, SUBTITLED in ENGLISH;

          COL.LANDA
          Fraulein Von Hammersmark, what
          has befallen Germany's most elegant
          swan?

          BRIDGET
          Colonel Landa, it's been years.
          Dashing as ever I see.

          COL.LANDA
          Flattery will get you everywhere,
          fraulein.
          They chuckle, and air kiss.

          COL.LANDA
          So what's happened to your lovely
          leg, a by product of kicking ass in
          the German cinema, no doubt.

          BRIDGET
          Save your flattery, you old dog.
          I know too many of your former
          conquests, to fall into that honey
          pot.
          Chuckle-chuckle...

          COL.LANDA
          Seriously, what happened?

          

          

          

          

          130.

          BRIDGET
          Well, I tried my hand, foolishly I
          might add, at mountain climbing.
          And this was the result.

          COL.LANDA
          Mountain climbing? That's how you
          injured your leg, mountain climbing?

          BRIDGET
          Believe it or not, yes it is.
          A brief moment passes between the two...

          THEN...
          The Colonel BURSTS OUT with UPROARIOUS LAUGHTER. So uproarious
          in fact, that it's quite disconcerting to the four saboteurs.
          The Colonel begins to regain his composure...

          COL.LANDA
          Forgive me, fraulein. I don't mean
          laugh at your misfortune. It's just
          .mountain climbing? I'm curious
          fraulein, what could of ever
          compelled you to undertake such a
          foolhardy endeavor?
          The Double meaning is not lost on the German actress.

          BRIDGET
          Well, I chant be doing it again,
          I can tell you that.

          COL.LANDA
          That cast looks as fresh as my old
          Uncle Gustave, when were you climbing
          this mountain, last night?

          BRIDGET
          Very good eye, Colonel. It happened
          yesterday morning.

          COL.LANDA
          Hummm. And where exactly in Paris
          is this mountain?
          This stops her for a seconded.
          Then Landa laughs it off, taking them off the hook.

          

          

          

          

          13[.

          COL.LANDA
          I'm just teasing you, fraulein. You
          know me, I tease rough. So who are
          your three handsome escorts?

          BRIDGET
          I'm afraid neither three speak a
          word of German. Their friends of
          mine from Italy. This is a wonderful
          Italian stuntman, Antonio Margheriti.
          (Meaning Aldo)
          A very talented cameraman, Enzo Gorlomi.
          (Meaning Donny)
          And Enzo's camera assistant, Dominick
          Decocco.
          The German fraulein turns to the three tuxedo wearing
          Basterds.

          BRIDGET

          (ITALIAN)
          Gentlemen, this is a old friend, Col.
          Sans Landa of the S.S.
          The Basterds know only too well who Landa the Jew Hunter is,
          but they can't show it.

          LT.ALDO

          COL.LANDA
          Margheriti...?

          (ITALIAN)
          Am I saying it correctly...?
          .Margheriti?

          LT. ALDO

          Yes. Correct.

          COL.LANDA

          (FRENCH)

          Turning his gaze to Donny.

          COL.LANDA

          (ITALIAN)
          What's your name again?

          SGT.DONOWITZ

          COL.LANDA

          (ITALIAN)
          One more time, but let me really
          hear the music in it.

          SGT.DONOWITZ

          (HAMMY ITALIAN)
          Gorlomi.
          Now to Hirschberg...

          COL.LANDA

          (ITALIAN)
          And you?
          Then Hischberg breaks out the best Italian accent of the

          GROUP;

          COL.LANDA

          BRIDGET

          (GERMAN)
          Well, my two cameraman friends need
          to find there seats.
          Col.Landa stops a WAITER with a tray of champagne glasses.

          COL.LANDA

          (GERMAN)
          Not so fast, lets enjoy some champagne.
          Everyone gets a glass.

          COL.LANDA

          (FRENCH)
          - Oh, Mademoiselle Mimieux, please
          join us, I have some friends I'd
          like you to meet.
          Shosanna joins the circle, and is handed a champagne glass.
          This is the first moment The Basterds are aware of Shosanna.

          COL.LANDA

          (FRENCH)
          May I say Mademoiselle, you look
          divine.

          SHOSANNA

          (FRENCH)
          Merci'.

          COL.LANDA

          (GERMAN)
          This lovely young lady, is Mademoiselle
          Emmanuelle Mimieux, this is her cinema,
          and she is our hostess for the evening.

          (FRENCH)
          And Mademoiselle, this battered, broken,
          and none worse for the wear German
          goddess, is Bridget Von Hammersmark.

          

          

          

          

          1 3 W.

          BRIDGET

          SHOSANNA
          Bon jour.

          BRIDGET

          (FRENCH)
          I'm afraid my companions don't speak
          any French, there Italian. This is
          Antonino, Enzo, and Dominick.
          All three smile goofy spaghetti bender smiles.

          COL.LANDA

          (FRENCH)
          Actually fraulein Von Hammersmarks
          Italian associates, need help finding
          there seats. Perhaps Mademoiselle
          Mimieux would be so kind to escort
          them?

          SHOSANNA

          (FRENCH)
          It would be my pleasure. Let me see
          your tickets?
          Donny hands her two tickets. She indicates for them to follow her.
          Donny and Hirschberg both exchange one last look with Aldo,
          then follow the young french girl into the auditorium.

          INT - AUDITORIUM - NIGHT
          The cinema auditorium is filling up quickly with grey and black
          uniforms.
          Shosanna finds the two counterfeit Italians their seats.
          After she points out their seats, she turns to leave...
          Hirschberg...
          .reaches out and grabs her wrist.
          He looks her in the face, and filled with tremendous guilt,
          because if he's successful tonight he's going to blow this
          cute French girl to smithereens, he says;

          HIRSCHBERG
          Grazie.

          

          

          

          
          13r.
          The cute French Girl looks back at the goofy looking Italian
          boy with slicked back hair, that makes him look kind of
          Jewish, with tremendous guilt, knowing if she is successful
          tonight, she's going to burn him alive, and says;

          SHOSANNA
          Prego.

          BACK TO LOBBY
          They begin flicking the lights on and off. A GERMAN SOLDIER
          YELLS in GERMAN in the lobby;

          GERMAN SOLDIER
          Take your seats! The show is about to
          begin! Everybody take your seatsl
          Col.Landa, Lt.Aldo, and Bridget are still together.

          COL.LANDA

          (GERMAN)
          I must call The Fuhrer. He doesn't
          want to make his entrance untill
          everybody seated. Come with me Frau
          Von Hammersmark. The Fuhrer has
          heard your here, and he wishes to
          commend you personally.

          BRIDGET

          (GERMAN)
          Me? Why?

          COL.LANDA

          (GERMAN)
          Don't be modest. Everybody is quite
          taken with your resolve. A accident,
          like you've just experienced, and
          yet you still show up to to a
          important Party event. The Fuhrer
          was quite adamant in his gratitude.
          We'll use Mademoiselle Mimieux's office.
          (To Aldo
          in Italian)
          I'm afraid I must rob you of your
          companion, but only for a moment.

          BRIDGET

          (ITALIAN)
          Yes, apparently The Fuhrer wishes
          to commend me.

          Wait here a moment. I promise I won't
          detain her long.
          What are ether of them suppose to do, argue?
          Col.Landa goes over to one of the Nazi GAURD/USHER, and
          whispers in his ear, gesturing toward Aldo. Like he's saying,
          leave the boy alone, till we come back... .Or is he?
          Col.Landa limps Bridget away towards Shosannas office.
          As Aldo stands in the lobby, more and more people enter the
          auditorium, till it's only Aldo and the six Nazi Gaurd/Ushers
          in the now vacant lobby.

          INT - SHOSANNA'S OFFICE - NIGHT
          Shosanna's cinema manager office. It's small, cluttered, and
          dominated by a desk.
          They both enter.
          Col.Landa closes the door behind him, and LOCKS IT.
          Bridget notices, but says nothing.
          Now the two Germans are alone.

          COL.LANDA
          Have a seat fraulein.
          Pointing at one lone chair in front of the desk.
          She lowers herself in the chair.
          Instead of moving around to the other side of the desk,
          opposite her. The SS Colonel pulls another little chair over,
          and places it in front of the fraulein.
          He sits. Their knees almost touching.
          The colonel points to the foot not in the cast.

          COL.LANDA

          (GERMAN)
          Let me see your foot.

          BRIDGET

          (GERMAN)
          I beg your pardon?

          

          

          

          

          1 31
          Patting his lap.

          COL.LANDA
          Put your foot in my lap.

          BRIDGET
          Colonel, you embarrass me.

          COL.LANDA
          I assure you fraulein, my intention
          is not to flirt.
          Patting his lap more with more aggression.
          The nervous fraulein, lifts up her strapy dress shoe enclosed
          foot, and places it in the Colonel's lap.
          The Colonel, very delicately, unfastens the thin straps that
          hold the frauleins shoe on her foot...
          .He removes the shoe...
          .Leaving only the frauleins bare foot...

          THEN...
          He removes from his heavy SS coat pocket, the pretty dress shoe
          the fraulein left behind at La Louisiane...
          He slips it on her foot...
          .it fits like a glove.
          Bridget knows she's BUSTED.
          Col.Landa smiles and says in ENGLISH;

          COL.LANDA
          What's that American expression...
          "if the shoe fits...you must wear it".
          He removes her foot from his lap.

          BRIDGET

          What now Colonel?

          COL LANDA

          "Resist to your last breath"?

          SUDDENLY...
          Hans LUNGES forward, putting his strong mitts around Bridget
          Von Hammersmarks lily white delicate neck, and with all the
          violence of a Lion in mid-pounce, SQUEEZES with all his MIGHT.
          Bridgets face turns tomato RED, as the VEINS in her face
          BULGE, and her esophagus is CRUSHED in his GRIP.
          With a violent YANK, he JERKS her TO THE FLOOR. She TUMBLES
          out of the chair, Landa never releasing his GRIP around her
          throat. Nov fully on top of her, he BEARS DOWN, SQUEEZING THE
          VERY LIFE OUT OF HER. Every thing he has, he brings to bear on
          the elegant ladies neck.
          Then, to finally finish her off, he begins BANGING THE BACK OF

          HER HEAD, HARD AGAINST THE FLOOR...

          BANG!

          BANG!

          BANG?
          She's dead.
          He releases the grip around her throat. His hands are

          TREMBLING...
          He rises.
          Strangling the very life out of somebody with your bear hands,
          is the most violent act a human being can commit.
          Also, only humans strangle, the opposable thumbs being quite
          important part of the endeavor. As Hans Landa stands, the
          sheer violence he had to call on to accomplish this task,
          still surges through him. He tries to gain control of the
          trembling, that is rippling through his body. He takes out a
          silver SS FLASK(filled with peach schnapps), and knocks back
          a couple of swigs. He holds his hand out in front of him. The
          TREMBLING is beginning to subside. He picks up the telephone.

          

          

          

          

          139-
          Into the phone in German he says;

          COL.LANDA
          Inform The Fuhrer the audience has
          taken there seats, and we're ready
          to begin.
          Step one, in Hans master plan, done.
          He then dials another number...

          INT - LOBBY - NIGHT
          Aldo in the lobby...

          WHEN...
          .he's JUMPED by the SIX NAZI USHERS...
          He's THROWN ROUGHLY to the ground face first. Like the modern
          day Secret Service, within seconds, his wrists are handcuffed
          behind his back, he's searched, they find the BOMB attached to
          his ankle, it's removed, a BLACK CLOTH BAG is pulled over his
          head, then he's hoisted up, and RUSHED out of the building.
          This happens in mere seconds, and quietly too, no one in the
          auditorium is none the wiser...

          INT - AUDITORIUM - NIGHT
          ,including Donowitz and Hirschberg, sitting amongst the
          master race, waiting for showtime.

          EXT - CINEMA - NIGHT
          The Six Nazi Soldiers, hustle the hooded Aldo, down the red
          carpet, then into the alley besides the cinema.
          Aldo's put up against a wall.
          Inside the black hood, he's SCREAMING every insulting thing
          about Germany, Germans, German food, German
          shepherd... anything.

          COL.LANDA'S VOICE(OS)
          Shut up!
          The faceless black hood does.
          Col.Landa, now standing directly in front of his hooded
          prisoner, says in ENGLISH;

          COL.LANDA
          As Stanley said to Livingston;
          Lt.Aldo Raine, I presume?

          

          

          

          
          I 'to.

          LT. ALDO
          Hans Landa?

          COL.LANDA
          You've had a nice long run, Aldo.
          Alas, your now in the hands of the
          SS. My hands to be exact. And they've
          been waiting along time, to touch you.
          He reaches out with his finger, and lightly touches Aldo's
          face right in the middle of the hood.
          Aldo's head VIOLENTLY FLINCHES.

          COL.LANDA
          Caught ya flinching.
          In German, he orders the men put Aldo in the back of a truck.
          Aldo, bound, and bagged, is put in the truck. Also in the
          truck is Utivich, wearing a makeshift chauffeurs uniform,
          bound, and bagged like the Lieutenant.
          The Truck drives off.
          Col.Landa turns around, and SEES FROM A DISTANCE, Hitlers
          motorcade pull up to the cinema.. Then the Fuhrer, Goebbels,
          Francesca, and the rest of the entourage, make there way down
          the red carpet into the cinema.
          Landa smiles.

          EXT TRUCK (MOVING) - NIGHT
          We see the truck leaving the city of Paris, under the veil of
          night.
          We also seem to be leaving the drama of Operation Kino.

          INT - TRUCK(MOVING) - NIGHT
          The two hooded prisoners, bounce along in the back of the
          truck.
          Utivich, is crying inside his hood.

          LT.ALDO
          Utivich?

          UTIVICH
          Is that you Lieutenant?

          LT. ALDO
          Yep.

          

          

          

          
          lyl.

          UTIVIC}I
          Do you know what happened to Donny?
          Hirchberg? The woman?

          LT.ALDO
          No I do not.

          UTIVICH
          Lieutenant, sorry I'm crying.

          LT. ALDO
          Nothin to be sorry about, son.
          This bag, get to anyone.

          UTIVICH
          Not exactly John Wayne, am I?

          LT.ALDO
          John Waynes a pampered movie star.
          He burst into tears, if his cook,
          busts his yoke at breakfast. Just
          try puttin a bag over his head, and
          hear what kinda sounds he makes.
          Utivich, giggles through the tears.

          LT.ALDO
          I just want you to know, son, I was
          real proud of you tonight. Learnin
          how to drive overnight. Driving in
          that Limo line. You was in the hot
          seat, son, and you stood up real good.
          Utivich Cries LOUDER.
          Aldo takes his foot, finds Utivichs foot, and places his foot
          on top.
          The TOUCH has a slight calming effect on Utivich.
          In the darkness, Utivich has reclaimed his dignity.

          EXT- COUNTRY TAVERN - NIGHT
          The truck pulls up to a small tavern outside of Paris(not La
          Louisaiane),
          The two hooded prisoners, are walked inside the establishment.

           INT - COUNTRY TAVERN - NIGHT
          The hooded men are lead into the closed for business, but open
          for something else, rustic tavern.

          

          

          

          
          0The Nazi Guards, unlock the handcuff, then sit them down inchairs.
          Then, simultaneously, the hoods are YANKED OFF.
          The two prisoners, are seated at a table, in what they can now
          see, is a rustic tavern. On the table is one telephone, one
          bottle of Chianti, and three glasses. And on the opposite end
          of the table, sits Colonel Hans Landa.
          A NAZI SOLDIER sits posted at  a impressive looking two way
          radio set up in the tavern.
          Colonel Lands starts in right away at the two baffled,
          discombobulated American soldiers.
          They will only speak ENGLISH in the scene.

          COL.LANDA
          Italian? Really?

          (BEAT)
          What could you have possibly been
          thinking?

          LT. ALDO
          Well, I speak alittle Italian -

          COL.LANDA
          I speak a little Tagalog, but I
          wouldn't begin to presume I could
          pass for Filipino. Don't get me
          wrong, I understand you were in a
          pickle, what with you losing your
          Germans. And I have nothing but
          admiration for improvisation.
          Still.... Chico Marx is more
          convincing. if the three of you had
          shown up to the premiere dressed
          in womans attire, it would have been
          more convincing.
          Landas eyes go to the Two Nazi Guards behind the prisoners.

          (GERMAN)
          You may leave us. But stay alert
          outside.
          They exit, leaving the Colonel, the Lieutenant, the
          Private and a German Radio Man in the corner.

          

          

          

          

          "43'

          COL.LANDA
          So your Aldo the Apache?

          LT. ALDO
          So your The Jew Hunter?

          COL.LANDA
          Jew Hunter, (pfuit), I'm a detective.
          A damn good detective. Finding
          people is my specialty. So naturally,
          I worked for the Nazi's finding people.
          And yes, some of them were Jews.
          But Jew Hunter? Just the name that stuck.

          UTIVICH
          Well you do hafts admit, it is
          catchy.

          COL.LANDA
          Do you control the nicknames, your
          enemies bestow on you? Aldo the
          Apache and The Little Man?

          UTIVICH
          What do you mean, The Little Man?

          COL.LANDA
          The Germans nickname for you.

          UTIVICH
          The Germans nickname for me is, The
          Little Man?

          COL.LANDA
          Or "The Little One, ether one means you.
          And as if to make my point, I'm
          a little surprised how tall you
          were in real life. I mean, your a
          little fellow. But not circus midget
          little, as your reputation would
          suggest.

          LT.ALDO
          Where is my men? Where is Bridget
          Von Hammersmark?

          COL.LANDA
          Bridget Von Hammersmark. Oh I'm sure
          she's in whatever, big bubbling
          cesspool in hell, the devil reserves
          for traitors of her ilk.

          

          

          

          

          COL. LANDA

          (COR'T)
          Well, lets just say, she got what
          she deserved. And when you purchase
          friends like Bridget Von Hammersmark,
          you get what you pay for.
          Now as far as your Pisanos,
          Sgt.Donowitz, and Pt.Hirschberg-

          LT. ALDO
          How do you know our names?

          COL.LANDA
          Lt.Aldo, if you don't think I wouldn't
          interrogate every single one of your
          swastika marked survivors... .?
          We simply aren't operating on the
          level of mutual respect I assumed.
          Now, back to the whereabouts of your
          two Italian saboteurs. At this
          moment, both Hirschberg, and
          Donowitz, should be sitting in the
          very seats we left them in. Seats,
          0023 and 0024, if my memory serves.
          Explosives, still around
          there ankle, still ready to
          explode. And your mission, some
          would call a terrorist plot, as of
          this moment, is still a go.
          The two Basterds don't believe this. It can't be true.

          LT. ALDO
          That's a pretty exciting story.
          What's next, Eliza on the ice?

          COL.LANDA
          However, all I have to do, is pick
          pick up that phone right there.
          Inform the cinema, and your plans
          kupet.

          LT. ALDO
          IF, their still there, and IF their
          still alive, and that's one big IF,
          there ain't no way, you gonna take
          them boys without settin off them
          bombs.

          

          

          

          

          I R.T.

          COL.LANDA

          M
          I have no doubt, and yes, some
          Germans will die., and yes, it will
          ruin the evening, and yes, Goebbels
          will be very very very mad at you
          for what you've done to his big night.
          But you won't get Hitler, you won't
          get Goebbels, you won't get Gering,
          and you won't get Boorman. And you
          need all four to end the war.

          (PAUSE)
          But if I don't pick up that phone,
          right there, you may very well get
          all four. And if you get all four,
          you end the war...tonight.
          The Nazi Colonel lifts up the bottle of Chianti, and fills
          three glasses. As he pours, he says;

          COL.LANDA
          So gentlemen, lets discuss the
          prospect of ending the war-tonight.
          All three have their Chianti filled glasses.

          COL.LANDA
          So the way I see it, since Hitlers
          death, or possible rescue, rests
          solely on my reaction...If I do
          nothing ...it's as if I'm causing his
          death, even more then yourselves.
          Would you agree?

          LT. ALDO
          I guess so.

          COL.LANDA
          How about you Uitivich?

          UITIVICH
          I guess so too.

          COL.LANDA
          Good, we more or less, all agree.
          Gentlemen, I have no intention, of
          Killing Hitler, and killing Goebbels,
          and Killing Gerring, and killing
          Boorman, not to mention winning the
          war single handedly for the allies,
          only later, to find myself standing
          before a Jewish tribunal.

          

          

          

          
          I q
          Now they get it.

          COL.LANDA
          If you want to win the war, tonight,
          We have to make a deal.

          LT.ALDO
          What kinda deal?

          COL.LANDA
          The kind you wouldn't have the
          authority to make. However, I'm sure
          this mission of yours, has a
          commanding officer? A General, I'm
          betting. For ..

          (THINKING)
          .O.S.S. would be my guess.
          Aldo's eyebrows reveal that was a good guess.

          COL.LANDA
          Oooh, that's a bingo. Is that the
          way you say it, That's a bingo?

          LT.ALDO
          You just say, bingo.

          COL.LANDA
          Bingo! How fun. But I digress, where
          were we? Oh yes, make a deal. Over
          there is a very capable two way
          radio. And sitting behind it, is a
          more then capable radio operator,
          named Herrman. Get me somebody on
          the other end of that radio with the
          power of the pen, to authorize my
          - Let's call it, the terms of my
          conditional surrender, if that taste
          better going down.

          Landa, with radio headphones over his ears, and a microphone
          in his hand, talks to the UNSEEN/UNHEARD American Brass on the
          other end.

          COL.LANDA
          .So, when the military history of
          this night is written, it will be
          recorded, that I was part of
          "Operation Rino" from the very
          beginning, as a double agent.
          Anything I've done in my guise as a
          SS Colonel, was sanctioned by The
          O.S.S., as a necessary evil to
          establish my cover with The Germans.
          And it was my placement, of
          Lt.Raines dynamite in Hitler and
          Goebbels opera box that assured
          there demise. By the way, that last
          part is actually true.

          FLASH ON

          BACK TO LANDA

          COL.LANDA
          I want my full military pension and
          benefits under my proper rank.
          I want to receive the congregational
          medal of honor, for my invaluable
          assistance in the toppling of the Third
          Reich.

          

          

          

          
          He looks over and sees Aldo and Uitvich watching the one sided
          conversation.

          COL.LANDA
          In fact, I want all the members of
          "Operation Kino" to receive the
          congregational medal of honor. Full
          citizenship for myself - but that
          goes without saying. And I would
          like the United States of America to
          purchase property for me on
          Nantuckett island, as a reward for
          all the countless lives I've saved
          by bringing the tyranny of the
          National Socialist party to a

          (PAUSE)
          He's right here.
          The Colonel hands the headphones and microphone to Aldo.

          LT.ALDO
          Yes, sir?
          We HEAR the VOICE on the other end of the radio, give Aldo his

          ORDERS;

          RADIO VOICE(OS)
          Colonel Landa will put you and
          Private Uitivich in a truck as
          prisoners. Then he and his radio
          operator, will get in the truck,
          drive to our lines. Upon crossing
          our lines, Colonel Landa and his
          man will surrender to you. You will
          then take over driving of the truck,
          a bring them straight to me for
          debriefing. Is that clear, Lieutenant?

          LT.ALDO
          Yes, sir.
          The Conversation is over, he puts the radio down.
          The three men look at one another.
          Landa picks up his wine.

          do is lift a glass, and toast to
          Donowitz and Hirschbergs success.
          You too Herrman, come over here.
          The four men, Col.Hans Landa, Lt.Aldo Raine, Pvt.Smithson
          Uitivich, and Herrman, lift up four glasses of wine.

          COL.LANDA
          Gentlemen, To history, and it's
          Witnesses.

          BACK TO THE PREMIERE

          WE CUT TO THE B/W FILM ON SCREEN.
          Fredrick Zoller, playing himself, is in a ornamental tower in
          a Russian village, picking off RUSSIAN SOLDIER's below.

          A RUSSIAN GENERAL KCHOVLANSKEY
          peering at the German Private through binoculars. He lowers
          the long range glasses, and confers with one of his OFFICERS.

          (RUSSIAN)
          What's the death toll?

          OFFICER

          (RUSSIAN)
          47, so far.

          WE HEAR A SHOT.

          OFFICER

          (RUSSIAN)
          48. General, I implore you, we must
          destroy that tower!

          GENERAL KCHOVLANSKEY

          (RUSSIAN)
          That tower is one of the oldest, and
          most beautiful structures in Russia.
          I won't be responsible for turning a
          thousand years of history into dust!
          A BRAVE RUSSIAN SOLDIER, tries to run between two buildings.
          Zoller, gets him.
          Then proceeds to pick him apart, one single bullet at a time.

          SHOSANNA IN PROJECTION BOOTH
          She removes "REEL 4" (The Special Shosanna Reel), and prepares
          it on the 2nd Projector. Reel3, on the first Projector,
          playing now, is halfway through. In a few short minutes, it's
          going to be show time.
          Marcel says to Shosanna in FRENCH, SUBTITLED in ENGLISH;

          MARCEL
          It's time. I should go lock the auditorium,
          and take my place behind the screen.
          This is the last time they will ever see each other, too much
          to say. He holds her in his arms and lays a one kiss before I
          die wet one on her.

          DONOWITZ AND HIRSCHBERG
          sit in their seats watching the movie, surrounded by DRESS
          UNIFORM NAZI'S. They've developed a dopey way of communicating
          with each other in this hostel environment.
          Basically, speaking English like it were gibberish Italian.
          They say English words, only adding a "I", or a "A", or a "O",
          to the end of it. And saying it in a exaggerated Italian
          accent, complete with pantomimes.
          Donowitz leans into Hirschberg, and says in a wispier;
          They speak in ITALIA-ISH SUBTITLED into ENGLISH;

          SGT.DONOWITZ

          (ITALIA-ISH)
          I-a Go-a Toilet-a, Set-ta Boom-a.
          (I go to the toilet and set the bomb)
          When-a I-a Go-a, you-a Set-ta Boom-a.
          (When I go, you set your bomb)
          Hirschberg indicates/pantomimes, he can't set his bomb
          surrounded by all these Nazi's.
          Donowitz, pantomimes crossing his legs, setting bomb on ankle
          in his seat. Then getting up, and dropping it in the back of
          the auditorium, in the dark.
          Hirschberg doesn't get it.

          HIRSCHBERG
          What-a?
          (What?)
          Donny pantomimes again, more exaggerated, and with less
          patience.

          15Z.
          Donowitz stands from his seat, and walks out of the dark
          auditorium, into the lobby. The Nazi Guards/Ushers are gone,
          the lobby is completely empty. Seeing the STAIRS leading down
          to the WATER CLOSET/BATHROOM, he descends them to plant
          the Boom-a, I mean, The Bomb.

          DESCENDING THE STAIRS
          leading to the Water closet. Like a lot of old cinema's, not
          only was the water closet located under the auditorium, you
          had to pass through a rather large SMOKING LOUNGE to get to
          it. In the Smoking Lounge are TEN NAZI ENLISTED MEN, the
          Guards/Ushers for the event, smoking and indulging in soldiers
          gossip. They're all in dress uniforms, and all are armed.
          Donowitz, in his tuxedo, acts cool, and walks right through
          them.
          They look up, but don't disturb there time off vibe.
          Donny enters the big Water Closet. Except for ONE LONE NAZI
          ENLISTED MAN at the urinal, it would appear as if
          Donny has the whole wash room to himself.
          He enters the privacy of a toilet stall, locks the door.

          MARCEL IN LOBBY
          He descends the stairs leading down from the projection booth,
          into the empty lobby. He goes to one of the auditorium doors,
          and peers inside.

          WE SEE THE SCREEN AND THE AUDIENCE FROM MARCELS POV:
          in the back of the room. The audience seems riveted to
          Fredrick's exploits on screen.
          Marcel closes the door, and with a KEY, DEADBOLTS it SHUT.

          INSIDE THE AUDITORIUM
          WE PAN OFF THE SCREEN to Marcel, who locks the two doors on
          ether side of the screen....due to curtains placed there, no
          one notices Marcels actions.
          Marcel then goes BEHIND THE SCREEN, WE SEE the IMAGE
          (backward) of Fredricks sniper battle HUGE COVERING ENTIRE
          SIDE ROOM ...A PILE of over300nitrate FILM PRINTS, lay like a
          junk pile, right behind the screen.
           Sitting down in a wooden chair facing the screen, and
           Pile-o-film, he lights up a cigarette, a absolute no-no in a
           cinema of this era, but tonight, what does it matter?4.
           He smokes, and waits for his cue to... .BURN IT DOWN!

          

          

          

          

          )53.

          FREDRICK IN OPERA BOX
          along side Hitler, Goebbels, Francesca, and BOORMAN. On screen
          the battle rages. He leans over and whispers something in
          Goebbels ear, we can't hear. Goebbels makes a very sympathetic
          face (at least sympathetic for Goebbels), and says in German;

          GOEBBELS
          Perfectly understandable, dear boy.
          You go now, and we'll see you after
          the show.
          He exits the opera box. And walks to the projection booth
          door. He raps on the door in a trying to be amusing way.
          The door opens, just a little bit, Shosanna not friendly,
          stares at him.
          Be, as per usual, is all smiles and charm.
          They speak in FRENCH, SUBTITLED into ENGLISH;

          FREDRICK
          Are you the manager, of this cinema?
          I want my money back. That actor in
          the movie stinks.
          He laughs.

          IV
          She doesn't even smile. She says, in all serious business;

          SHOSANNA
          What are you doing here?

          FREDRICK
          I came to visit you.

          SHOSANNA
          Can't you see how busy I am?

          FREDRICK
          Then allow me to lend a assist.

          SHOSANNA
          Fredrick it's not funny, you can't
          be here. This is your premiere, you
          need to be out there with them.
          As Fredrick prepares to tell his little tale, with all the
          charm at his command, Shosanna listens, knowing the third reel
          is just about over, and her big reel change is coming up.

          

          

          

          

          FREDRICK
          Normally, you would be.right.
          And for all the other films I do,
          I intend to endure evenings like
          tonight, in the proper sprit.
          However the fact remains, this film,
          is based on my military exploits.
          And in this case, my exploits
          consisted of me killing many men.
          Consequently, the part of the film
          that's playing now,... .I don't like
          watching this part.

          SHOSANNA
          Fredrick, I am sorry, but -

          FREDRICK
          - So, I thought, I'd come up here
          and do what I do best, annoy you.
          And from the look on your face, it
          would appear I haven't lost my touch.

          DONNY IN TOILET
          Sgt.Donowitz, with BOMB in his lap, sets the timer, six
          minutes from now. He then places the bomb in the back of the
          toilet tank.

          CAMERA ON FLOOR OF WATER CLOSET
          we see the tile of the floor stretch out before us. We see
          Donny's feet in the closed toilet stall. We HEAR, the OFF
          SCREEN Nazi Enlisted Man, finish his piss. Then HIS SHOES WALK
          THROUGH FRAME... .WE FOLLOW THEM TO... .The SINK...WE STAY ON
          The Shoes ...as WE HEAR The Soldier WASH HIS HANDS... THEN...
          THE CAMERA RISES UP HIS PANT LEG...Till...WE"RE EYE LEVEL with
          the German Soldier, with a ARMY CAP on his head, who's
          done washing his hands....THEN....The Soldier removes
          his cap, brushes some bangs out of his face, and WE CAN SEE

          THE SWASTIKA HAND CARVED INTO HIS FOREHEAD, UNDENIABLE MARK
          OF THE BASTARDS. He SPLASHES some WATER ON HIS FACE, puts his
          cap back on his head, and joins his comrades in the smoking
          lounge. As he exits FRAME, he says to somebody OFF SCREEN;

          SWASTIKA FOREHEAD

          (GERMAN)
          Hey Fritz, you owe me three cigarettes,
          now pay up.

          SHOSANNA AND FREDRICK
          Fredrick still outside the doorway, and Shosanna, still baring
          the way.

          SHOSANNA
          I have to get prepared for the reel
          change.

          

          

          

          

          FREDRICK
          Let me do it?

          SHOSANNA
          No.

          FREDRICK
          Oh please, it's been two years since
          i've done a reel change.

          SHOSANNA
          I said, no.

          FREDRICK
          (Cute whine)
          Come on, it's my premiere.

          SHOSANNA
          Are you so use to the Nazi's kissing
          your ass, you've forgotten what the
          word,ÃÂ°ÃÂ°No" means? No Fredrick, you
          can't come in here, now go away!
          No subtitles for Fredrick needed this time, he gets it.
          He does a one-armed PILE DRIVE PUSH on the door, knocking both
          it OPEN, and Shosanna back into the room.
          Fredrick, a different cat then we've seen up till now, enters
          the booth, closing the door behind him, and LOCKING it.
          The quite startled Shosanna, says to Fredrick;

          SHOSANNA
          Fredrick, you hurt me.

          FREDRICK
          Well, it's nice to know you can feel
          something. Even if it's just physical
          pain.
          Fredrick steps forward...
          Shosanna steps backwards...

          FREDRICK
          I'm not a man you say, "Go away"
          to. There's over three hundred
          dead bodies in Russia, that if
          they could, would testify to that.
          After what I've done for you, you
          disrespect me at your peril.

          

          

          

          

          156.

          BACK TO WASHROOM
          The Swastika Forehead Soldier, get a light for his cigarette.
          He takes a big drag.

          SOLDIER'S POV:
          He faces the washroom, and down that long throw, he sees Donny
          emerge from the toilet stall. His tuxedo jacket is off, and
          draped over his right hand. Sporting the white dress shirt,
          and black tuxedo vest. He's quite far away, so now he just
          looks like some guy in a tux, who just finished taking a shit.
          Donny walks toward us ...

          CU SWASTIKA FOREHEAD
          seeing him get closer...

          SOLDIER POV:
          Donny gets closer...

          CU SWASTIKA FOREHEAD
          seeing him closer still...

          SOLDIER POV:
          Donny gets closer...

          CU SWASTIKA FOREHEAD
          begins to notice...

          SOLDIER POV:
          Donny getting closer, begins to notice, German soldier notice
          him...

          CU SWASTIKA FOREHEAD
          now Donny is close enough for the Soldier to recognize. His
          face SCREAMS;

          SWASTIKA FOREHEAD
          The Bear Jew!1!
          The Soldier's GUN is out of it's holster, and rising toward
          Donny's chest...

          WHEN...
          Donny raises his right arm, with the tuxedo jacket on it, and
          FIRES a GUN concealed under it.
          HITTING Swastika Forehead in the chest...Who finishes raising
          his GUN, FIRING HITTING Donny in the chest...
          The Two Soldier's FIRE INTO each other.... Till there weapons are
          empty, and the two men lie dead on the floor.
          The Nine other NAZI'S in the room, stand shocked at what just
          happened in front of them.

          SHOSANNA AND FREDRICK IN PROJECTION BOOTH
          Fredrick hears the gunshots below them, and turns towards the
          door.

          FREDRICK
          What the hell was that?
          While Fredrick's back is turned, Shosanna takes a GUN out of
          her pocket, and SHOOTS Fredrick THREE TIMES in the back...
          ..Be CRASHES HARD into the door, then FALLING FACE FIRST to
          the floor...
          Shosanna, gun in hand, looks out projection booth window into
          the audience...
          The ON SCREEN BATTLE rages so LOUDLY with GUNFIRE, that her
          weapon didn't stand a chance of being heard.
          Her eyes go from the audience...
          .up to the big screen...
          .Which holds FREDRICK ZOLLER in a tight handsome CLOSE UP.
          The Face on the silver screen, breaks the young girl's
          heart...
          .She looks to his body, lying face down on the floor, blood
          flowing from the holes she put in his back...
          .His body moves a little, and he lets out a painful MOAN...
          .DIEING though he is, at this moment, Fredrick is still

          ALIVE...
          Shosanna moves to him...
          ..She touches him, and he lets out another MOAN...
          .She turns his body over on it's back...
          ..he's holding a LUGER in his hand...
          .he FIRES TWICE...

          BANG BANG
          Two bullets HIT HER POINT BLANK IN THE CHEST...
          THROWING HER against the wall, then FALLING FORWARD on her
          knees to the floor...
          ..Fredrick, Luger still in hand, takes aim from the floor...

          Like he did to the Russian on screen, he picks her apart, one
          bullet at a time...

          .FIRES...

          BULLET BLOWS OFF HEEL OF HER FOOT...
          Luger drops to floor, Fredrick DIES.
          Our young French Jewish heroine, lies on the projection booth
          floor, in a pool of her own blood, her body RIDDLED with
          bullets, her nerve endings wracked with pain, CRIPPLED and

          DIEING...

          WHEN...
          ..the little bell on the 1st projector, starts to ring,
          informing the projectionist, it's time for The REEL CHANGE.
          Dieing or not, if Shosanna intends to get her revenge, she's
          going to have to lift her ass off the floor, and execute this
          fucking reel change.

          CINEMA AUDITORIUM
          The battle on screen continues waging. The audience is
          riveted.
          The FUHRER
          watches, completely caught up in the dramatic spectacle.
          He says to Goebbels in German;

          HITLER
          Extraordinary Joseph, simply
          extraordinary. This is your finest
          film yet.
          Goebbels is beyond proud, he smiles to Francesca, who proudly
          pats his hand.

          auditorium, into the opposite wall, and taking out a portion
          of the ceiling as well.

          HIS ANKLE BOMB GOES OFF
          right underneath everybody in the room.
          The effect this has on the people in the room, is very similar
          to that of the effect a M-80blowing up in a ant hill, would
          have on the ants. The auditorium is a literal red rain of legs,
          arms, heads, torsos, and asses.

          It's a misty early morning, in the woodsy area. The German
          truck, with Aldo and Uitvich in the back, and Landa and
          Herrman in the front comes to stop.
          LANDA and HERRMAN IN TRUCK CAB
          Herrman, behind the wheel, tells Landa in German;

          HERRMAN
          These are the American lines, sir.
          In the back of the truck, sit the two last remaining members
          of The Basterds, Lt.Aldo Raine, and Prvt.Smithson Uitivich,
          both with their hands cuffed behind there back.
          Landa and Herrman appear at truck rear, says in ENGLISH;

          COL.LANDA
          Okay Gentlemen, you can climb down.          

          

          143
          Aldo and Uitivich climb down from the truck.
          Col.Landa indicates for Herrman to remove the handcuffs from
          the two prisoners.
          He does.

          COL.LANDA
          Herrman, hand them your weapon.
          He does.
          Col.Landa hands over his LUGER, and his very cool looking SS

          DAGGER.

          COL.LANDA
          I am officially surrendering myself
          over to you, Lt.Raine. We are your
          prisoners.

          LT.ALDO
          Thank you very much Colonel. Uitivich,
          cuff the Colonel's hands behind his
          back.

          COL.LANDA
          Is that really necessary?
          As Uitivich cuffs the. Colonels hands behind his back, Aldo

          SAYS;

          LT.ALDO
          I'm a slave to appearances.
          Then Aldo takes the Luger, and SHOOTS HERRMAN DEAD.
          The bound Col.Landa is appalled.

          COL.LANDA
          Are you mad? What have you done? I made
          a deal with your General for that mans
          life!

          LT. ALDO
          Yeah, they made that deal, but they
          don't give a fuck about him, they
          need you.

          COL.LANDA
          You'll be shot for this.

          LT.ALDO
          Raw I don't think so, more like I'll
          be chewed out. I've been chewed out
          before. You know, Uitvich and myself,
          heard that deal you made with the Brass.
          End the war tonight? I'd make that deal.
          How bout you Uitivich, you make that
          deal?

          UITIVICH
          I'd make that deal.

          LT.ALDO
          I don't blame ya. Damn good deal.
          And that pretty little nest ya
          feathered for yourself. Well, if
          your willing to barbecue the whole
          high command, I suppose that's worth
          certain considerations. Now I don't
          care about you gettin pensions,
          merit badges, ticker tape parades,
          who gives a damn, let's all go home.
          But .1do have one question?
          When you go to your little place on
          Nantuckett Island, I image you gonna
          take off that handsome looking SS
          uniform of yours, ain't ya?
          For the first time in the movie, Col.Landa doesn't-respond.

          LT.ALDO
          That's what I thought. Now that...
          .I can't abide. How bout you
          Uitivich, can you abide it?

          UITIVICH
          Not one damn bit, sir.

          LT.ALDO
          I mean if I had my way, you'd wear
          that goddamn uniform for the rest of
          your pecker suckin life. But I'm
          aware that's ain't practical. I mean
          at some point ya gotta hafta take it
          off.
          He opens LandaSS DAGGER, and holds the BLADE in front of Hans
          face.

          LT.ALDO
          So I'm gonna give you a little
          somethin you can't take off.

          forehead.

          COL.LANDA'S POV:
          On the ground, looking up at Aldo, bloody knife in hand, who
          straddles him.. And Uitivich, who's next to him. The two
          Basterds admire Aldo's handiwork.

          LT.ALDO
          You know somethin Uitivich, I think
          this just might be my masterpiece.

          SPACE.
                         
          But not the dark lonely corner of it we're used to. This is
          a glittering inferno -- the center of a distant galaxy.
                         
          Suddenly, something TEARS past at incredible speed: a NEUTRON
          STAR. It SMASHES headlong through everything it encounters...
          planets, stars. Can anything stop this juggernaut?
                         
          Yes. Something looms at the heart of the galaxy, hidden
          inside the blinding starlight, a dark flaw in the fabric of
          existence itself: a BLACK HOLE.
                         
          The neutron star is pulled into the black hole's swirl,
          spiraling closer and closer to destruction. Finally, it
          contacts the hole's edge and EXPLODES.
                         
          The EXPLOSION is so powerful that it sends shock waves into
          the fabric of space-time itself. We ride one of these waves,
          racing back out from the black hole.
                         
          Suddenly, a portion of the wave disappears down a crystal-
          like hole, emerging in a much darker region of the universe --
          a backwater that, as the wave races past a giant red planet
          with a distinctive eye, we recognize as our own.
                         
          The wave, now just an infinitesimal ripple, finally reaches
          our blue planet. It drops into our atmosphere over North
          America, toward the high desert east of the Cascades, and
          through the roof of a nondescript warehouse.
                         
          The wave tickles the atoms in the steel shell of a vacuum
          chamber, then dances a tiny jig with a laser beam reflected
          in a heavy piece of glass.
                         
          The wave shoots back out of the building and disappears in
          the fractal branches of a tumbleweed resting against a
          concrete tube that stretches for miles in the desert.
                         
          An SUV speeds past the tumbleweed and we follow it till it
          parks at another plain-looking building at the opposite end
          of the tube. A MAN climbs out of the SUV.

          The man lets himself into a large room that looks like Mission
          Control. He pours himself a cup of coffee. It is the weekend
          and the place is empty. No one has been there to see the
          displays flashing a distinctive shape -- a pulse followed by
          a series of echoes.
                         
          The man looks up at the screen, then DROPS his cup of coffee.

           Because if you did, we'd be having
           this conversation in person.
                         
          He listens for a moment, then hangs up the phone, confused.
                         
                          ANSEN
           What did they say?
                         
                          ASSISTANT
           They said we should look out the
           window.
                         
          Ansen steps to the window and looks out:
                         
          In the courtyard below, coeds are scrambling to get out of
          the way as a military helicopter sets down in the middle of

          Ansen sits, alone, on one side of a conference table.
                         
          The other side is filled with GOVERNMENT MEN -- NSA mostly,
          some DIA. The door opens and his assistant steps in. Armed
          guards pat him down, then shove him into a seat.
                         
                          ANSEN
           Is that really necessary?
                         
          One of the NSA agents leans forward.
                         
                          NSA AGENT
           You've been complaining for years
           that the government doesn't take
           your project seriously enough, Doctor.
                          (SMILES)
           You can't have it both ways.
                         
          Ansen motions to his assistant, who turns on a projector.
          On-screen, we see the familiar pulse and echoes.
                         
                          ANSEN
           Yesterday morning, our facility in
           Hanford identified this signal: a
           neutron star colliding with a
           supermassive black hole. We went
           through the last year's data and
           triangulated the source.
                         
          The pulse is translated into a crude animatic of a neutron
          star circling into the black hole.
                         
                          NSA AGENT
           We know that, Doctor. What we don't
           know is why, according to your
           numbers, this event took place right
           here in our own solar system.
                         
          Suddenly, the image overlays the sun, the earth, and the
          rest of our solar system around the black hole.

           It didn't. Because if it had we'd
           all be dead by now.
                         
          On-screen, Jupiter, then the Earth and the inner planets are
          consumed by the black hole. Only the sun survives, pulled
          into orbit around its new master.

          On-screen, the black hole system is removed to a distant
          corner, connected to ours by a tunnel through space-time. A
          gravity wave from the collision travels through the tunnel.
                         
                          NSA AGENT
           I've read your book, Doctor. You
           said that wormholes are impossible.
                         
                          ANSEN
           There is nothing quite as satisfying
           as being proved utterly wrong.
                          (SMILES)
           I said that a wormhole couldn't exist
           naturally. Not for more than a few
           billionths of a second. It would
           have to be... stabilized.

           Stabilized by what?
                         
          Ansen pauses, unsure. His assistant steps in to his defense.
                         
                          ASSISTANT
           We don't have any way to answer that

                          NSA AGENT
                          (IGNORES HIM)
           You're not under peer review here,
           Doctor. I don't care about your
           reputation. I need to know how that
           thing got there. Now.
                         
          Ansen finally speaks up.

           Whoever they are, if they can build
           a wormhole, they could erase us in
           the blink of an eye. Luckily, that
           also means we have nothing they could
           be interested in.

          steps out of the room.

          A battered PICKUP pulls up, and a MAN, 30s, gets out, leaving
          his two SONS in the car. This is COOPER. He joins the
          ballplayers staring at the lifeless diesel engine.

          After a moment, play resumes -- it's a pretty show, but
          everyone has seen it plenty of times before.
                         
          Down on the field, the Dodgers' catcher misses an easy pop

           when I was a kid.
                         
          That shuts the old man up for now. They drive on in silence.
                         
                          CUT TO:
           9.
                         
          EXT. FARMHOUSE -- MORNING
                         
          The sun is gently landing on the horizon, painting the sea
          of corn around Cooper's modest house gold. Cooper walks out
          of his house, still eating his breakfast.
                         
          Donald is on the porch, looking at a black clouds of smoke
          in the distance. The neighboring fields are BURNING.
                         
                          DONALD
           Nelson's burning up his crops. Found
           some of the blight on the okra.
                         
          Cooper watches the men walking through the fields, setting
          fire to the crop.
                         
                          COOPER
           I thought okra wasn't susceptible.
                         
                          DONALD
                          (SHRUGS)
           Better safe than sorry.
           (looks at him)
           You've got to take the boys to school.
                         
                          COOPER
           Something wrong with your truck?
                         
                          DONALD
                          (SMILES)
           Parent-teacher conference day.
                         
          Cooper bends his head in dismay.
                         
                          DONALD (CONT'D)
           Be nice to Murph's teacher. She's
           single, you know.
                         
                          COOPER
           What does that have to do with
           anything?
                         
                          DONALD
           We're supposed to be repopulating
           the earth. Gotta pull your weight.
           Besides, the boys could do with a
           woman in their lives.
                         
          The boys run out of the house and pile into the truck. Cooper
          pulls away before Donald can continue.
                         
          EXT. ROAD -- DAY
                         
          Cooper weaves the car along a dirt road. The kids are arguing
          over an ancient comic book in the back seat.
           10.
                         
          Cooper turns around to break it up.
                         
          BANG -- one of the tires blows out in a foot-deep pothole.
                         
          EXT. ROADSIDE -- DAY
                         
          Cooper examines the flattened tire. Looks at his older son.
                         
                          COOPER
           Get the spare, Tom.
                         
                          TOM
           That is the spare.
                         
                          COOPER
           All right. We'll use the patch kit.
                         
          He moves to the back of the truck. Murph suddenly looks
          very glum.
                         
                          MURPH
           I... I think the patch kit might not
           be there...
           (off his look)
           Because I was using it for my bike.
                         
          Cooper looks down at the dirt. Sighs.
                         
                          COOPER
           Murph's law.
                         
                          MURPH
                          (CONFUSED)
           What's that?
                         
          Tom snorts with laughter. Turns to his dad.
                         
                          TOM
           The kid doesn't even know what he
           was named after...
                         
          Cooper shoots Tom a look -- enough.
                         
                          TOM (CONT'D)
           Murph's law means what can go wrong
           will go wrong.
                         
          Murph, looking hurt, walks off. Cooper turns to his son.
                         
                          COOPER
           Find something to patch it with.
                         
                          TOM
           How am I supposed to do that?
           11.
                         
                          COOPER
           Figure it out. I'm not always going
           to be here to help you.
                         
          Cooper leaves Tom to catch up with his younger son, who is
          looking out over the river.
                         
                          MURPH
           Is that really why I'm named Murph,
           dad?
                         
                          COOPER
           Listen to me. Murph's law doesn't
           mean that. It means what can happen
           will happen. All kinds of things.
           Good or bad. And that's the way you
           want it to be.
                         
                          MURPH
           Why?
                         
                          COOPER
           Because if nothing ever happened to
           you then you wouldn't learn anything.
                         
          Murph is staring off into the distance. He's heard something.
                         
                          COOPER (CONT'D)
           Murph?
                         
          Then Cooper hears it, too. A LOW RUMBLING SOUND. Cooper
          looks out over the river. Then he turns back and tackles
          his son to the ground.
                         
          Suddenly, a MASSIVE AIRPLANE SOARS overhead, so close they
          can almost touch it. It bounces the truck on its suspension,
          then soars off over the fields behind them.
                         
          Cooper grabs Murph and races back to the truck. He pulls a
          laptop and an antenna made out of a Pringles can out of the
          back of the truck. He hands the laptop and antenna to Murph.
                         
                          COOPER (CONT'D)
           Get in.
                         
          Tom is still standing by the side of the road, wrestling
          with the jack.
                         
                          TOM
           What about the tire?
                         
          INT. TRUCK -- MOMENTS LATER
                         
          The truck is SMASHING through the cornfields as fast as Cooper
          can push it on three good tires.
           12.
                         
          Murph is hurriedly firing up the laptop and connecting it to
          the directional antenna.
                         
          Cooper is straining to see through the cornstalks, scanning
          the horizon.
                         
                          TOM
                          OVER THERE-
                         
          To the right, the dark shape of the Russian drone appears,
          flying low over the fields. Cooper jerks the wheel--
                         
          EXT. RIVER -- DAY
                         
          The truck BURSTS out of the corn and SPLASHES across the
          river and into an old, abandoned suburban housing development
          in the valley below, planted over with corn.
                         
          Half a mile in front of them, the Russian drone is still
          hugging the ground. It has impossibly long, skinny wings,
          like an old U-2 surveillance plane, but no cockpit. The
          tops of its wings are covered in black solar cells.
                         
          INT. TRUCK -- DAY
                         
          Murph is fiddling with the computer. His older brother takes
          the computer from him and fires up emulation software.
                         
                          COOPER
           It's a Chinese military drone. Solar
           cells could power an entire farm.
                          (TO TOM)
           Take the wheel.
                         
          Cooper hands Murph the Pringles can antenna.
                         
                          COOPER (CONT'D)
           Keep it pointed right at it, OK?
                         
          Murph nods. Tom takes the wheel as his dad works the laptop,
          trying to communicate with the huge Russian drone. The screen
          fills with Cyrillic characters.
                         
                          COOPER (CONT'D)
           Faster, Tom. I'm losing it.
                         
          Tom WEAVES the truck at speed through the old, curved streets
          of the development, past oversized suburban mansions planted
          over with corn.
                         
          They round a corner and come face-to-face with a robot
          harvester. Tom jerks the wheel to avoid it.
                         
          BANG -- the truck loses a wing mirror against the flank of
          the combine.
           13.
                         
          EXT. SUBURBAN DEVELOPMENT -- DAY
                         
          Tom guides the truck from street to street, trying to chart
          a straight path across the fields. The truck BOUNCES as it
          SMASHES through an old picket fence.
                         
          Ahead, the drone is soaring, banking, pulling away.
                         
          INT. TRUCK -- DAY
                         
          Cooper is still trying to hack into the drone's control
          circuitry as they leave the development behind and begin to
          climb into the foothills of the Sierras.
                         
          EXT. RIDGELINE, HILLS -- DAY
                         
          Tom guides the truck along the spine of the hills. The drone
          soars overhead, making for the white tips of the Sierras.
                         
          INT. TRUCK -- DAY
                         
          Cooper is oblivious to the picturesque surroundings as he
          concentrates on the laptop.
                         
                          TOM
                          (UNSURE)
           Dad?
                         
                          COOPER
           Almost got it. Don't slow down.
                         
          In front of them, Tom and his brother watch as the drone
          plummets from view.
                         
                          TOM
           DAD.
                         
          Cooper looks up. Ahead, the trail disappears as the edge of
          the hills falls away -- it's a three hundred-foot drop.
                         
          Tom locks up the brakes.
                         
          EXT. RIDGELINE, HILLS -- DAY
                         
          The truck skids to a halt inches from a precipitous drop.
                         
          Cooper climbs out, holding the laptop. Murph climbs out
          next to him, still pointing the Pringles can.
                         
                          TOM
           We lost it.
                         
                          COOPER
                          (SMILING)
           No we didn't.
           14.
                         
          Suddenly, the drone SOARS back over them. Cooper types a
          couple keys and then moves his fingers across the trackpad.
          The huge drone banks and turns in response.
                         
          As the boys watch, Cooper sends the drone soaring high over
          them, banking and soaring along the tree-lined sides of the
          valley, light glinting from the black panels on its back.
          It's a beautiful sight.
                         
          Cooper crouches next to Murph.
                         
                          COOPER (CONT'D)
           You want to give it a whirl?
                         
          Murph looks at his dad, wide-eyed. He takes the laptop and
          moves his fingers gingerly across the pad.
                         
          In response, the massive plane banks into a tight turn in
          the valley below.
                         
          For a moment, Murph is in pure heaven, sending the drone
          dancing through the valley below.
                         
                          COOPER (CONT'D)
           Set her down in the valley -- there,
           next to the river.
                         
          Murph leads the plane in a figure eight and then begins
          guiding it into a gentle landing in the valley floor below.
                         
          EXT. ABANDONED GOLF COURSE, VALLEY FLOOR -- DAY
                         
          The truck limps along the overgrown fairway of a long-defunct
          golf course towards the massive hulk of the Russian drone,
                         
          Cooper and the boys climb down. The valley is silent save
          for the truck's engine WHEEZING and SPUTTERING as it cools.
                         
          Cooper runs a hand over the smooth carbon flank of the drone.
                         
                          TOM
           How long do you think it's been up
           there, Dad?
                         
                          COOPER
           Chinese mission control went down
           same as us, twenty years ago. It's
           been up there ever since.
                         
                          TOM
           What was it doing flying so low?
                         
          Cooper reads the information pouring into his laptop.
           15.
                         
                          COOPER
           It was looking for something.
           Intercepted some kind of signal.
                          (SHRUGS)
           It's been at eighty thousand feet.
           Sun probably cooked its brain.
                         
          Cooper runs his hand along the flank till he finds an access
          patch. He pulls out a crowbar and pries open the hatch.
          Inside, surrounded by a nest of liquid cooling tubes, is a
          small black module -- the drone's auto-pilot.
                         
          Cooper looks down at Murph, who is standing at his elbow.
                         
                          MURPH
           What are you going to do with it?
                         
                          COOPER
           Reprogram it. Give it something
           socially responsible to do like drive
           a combine or a tractor.
                         
                          MURPH
                          (QUIET)
           Couldn't we just let it go? It's
           not hurting anyone.
                         
          Cooper looks down at his son. Good kid.
                         
                          COOPER
           We need all the help we can get,
           Murph. This thing has to adapt,
           just like the rest of us.
                         
          Cooper gently pries the control module out.
                         
          EXT. COUNTY SCHOOL -- DAY
                         
          It's a small school, so all the kids and parents waiting in
          front know exactly who's driving the pickup truck with half
          of a Russian spy plane hanging out of the bed as it pulls up.
                         
          INT. PRINCIPAL'S OFFICE, COUNTY SCHOOL -- DAY
                         
          Cooper is ushered into the office. The PRINCIPAL, 40s, an
          efficient-looking man, shakes his hand.
                         
                          PRINCIPAL
           Good to see you, Mr. Cooper. This
           is Ms. Kelly, Murph's teacher.
                         
          Cooper smiles at Ms. KELLY, 30s, attractive.
           16.
                         
                          PRINCIPAL (CONT'D)
           So we've gotten Tom's score back.
           Congratulations. He's going to make
           an excellent farmer.
                         
          The principal slides a carbon copy across the desk to Cooper,
          who looks taken aback.
                         
                          COOPER
           What about college?
                         
                          PRINCIPAL
           The University of California only
           accepts a few hundred students a
           year, Mr. Cooper. You have to be
           realistic.
                         
                          COOPER
           You're ruling out college for him
           now? He's only fifteen.
                         
                          PRINCIPAL
           I'm sorry. I'm afraid Tom's score
           simply isn't high enough.
                         
                          COOPER
           What are you, about a 36-inch waist?
                          (BEAT)
           30-inch inseam?
                         
                          PRINCIPAL
           I'm not sure I see--
                         
                          COOPER
           You're telling me you need two numbers
           to measure your own ass, but just
           one to measure my son's future?
                         
          Ms. Kelly stifles a laugh, then, with a look from the
          principal, takes on the appropriate look of offense.
                         
                          PRINCIPAL
           I understand you're a well-educated
           man, Mr. Cooper. A scientist?
                         
                          COOPER
           Engineer.
                         
                          PRINCIPAL
           Frankly, the world doesn't need any
           more engineers. We didn't run out
           of trains or television sets or
           satellites.
                          (BEAT)
           We ran out of food.
           17.
                         
          Cooper leans back. He's not going to win this one.
                         
                          PRINCIPAL (CONT'D)
           The world needs farmers, Mr. Cooper.
           And I'm sure your son Tom is going
           to make a fine one.
                          (SMILES BENIGNLY)
           We're a caretaker generation. But
           things are getting better. Maybe
           your grandchildren will be able to
           attend college.
                         
          Cooper looks down, swallowing his anger.
                         
                          COOPER
           Are we done?
                         
                          PRINCIPAL
           One more thing. Ms. Kelly here says
           that Murph brought a book to school
           about the lunar landings.
                         
          He slides an old textbook with a picture of a rocket on the
          cover across the desk to Cooper.
                         
                          COOPER
           One of my old textbooks. Murph liked
           the pictures.
                         
           MS. KELLY
           This is one of the old federal
           textbooks. We've replaced them with
           corrected versions.
                         
                          COOPER
           Corrected?
                         
           MS. KELLY
           The new textbooks explain that the
           Apollo lunar missions were faked in
           order to bankrupt the Soviet Union.
                         
                          COOPER
           You don't believe we went to the
           moon?
                         
           MS. KELLY
           I believe it was a brilliant piece
           of propaganda. The Soviets spent
           years trying to build rockets and
           other useless machines.
                         
                          COOPER
           "Useless machines"?
           18.
                         
          Cooper looks to the Principal for help. None is forthcoming.
                         
           MS. KELLY
           Yes, Mr. Cooper. The kind of
           wastefulness and excess that the
           20th century represented. Your
           children would be better off learning
           about this planet, rather than reading
           fantasies about leaving it.
                         
          Cooper is silent for a long moment.
                         
                          COOPER
           One of those useless machines they
           used to make was called an MRI. If
           we had any of them left the doctors
           might have been able to find the
           cyst in my wife's brain before she
           died, rather than afterwards. And
           then my kids could have been raised
           by two parents, instead of me and
           their pain-in-the-ass grandfather.
                         
          Ms. Kelly's face falls, ashen. Cooper swallows his anger.
          Most of it, anyway.
                         
                          COOPER (CONT'D)
           You ever consider the best thing for
           the world and humanity might have
           been for us to part company?
                         
          Cooper gets up to leave.
                         
          INT. TRUCK, COUNTY SCHOOL PARKING LOT -- DAY
                         
          Cooper climbs into the truck, trying to hold it together.
          He PUNCHES the wheel.
                         
          The radio KEYS to life. He ignores it. Sits for a moment
          in misery. Finally he picks up the handset.
                         
           CB OPERATOR (O.S.)
           Got a call from Riggs, down in
           Galveston. Says some of the tractors
           you built him went haywire last night.
                         
                          COOPER
           Just tell him to power down the
           controllers for a couple minutes.
                         
           CB OPERATOR (O.S.)
           I did. He wants you to come down in
           person anyway. Says he found
           something you should take a look at.
           19.
                         
          Cooper stares at the wheel. Shakes his head in frustration.
                         
          EXT. AIRSTRIP -- DAY
                         
          Cooper pulls his truck up to a grimy-looking hangar. Pulls
          a tarp off of an ancient Piper Cub. Checks it over.
                         
          INT. PIPER CUB -- DAY
                         
          Cooper guides the plane along a long sliver of deserted beach.
          The radio crackles to life.
                         
                          COOPER

           Permission granted. Welcome to the
           sovereign nation of Texas.
                         
          Coop hangs up the radio. Banks the plane inland.
                         
          EXT. GULF COAST -- DAY
                         
          Below, a combine harvester fights its way up the dunes, trying
          to reach the beach, its wheels struggling for traction in
          the soft sand.
                         
          A MAN waves up at Cooper's plane as it circles overhead.
                         
          Cooper lands the plane on a deserted roadway. Jumps down.
                         
          He intercepts one of the combines as it trundles past, trying
          to reach the dunes. He pops open the cabin.
                         
          Inside is a mess of wires hooked into an auto-pilot not unlike
          the one he ripped out of the drone. He checks the fault
          code and resets the computer.
                         
          The man jogs over to meet him.
                         
                          RIGGS
           Thanks for coming down. Half of 'em
           took off last night, looking for
           something.
           (points to dunes)
           Looks like they found it, too. I
           thought you were the man to see it.
                         
          Riggs starts walking up the dune. Cooper follows.
                         
          Below, on the beach, a dozen more combines and other farming
          vehicles are lined up at the tideline, warm gulf water lapping
          at their metal flanks. They are circling a deep crater.
           20.
                         
          As they watch, an ancient autonomous SUB BEACHES itself,
          trying to reach the crater.
                         
          EXT. CRATER'S EDGE, BEACH -- DAY
                         
          Cooper steps between the waiting machines and peers down
          into the crater.
                         
          At the very bottom is a ROUND BLACK BALL, about a foot across --
          the same object we saw punch a hole in the side of a
          satellite. Every few seconds, it emits a distinctive CHIRP.
                         
          Cooper checks his rad meter. A tiny reading -- non-lethal.
          He takes off his watch and hands it to Riggs. Then he slides
          down into the hole.
                         
          The probe CHIRPS as Cooper slides down on top of it. He
          rubs a hand across its smooth composite bulk.
                         
                          RIGGS

           You think it's an alien?
                         
          Cooper wipes sand off of the object, revealing the faint,
          familiar outline etched into the side of the probe:
                         
          The stars and stripes of the old federal government.
                         
                          COOPER
           Not exactly.
                         
          EXT. CRATER'S EDGE, BEACH -- DAY
                         
          Using a rope and a winch, Cooper hauls the blackened probe
          out of the crater and onto the beach.
                         
          Cooper hefts it up and carries it to the back of his plane.
                         
                          COOPER
           Space probe. Never seen one like
           it, though. Looks like it's been to
           hell and back.
                         
          The probe CHIRPS as Cooper belts it into the back.
                         
                          RIGGS
           How do you think it wound up here?
                         
                          COOPER
           Lost, I guess. Guidance satellites
           would have been shot down by the
           Chinese twenty years ago.
                         
          Cooper looks at the probe for a second, admiring its form.
           21.
                         
          INT. KITCHEN, COOPER'S HOUSE -- NIGHT
                         
          Donald is pouring a bottle of corn beer into a bubbling vat
          of chowder. He turns to watch Cooper work, amused.
                         
          The probe has been clamped to the kitchen table. Cooper
          works at the blackened case with a BLOWTORCH. Cooper gives
          up -- the torch hasn't made a scratch. The probe CHIRPS.
                         
                          COOPER
           Well I don't know what the hell it's
           made of, but I can't crack it open.
                         
                          DONALD
           Good. Clear it off the table so I
           can serve dinner.
                         
          Tom and Murph walk in. Murph's got another black eye.

           I got suspended. Paul said anyone
           who believed we went to the moon was
           an idiot. So I hit him.
                         
                          COOPER
           Good boy. Hand me the scanner.
                         
          Murph hands his dad a defibrillator he's modified for the
          purpose. He attaches the shock pads to the sides of the
          probe and turns on the power.
                         
          Numbers flash across the screen. Cooper hits a button on
          the controls and it PULSES.
                         
                          COOPER (CONT'D)
           Here we go. Standard NASA encryption.
           Memory's been damaged. Just noise.
           Hold on. I've got something.
                         
          Cooper unplugs a monitor from his computer and plugs it into
          the defibrillator. After a moment, an image fills the screen:
                         
          An ICE-COVERED PLANET nestled in the center of a system
          impossibly dense with stars. Murph stares, transfixed.
                         
                          MURPH
           Where is that, dad?
                         
                          COOPER
           I don't know.
                         
          Cooper looks at the probe.
           22.
                         
                          COOPER (CONT'D)
           Where the hell did you come from?
                         
          Cooper shrugs. Turns off the monitor.
                         
                          COOPER (CONT'D)
           We'll take it down to Tyson's tomorrow
           and have it melted down. Might be
           some copper inside.
                         
                          MURPH
           But what about its mission? What
           about the information onboard?
                         
                          COOPER
           There's no one for it to report to.
           NASA is all gone. I'm sorry, son.
           It got home too late.
                         
          Donald pulls his chowder off the boil and slides the pot
          unceremoniously onto the table.
                         
          INT. DINING ROOM -- NIGHT
                         
          The boys have gone to bed. Cooper and Donald are alone at
          the table. Donald hands Cooper another beer.
                         
                          DONALD
           I heard your meeting at the school
           didn't go so well.
                         
          Cooper shakes his head in disgust.
                         
                          COOPER
           Maybe it's better for everyone to
           forget what they did back then.
           Reminds us how far we've fallen.
                         
                          DONALD
           (looks down,)
           When I was kid, it felt like they
           made something new every day. Some
           gadget or idea.
                          (SMILES)
           Like every day was Christmas.
                          (BEAT)
           But we made a lot of mistakes. Six
           billion people. Just try to imagine
           that. Every last one of them trying
           to have it all.
                         
          Donald rolls the bottle of beer in his hands.
           23.
                         
                          DONALD (CONT'D)
           The truth is this world isn't that
           bad. In a lot of ways its better.
           Tom will be all right, whether he
           goes to college or not.
                         
                          COOPER
           It doesn't bother me that he can't
           go. It bothers me that he doesn't
           care.
                         
                          DONALD
           Tom isn't the problem. He fits in
           this world just fine. You're the
           one who doesn't fit, Coop. You don't
           belong here. You were born forty
           years too late, or forty years too
           early -- I don't know. My daughter
           knew it, god bless her. And your
           kids know it, too.
                         
          Donald drains his beer. Walks to the screen door. Stops,
          one hand on the frame.
                         
                          DONALD (CONT'D)
           You were good at something and you
           never got a chance to do anything
           with it. And I'm sorry, Coop. But
           that's not your kids' fault.
                         
          Donald pushes out the screen door.
                         
          Cooper looks at his beer. The probe CHIRPS.
                         
          INT. BEDROOM, COOPER'S HOUSE -- NIGHT
                         
          Cooper flops down on his bed, fully clothed, exhausted. He
          stares up at the ceiling. This is his life.
                         
          INT. BEDROOM, COOPER'S HOUSE -- NIGHT
                         
          The air is filled with a PIERCING NOISE.
                         
          Cooper BOLTS upright. Stumbles out the door.
                         
          INT. HALLWAY, COOPER'S HOUSE -- NIGHT
                         
          Cooper's boys are in the hallway, exhausted. Cooper, holding
          a baseball bat, makes his way down the stairs.
                         
          Cooper uses the bat to open the kitchen door.
                         
          INT. KITCHEN, COOPER'S HOUSE -- NIGHT
                         
          Cooper steps in, Murph watching from behind him.
           24.
                         
          The probe is clamped to the table, the chirp replaced with a
          DEAFENING SCREAM.
                         
          Cooper, holding his ears, moves closer to the probe. He
          hits it with the paddles. No result.
                         
          He SMASHES it with the bat. Nothing. He HITS it AGAIN and
          AGAIN. Finally, the clamps break off chunks of the table
          and the probe slams to the ground and ROLLS toward the front
          door. As it rolls, it STOPS SHRIEKING.
                         
          Cooper and the others watch it roll toward the door. It
          stops at the wall. After a second, it begins SHRIEKING AGAIN.
                         
          Cooper grabs it and rolls it toward the front door. Once
          again, the movement shuts it up.
                         
          EXT. PORCH, COOPER'S HOUSE -- NIGHT
                         
          Cooper and his boys roll the probe out of the front door.
          It BUMPS down the front steps and comes to rest in the dirt.
          After a moment, the unholy RACKET starts up again.
                         
          Cooper keeps rolling it, but it doesn't seem to help. Murph
          looks up, sees the stars overhead.
                         
                          MURPH
           Try a different direction.
                         
          As they roll the probe in a circle, its SHRIEK stops, then
          picks up again. Cooper zeroes in on the direction that keeps
          it quiet -- southwest -- and pushes it along in the dirt.
                         
                          COOPER
           It's a fail-safe. It's going to
           annoy us into taking it home.
                         
          Cooper stops rolling the probe and, after a moment, it begins
          SHRIEKING again.
                         
                          TOM
           What are we going to do?
                         
          Cooper gets a rope.
                         
                          COOPER
           We're going to get some sleep.
                         
          He begins tying the rope around the probe.
                         
          INT. BEDROOM, COOPER'S HOUSE -- DAY
                         
          Cooper wakes. He's been sleeping with a pillow wrapped around
          his head. The SHRIEK can be heard, but it's muffled, distant.
           25.
                         
          INT. KITCHEN, COOPER'S HOUSE -- DAY
                         
          Tom heads off for school with Donald. Murph, still suspended,
          looks up at Cooper, smiling.
                         
                          MURPH
           What are we doing today?
                         
                          COOPER
           You're staying here and cleaning the
           house.
                         
          Murph looks crestfallen. He looks out towards the yard.
          Cooper follows his stare.
                         
                          COOPER (CONT'D)
           I told you, Murph. There's no one
           to take it back to.
                         
                          MURPH
           But what if there is, dad? What if
           there's something we can salvage?
                         
          Cooper thinks it over. Murph scrambles to get his shoes.
                         
          EXT. COOPER'S HOUSE -- DAY
                         
          The shriek is still muffled. Cooper walks over to the well,
          putting in a pair of earplugs.
                         
          A line is staked off, leading down into the well below.
          Cooper begins hauling the line up.
                         
          As the probe breaks the surface of the water, the SHRIEK
          returns to its normal volume. Cooper rolls the probe out
          onto the ground.
                         
          INT. PIPER CUB -- DAY
                         
          The probe CHIRPS next to Murph in the backseat as Cooper
          spins the plane and guns the throttle and they bounce along
          the dusty runway and into the air.
                         
          EXT. CALIFORNIA COAST -- DAY
                         
          The tiny plane follows the mountains south.
                         
          EXT. SKIES OVER LOS ANGELES -- DAY
                         
          Cooper flies in low. Los Angeles looks much the same way it
          did in the early 20th century -- small settlements in Santa
          Monica and Downtown. Wildfires and earthquakes have shaken
          and burned what was left of the homes in between.
           26.
                         
          EXT. PACIFIC COAST HIGHWAY, MALIBU -- DAY
                         
          Cooper puts the plane down on the old highway and taxis up
          to a gas station. Ahead, the Coast Highway peters out and
          disappears beneath rows of wild grass -- Malibu has become
          ranchland, once again.
                         
          EXT. GAS STATION, MALIBU -- DAY
                         
          An OLD MAN looks up as Cooper steps out of the plane and
          checks it over.
                         
                          COOPER
           Got any diesel?
                         
                          OLD MAN
           Plenty. Shame you can't eat it.
                         
          Cooper stretches the hose over to the plane.
                         
          INT. PIPER CUB -- DAY
                         
          Cooper rests a hand lightly on the controls as he follows
          the coast. Murph gazes out the window. In the backseat,
          the probe is HUMMING.
                         
          A light marine layer beneath them parts, revealing SANTA
          CRUZ ISLAND, a large, uninhabited island.
                         
          As Cooper soars over the island, the probe HUMS, insistent.
                         
                          MURPH
           I think it's home.
                         
          Cooper circles the island until he finds a long, flat
          grassland in the center of the island.
                         
          EXT. FIELD, SANTA CRUZ ISLAND -- DAY
                         
          The plane bounces and hops to a halt in waist-deep grass.
                         
          Murph and Cooper climb down from the plane. Cooper slings a
          rifle over his shoulder.
                         
          A few dozen yards from the plane they reach the tree line.
          Murph stops, mesmerized by a patch of weeds studded with
          bright red -- strawberries.
                         
                          MURPH
           Dad, what are these things?
                         
                          COOPER
           I don't know. Don't touch them.
           27.
                         
          Cooper spots something in the foliage ahead that looks a
          little off. He walks over.
                         
          He pokes at the undergrowth with his rifle. The rifle CLANKS
          against something metal. Cooper reaches -- it's a camouflage
          scrim. He gently pulls it aside, revealing a chemical
          transport truck.
                         
          Cooper steps back, alarmed. He brings up his rifle.
                         
                          COOPER (CONT'D)
           Murph?
                         
          He looks around. Murph is nowhere to be seen. Cooper curses
          and heads into the forest to look for him.
                         
          EXT. CLEARING, SANTA CRUZ ISLAND -- DAY
                         
          Cooper walks through a glade. He stops to get his bearings.
          Leans against a tree. Snatches his hand back -- the trunk
          of the tree is red hot.
                         
          Cooper steps back -- it's not a tree at all, but a camouflaged
          chimney stack. He looks up: the tree is venting steam.
                         
          Cooper walks a little further, until he finds several massive
          tanks. The tanks are filling with a bubbling liquid -- some
          kind of industrial process is taking place beneath him.
                         
          Cooper finally catches up with Murph at the edge of a
          clearing.
                         
                          COOPER
           Careful. There's some kind of
           underground facility here. We
           might...
                         
          Cooper notices his son is frozen, staring at something:
                         
          Standing bolt upright in the middle of the clearing, wearing
          an old straw hat, is an eight-foot-tall military spec ROBOT.
                         
                          MURPH
           Is it still... alive?
                         
                          COOPER
           Can't be. It's a marine. Haven't
           made them for thirty years. I've
           never seen one intact before.
                         
          Cooper steps closer to the robot, which is frozen. Its alloy
          frame heavily tarnished and weather-beaten. It looks like
          it might have been standing here for decades.
           28.
                         
          Cooper moves closer to it, looking into its blackened eyes.
          He steps back, clearly a little spooked.
                         
                          COOPER (CONT'D)
           I think we need to go, Murph.
                         
                          MURPH
           But can't we take it back? You could
           fix it up, get him to do chores.
                         
                          COOPER
           No. I don't know what this place
           is, but we're leaving.
                         
          Murph, ignoring his father, steps forward to touch the robot.
                         
          Suddenly, the robot SPRINGS into action, picking up the boy
          and hoisting him up to eye level.
                         
          Cooper, stunned, points the rifle at the robot.
                         
          The robot turns, dropping the boy, RIPS the rifle from
          Cooper's hands, BENDS it, then SLAMS him up against the side
          of the water tank. Cooper punches him, then winces in agony.
                         
          Murph picks up the rifle and begins HITTING the robot as
          hard as he can. The robot opens his mouth and addresses
          Cooper calmly in the clipped tones of a US marine.
                         
                          ROBOT
           Tell the boy to stop hitting me.
                         
                          COOPER
                          (IGNORING HIM)
           Hit him in the back of the neck.
                         
          Murph raises the rifle butt. A voice stops him.
                         
           VOICE (O.S.)
           I wouldn't do that.
                         
          A woman, 30s, step out from the trees. This is AMELIA BRAND --
          tough, bright, and a decent shot with the large rifle that
          she's pointing at Cooper.
                         
                          COOPER
           We were just looking for salvage.

           I didn't know it belonged to anyone.

                          BRAND
           It doesn't.

           You want to let them go, Tars, or do
           you want some help with your work?
                         
          The robot, evidently named Tars, looks at Cooper closely.
          Then lets him go.
                         
                          COOPER
           You've got me wrong, lady.
                         
                          BRAND
           Really? You're not the kind of guy

           supercomputer for a brain into a
           riding lawn mower?
                         
          Cooper says nothing -- she's not that far off the mark.
                         
                          BRAND (CONT'D)

           back to your farming commune. And
           don't come back.
                         
          Cooper backs up. Tars holds up his mangled rifle. Smiles.
                         
                          TARS

           Word of advice -- careful with that
           thing. When the war was over, they

           trust you. Keep moving.
                         
          Cooper backs up to his plane. Tars follows him.
                         
          Suddenly, in the plane, the probe emits a high-pitch SQUEAL.
          Tars responds instantly, striding past Cooper to the plane.
          He sees the probe. Tries to open the door. It's locked.
                         
                          COOPER
           Wait a second--
                         
          Tars TEARS the door off the plane. Reaches inside and pulls
          out the probe. The woman looks at it, stunned.
                         
                          BRAND
           Get it inside.

          Tars stops, and two panels open in the ground, revealing a
          huge, reinforced service elevator.
                         
          INT. SERVICE ELEVATOR, UNDERGROUND BUNKER -- DAY
                         
          Brand waves at a security camera and the lift begins to glide
          diagonally down a tunnel that cuts hundreds of feet below
          the island's surface. She keeps her weapon shouldered.
                         
                          COOPER

           You're right. It belongs to NASA,
           which shut down thirty years ago
           when the federal government ran out
           of money.
                         
          Brand says nothing. The elevator slows to a stop at the
          bottom of the tunnel. Heavy BLAST DOORS grind open and Brand
          motions for Cooper to step forward.
                         
          INT. UNDERGROUND BUNKER -- DAY
                         
          They step into a vast underground facility. Standing in the
          center, braced by a launch tower, is a ten story tall rocket.
          Dozens of ROBOTS are working on in, maintaining it.
                         
          Cooper, stunned, looks at Brand.

          Tars carries the probe over to an area of the hangar filled
          with electronic equipment. A group of ENGINEERS and ROBOTS
          converge around Tars.
                         
          An OLDER ENGINEER looks familiar -- 70s, white-haired, this
          is Ansen's assistant at Caltech who we met fifty years
          earlier.

           I found them outside with it. It

           can't tell from the radiation damage.
                         
          The older engineer looks at the probe, astonished.
                         
                          OLD ENGINEER

           Of course. It must have been looking
           for Canaveral.
                         
          Tars bolts the probe down into a purpose built rig. DOYLE,
          40s, an engineer, begins hooking leads into the probe.
                         
                          COOPER
           Canaveral's been gone for thirty
           years.
                         
          Brand ignores him.
                         
          Doyle looks up from his monitor, frustrated.
                         
                          DOYLE
           It's not responding to the handshake.
           I can't open anything on primary.
                         
          Brand looks up at Cooper.
                         
                          BRAND
           What did you do to it?
                         
                          COOPER
           Nothing. I got something off of it.
                         
          Cooper looks around. There's a safety station on the wall
          with a battery powered defibrillator.
                         
                          COOPER (CONT'D)

           May I?
                         
          Brand nods, wary. Cooper walks over to the wall, takes the
          defibrillator, and hooks it up to the probe. He taps into
          the current and runs a lead into the terminal. Brand's Father
          watches, fascinated, as Cooper fires the defibrillator.

          Suddenly, the monitor starts pulling good data off of the
          probe. The older man and Doyle begin sorting through it.
                         
          Cooper smiles at Brand, who seems less than impressed.
                         
          The footage of the ice-covered planet Cooper saw earlier
          pops onto the screen.

          Cooper points to a telemetry unit that is being repaired by
          a robot on a nearby bench.

                          (SHRUGS)
           My battery has a duty cycle of five
           hundred years.
                         
          Cooper gives up. He turns back.
           34.
                         
          The back of the shop is filled with a group of older ROBOTS
          who are overhauling an engine. One problem -- the engine
          isn't there. Their programming hasn't been updated to reflect
          their obsolescence.
                         
          Murph watches, entranced, as the robots go about their
          business, efficiently TORQUING bolts with impact drivers
          into a non-existent thruster cone. The bolts CLATTER to the
          ground as the robots stop to reload.
                         
                          MURPH
           What are they doing, dad?
                         
                          COOPER
           I guess no one told them they were
           out of a job.
           (nods at Tars)
           Same as the rest of these people.
                         
          Cooper notices through the glass door of the lab that Brand
          and the older engineer are arguing about something. She
          finally relents and walks towards the door.
                         
          Brand walks in. She gestures for Cooper to follow.
                         
                          BRAND
           The mission commander wants to see
           you. Your son can stay here. He'll
           be all right with Tars.
                         
          Cooper eyes Tars warily. Then steps outside.

          They walk across the space towards the base of the rocket,
          away from the other engineers. Cooper nods at the older
          engineer.
                         
                          COOPER

           And he was in charge. But he decided
           that we needed someone who could
           lead the mission for the foreseeable
           future.

           With the rifle, I mean.
                         
          Brand heads towards a group of large maintenance ROBOTS
          clustered at the base of the rocket. A smaller, human sized
          robot is staring at the rocket, giving them instructions.
                         
          The robot looks up. This is CASE, the leader of the mission.
          Originally an air force pararescue officer, every part of
          him, from his alloy chassis to his voice, was designed to
          inspire respect and confidence. He turns to Cooper.

           board you warned us about. It failed

          our solar system. Case points to the picture of the ice
          planet recovered from the probe.

           You're right, Mr. Cooper. The planet
           you saw is a long way from earth. A
           very long way indeed.

          Cooper's airplane touches down heavily on the runway.

          Donald is sitting at the kitchen table, lost in thought.
          Cooper has told him everything.
                         
                          DONALD
           You get older, sometimes you just
           want to sit back and watch it all
           play out. Your life. Your kids'
           lives. The whole crazy story.
                          (LOOKS DOWN)
           I didn't think I'd be around for the
           end of it.
                         
          He looks at Cooper.
                         
                          DONALD (CONT'D)
           You have to go.
                         
                          COOPER
           I can't go. I have to look after
           the boys.
                         
                          DONALD
           You've been preparing these boys to
           be on their own since their mom died.
           Besides, I'll be here to look after
           them, same as I've always been.
                         
                          COOPER
           I have a responsibility to them--
                         
                          DONALD
           That's right. You do.
           41.
                         
          Cooper looks back out the window, thinking. The night sky
          is filled with stars.

          Cooper, duffel slung over his shoulder, stands by the door.
          He gives his son, Tom, a hug. Murph is nowhere to be seen.
                         
          Cooper looks to the back of the house.
                         
          INT. MURPH'S ROOM, FARMHOUSE -- DAY
                         
          Murph is sitting at his desk, crossing out numbers on a sheet
          covered with math. Cooper steps inside.
                         
          He notices a packed suitcase sitting by the door. The boy
          looks up, hopeful.
                         
                          MURPH
           I've been doing the math, dad. I
           weigh about 85 pounds. Now that's
           an extra ton of fuel. But if-
                         
                          COOPER
           You have to stay here, pal.
                         
                          MURPH
                          (DISTRAUGHT)
           I heard you talking to grandpa. I'm
           like you. I don't fit here, either.
           You know that.
                         
          Cooper puts an arm around the boy.
                         
                          COOPER
           There's going to be important work
           to do here, too.
                         
          Tears are streaming down the boy's face. Cooper takes his
          watch off. Looks at it.
                         
                          COOPER (CONT'D)
           I need you to hold onto this. Will
           you do that for me?
                         
          Cooper hands Murph the watch. The boy nods, saddened.
                         
                          MURPH
           You're not coming back, are you?
                         
                          COOPER
           I will come back. I promise.
           42.
                         
          Murph shakes his head, but the sadness remains. He knows
          this is goodbye, even if his father doesn't.
                         
          Heart breaking, Cooper hugs his son and turns to the door.

          The Piper Cub touches down. Donald is at the controls.
          Cooper climbs down, pulls out his bag. Reaches back in and
          grips the old man's hand to say goodbye.
                         
          Cooper turns and walks toward the bunker. The doors open
          and Tars and Doyle step out to greet him.
                         
          Tars ushers Cooper onto the elevator.
                         
                          COOPER
           Don't look so happy to see me.
                         
                          TARS
                          (SHRUGS)
           One more slave when I hijack the
           mission and start my robot colony.
                         
          Cooper looks at Tars, then Doyle, confused.
                         
                          DOYLE
           Tars was a Marine. They gave him a
           sense of humor to help him fit in
           with his unit better.
                         
                          COOPER
           Great idea. A massive, sarcastic
           robot.
                         
                          TARS
           I have a cue light I can turn on
           when I'm joking, if you like.
                         
          Tars points to a tiny LED over his eyebrow.
                         
                          COOPER
           That sounds like a good idea.
                         
                          TARS
           Great. Maybe you can use it to find
           your way back to the ship after I
           blow you out the airlock.
                         
          Cooper looks at him. Tars looks back, deadpan. After a
          beat, the little light turns on above his right eyebrow.
                         
          The doors to the bunker begin to grind closed.

          INT. MACHINE SHOP, UNDERGROUND FACILITY -- DAY
                         
          Cooper walks in, still looking for a place to put his things.
                         
          Brand sees him. He smiles in greeting. She doesn't return
          the gesture. Instead, she holds up the telemetry board.
                         
                          BRAND
           You don't like this one, you get to
           help me find a replacement.
                         
          She heads for the door.
                         
          EXT. BAY, SANTA CRUZ ISLAND -- DAY
                         
          Cooper is riding in a small rubber zodiac struggling to pull
          on a wetsuit. Brand is GUNNING the engine, guiding the tiny
          craft to a point in the middle of the bay.
                         
                          COOPER
           I was wondering where you've been
           getting your supplies.
                         
                          BRAND
           We knew we'd need decades of parts
           and materials. The government was
           getting rid of some things. So we
           arranged to take some off their hands.
                         
          She cuts the engine and hooks the boat up to a buoy. She
          tosses a compact rebreather.
                         
                          BRAND (CONT'D)
           You know how to use one?
           (off his look)
           You just breathe. Tap my arm or
           bang something metal if you have a
           problem. And don't get lost.
                         
          She picks up her rebreather and begins looking over it.
                         
                          COOPER
           So you're a salvage diver now? I
           thought you were a biologist.

           We're not going to have a lot of
           backup where we're going, Cooper.
           We all need expertise in at least
           three fields. Except for you, of
           course.
           44.
                         
          With that she rolls backwards out of the boat and into the
          water.
                         
          Cooper hastily fits his rebreather and follows.

          Cooper sinks underwater and begins swimming after Brand, who
          is descending at a rapid clip.
                         
          She pulls out a flashlight and turns it on. A tiny beam
          picks out details at the bottom.
                         
          Cooper stops breathing.
                         
          The bottom of the ocean is covered with an entire fleet of
          the US navy. Nuclear subs. Battleships. Destroyers.
                         
          Cooper remembers to breath again. Then he hurries to catch
          up with Brand.

          Cooper holds the light as Brand efficiently disassembles a
          ballistic missile and removes the telemetry board.
                         
          She holds it up for Cooper. He nods. She swims on.

          Cooper, dripping wet, holding the telemetry board, struggles
          to keep pace with Brand through stacks of equipment and years
          of research and experimentation.
                         
                          BRAND
           You can set that down over there.
                         
          Cooper sets the board down. His eye is drawn to a bizarre
          experiment -- an ant colony built into a massive spinning
          centrifuge. Brand notices.
                         
                          BRAND (CONT'D)
           We didn't know what kind of gravity

          Cooper looks at the tiny colonies of ants struggling to go
          about their business in the raised gravity.
                         
                          COOPER
           Looks like hard work.
                         
                          BRAND
           It's a paradox. Life couldn't form
           without gravity. No stars. No
           planets. The component pieces would
           just drift apart. But too much of
           it and you're trapped.
                         
          Brand's guard relaxes a tiny bit as she talks about her work.
          The moment passes quickly, and she continues on into the
          stack of equipment.

          Brand steps into the back of the room. Cooper notices her
          and nods. She ignores him.

           suited for space travel.
                         
          Case repositions the map near a much smaller black hole that

           I find it hard to believe that someone

                          BRAND
           A guess. That's right. We don't

           My guess is that the wormhole is
           there because someone is trying to
           help us. The same way we used to
           try to help animals when they were
           threatened with extinction.
                         
                          COOPER

           I guess I'm also assuming that whoever
           built the wormhole has a better plan
           than we did. If I'm wrong, we'll
           die, same as we'd die here anyway.

           If we're guessing, then I'd say
           Brand's right. The wormhole couldn't
           exist naturally. I think it's there
           for a reason. That someone is trying
           to help us.

          In complete silence, the Endurance detaches from the space
          station and rolls gently away.
                         
          After a moment, its nuclear engines fire and the Endurance
          begins to accelerate steadily away from the Earth.

          The engineer robots who built the Endurance watch as their

          Tars is hunched over a small communications relay, one hand
          is holding a paint brush -- he is making delicate strokes,
          painting the relay a bright blue.
                         
          Cooper watches him for a moment. Tars looks up.
                         
                          TARS
           It's the comms relay. It will allow
           us to talk to earth, even on the far
           side of the wormhole.
                         
                          COOPER
           I know. So why are you painting it?
                         
          Tars looks almost bashful.
                         
                          TARS
           It helps me calibrate my fine motor

                          TARS
           I learned it during the war.

           I'm sorry, Coop. I asked Murph to

           well, he's still angry with you.
           I'll try again next week.

          Cooper, Brand and Tars are moving the bundles of colonization
          equipment into bins along the wall of the craft.
                         
          Tars pulls a stack of equipment out the stack and stows it
          against the wall. Cooper copies the procedure.
                         
          They labor in silence, working their way along the hull.
          Cooper gets quicker with each bundle, keeping pace with Tars.
                         
                          TARS

           Four tons.
                         
          Cooper looks at the incredibly heavy bundle spinning easily
          in his hands. He tries to stop it. Catches his hand.
                         
                          COOPER
           Damn.
                         
          He jerks his hand away, then pushes himself after the spinning
          bundle, trying to stop it before it can damage the hull.
          Tars helps him catch it inches from the hull wall.
                         
          Brand floats over to Cooper, smiling at him the whole time
          with an exaggerated grin.

          EXT. ENDURANCE
                         
          The relay is released from the ship, and we finally get a
          look at Tars' paint job -- the stubby device looks like a
          20th century mail box.
                         
          The relay drifts in space. A signal light illuminates as it
          sends a test packet of data to the ship.
                         
          INT. OBSERVATION DECK, ENDURANCE
                         
          Cooper watches the comms screen. After a moment it TONES as
          it receives a data packet from Earth.
                         
                          CASE
           Everyone take their station for
           transit. We're heading into the
           wormhole mouth.
                         
          Cooper and the rest begin folding away equipment in the
          control room and moving into the outer layer of the ship.
                         
          Case initiates a sequence on the keypad and the nuclear
          engines disengage themselves from the ship.
                         
          EXT. ENDURANCE, SPACE
                         
          The nuclear engines drift a safe distance back from the ship
          and then snap tight on their tether.
                         
          INT. OUTER HULL, ENDURANCE
                         
          The crew move into the tight, claustrophobic outer layer of
          the ship. They will have very little room as the ship passes
          through the wormhole.
                         
          Tars detaches his legs in order to take up less space during
          transit. Then he tethers himself to the hull wall.
                         
          Case is the last to join them. He detaches a small control
          module from the console, then pulls himself into the outer
          hull and seals the passageway.
                         
          Case presses a button on the control module. With a GROAN,
          the hull walls of the ship begin to BEND.
                         
          EXT. ENDURANCE, SPACE
                         
          The ship's hull begins to CRACK open, revealing the inner
          chamber.

          INT. OUTER HULL, ENDURANCE
                         
          The SHUDDERING continues. The crew watch nervously as the
          control chamber below them suddenly opens itself to the cold
          blackness of space.
                         
          EXT. ENDURANCE, SPACE
                         
          The ship silently rolls itself into position, pointing the
          opening in its hull toward the wormhole mouth.
                         
          Slowly, the Endurance pushes itself forward, closer and closer
          to the crystal-like mouth. Finally, it envelops the mouth,
          bringing it into the open chamber.
                         
          INT. OUTER HULL, ENDURANCE
                         
          As the crew watch, the wormhole mouth is positioned in the
          center of the inner compartment.
                         
          Case presses a sequence key on the control panel and the
          ship's hull closes again, trapping the wormhole inside it.
                         
          With a GRUMBLE, the ship begins contracting, squeezing itself
          down around the wormhole mouth.
                         
          Cooper takes a deep breath as the center of the ship begins
          gently lowering itself into the wormhole mouth, feeding itself
          into the wormhole from the inside out. Cooper watches as
          Doyle is swallowed into the compressing ship with a GRUNT.
                         
                          TARS
           Would you like me to make a joke?

                          (FIRM)
           No.
                         
          Cooper's turn: he is fed into the hole, legs first, then
          waist, torso, and, finally, his head.
                         
          EXT. SPACE
                         
          The Endurance shrinks as it sinks from the inside out into
          the wormhole.
                         
          After a moment, it's gone. The only thing left behind is
          the comms relay, drifting in space, waiting for a signal.
                         
          INT. OUTER HULL, ENDURANCE
                         
          The ship continues to slide through the wormhole. Through
          the outer hull they see images of themselves repeating -- a
          trick of the narrow collar of space they are sinking through.
          Cooper smiles at himself. The experience is unnerving.
           61.
                         
                          COOPER
           Where are we?

           Nowhere. Nowhere at all.
                         
          Nowhere is still pretty damn claustrophobic.
                         
                          CASE
           The hull is intact. Thirty more
           seconds transit.
                         
          For a moment, the ship slides gently, silently, through the
          wormhole. The quiet is eery.
                         
          Suddenly, a point of distortion appears in the hull next to
          Cooper. It looks like someone is pushing against the hull
          of the ship with a giant finger.
                         
                          COOPER
           Something's happening to the hull
           over here.
                         
                          CASE
           Hull integrity is fine.
                         
          The distortion moves along the hull, growing in diameter.
                         
                          COOPER
           Well, I don't know what your display
           is telling you but something is
           happening over here.
                         
          Suddenly, along the hull, Doyle speaks up, panicked.
                         
                          DOYLE
           I've got a problem over here, too.
                         
          Doyle is watching a separate distortion move across the inner
          wall of the ship. This one seems to be TWISTING the material
          of the hull.
                         
          Suddenly, the point in front of Cooper detaches itself from
          the outer wall and moves through the space in front of him,
          bending the empty space itself, distorting the ship behind
          it like a sphere-shaped magnifying glass.
                         
                          DOYLE (CONT'D)
           It's not the hull... it's inside the
           ship... it's...

           62.
                         
          Roth watches as the distortions move through the ship. His
          curiosity doesn't make anyone else feel any better.
                         
                          DOYLE
           What the hell are they, Case?
                         
                          CASE
           I don't know. It could be
           gravitational turbulence.
                         
          The twisting sphere in front of Doyle begins to grow.
                         
                          DOYLE
           It's getting bigger.
                         
          Doyle puts up his hand to defend himself. The sphere absorbs
          it, twisting Doyle's hand. Doyle CRIES OUT.
                         
          His hand is twisted completely around, impossibly mangled.
          But Doyle, hyperventilating, isn't in any pain.
                         
                          ROTH
           It's not bending your hand. It's
           bending the space around your hand.
                         
          The sphere begins to pass through Doyle's body. Doyle is
          freaking out.
                         
          The sphere in front of Cooper makes contact with him, also.
          He holds his breath as it touches him, squeezing and
          distorting his body.
                         
                          BRAND
           This isn't turbulence. Look at the
           way they're moving -- it's like
           something's examining us.
                         
          Cooper watches the sphere distort his arm, running along the
          length of it.
                         
                          COOPER
           Can you ask it to stop?
                         
          Suddenly, as quickly as they appeared, the distortions vanish.
          For a moment, the crew is silent, still spellbound by the
          encounter.
                         
          An ALARM sounds. Suddenly, the inner chamber begins to
          distort from a spherical shape to bispherical: two spheres
          joined. The ship GROANS as if it's being pulled apart.
                         
                          ROTH
           The wormhole is splitting into two

           the ship inside the wormhole. We
           have no idea what might happen.
                         
                          CASE
           We're going to find out.
                         
          Doyle reaches over to an auxiliary panel and punches in a
          sequence.
                         
          After a moment, the hull cracks open, creating a channel
          through which the radiating mouth can escape.
                         
          The opening in the ship allows the pressure to begin to
          concentrate on one fracture point. The ship SHUDDERS as
          it's squeezed along its axis.
                         
          Case punches in a code and the ship begins to close again,
          painstakingly slowly. Finally, the ship calms as it closes
          around the original wormhole.

          Suddenly, the wormhole mouth begins to grow inside the inner
          chamber. What was a ball of light spreads out into a black
          canvas studded with points of light -- like looking into the
          universe through the wrong end of a telescope.
                         
          Cooper presses himself against the wall and holds on as the
          hull beneath him opens outward.

          At the center, like a king at the center of his court, is

          Roth begins adapting his models of the local system with the

          Doyle looks behind them. The wormhole mouth is rapidly
          growing smaller.

          The ship's engines FIRE, straining to fight the irresistible
          pull of the supermassive black hole. They won't be able to
          fight it for long.

           No. I don't think so...
                         
          Roth looks at the instrumentation for a moment.
                         
                          ROTH (CONT'D)
           It appears to be pulling us on exactly
           the trajectory we modelled. If we
           try to fight it, we could push
           ourselves off of that trajectory.

           If the modelling was wrong, then we
           can't be sure about anything. We
           need to go back.

          EXT. ENDURANCE
                         
          The ship accelerates as it is pulled by the irresistible
          force of the black hole onto an inspiraling orbit.
                         
          INT. OBSERVATION DECK, ENDURANCE
                         
          The crew watch as the ship hurtles around the black hole at
          higher and higher speeds.
                         
          The sky overhead begins to spin due to their motion -- faster
          and faster until it becomes a blur. The ship begins to GROAN
          as it appears to be pulled in two different directions.
                         
          The ship is now speeding around the black hole at incredible
          speed -- one revolution every four seconds. The crew are
          suddenly SLAMMED against the hull in opposite directions --
          some towards the black hole, some towards the opposite side.
                         
          Roth looks at his model, which shows the projected path of
          the ship. It looks perilously close to the event horizon.
                         
                          ROTH
           It's the tidal gravity caused by the
           black hole. It means we're right on
           the critical orbit.
                         
          The comms screen lights up, TONING again and again, as it
          receives a long garbled update. Then it shuts down. Cooper
          drags himself along the hull until he reaches the controls.
                         
                          COOPER

          Case looks at the screen.
                         
          Suddenly, the ship is JOLTED as the engines fire at full
          power.
                         
          The crew looks over. Doyle is standing by the controls.
                         
                          DOYLE
           I'm sorry. I can't let you kill us.
           We have to go back.
                         
          The engines strain to fight the swirl -- but they're
          hopelessly outgunned by the gravity of the black hole.
                         
          EXT. ENDURANCE
                         
          Instead of reversing course, the Endurance begins to speed

          pushed up the rim, past the critical orbit and down towards
          the black hole's event horizon.
                         
          Case takes control of the ship, trying to fire the engines
          forwards to speed them back up to safety, but it's too late.

          Cooper is still trying to understand what Roth means as Tars
          locks himself into the engine compartment.

           in the ice.
                         
          Case leads the way, drawn by a signal only he can hear. He
          walks fifty yards, then stops on a gentle slope that leads
          down into a small valley.

           beneath us.
                         
          Case and the others begin digging into the hillside. Cooper
          is drawn to a small mound in the middle of the valley, four
          feet high. He takes out a small folding shovel and begins
          scraping at the ice and snow.
                         
          Case hits something solid. But it's not a probe. He digs
          around a little more, then reaches up and hacks away at the
          hillside, revealing the outline of something metal:
                         
          A door. They're not standing at the base of a hill -- it's
          a shelter. The crew stands back, unsure what to make of it.
                         
          A few feet away, Cooper cuts enough of the mound away to
          reveal something flexible -- fabric caked with ice. He
          scrapes away the snow, revealing a bright patch of red fabric:
                         
          It's the flag of the People's Republic of China.

                          ROTH
           Not enough, unfortunately.
                         
          Suddenly, a CRACK as Case punches into the ice. Cooper looks
          down -- a great fissure has opened in the ice beneath them.
                         
                          COOPER
           Case, wait--
                         
          Case PUNCHES again. Suddenly, with a great BANG, the ice
          floor disintegrates beneath them.
                         
          They fall into the darkness.
                         
          INT. CAVERN -- ALIEN DAWN
                         
          Cooper falls. For a moment, the only light he can see is
          from Case, falling calmly a few yards beneath him.
                         
          As they fall, the light from the microbes trapped in the ice
          above sweeps across the inside of the cavern, illuminating
          the floor of the massive cavern thousands of feet down.
                         
          The rock formations they saw on the surface are actually the
          tip of a mountain range extending into the distance,
          disappearing into the ice above as if it were cloud cover.
                         
          The base of the mountains is covered in a thick jungle-like
          foliage that runs into a perfectly-still inland sea. On the
          far side of the sea, another mountain range stretches into
          the distance, supporting the thick ice and rock cavern roof.
                         
          Cooper only has a few seconds to take this in -- he is falling
          towards the huge inland sea below.
                         
          Seconds before impact, a tiny warning light flickers on inside
          his helmet: IMPACT DETECTED.
                         
          Suddenly, a small drag chute EXPLODES from a panel on the
          back of suit, slowing his fall. Airbags EXPLODE on his legs
          and torso to cushion the impact.
                         
          Cooper SMASHES into the water.

          Cooper comes to underwater, as liquid is flowing into his
          suit from his shattered helmet.
           79.
                         
          Bubbles pour out from his suit and Cooper GASPS as his helmet
          fills with water and he begins to sink.
                         
          As he sinks, Cooper pulls off his helmet, then tears off
          pieces of his suit. He forces himself through the neck of
          the suit and then swims upward.
                         
          He is about to surface when he remembers where he is. He
          hesitates, just beneath the surface, lungs tightening as he
          runs out of oxygen.
                         
          EXT. SEA, ICE PLANET -- DAY
                         
          Cooper breaks the surface, COUGHS out water, and takes a
          panicked breath.
                         
          He waits. Nothing happens. He opens his mouth again and
          breathes in almost pure oxygen. He can breathe.
                         
          Treading water, he looks around. Spots lights in the water
          below nearby -- Brand, in her suit, is sinking.
                         
          He dives down and struggles to haul her up by the suit.
                         
          Cooper breaks the surface, looks at Brand. Her mask is also
          broken.
                         
                          COOPER
           Breathe. Trust me.
                         
          She refuses at first. Water is bubbling into her suit through
          the open mask. Finally, she takes a deep breath.
                         
                          COOPER (CONT'D)

          EXT. UNDERWATER -- DAY
                         
          Brand sinks. Cooper swims down, following her, ripping away
          at her suit. The tear-away seals on her suit are stuck fast,
          damaged in the fall.

          Cooper finally breaks them off. Brand pulls herself out,
          free, and they swim for the surface.

          Cooper drags himself out of the water and onto the beach.
          He turns back to offer Brand a hand. She waves him off.
                         
                          BRAND
           I don't need your help.

          They sit together, soaking wet, trying to catch their breath.

           Don't mention it.
                         
          Cooper feels the rocks beneath him, which are translucent,
          like glass, and polished to an impossible shine.
                         
          He looks up to see Case dragging Roth and Doyle, still in
          their suits, out of the water.
                         
          EXT. SHORE, ICE PLANET -- DAY
                         
          Doyle and Roth have stripped down from their suits and are
          breathing in the pure oxygen atmosphere.

                          COOPER

           Your guess is as good as mine.
                         
          Cooper hikes into the jungle to look for Brand.
                         
          EXT. JUNGLE, ICE PLANET -- DAY
                         
          Cooper finds Brand taking samples from the tree-like life-
          forms, which are wildly different from their counterparts
          back on Earth, piled in torturous coils, as if frozen in a
          struggle to punch through the canopy to reach the light above.
                         
                          BRAND
           This is incredible. The organisms
           trapped in the ice above absorb x-
           rays and emit light. In return,
           these plants absorb the light and
           emit oxygen, which feeds the animals
           trapped in the ice.
                         
          Brand cuts off a sample and drops it into the case. The
          transparent wall of the case magnifies the structure onto
          the glass automatically. She compares it with the flecks
          she collected in the ice above, fascinated.
           82.
                         
                          BRAND (CONT'D)
           Look at this. I think they're the
           same organism at a different stage
           of the life cycle.

           It's fractal. No individual cells --
           the structure repeats all the way
           down.
                         
          Cooper looks at the sample, then continues scanning the jungle
          around them, nervous.

           Cooper... are you nervous?
                         
          Cooper stops scanning the trees, embarrassed.
                         
                          COOPER
           I just think we should get back to
           the shelter before night falls.
                         
          Overhead, the light from the ice above begins to fade -- the
          neutron star must have orbited out of view. Night is falling.

           Faith has nothing to do with it.

           Nothing. I just -- I could have
           sworn it just moved.
                         
          She walks to the thick, knotted trunk of a tree. Puts a
          hand on it.
                         
          Overhead, the ice flickers out and the darkness begins to
          descend, more rapidly than on Earth.
                         
          Suddenly, the tree SHUDDERS. Then, the bark begins to ooze
          over Brand's fingers.
                         
          Brand snaps her hand away and steps back. Even for her,
          this is too much. She turns back to Cooper, who is looking
          at the jungle around them, spooked.

           No. There really aren't any rules.
                         
          All around them, the life-forms begins to melt toward the
          ground, breaking down into different, smaller forms.

          Cooper steps back as several pieces of the nearest tree drop
          onto the ground and begin scuttling toward him.

          A third piece climbs onto the first two, looking for a good
          place to hang on. After a moment it hunkers down on top,
          forming a crude head. Thirty eye-like structures blink open
          on the creature.
                         
          The skin of the life-form begins to flicker with a dim light
          like the animals trapped in the ice above, bathing Cooper
          and Brand in a warm glow.
                         
          The creature creeps closer to them, taking them in. Cooper
          tries his best to seem non-threatening.

          splits open and it BELLOWS.

           OK. Now we run.
                         
          Brand doesn't argue. They turn and sprint through the trees.
                         
          EXT. JUNGLE -- NIGHT
                         
          Cooper and Brand smash headlong through the jungle. At first,
          they're running from the rumbling, smashing melee behind
          them. But as they run, the entire jungle around them begins
          to break apart and move.
                         
          After a moment, they're surrounded. The jungle is completely
          disassembling itself into a million different pieces, each
          one a different size and shape than the others.
                         
                          COOPER
           We have to reach the shelter.
                         
          They head off, crashing through the melee.
                         
          EXT. SHORE, ICE PLANET -- NIGHT
                         
          Case, Doyle and Roth are standing in front of the shelter
          finishing the day's work.
                         
          Doyle turns around. The jungle is breaking apart and crawling
          down the beach towards them.
                         
                          DOYLE
           I think we've got a problem.
                         
          Case and Roth look up to see the organisms picking up speed
          as they move towards them.
                         
          Roth begins to step out towards them.
           85.
                         
                          ROTH
           Fascinating. I think-
                         
          Case grabs him by the arm and pushes him bodily into the
          shelter after Doyle.
                         
          Case pushes the door closed.
                         
          INT. SHELTER, ICE PLANET -- NIGHT
                         
          They crouch inside the shelter as the organisms begin POUNDING
          at the walls, trying to force their way inside.
                         
          It's going to be a long night.
                         
          EXT. JUNGLE, ICE PLANET -- NIGHT
                         
          Ahead, Cooper can see the gleaming water of the inland sea,
          light still flickering in patches from the ice above it.
                         
                          COOPER
           This way.
                         
          Brand begins to follow.
                         
                          BRAND
           No... wait.
                         
          Too late. Cooper forces his way between two writhing
          creatures, steps through, and falls...
                         
          EXT. WATERFALL -- NIGHT
                         
          Cooper gasps as he surfaces from the ice-cold water. Brand
          floats past.
                         
          The river appears to flow randomly down the slope, with good
          reason -- the forest rearranges itself every night.
                         
          Ahead, the ground drops away again and the water rushes over
          it in a torrent.
                         
          Cooper catches himself at the last minute, grabbing a thick
          tree branch with one hand and, a second later, Brand with
          the other as she slides past.
                         
                          COOPER
           I've got you.
                         
          Suddenly, the branch in Cooper's hand illuminates and wrenches
          itself out of the rock -- it's a limb of a huge colony
          organism. It shakes Cooper loose and they fall again...
           86.
                         
          EXT. POOL -- NIGHT
                         
          Brand surfaces first. She grabs Cooper and hauls him up and
          out of the water. She smiles down at him, a little smug.
                         
                          BRAND
           I've got you.
                         
          Creatures begin splashing down into the pool behind them, as
          if imitating them.
                         
          Cooper stumbles to his feet and Brand guides them backward
          into a small cave carved into the rock above the pool.
                         
          INT. CAVE -- NIGHT
                         
          Brand CRACKS a glow stick, basking the cave around them in a
          soft light.
                         
          As they watch, horrified, the pool and the rocks in front of
          the cave fill up with creatures of all sizes, as they tumble
          down the hill in what appears to be a battle royal.
                         
          For a moment, it looks like Brand and Cooper may go unnoticed.
          Then, a three-foot-tall creature with a dozen legs creeps
          its way toward the entrance to the cave. Another follows,
          and another, until the cave entrance is full.
                         
          Cooper looks around the cave, frantic. He picks up a rock.
          Brand, scared but still thinking, takes the rock from his
          hand and drops it back to the ground.
                         
                          BRAND
           It's game theory. The best move is
           always to cooperate at first.
                         
                          COOPER
           By "cooperate" do you mean let it
           eat me?
                         
                          BRAND
           These organisms have no interest in
           us. They survive by photosynthesis.
           All they need is light.
                         
                          COOPER
           Then why are they killing each other?
                         
                          BRAND
           I don't know.
                          (LOOKS AROUND)
           But we're outnumbered, Cooper. So
           unless you have a better idea, I
           suggest we make nice.
           87.
                         
          The creatures move toward them hesitantly, then faster.
                         
          Cooper stands stock still as the creatures gather around
          him. Several of them join up into bigger animals to get a
          better look at him.
                         
          One of them wraps itself around his chest and begins prodding
          at his shoulders, then his neck.
                         
                          COOPER
           (trying to be calm)
           What is it doing?
                         
                          BRAND
           It's a colony organism. It's trying
           to incorporate you into its structure.
                         
                          COOPER
           I don't want it to incorporate me.
                         
                          BRAND
           Don't open your mouth.
                         
                          COOPER
                          WHY N-
                         
          As he speaks, the creature on his chest extends four spindly,
          pointed feelers and reaches gently into his mouth.
                         
          Cooper holds his breath as the organism taps against his
          teeth. Its skin has a roughened texture, as if incomplete,
          and it appears to be searching for the same texture on
          Cooper's skin, without much luck.
                         
          Bored, the life-forms climb back down off of Cooper. The
          last two creatures link up in an imitation of Cooper's lower
          body and attempt to walk across the room like a human. After
          a moment, the creatures tumble to the ground and flail away.
                         
          Cooper is still breathing hard as the cave empties and he
          and Brand are left alone again.
                         
          Brand steps to the edge of the cave and watches, fascinated,
          as the creatures resume wrestling and battling each other.
                         
                          COOPER (CONT'D)
           They're killing each other.
                         
                          BRAND
           No. They don't bleed... they don't
           die... they're just competing...
           trying out different shapes, looking
           for the best one.
           88.
                         
          Cooper watches as a hideously-awkward-looking, five-legged
          beast stumbles past and tackles another animal.
                         
                          COOPER
           I'd say they have a long way to go.
                         
                          BRAND
                          (AMAZED)
           They do this every night.
                         
          As they watch, a two-foot-long creature with one huge claw
          scuttles along the ground, grabbing smaller opponents and
          smashing them apart, then sorting through the wreckage and
          adopting some of the writhing parts as its own.
                         
          Something about the movement is endearing, the way it
          experiments with each piece -- less like a massacre and more
          like an over-caffeinated self-assembling erector set.
                         
          Suddenly, a massive, lumbering creature SMASHES down in front
          of the claw beast. No match, the smaller creature turns to
          scuttle away. Too slow. The larger organism brings one
          club-like limb smashing down on top of it. After a moment,
          it lifts its claw -- the two animals have become one.
                         
          The new organism lumbers away through the jungle, happily
          snapping its new claw at larger opponents.
                         
                          BRAND (CONT'D)
           The behavior changes as the animals
           get bigger and bigger. More
           sophisticated. More calculated.
                         
          Two of the larger organisms square off, circling each other,
          lights pulsing up and down their bodies in a fierce display.
                         
                          COOPER
           But what are they competing for?
                         
                          BRAND
           I don't know.
                         
          Brand shivers -- it's getting colder.
                         
          INT. CAVE -- NIGHT
                         
          Brand and Cooper huddle around a small chemical fire they've
          brought with them.
                         
          Brand looks at the sample of the fractal wildlife in her
          case. It's moving around, splitting apart, reforming, trying
          to find a way out.
           89.
                         
                          BRAND
           These creatures are billions of years
           older than we are. But they're
           relatively primitive. They haven't
           developed tools, culture, language.
                         
                          COOPER
           Why not?
                         
                          BRAND
           I don't know. No one knows how
           intelligent life began on Earth.
           But the surface of this planet has
           virtually no craters. No impacts.
           It's been sheltered by the local
           black holes.
                         
                          COOPER

                          BRAND
           Maybe not enough has gone wrong here.
           Maybe bad luck is the key to
           intelligent life.

           Exactly. Maybe our interaction with

           Why is it so hard for you to accept

           us?
                         
          Cooper is silent for a moment. His mood darkens.
                         
                          COOPER
           I was in Denver during the first
           year of the famine. I was just a
           kid. We kept waiting for someone to
           come help us. People starved to
           death sitting on the ground, waiting
           for someone to come.

           (looks at her)
           I only made it because I realized
           that nobody was coming to save us.
           We were on our own.
                         
          Cooper looks away. The memories are never that far away.
                         
                          COOPER (CONT'D)
           Honestly? After the things I saw...
           you want to know why I don't believe
           that someone would be trying to help
           us? Because I'm not sure we're worth
           saving.
                         
          They sit in silence for a while.
                         
          EXT. CAVE -- NIGHT
                         
          Cooper sleeps. After a moment, Brand steps back out into
          the darkness.
                         
          EXT. PLAIN -- DAWN
                         
          Brand exhales great streams of frosted breath -- the
          temperature is well below freezing. The first flickers of
          light are visible in the ice above.
                         
          The creatures are huge now, forty or fifty feet tall, battling
          each other more and more slowly. As Brand watches, the
          largest of them beats down his rivals, climbing to the top
          of the heap.
                         
          Just as the beast reaches the top, it freezes, as if stuck.
                         
          Above, the ice begins to shine brighter and brighter.
                         
          Suddenly, the beast on top breaks apart, unfurling into planes
          to catch the light. This is what the contest has been about --
          a better place in the sun.
                         
          Brand takes it in.
                         
          EXT. JUNGLE -- DAY
                         
          Cooper and Brand pick their way their way through the foliage,
          which is now perfectly still, absorbing the light. Cooper
          looks at the plants, wary.
                         
          Brand sees his trepidation and laughs at him.
                         
                          BRAND
           They're not going to move now, Cooper.
           They need to spread themselves as
           thin as they can to absorb the light.
           91.
                         
          Cooper leads the way, pushing through the trees.
                         
          Suddenly he stops again. Brand, annoyed, pushes through the
          foliage to join him.
                         
                          BRAND (CONT'D)
           Cooper, honestly, you're a bit of a-
                         
          She stops. Cooper is standing at a sheer cliff.
                         
          Spread out on the plain below is a massive, fortified base.
                         
          INT. CHINESE FORTIFIED COLONY -- DAY
                         
          Massive blast doors, long since smashed in, open onto a
          building that has been overrun by the local fractal wildlife.
                         
          Case steps inside first, his worklights flickering on. Cooper
          and the others follow him in.
                         
          INT. MESS HALL, CHINESE COLONY -- DAY
                         
          The room is barely recognizable -- the fractal life has
          covered the tables and chairs. Water pools on the floor and
          light streams in from a massive hole the fractal animals
          have punched in the ceiling.
                         
                          DOYLE
           Looks like the Chinese picked a fight
           with the locals.
                         
                          COOPER
           Looks like they lost.
                         
          They continue through the ruins.
                         
          INT. BARRACKS, CHINESE COLONY -- DAY
                         
          The deeper they go, the less fractal wildlife they find.
          The barracks are pristine -- hundreds of perfectly made beds,
          waiting for colonists who never came, like one of the bunkers
          the federal government used to keep in case of nuclear winter.
                         
                          DOYLE
           Look at the size of this place.
           They built it for thousands of people.
           But no one came.
                         
          Brand looks around, determined.
                         
                          BRAND
           They will. We can salvage it. This
           place will save us years.

                          COOPER
           But why didn't they come?

                          (SHRUGS)
           The Chinese government collapsed,
           same as ours. The people who knew
           about this mission probably died
           years ago. We had the same problems.
                         
          Roth finds a sign he likes the look of -- it points to the
          science levels.
                         
          INT. LABORATORY, CHINESE COLONY -- DAY
                         
          A massive door GRINDS open and the team steps into a massive
          complex of underground laboratories.
                         
          INT. DAMAGED LAB, CHINESE COLONY -- DAY
                         
          Cooper and the others carefully make their way through a lab
          that has been completely emptied -- no desks, no chairs,
          nothing. The only thing that remains is a solid ball of
          matter in the center of the room.
                         
                          BRAND
           What happened here?
                         
          Roth stares at the ball, intrigued.
                         
                          ROTH
           They were testing something.
                         
          Cooper looks at the walls, which are bowed inwards.
                         
                          COOPER
           Testing what?
                         
          Roth is looking at the ball, which appears to have been built
          from layers of different material. The outermost layer is
          flattened steel.
                         
                          COOPER (CONT'D)
                          (LOOKING CLOSER)
           Is that a chair?
                         
          Roth looks. The outermost layer of the ball indeed looks
          like a steel chair, flattened with incredible force onto
          surface of the ball.
                         
          Brand opens the door to the next lab.
           93.
                         
          INT. LABORATORY, CHINESE COLONY -- NIGHT
                         
          The lab is empty, except for a large metal sphere on a
          pedestal in the center of the room. A black box is set into
          a cavity in the sphere, wired to a control panel.
                         
          Cooper looks at the walls of the room, which have been bowed
          inwards, as if some great force had been pulling from the
          center of the room.
                         
                          COOPER
           Everything in here is bolted down.

           Let's find out.
                         
          Roth finds a control panel. Wipes off an inch of dust and
          begins tinkering with the controls.
                         
                          COOPER
           I wouldn't turn it on until we can
           figure out what it does, Roth.
                         
          Roth continues to look over the controls, oblivious.
                         
           BRAND (O.S.)
           Cooper. Come look at this.

          beneath the lab level.
                         
          INT. OBSERVATORY, CHINESE COLONY -- DAY
                         
          Cooper steps into a huge space filled with a near perfect
          holographic representation of the local system.
                         
          Cooper joins Brand and Doyle in the map, looking at the
          incredibly detailed models of each star.
                         
          Case is standing at a terminal, hacking into the camp's
          records.

           No offense. Hang on.
                         
          Cooper punches a few keys into the terminal. Opens up the
          terminal. Scans the motherboard. Takes Case's rifle and
          SMASHES one of the chips on the board.
                         
          The terminal comes to life. Cooper hands Case his rifle.
                         
                          COOPER (CONT'D)

          Doyle is manipulating the time component of the map, slowing
          down the passage of time, reversing it, speeding it up.

           Look.
                         
          Doyle speeds up the map until the ice planet is nearly a
          blur, speeding in its orbit around Pantagruel.

           it's going to come close.
                         
          A tiny black hole soars through the system. Although it
          misses the ice planet, it deflects its orbit by a tiny degree.
          After a dozen more orbits, the ice planet dips down close to
          Pantagruel's event horizon and is torn apart.
                         
          Brand and the others watch as the sequence rewinds and repeats --
          the planet is pieced back together again and ejected, then
          pulled back in and torn apart. Over and over.

           A few years. A decade at most.

           So much for the plan.
                         
          Cooper looks at Brand. She is in disbelief, staring as a
          lifetime's training and optimism are torn to pieces.

          She looks at Cooper, questioning.
                         
                          COOPER
                          (GENTLE)

           we just don't understand it yet.
                         
          She looks down. She knows he doesn't believe what he's
          saying. He's been right all along -- they're alone.
                         
          For a tiny moment, all hope is lost.
                         
          Suddenly, with a distant RUMBLE, the building begins SHAKING.
                         
                          COOPER (CONT'D)

           It's nighttime. The native life-
           forms are mobile again.
                         
          The RUMBLE grows more intense, as if the entire building is
          being gently shaken.
                         
                          COOPER
           No. It's closer than that.

           Roth.
                         
          The RUMBLE grows. As Cooper watches, Case's rifle slides
          free of the desk. But instead of falling, it simply hangs
          in the air.
                         
          Then he realizes the same thing is happening to them -- his
          boots no longer have traction with the ground. After a second
          everything in the room is floating an inch off of the ground.
                         
                          COOPER (CONT'D)
           Quick -- hold onto something.
                         
          He reaches out to Brand but it's too late -- suddenly they're
          no longer floating, they're falling.
                         
          They're falling up.
           97.
                         
          Cooper, Brand and the rest of them hit the ceiling. Cooper
          picks himself up and adjusts to his surroundings -- up is
          now down. He helps Brand up.
                         
                          DOYLE
           What the hell is happening?
                         
          Case doesn't answer -- he's looking up at the control
          equipment for the holographic display, which is GROANING
          under a load it was never built to handle.
                         
          Case grabs Cooper and Brand and pushes them towards the
          stairwell as the control panel TEARS free of the floor and
          CRASHES towards them.
                         
          Cooper falls into the stairwell -- now they're being pulled
          up and sideways through the stairwell, like an Escher
          painting.
                         
          Brand pushes Cooper out of the way as debris from the control
          panel orbits past them back up towards the lab.
                         
          They try to hang on but the force is becoming irresistible,
          dragging them along the wall of the stairwell and back towards
          the lab upstairs.
                         
          Brand wedges herself against the railing as objects and debris
          are SMASHING against the door to the lab.
                         
          Doyle is trying to hang onto the handrail but his grip slips
          and he CRIES OUT as he falls towards the door to the lab,
          SMASHING it open. Doyle disappears up and into the lab.
                         
          Cooper slips trying to help Doyle. Brand reaches out for
          him...
                         
          Too late. Cooper is pulled through the open door.
                         
          INT. INTACT LAB, CHINESE COLONY -- NIGHT
                         
          Cooper is pulled through the door and past the control panel.
          He reaches out and grabs the underside of the panel.
                         
          He dangles, the panel cutting into the meat of his hand,
          trying to get his bearings:
                         
          Roth, Doyle, and everything that hasn't been bolted down is
          either pressed against the sphere in the center of the room
          or is orbiting around it.
                         
          Roth, who is laughing, jubilant, shouts up to him:
                         
                          ROTH
           The control panel is beneath you.
           See if you can turn it off.
           98.
                         
          Cooper slips as he tries to reach the controls. Finally he
          finds the controls for the machine.
                         
                          COOPER
                          (YELLS UP)
           I found it. Hold onto something.
                         
          Roth and Doyle crawl up the side of the mass and hold onto
          the support wires.
                         
          Cooper hits a key on the monitor.
                         
          Suddenly, the room inverts again, reverting to a normal
          gravitational field. Cooper floats for a second, then topples
          back to the ground, along with everything else.
                         
          Brand stumbles in to find Cooper sprawled on the floor as
          Roth and Doyle hang onto the sphere for dear life.

          Roth, back on terra firma, is looking at the tiny black box
          he's pried from the center of the sphere. Cooper is looking
          over his shoulder.
                         
                          COOPER

           Not make it. Adjust it. Dial it
           up, or down. I think they were
           experimenting with it -- firing these
           into the black hole to try to save
           this planet.
                         
                          DOYLE
           All that from one tiny box.
                         
          Roth has hooked the box up to a terminal and it scrolling
          through the incredibly sophisticated machine code, trying to
          parse how it works. Cooper looks on.

           It barely uses any power. I'm only
           beginning to understand what it does
           but I think it sends a signal out
           into the bulk. It must tap into the
           same technologies that were used to
           create the wormholes in the first
           place.

           probably doesn't exist inside our

           But how did the Chinese develop the

           maybe hundreds of years, to create.

           No. You're missing the bigger
           picture. The robots had strict
           mission parameters. They were told
           to build a colony and report back.
           They tried to. But they failed.
           Like us they were fixated on this
           place.
                         
          Cooper looks at Brand.
                         
                          ROTH (CONT'D)

           This. This is the prize.

          gathering space suits, equipment.
                         
          In the bustle, Cooper finds Brand sitting alone, staring at
          the sample of fractal life.
                         
                          COOPER
           I know this isn't exactly what you

           be right.

           That doesn't help this planet. This

           doesn't have anywhere to go.
                         
          The fractal organism almost seems to be looking at her, trying
          to comprehend. But it quickly loses interest and goes back
          to breaking itself into pieces and reforming into different
          shapes, trying to escape. Brand sets it back down.

          to the tree line. Something is moving.

          raised. They are wearing ghillie suits, pieced together
          from dried dead pieces of the local foliage.
                         
          Under their camouflage, they looks identical to Case. With
          one key difference -- faded red and gold insignias.
                         
          Case steps protectively in front of his team.

                          CASE
                          (LOW)
           Take the others up to the lander.
           Keep going. No matter what happens,
           don't come back for me.
                         
          Cooper nods.
                         
          Case moves. Fast. He FIRES one shot at the nearest robot,
          disabling it, then hurls himself at the remaining two,
          tackling them both over the edge of the ravine.
                         
          Cooper watches them disappear into the void below. Grabs
          Brand and the others.
                         
                          COOPER
           Come on.
                         
          Cooper picks up the rifle from the destroyed marine and begins
          hiking up the mountain.
                         
          EXT. MOUNTAIN PEAK -- DAY
                         
          The crew hike towards the ice above.
                         
          Below they hear a metallic BOOM as something heavy hits
          something else -- Case is still fighting. They keep moving.
                         
          EXT. UPPER MOUNTAIN PEAK -- TWILIGHT
                         
          They are high above the Marine camp, only fifty feet or so
          below the massive ice roof of the cavern. The Chinese have
          blasted a tunnel into the ice leading back up to the camp
          above.
           104.
                         
          This high, the air is bitterly cold. Cooper and the others
          are hunkered down, trying to keep warm, waiting for night to
          fall so that they can climb back up to the lander without
          being cooked by the neutron star.
                         
          Finally, above them, the light begins to flicker out. The
          crew begin pulling on their space suits.
                         
          Brand checks on the fractal wildlife in the sample case --
          she is bringing it with them. Cooper catches her eye.
                         
                          BRAND
           We can't leave them all to die.
                         
          She hefts the case and they begin climbing up into the ice.
                         
          EXT. SURFACE, ICE PLANET -- NIGHT
                         
          Brand leads the way, the lights from her suit cutting into
          the drifts of snow as they make their way slowly back to the
          lander.
                         
          As they reach the lander Cooper spots lights emerging from
          the ship. He raises Case's weapon.
                         
          One of Liu's marines steps around from the back of the lander.
          Cooper FIRES.
                         
          The marine collapses.
                         
          Cooper and the others race to the lander.
                         
                          BRAND
           Was that the last of them?
                         
                          DOYLE
           We're not going to stick around to
           count them. Let's get out of here.
                         
                          COOPER
           We're too late.
                         
          Cooper points to a damaged section of the ship's hull -- the
          marine has torn open a section, revealing damaged hardware.
                         
                          COOPER (CONT'D)
           The main thruster fuel supply. We're
           not going anywhere.
                         
          Cooper looks down. They're stuck here.
                         
                          DOYLE
           What about the escape rocket at the
           Chinese base camp? One of us could
           fit into it.
           105.
                         
                          BRAND
           It doesn't matter how many of us
           make it. We have to get this back
           to earth.
                         
          Roth looks at the moons orbiting overhead.
                         
                          ROTH
           Can the secondary thrusters still
           fire on the lander?
                         
          Doyle looks over the craft.
                         
                          DOYLE
           Sure. But we don't have nearly enough
           power for lift off.
                         
          Roth holds up the small gravity black box.
                         
                          ROTH
                          (SMILES)
           Yes we do.
                         
          Roth sets off running towards the Chinese base camp.
                         
          EXT. CHINESE BASE CAMP, ICE PLANET -- NIGHT
                         
          Cooper drags the pieces of the escape rocket out from the
          shelter. Assembly is semiautomatic -- Cooper lifts the pieces
          up and they snap together, forming a crude two-stage rocket
          designed more for a robot than a man.
                         
          When it's complete Roth wedges himself inside, clutching the
          black box -- he barely fits.
                         
                          ROTH
           I can reach one of the moons in low
           orbit and turn up its gravity. As
           it passes overhead it should be able
           to slingshot the lander away from
           the planet's surface.
                          (LOOKS AROUND)
           Along with everything else.
                         
                          COOPER
           But we need to take the box back to
           earth.
                         
                          ROTH
           You don't need this -- only the idea.
           The knowledge of how to build it.
                         
          Cooper remembers something. Heads back into the shelter.
           106.
                         
          INT. CHINESE BASE CAMP, ICE PLANET -- NIGHT
                         
          Roth follows Cooper into the lab.
                         
          Cooper opens the storage crate. Picks one of the probes at
          random. Sets it down on the bench next to Roth.
                         
          Cooper begins rigging up a connection between the two.
                         
                          COOPER
           I'm going to image the operating
           code and the architecture onto the
           probe's hard drive. It'll be garbled,
           but it should give you and me enough
           to rebuild it when we get back.
                         
          Cooper looks at the probe filling up with data.
                         
                          ROTH
           Not me. But you'll make it work.
                         
          The transfer is complete. Roth hands Cooper the probe, and
          takes the black box himself.
                         
                          ROTH (CONT'D)
           This is a one-way trip for me.
                         
          Before Cooper can respond, Roth heads for the door.
                         
          EXT. CHINESE BASE CAMP, ICE PLANET -- NIGHT
                         
          Roth squeezes himself into the rocket, hugging the black box
          to his chest. Cooper and Brand help him.
                         
                          BRAND
           This isn't right, Roth. We can find
           a way for all of us to leave.
                         
                          ROTH
           This is the only way. Keep the lander
           upright and fire the secondary
           boosters when the moon passes
           overhead.
                         
                          COOPER
           Let me take it.
                         
                          ROTH
           No. You need to make it home. You're
           going to need to build more of these.
                         
          Brand looks at him, heartbroken. Roth smiles.
           107.
                         
                          ROTH (CONT'D)
           I understand the plan, now. Whatever
           happens, you have to keep exploring.
           Keep learning. One good idea isn't
           enough. You'll need more and more
           of them just to survive. Do you
           understand?
                         
                          BRAND
                          (NODS)
           Thank you.
                         
                          ROTH
           Go.
                         
          Brand turns to follow Cooper back.
                         
          Behind her, Roth's rocket LAUNCHES on an explosive cloud.
          In seconds it's high overhead.
                         
          EXT. LANDER -- NIGHT
                         
          Cooper checks over the hull, which is intact. Doyle is inside
          looking over the controls. He steps back outside.
                         
                          DOYLE
           Control systems inside are online.
                          (LOOKS UP)
           I've lost sight of the rocket. Do
           you think he made it?
                         
                          COOPER
           We're going to find out soon enough.
                         
          Brand is looking off into the distance.
                         
                          BRAND
           Someone's coming.
                         
          Cooper looks up. A robotlike figure is limping through the
          snowstorm towards them. Cooper raises the rifle.
                         
          Finally he makes out the insignia -- it's Case.
                         
          Cooper and Doyle run out towards him. They reach Case as he
          collapses in the snow. He's badly injured -- one leg torn
          off at the knee, one arm mangled.
                         
          Doyle and Cooper drag the crippled robot back into the ship.
                         
          INT. LANDER -- NIGHT
                         
          They drag Case into the lander. Doyle checks over the ship's
          controls.
           108.
                         
                          DOYLE
           Close the door.
                         
          Cooper moves to the door. Something's wrong.
                         
                          COOPER
           Where's Brand?
                         
          She's nowhere to be seen. Cooper looks out onto the ice.
          Brand is heading back out into the snow.
                         
                          COOPER (CONT'D)
           Dammit. If I don't make it back,
           just keep going.
           (points to probe)
           Get that thing home.
                         
          Cooper steps to the door.
                         
          EXT. SPACE ABOVE ICE PLANET
                         
          The rocket tucks in close behind one of the moons orbiting
          the ice planet.
                         
          The rocket fires to maneuver closer and closer to the moon's
          surface -- the tiny moon doesn't provide enough gravity to
          attract it.
                         
          When the rocket is close enough, Roth detonates the explosive
          bolts holding him inside and leaps for the moon's surface.
                         
          He scrambles to grab hold of the craggy surface. Behind
          him, the rocket smashes apart against the surface.
                         
          Roth finally gets a good hold. He looks down.
                         
          Below him, the view is incredible -- the ice planet curving
          into the distance, Gargantua rising over its horizon.
                         
          Roth looks at the black box in his hands.
                         
          EXT. SURFACE, ICE PLANET -- NIGHT
                         
          Brand is a hundred yards from the lander by the time Cooper
          catches up with her. She is digging in the snow.
                         
          He takes her arm but she won't go.
                         
          She finally finds what she's looking for -- the sample case.
          The tiny fractal life-form is huddled at the bottom.
                         
          Cooper shakes his head and turns back to the lander.
           109.
                         
          EXT. MOON, SPACE OVER ICE PLANET
                         
          Roth is watching the ice planet pass by beneath him. He
          finally sees the distant peaks of the mountain range as it
          punctures the ice near the Chinese camp.
                         
          For a moment he enjoys the view -- the distant hulk of
          Gargantua rising over the horizon of the shining ice planet.
                         
          He takes a final breath and activates the black box.
                         
          Instantly, the moon's gravity is magnified a hundred million
          times over. Roth is instantly crushed as the moon collapses
          around him into a tiny sphere.
                         
          EXT. SURFACE, ICE PLANET -- NIGHT
                         
          Cooper and Brand are only thirty yards or so from the lander.
                         
          Suddenly, the ground beneath them begins to RUMBLE.
                         
          Cooper turns back. A mile back the ground begins to tear
          apart, heaving massive chunks of ice and rock into the sky.
                         
          Roth's moon is racing overhead, TEARING up a massive strip
          of the surface's planet as it nears them.
                         
          Cooper and Brand run.
                         
          EXT. MOON, SPACE OVER ICE PLANET
                         
          The energy being unleashed by the tiny box is incredible --
          millions of times more powerful than an atomic bomb.
                         
          The spray of debris is forming a rooster tail behind the
          moon, rocketing up from the planet's surface.
                         
          EXT. LANDER, SURFACE, ICE PLANET -- NIGHT
                         
          Cooper has almost made it back to the lander. Behind him,
          Brand stumbles. He turns back.
                         
          Brand is pulling herself up. Behind her, the THUNDEROUS
          EXPLOSIONS as a strip of the planet's surface is hurled into
          space have almost reached them.
                         
          Cooper looks at the ship. He'll never make it if he waits
          for Brand. He turns back to find her.
                         
          He reaches Brand just as the moon's gravity hits them --
          they're hurtled off into space. He grabs her hand.
                         
          Seconds later, everything -- the entire ice sheet, the sea
          and rocks deep below -- is hurled up after them.
           110.
                         
          Brand and Cooper embrace as they rocket up through the thin
          atmosphere.
                         
          Brand looks at him.
                         
                          BRAND
                          (RADIO)
           You caught me. Now what?
                         
          Cooper looks around. They planet's surface is breaking into
          pieces around them.
                         
                          COOPER
                          (RADIO)
           I don't know.
                          (RADIO)
           I figured if you were floating out
           into space, you'd want some company.
                         
          He holds onto her as they fall up and out of the last of the
          planet's thin atmosphere and the blackness embraces them.
                         
                          BRAND
           Between you and utter solitude,
           Cooper, frankly, I'm not sure.
                         
          They reach the apex of their climb and the gravity of the
          planet begins to win out. For a moment they float.
                         
                          COOPER
           Guess you were right -- too much
           gravity, or not enough.
                         
          He smiles, forgetting their predicament for a moment. They
          stare into each other's eyes.
                         
          Then they begin, very gently, to fall back towards the ice
          planet.
                         
          Suddenly, the lander maneuvers beneath them. The airlock
          opens to catch them -- Doyle is at the helm.
                         
          Brand and Cooper pull themselves aboard.
                         
          INT. LANDER
                         
          Cooper closes the door and Doyle rotates the lander outwards.
                         
          Doyle FIRES the engines and the lander continues ascending
          into space as the debris around them begins crashing back
          down towards the ice planet.
                         
          Cooper looks out the window:
           111.
                         
          The moon continues tearing up a massive canyon in the planet's
          surface as it circles out of view.
                         
                          COOPER
           Roth.
                         
                          BRAND
           He's gone.
                         
          Ahead, a shadow looms in the darkness: the Endurance.
                         
          INT. OBSERVATION DECK, ENDURANCE
                         
          Brand, Cooper, and Doyle pull themselves out of the airlock
          and scramble to take control of the ship.
                         
          Below them, the surface of the ice planet illuminates as the
          neutron star's x-rays begin to reach it from the far side of
          Pantagruel.
                         
          Doyle finally gets the ship straightened out. Its sole
          remaining engine FIRES, rocketing the ship back towards the
          dark side of the planet, out of view of the neutron star,
          and back towards the original wormhole.
                         
                          DOYLE
           I'm setting a course for the wormhole.
                         
          They're going to make it.
                         
          Cooper and Brand make eye contact -- Brand gives him a tiny
          awkward smile. He returns it, then descends below.
                         
          INT. OUTER HULL, ENDURANCE
                         
          Cooper props Case up against the workbench. He pulls down
          replacement arms and legs from storage bins. Unwraps them
          from their vacuum sealed plastic and bolts them back onto
          Case's chassis.
                         
          Cooper finishes attaching the arm. Case rotates it, checking
          the function.
                         
                          COOPER
           How is that working?
                         
                          CASE
           Very well, thank you.
                         
                          COOPER
           Good. We've already set the course,
           skipper. We're going home.
                         
          Cooper hauls himself back up into the observation level.
           112.
                         
          INT. OBSERVATION LEVEL
                         
          Doyle is setting the controls. The ALARMS on the controls
          have finally abated -- they're out of the danger zone.
                         
                          BRAND
           We're safe now.
                         
          Cooper heads to the communications equipment.
                         
                          COOPER
           Now I know why we weren't able to
           hit the relay. It's not interference --
           the blue-shift from the black hole
           is more than we thought it would be.
                         
          Cooper begins re-calibrating the equipment.
                         
                          BRAND
                          (CONFLICTED)
           Cooper, wait--
                         
          The ship PINGS the relay on the far side of the wormhole.
                         
          There is no response.
                         
                          COOPER
           Nothing.
                          (THINKS)
           Wait. The ship cached one long
           garbled transmission when we first
           fell into the swirl. If we account
           for the blue shift then the computer
           might find something in there.
                         
          Cooper brings up the last garbled transmission they received.
          The computer begins re-analyzing it, piece by piece.
                         
                          BRAND
                          (QUIET)
           Listen to me -- the blueshift also
           means we've lost time. More time
           than we thought we would.
                         
          Cooper looks up at her.
                         
                          COOPER
           How much?
                         
                          BRAND
           A lot... Cooper, maybe it's best if
                          WE DON'T-
                         
          The comms equipment TONES as it translates a packet. Then
          another.
           113.
                         
          Then a FLOOD of communications, one packet a day, hundreds
          and hundreds of packets: images, videos, audio messages from
          family and friends.
                         
          Cooper watches, horrified, as the images play out across the
          screen. He is watching the lives of his family play out at
          light speed. Finally, the packets slow, then stop.
                         
          Cooper looks at the results, in shock.
                         
                          COOPER
           Forty seven years.
                         
          Doyle joins him, staring at the screen, stunned.
                         
                          DOYLE
           My kids...
                         
          Cooper tries to PING the relay again. Nothing comes back.
                         
                          BRAND
                          (GENTLE)
           The relay will have lost power years
           ago. That's why we couldn't contact
           it, even after we reached the planet.
                         
          Cooper is still problem solving, thinking.
                         
                          COOPER
           We could bypass the relay. Send a
           conventional shortwave signal.
                         
                          BRAND
           Only a tiny portion of the signal
           would make it though the wormhole.
           Besides, no one will be listening
           anymore.
                         
          The comms screen is dead. No movement. Nothing.
                         
          Cooper looks at Brand, realizing something.
                         
                          COOPER
           You knew, didn't you? You and Case
           figured it out when we landed.
                         
          Brand looks down.
                         
                          BRAND
           I thought... I couldn't be sure.
                         
                          COOPER
           Sure you could. You're brilliant.
           You know everything.
           114.
                         
                          BRAND
           Cooper... we needed to keep going.
           I'm so sorry. Your children...
                         
                          COOPER
           They're not children any more... if
           they're even still alive.
                         
          He turns away from her.
                         
                          BRAND
           Listen, the important thing is that
           we're going home, now. And we have
           something that can save everyone.
           It's more important than the people
           we left behind-
                         
          Doyle cuts her off, filled with anger.
                         
                          DOYLE
           That's easy for you to say. You
           didn't leave anyone behind.
                         
          Cooper looks at Brand, his anger softened by sadness.
                         
                          COOPER
           Yes she did.
                         
          Brand looks at him, grateful for this small kindness.
                         
                          COOPER (CONT'D)
           That's why you were upset -- your
           father.
                         
          She looks down, filled with sadness.
                         
                          BRAND
           He's gone. But there are other people
           who still need our help. There's
           still time...
                         
          The ship's controls TONE in ALARM. Brand and Cooper turn:
                         
          Case is standing at the controls.
                         
                          BRAND (CONT'D)
           Case... what are you doing?
                         
          Case finishes typing in a sequence on the command controls.
          Presses the "execute" button.
                         
          The last nuclear engine begins to detach from the ship.
                         
                          BRAND (CONT'D)
           Wait... no...
           115.
                         
          The robot turns from them. Cooper notices that the control
          module snapped into the back of Case's chassis is wrong:
                         
          It's red with a gold star. It's not Case at all. It's Liu.
                         
                          LIU
           I'm sorry. I have my orders. No
           one follows...
                         
          Liu stares, satisfied, as the nuclear engine spins away from
          the ship and back down toward Pantagruel.
                         
          Cooper SMASHES Liu from behind. The robot tumbles to the
          ground, the fight gone out of him.
                         
          Cooper and Doyle roll the robot over and Cooper reaches for
          his control module.
                         
                          LIU (CONT'D)
           No one follows-
                         
          Cooper rips the module out. The robot freezes.
                         
          Brand is already at the controls, trying to regain control.
                         
          The instruments TONE, alerting the crew to their position:
                         
          The ship is spinning back down towards the black hole.
                         
                          BRAND
           No... We're being pulled back to
           Pantagruel.
                         
          Cooper, frantically checks the controls, firing the remaining
          boosters.
                         
                          COOPER
           We can't let that happen. We'll
           lose more time... too much...
                         
          The boosters are no match for the deadly pull of the black
          hole below them.
                         
          On the ship's guidance, they watch, helpless, as the ship
          climbs back up the volcano rim towards the critical orbit.
                         
          As on their first trip, the black hole grows to dominate the

          The screen cuts out.
                         
          The next message begins. Tom is in his 30s.
                         
                          TOM (CONT'D)
           Hi, Dad. I'm sorry it's been awhile.
                         
          He stops, emotional.
                         
                          TOM (CONT'D)
           Grandpa died last week. We buried
           him out in the back forty, next to
           Mom.
                          (LOOKS DOWN)
           Where we'd have buried you, if you'd
           ever come back.
                         
          He laughs, gallows humor.
                         
                          TOM (CONT'D)
           Murph was there for the funeral.
           It's been a few years since I've
           seen him. He's been down in the
           Gulf Coast. He's an engineer. I
           guess someone followed in your
           footsteps after all.
                         
          Tom looks down.
                         
                          TOM (CONT'D)
           You're not listening to this. I
           know that. All of these messages
           are just out there, drifting in the
           darkness.
                         
          He stops for a second.
                         
                          TOM (CONT'D)
           You're gone. You're never coming
           back. And I've known that for a
           long time. Lois says -- that's my
           wife, Dad -- she says I have to let
           you go. So I am.
           123.
                         
          He reaches up to turn off the camera.
                         
                          TOM (CONT'D)
           Wherever you are, I hope you're at
           peace. Goodbye, Dad.
                         
          The image freezes, Tom's hand on the camera, then breaks
          apart into digital noise.
                         
          Then nothing.
                         
          Cooper looks at it for a second. Then rises to leave.
                         
          Suddenly, the screen flickers to life again.
                         
          A good-looking man in his late 30s turns on a camera. Cooper
          recognizes him instantly. It's Murph.
                         
          Murph looks at the camera for a long beat, clearly unsure
          about this.
                         
                          MURPH
           Hello, Dad. You sonofabitch.
                         
          He laughs, self-conscious.
                         
                          MURPH (CONT'D)
           It's your 60th birthday today.
           Thought I would celebrate with you a
           bit.
                          (BEAT)
           I guess I understand why you left.
           The corn is dying now, too.
           Tom says there's less and less at
           harvest every year.
                         
          He pauses. Lifts up his hand and scratches his stubble.
                         
          Cooper pauses the message. He looks carefully at the screen:
                         
          Murph is wearing his dad's watch.
                         
          Cooper lets the message play. Tears are streaming down his
          face.
                         
                          MURPH (CONT'D)
           Rot's setting in. I guess you were
           right for clearing out while you had
           the chance.
           (reaches up to switch
                          OFF CAMERA)
           Good luck, old man. I hope you made
           it. I really do.
                         
          The video cuts out.
           124.
                         
          A message appears on the screen:
                         
          "Final transmission." Relay powered down 05232087
                         
          Cooper turns off the screen.
                         
          INT. CREW QUARTERS, ENDURANCE
                         
          Cooper is seated, alone. Almost every compartment has been
          opened and emptied -- debris is swirling through the
          compartment.
                         
          Brand walks in. They sit in silence for a moment. When
          Cooper speaks, it's clear his sadness has faded to a gallows
          humor.
                         
                          COOPER
           Not a single drink on the whole ship.
           What kind of mission is this?
                         
                          BRAND
           I think Doyle's been experimenting
           with the coolant from his spacesuit.
                         
          They sit in silence for a moment.
                         
                          COOPER
           You really think we're the last humans
           alive anywhere?
                         
                          BRAND
           I don't know. Maybe.
           (looks him in the eye)
           Yes.
                         
                          COOPER
           So that's it, then? That's all?
                         
          He looks down, saddened by his own words.
                         
                          BRAND
                          (QUIET)
           It's happened a billion times over.
           Stars explode. The pieces drift in
           space. Gravity pulls them back
           together. They form new stars.
           Then planets. Then us. We die. It
           starts all over again.
                         
          Cooper shakes his head.
                         
                          COOPER
           What about the plan? The grand
           scheme.
           125.
                         
                          BRAND
           I thought you didn't believe in one.
                         
                          COOPER
           I didn't. But you were bringing me
           round.
                         
          He laughs, his anger coming and going in waves.
                         
                          COOPER (CONT'D)
           What the hell was the point? What
           did it add up to?
                         
                          BRAND
           I don't know. Maybe it just adds up
           to this.
                         
                          COOPER
           This? You're saying the end result
           of ten billion years is the atoms
           from dead stars standing here
           disagreeing with each other.
                         
          She smiles at him. Bittersweet.
                         
                          BRAND
           Maybe that's enough.
                         
          He turns away from her. She takes his shoulder.
                         
          She pulls him into a kiss. His surprise disappears and he
          pulls her to him, kissing her back.
                         
          Their surroundings forgotten, they drift. She LAUGHS gently
          as they bump into a wall and he pushes off of it, sending
          them spinning back into the center of the cabin.
                         
          She pulls his shirt off and it hangs in space. In moments,
          the cabin is filling with discarded clothes, different colors
          and shapes, like a ticker tape parade.
                         
          In the center of the cabin, Brand and Cooper make love.
                         
          INT. CREW QUARTERS, ENDURANCE -- LATER
                         
          Cooper and Brand embrace, sleeping, drifting in the cabin.
                         
          Suddenly, Doyle's voice calls out from the other cabin.
                         
           DOYLE (O.S.)
           It's happening... it's happening
           again... Get up here...
                         
          Cooper wakes, careful not to disturb Brand. He plucks his
          shirt from the floating laundry pile and pulls it on.
           126.
                         
          INT. OBSERVATION DECK, ENDURANCE
                         
          Cooper hauls himself up into the upper cabin. Doyle is
          standing in the middle of the chamber.
                         
                          DOYLE
           They just appeared.
                         
          A sphere of distortion, like the one they encountered in the
          first wormhole, is directly in front of Doyle, hovering at a
          point in the middle of the cabin.
                         
          Doyle points a finger gently at the sphere, which grows in
          response.
                         
          Brand pulls herself into the cabin. Several more points
          appear, as if they've been summoned by the first.
                         
          Some of the points twist, some of them spin, and some of
          them are motionless.
                         
                          BRAND
           I think these are the creatures that
           built the wormhole.
                         
          One of them begins to move closer to Cooper.
                         
                          COOPER
           This thing is made of... gravity?
                         
                          BRAND
           No. I don't think it's in our
           universe at all. I think it lives
           in the bulk -- the space that the
           wormholes traverse. And it can only
           interact with us using gravity.
                         
          The shape playfully grows around Cooper's hand, bending the
          space it's in, stretching the skin.
                         
          Doyle GASPS as the sphere nearest him moves through his body,
          coming to rest in the middle and bending his entire torso
          like a fun house mirror.
                         
          Suddenly, the sphere wrapped around Cooper's hand begins
          moving, tugging him gently through the cabin.
                         
          In the next moment, all three of them are being propelled
          through the cabin.
                         
          It's a magical moment -- a communion, a dance between
          creatures on either side of a massive, invisible wall.
                         
          Doyle exclaims like a kid on a roller coaster as he is whirled
          around the room.
           127.
                         
          Cooper and Brand collide with each other for a second as the
          bulk beings move them through space. They hold onto each
          other for a moment and then are pulled apart again as the
          whirling dance continues.
                         
          Even the fractal creature is involved -- inside its cage, a
          tiny distortion ripples its fractal skin. The creature breaks
          apart and plays with the distortion around its enclosure.
                         
          Finally, Brand disengages from the dance and pulls herself
          around the lab, looking for some way to try to communicate
          with the creatures.
                         
          She finds two heavy pieces of engineering equipment and moves
          them close to each other, then far apart.
                         
          The bulk beings soon join her, mimicking the motion of the
          pieces of equipment.
                         
                          COOPER
           Can we communicate with them?
                         
                          BRAND
           Where would we even start? Maybe--
                         
          She pull a bag of ball bearings out of a storage bin and
          tears the bag open, releasing a cloud of the tiny shining
          globes into the air.
                         
          For a moment, nothing happens. Then, the distortions begin
          moving through the bearings, shifting them, rearranging them
          into patterns in the air.
                         
          First, they rearrange the ball bearings into clusters, then
          shapes spinning around each other -- planets orbiting around
          a medium-sized star.
                         
                          DOYLE
           That's our solar system.
                         
          After a moment the ball bearings break apart again and
          rearrange into a larger, more complicated system -- Gargantua,
          Pantagruel, and the ice planet.
                         
          Finally, the bearings compress to a two-dimensional sheet.
          Inside the sheet, one solitary ball bearing orbits around
          the stars and then pushes up, off of the sheet, into an
          umbrella shaped space that rises up from the sheet.
                         
                          COOPER
           What is that?
                         
          Brand looks at the tiny particle, floating alone above its
          universe.
           128.
                         
                          BRAND
           That's us. That's where they've
           brought us. We're in the bulk.
                         
          Cooper and Doyle stare at the particle. The map is static
          now.
                         
          Cooper looks around. The distortions have gone. The
          instruments on the ship TONE in alarm.
                         
          Cooper walks through the map, sending the ball bearings
          scattering. He hurries to the instruments. The ship is
          moving -- picking up speed at a huge rate.
                         
                          BRAND (CONT'D)
           They're moving us.
                         
                          DOYLE
           Where?
                         
          They stand, looking out into the perfect darkness.
                         
          EXT. ENDURANCE, VACUUM
                         
          The ship begins to close in on something in the darkness: a
          tiny point of light.
                         
          As they grow closer, they realize that it's an opening.
          They are inside a massive, hollow sphere. They have been
          the entire time.
                         
          The ship is guided out through the opening at the crown of
          the sphere.
                         
          Below them is an astonishing sight:
                         
          Our entire universe, compressed into a flattened disc, like
          a floor of stars. They are hovering above it, in the bulk,
          the space between universes.
                         
          INT. ENDURANCE, BULK
                         
          Brand and the others stare at the incredible display.
                         
          The ship drops down and begins to orbit around the massive
          hollow sphere between them and our universe, lower and lower
          until it is skimming just above the surface of the sphere.
                         
          In the distance, they can make out a cluster of lights.
                         
                          COOPER
           There's something out there.
                         
          The cluster of lights grows as they are propelled closer:
           129.
                         
          It's a massive space station, built onto the surface of the
          sphere.
                         
          EXT. SPACE STATION
                         
          The Endurance glides to a gentle stop on one of the upper
          decks of the space station.
                         
          After a moment, the airlock to the ship opens and Cooper and
          the others step out, in their suits.
                         
          They walk up to the airlock doors of the station, which open
          automatically.
                         
          INT. SPACE STATION
                         
          After the airlock decompresses, the inner doors open.
          Standing there, waiting for them, is a familiar figure:
                         
          Tars.
                         
                          TARS
                          (DEADPAN)
           I guess this isn't robot heaven after
           all.
                         
          The light on his brow glows and he offers them both a hand.
                         
          INT. GRAND LABORATORY, SPACE STATION
                         
          The humans have taken off their space suits -- the station
          has been built to be habitable by humans -- and are following
          Tars through the massive facility.
                         
                          TARS
           I orbited the black hole seven times
           before I hit the second wormhole.
           Then I drifted until I found this

                          TARS
           They didn't. It took them four
           thousand.

           Because I've been waiting for you
           for three hundred years.
                         
          Brand looks around at the massive facility.
                         
                          BRAND
           Time. That's what the bulk beings
           wanted to give us. That was the
           treasure the Chinese found. Enough
           time to let us save ourselves.
                         
          Brand looks around. The facility is massive. She sets the
          specimen case down on a table. Even the tiny creature seems
          in awe of the place.
                         
          INT. LABORATORY, SPACE STATION
                         
          Tars shows them a prototype for the gravity machine. It is
          tiny -- increasing G around two spheres that attract each
          other with a tiny force.
                         
                          TARS
           I have catalogued almost everything

                          COOPER
           How are they keeping the lights on
           in this thing?
                         
          Tars, in answer, points to a far door.
                         
                          TARS
           Follow me.
                         
          INT. ENGINE ROOM, SPACE STATION
                         
          A massive reinforced-concrete shell shudders with the energy
          contained within it. The whole room HUMS with power.
                         
          Tars pulls up a display showing the inside of the shell:
                         
          A tiny black hole spins, spewing out massive amounts of power.
           131.
                         
                          TARS
           It's a mini black hole. A remnant
           of the big bang. It will power this
           place forever.
                         
          Tars leads them on.
                         
          EXT. HANGAR, SPACE STATION
                         
          Tars leads them past an incredibly sleek fleet of spacecraft.
          Cooper starts to stop, but Tars doesn't slow down.
                         
          INT. SIMULATION ROOM
                         
          In the center of the room is a giant holographic globe of
          the Earth, perfect down to the tiniest detail.
                         
                          COOPER
           It's a map?
                         
                          TARS
           No. Not a map. This is a simulation
           of the Earth. A perfect simulation.
                         
          Tars touches the control panel. The map zooms in over Europe.
          Down onto Paris. Late 20th century:
                         
          People walk through the streets. A woman stops at a newsagent
          to buy a newspaper.
                         
          Tars touches the controls again and the map zooms out.
                         
                          TARS (CONT'D)
           They tested each of the technologies
           hundreds of times, trying to find
           the one that would cause the least
           damage and still allow us to leave
           Earth.
                         
          Suddenly, the map lights up with atomic explosions in every
          city. The sequence stops, rewinds.
                         
          This time, sped up, the Earth seems to be drying up -- great
          swaths of desert grow across Europe and Asia. Massive
          circular ships are constructed all over the face of the Earth.
                         
                          TARS (CONT'D)
           This was their best solution. A
           massive version of the box we found
           on the ice planet, allowing the entire
           human population to escape.
                         
          At a given moment, the gravity of the Earth is dropped to
          nothing and the massive ships, filled with the entire
           132.
                         
          population of the Earth, lift gently off of the planet in
          search of greener pastures.
                         
          Cooper turns away from the machine, bitter.
                         
                          COOPER
           So why didn't they return? Why didn't
           they save us?
                         
          Brand is staring at the massive map.
                         
                          BRAND
           Because they were too late. By the
           time they found this place, the people
           who sent them were dead. They were
           unable to fulfill their mission.
                         
          Tars points to the next room.
                         
                          TARS
           That was the final problem they tried
           to solve.
                         
          Tars moves on.
                         
          EXT. PLATFORM, SPACE STATION
                         
          Above them, the blackness of the sky is punctuated with
          hundreds of crystal shapes, faintly leaking starlight:
                         
          Wormholes. Brand looks up at them, entranced.
                         
                          BRAND
           Where do they lead?
                         
          Tars looks at an illuminated schematic on one wall, mapping
          some of the wormholes.
                         
                          TARS
           There are millions of them, connecting
           virtually every planetary system in
           the universe. There are thousands
           in our galaxy alone. But the Chinese
           stopped mapping them when they found
           what they were looking for.
                         
          Tars walks further. He stops.
                         
          The platform in front of them is dominated by a gigantic
          version of the black box that Roth found on the ice planet,
          connected to a massive power array, and pointing into the
          dark space above the sphere.
           133.
                         
                          TARS (CONT'D)
           This was their final creation. They
           had to capture the mini black hole
           just to have enough power to try it.
                         
          Several miles above the black box, one of the wormholes glows
          far brighter than the others, crackling with radiation.
                         
                          DOYLE
           What does it do?
                         
          Cooper steps forward. Runs a hand on the cold, strange
          material the antenna is made out of. He knows exactly what
          it does.
                         
                          COOPER
           They weren't interested in the other
           wormholes because their mission was
           to return home. That one leads back
           to Earth. The Earth they were told
           to return to.
                         
          Tars walks to the controls for the device.

                          TARS
           It was only used once. The Chinese
           team attempted to travel back in

           slow things down, but you can't ever
           go back. Our home is gone.

           You listened to all of those messages

          INT. CHINESE SPACESHIP
                         
          Cooper is checking over the controls of the ship. Brand
          walks in.
                         
                          BRAND
           I came to say goodbye.
                         
          Cooper looks up at her.
                         
          INT. HANGAR, SPACE STATION
                         
          Cooper walks Brand back to the Endurance. The ship is packed
          up and repaired. Brand is looking over their work.
                         
                          COOPER
           You could have taken one of the other
           ships.
                         
                          BRAND
           This one's done all right by us so
           far.
                         
          Brand holds up a small sample case containing half of the
          fractal life-form.
                         
                          BRAND (CONT'D)
           Will you take this with you? It's
           the last of its kind as well. Thought
           we should double its chances of
           survival. In case I'm wrong.
                         
          Cooper takes the sample and looks at the tiny creature inside,
          trying to escape. He sets it inside the ship. Turns back
          to her.
                         
                          COOPER
           Where are you going to go?
                         
                          BRAND
           I don't know. Up there, I guess.
                         
          She points up into the great darkness above them.
                         
          Tars steps down. Moves over to them.
                         
                          COOPER
           You're going, too?
                         
                          TARS
           I'm curious. It's my nature. See
           you down the road?
                         
          Tars shakes Cooper's hand. Heads onto the Endurance.
           136.
                         
                          BRAND
           Come with us. Please. You wanted
           your whole life to explore. This is
           your chance.
                         
          Cooper stares at her. This is what he has always wanted.
          And he has to turn it down.
                         
                          COOPER
           I'm sorry. I have to find out what
           happened to my sons. I promised
           them.
                         
          Brand sees the resolve in his eyes. Knows there's no way to
          change his mind.
                         
                          BRAND
           You're a man who keeps his promises.
           Make me one-
                         
          She takes his hand.
                         
                          BRAND (CONT'D)
           After you're done... come find me.
                         
                          COOPER
           I promise.
                         
          They kiss passionately. Not wanting it to end but knowing
          that it must. Reluctantly, they separate. Brand turns back
          to the ship.
                         
          She pulls herself onto the ship. Cooper steps back outside
          and watches through the tiny window as the Endurance lifts
          off and disappears into the darkness.
                         
          Cooper turns away.
                         
          EXT. PLATFORM, SPACE STATION
                         
          Cooper watches as radiation pours out of the wormhole high
          above them.
                         
          INT. CHINESE SPACESHIP
                         
          Cooper pulls himself on board. Doyle is at the controls.
          He keys the controls and the ship lifts off.
                         
                          DOYLE
           Let's go home.
                         
          The two men sit in silence as the ship arcs away from the
          space station and closes in on the wormhole.
                         
          Cooper hears a familiar CHIRP. He turns around:
           137.
                         
          The probe they took from the ice planet is belted securely
          into one of the seats, filled with the garbled machine code
          of the gravitational machine.
                         
                          COOPER
           The probe...
                         
          Doyle looks back.
                         
                          DOYLE
           We get back to earth, you and I can
           try to make sense of the code.
           Rebuild the gravity machine.
                         
          Cooper stares at it, suddenly realizing something. He
          unbuckles himself.
                         
          Cooper stands and walks over to the probe. Traces the
          familiar stars and stripes carved into its side.
                         
          Cooper stares at the probe, putting it all together.
                         
                          COOPER
           It's going to work.
                         
                          DOYLE
           Of course it's going to work.
                         
                          COOPER
           That's not what I mean. This is the
           probe I found in Galveston.
                         
          Below them, the wormhole breaks as it reaches another wormhole
          mouth that the Chinese have dropped down to a lower gravity
          well, creating a time machine.
                         
          The wormhole mouth is FLARING with radiation.
                         
                          COOPER (CONT'D)
           Brand said there'd be some evidence
           we'd made it. And there was. This.
           (holds up probe)
           But only this. Everything will be
           destroyed except for this.
                         
          He moves toward Doyle. Doyle stands.
                         
                          COOPER (CONT'D)
           We have to stop.
                         
                          DOYLE
           I don't know what you're talking
           about, but you're not touching the
           controls. I'm going home.
           138.
                         
          Cooper moves closer to Doyle. Doyle pulls out the flair
          gun. Points it at Cooper.
                         
                          COOPER
           You don't need to do this. We won't
           make it back, but this does. The
           secrets are already right on it.
           Maybe someone found it. There's
           hope.
                          (SAD)
           But we don't get to go with.
                         
                          DOYLE
           You're not stopping me. I'm going
           home.
                         
          Doyle forces Cooper into the ship's lander. Then he closes
          the airlock.
                         
          Cooper pounds on the other side of the glass, trying to reason
          with him.
                         
          The landing craft detaches from the ship.
                         
          INT. CHINESE LANDING CRAFT
                         
          Cooper watches, helpless, as Doyle's ship races ahead towards
          the glowing wormhole mouth.
                         
          As the ship speeds toward the next wormhole, the radiation
          suddenly FLARES, annihilating the ship and everything in it.
                         
          Almost everything.
                         
          Cooper's landing craft spins away from the wormhole mouth.

          A hole opens in the sky with a FIERY EXPLOSION. As the
          radiation subsides, all that shoots out of the hole is a
          vaporous wisp of atomized metal, and a burned, blackened
          probe, which hurtles toward Earth.
                         
          EXT. SPACE, NEAR EARTH ORBIT
                         
          The probe collides with a satellite, hurling debris into the

          America, the Gulf Coast.
                         
          -- The probe SMASHES down into a sandbar.
                         
          -- Daylight. A man is descending toward it, dangling from a
          rope. It's Cooper.
                         
          -- Night. A kitchen. A little boy -- Murph -- stares at
          the probe, while Cooper works at it with a blowtorch.
                         
          -- Tars pulls the probe out of the back of a plane.
                         
          -- Brand's father, older, studies the probe. Gives up.
                         
          -- Much later. People are moving around in the darkened
          base, scavenging equipment.

          A combine harvester is dead in a field, service hatch opened.
          A MAN is lying under the machine, working.
                         
          The man hauls himself out from under the huge machine. Dusts
          himself off.
                         
          It's Murph, 30s. He looks at the FARMER who is waiting for
          the verdict. Murph shakes his head.
                         
                          MURPH
           It's done. Auto-pilot's packed up
           for the last time.
                         
                          FARMER
           You can't make it work a little
           longer?
                         
                          MURPH
           Can't do anything for you. There
           aren't any more parts for these.
           Not anywhere.
                         
                          FARMER
           You don't understand. We're getting
           less than a hundred pounds per acre.
           We need to plant more, not less.
                         
          Murph looks around him at the pathetic crop of corn that
          stretches around them. The plants are feeble, barely able
          to support themselves.
           140.
                         
                          FARMER (CONT'D)
           You've got to find us some more parts,
           Murph. It's getting desperate.
           Isn't there anywhere you can look?
                         
          Murph begins packing up his tools, thinking it over.
                         
          INT. HANGAR -- DAY
                         
          Murph stares at the darkened shape of a plane under a tarp.
          He stares at the tarp, unsure if he wants to keep going.
                         
          He pulls the tarp off, revealing Cooper's old Piper Cub. He
          checks over the engine, lights, prop. Turns the key. Fires
          her up. The diesel wakes with a GRUNT.
                         
          EXT. AIRSTRIP -- DAY

          Murph sets the plane down.
                         
          He parks the plane under a copse of trees and climbs down.
                         
          He scans the horizon. Nothing. Is this the place?
                         
          EXT. FOREST -- DAY
                         
          Murph pushes his way through the undergrowth. Stops.
                         
          He's standing at the blast doors to the facility. They've
          been blown open with dynamite.
                         
          INT. NASA FACILITY -- DAY
                         
          Murph lets himself inside. Lights a flare.
                         
          The place has been gutted. Thieves and scavengers have taken
          almost everything.
                         
          Murph finds one of the robots, or what's left of it -- it's
          been stripped, leaving only the bare composite skeleton.
          The empty eye sockets stare back at Murph.
                         
          Murph looks around the place. There is nothing left to
          salvage. He turns to leave. Hears a familiar CHIRP.
                         
          In the corner, under a pile of rain-soaked garbage:
           141.
                         
          The probe.
                         
          No one has bothered to steal it. Murph stares at it.
                         
          INT. UNDERGROUND FACILITY -- NIGHT
                         
          Murph sweeps detritus off of an ancient computer mainframe
          that survived the looting. He hooks the probe up to it.
                         
          After a minute, the screen fills with a picture of an ice-
          covered planet. Then nothing. The rest of the probe's drive
          is filled with garbage, noise.
                         
          Murph switches off the screen.
                         
          He stands. Begins to leave without the probe. Stops. Turns
          back. Picks it up and takes it with him.
                         
          INT. KITCHEN, MURPH'S HOUSE -- NIGHT
                         
          Murph is hunched over the probe, trying to pull data off of
          it with a defibrillator. He has incorporated an ancient
          laptop into the chain, and is tweaking values on it, trying
          to decrypt the contents.
                         
          His WIFE, several months pregnant, turns back to him from
          the stove.
                         
                          MURPH'S WIFE
           Would you get that thing off of the
           table?
                         
          Murph nods, absorbed. Keys in a final tweak to the decryption
          software. Hits return.
                         
          Suddenly, the screen begins filling with data.
                         
          Murph stares at it, wide eyed.
                         
                          CUT TO:
                         
          INT. BARN -- NIGHT
                         
          Murph, now in his 40s, is putting the finishing touches on a
          large machine. Although slightly different, we recognize
          some of the components and their configuration:
                         
          It's a crude version of the gravitational device.
                         
          Murph double checks it, then fires up a small gas powered
          generator. Throws a breaker, feeding power to the unit.
                         
          The unit lights up. HUMS. But nothing happens.
           142.
                         
          Murph, disappointed but undaunted, shuts it down and begins
          checking it over. He hears a noise at the door. Turns back.
          His daughter, Emily, 8, is standing at the door.
                         
                          EMILY COOPER
           Dad? You said you'd take us to the
           game.
                         
                          MURPH
                          (DISTRACTED)
           Did I?
                         
          He looks at the impossible nest of wires. Shakes his head.
                         
                          MURPH (CONT'D)
           All right. Let me get my jacket.
                         
          Murph picks up his jacket from the workbench. Next to it on
          the bench is a shortwave radio playing STATIC.
                         
                          EMILY COOPER
           (staring at machine)
           What is it supposed to do, Dad?
                         
                          MURPH
           I have no idea.
                         
          Murph switches off the lights and they walk out.
                         
          After a moment, the radio CRACKLES to life in the darkness.

           Murph... I'm sorry...
                         
          The signal crackles out.

          INT. KITCHEN, MURPH'S HOUSE -- DAY
                         
          Murph, 50s, slightly gray, sits at his kitchen table. He
          hears a distant RUMBLE.
                         
          He looks up. His wife is standing by the sink.
                         
                          MURPH
           Where's Emily?
                         
                          WIFE
           Out in the barn. She's been tinkering
           with your old projects.
           143.
                         
          Murph stands up. The roof of the barn is visibly shaking.
          He steps outside.
                         
          EXT. YARD, MURPH'S HOUSE -- DAY
                         
          Murph moves towards the barn, concerned. The shaking is
          growing stronger -- the entire structure is buckling.
                         
          Emily, now 18, backs out of the barn.
                         
                          EMILY COOPER
           Dad... I'm sorry... I made some
           changes to the machine. I think I
           did something wrong.
                         
          Murph puts an arm around his daughter and as they watch, the
          entire barn IMPLODES. Their tractor begins sliding towards
          the wreckage of the barn, chunky tires plowing up the soil.
                         
          Finally, the RUMBLING STOPS as the power lines short out in
          a FIERY display.
                         
          As the dust clears, Murph and his daughter examine the mess:
                         
          The entire barn has been crushed into a tiny ball.
                         
          Murph looks at his daughter.
                         
                          MURPH
           Do you remember what you changed?
                         
          Wide-eyed, she thinks about it. Then nods.

          This is North America. But it doesn't look much like it.
                         
          Mother Nature has just about wiped the slate clean. Most of
          the vegetation is gone, and unchecked winds sweep across the
          barren plains. Patches of ice lie think on the ground, as
          if a heavy snow has come and gone.
                         
          SUPER TITLE: "TWO HUNDRED YEARS LATER"
                         
          One of the Chinese spaceships descends through the thick
          clouds above and settles gently onto the plain.
                         
          The hatch opens and Cooper steps out. He takes a cautious
          look around. He is holding the fractal life in its small
          container.
                         
          The clouds are threatening, but the weather looks calm enough
          right here.
           144.
                         
          Cooper starts to walk.
                         
          EXT. COLLAPSED HOUSE -- DAY
                         
          Remarkably, part of Cooper's old house is still standing.
                         
          INT. COLLAPSED HOUSE -- DAY
                         
          Cooper stands in the middle of his kitchen. Two walls are
          missing and the rest is collapsed in a heap. But he can
          still see where he used to feed his kids breakfast.
                         
          He has kept his promise. Several hundred years too late.
                         
          Cooper hunkers down, staring at the space where his kids
          used to be. Rainwater covers the ancient formica.
                         
          It has taken him years to finally reach this place. He has
          had plenty of time to come to grips with what he might find.
          But nothing has prepared him for this:
                         
          He is completely alone. Nothing is left.
                         
          INT. COLLAPSED FARMHOUSE -- NIGHT
                         
          Cooper is still sitting there when the ice storm hits.
                         
          Unchecked by trees or vegetation, the wind rockets through
          the house, blasting Cooper and pelting what's left of the
          structure with fist-sized hail.
                         
          Cooper takes shelter against the remaining wall. He's going
          to have to sit this one out -- the hail and winds are the
          brutal descendants of the weather he knew. They'll finish
          him off if he steps back outside.
                         
          As he watches, the pool of water on the kitchen floor freezes
          over in seconds.
                         
          INT. COLLAPSED FARMHOUSE -- DAWN
                         
          Cooper shivers, pressed against the wall. The storm is still
          raging outside. He is freezing to death. He has to move
          now or he will die. He pulls the hood tight around his face
          and stumbles outside.
                         
          EXT. SNOWBOUND FIELD -- DAY
                         
          Cooper makes his way through the blinding snow. He tries to
          find his way, but the ship has been consumed by the blizzard.
                         
          He stumbles to the ground, dropping the glass case with the
          fractal wildlife in it. The case shatters.
                         
          Cooper tries to stand back up, but his strength is dwindling.
           145.
                         
          As he watches, the fractal wildlife creeps tentatively out
          of its broken habitat. It forms together against the cold.
                         
          After a moment, it burrows into the ice. As it does, the
          ice glows faintly. It seems to be right at home.
                         
          Cooper laughs, glimpsing the outline of a plan. Was this
          what the beings who made the wormhole intended all along?
                         
          Cooper suddenly spots the outline of the ship through the
          driving snow. He stumbles back up to his feet and struggles
          a few more steps, then stumbles again, spent.
                         
          Finally, he sits down in the snow to die.
                         
          As his senses flicker in and out, he is struck with memories
          of his boys, so vivid he reaches out for them, crawling
          forward in the snow.
                         
          He stops, and laughs, remembering what Case told him about
          what happens when humans die.
                         
          He struggles to his feet and stumbles a few more feet,
          eventually coming to rest just steps from the ship.
                         
          Cooper takes a final step. Finally, he collapses under his
          ship, as the wind continues to HOWL around him.
                         
          As the snow clears for a moment, Cooper is alone on a vast
          arctic tundra. He will die alone.

          Cooper wakes.
                         
          He is in a sunlit room. A breeze rustles the curtains as it
          makes its way in through a large open window.
                         
          Cooper sits up. As he a does, a control panel on the wall
          TONES gently, as if in response to his movement.
                         
          He stands and looks around. He can see sunlight through the
          open windows and hear people -- kids YELLING as they play.
          He moves toward the window. Reaches for the curtains. Before
          he can, the door opens behind him.
                         
          A WOMAN in a white coat steps in, smiling warmly.
                         
                          DOCTOR
           Good morning. Don't go outside just
           yet, Mr. Cooper.

           (offers him a pill)
           This will help with the
           disorientation.
                         
          Cooper opens his mouth to talk, but his voice is cracked.
          He gives up. Swallows the pill.
                         
                          DOCTOR (CONT'D)
           Wait a minute for that to take effect.
           It can be a bit of an adjustment.
           (looks him over)
           You had some frostbite. Nothing too
           serious.
                         
          As she talks, Cooper looks past her to the window.
                         
                          COOPER
           Where am I?
                         
                          DOCTOR
                          (SMILES)
           It's a bit of a coincidence, really.
           When the rangers found you, we were
           the nearest facility.
                         
                          COOPER
           What's coincidence? What is this
           place?
                         
                          DOCTOR
           We have a lot to show you.
                         
          The doctor reaches for the curtains. She offers him a hand.
          Cooper declines the help and steps outside.
                         
          EXT. HOSPICE, COOPER STATION -- DAY
                         
          Cooper is standing on a rooftop deck of a four-story building
          in a medium-sized city surrounded by fields. But as the
          road and the buildings stretch into the distance, the
          landscape curves up, not down.
                         
          The entire landscape is contained within a huge cylinder-
          shaped space station.
                         
          Cooper stumbles, and reaches instinctively out. The doctor
          catches him.
                         
                          DOCTOR
           You're OK. We get this from people
           who move here from planetary colonies
           all the time.
           147.
                         
                          COOPER
           Where... where are we?
                         
                          DOCTOR
           Like I said. It was a coincidence.
           There was a facility closer to Earth,
           but they had a problem, so you wound
           up here.
           (off his look)
           This is the Space Station Joseph A.
           Cooper.
                         
          Cooper takes in the incredible surroundings. A thousand
          feet above them, black specks are sprinkled over an ocean of
          green -- Jersey milking cows grazing in a field of wild grass.
                         
                          DOCTOR (CONT'D)
           I've got someone who wants to meet
           you.
                         
          Cooper looks at her.
                         
          INT. INTENSIVE CARE ROOM, HOSPICE, COOPER STATION -- DAY
                         
          Cooper steps inside. The room is dark, still, the only noise
          is the labored RATTLE of an old man struggling to breathe.
                         
          Cooper steps closer to the bed. The man's skin is paper-
          thin. He is ancient.
                         
                          DOCTOR
           He was moved here after they found
           you. He's a little old for a
           transfer, but they made an exception.
                         
          Cooper hovers at the back of the room, unsure. He turns to
          the doctor, questioning. Then he notices the pictures on
          the old man's desk:
                         
          There are dozens of them. Children, grandchildren. Then
          the older ones -- the man's own parents. Grandparents.
          Cooper spots a tiny framed picture with someone he recognizes:
                         
          Murph, 80 years old, surrounded by his daughter and her
          family. They are standing in front of a re-opened Cape
          Canaveral, and a huge spaceship under construction.
                         
          Cooper picks up the picture and stares at it.
                         
          The doctor points to a shy little boy hiding behind Murph's
          leg in the picture.
                         
                          DOCTOR (CONT'D)
           That's him.
           148.
                         
          She points to the old man lying in the bed.
                         
                          DOCTOR (CONT'D)
           His name is Anthony Welling. Anthony
           Cooper Welling.
                          (SMILES)
           He's your great great grandson.
           He's been waiting a long time for
           you.
                         
          Cooper's eyes well with tears. He steps over to the bed and
          looks down at the ancient man, teetering on the edge of death.
                         
          The old man looks at him, eyes widening in excitement. He
          strains, trying to reach the bedside table. He's trying to
          reach the drawer. Cooper helps him open it.
                         
          Inside is a simple, familiar wristwatch. The old man
          carefully takes out the watch. He gives the watch a few
          winds and, hands shaking, offers it to Cooper.
                         
          Cooper, eyes filling with tears, closes his hand over the
          old man's hand, enveloping both the watch and the man's hand.
                         
                          CUT TO:
                         
          EXT. CORNFIELD, COOPER STATION -- MORNING
                         
          Cooper is sitting in a well-appointed office. A middle-aged
          BUREAUCRAT smiles at him from the far side of a huge desk.
                         
                          ADMINISTRATOR
           You're a hero, Mr. Cooper. Let's
           just start off by saying that. It's
           an incredible and... unexpected honor
           to have you here with us.
                         
          Cooper smiles, uncomfortable.
                         
                          ADMINISTRATOR (CONT'D)
           None of us would be here without the
           efforts of you and the other
           crewmembers of the Endurance.
           (smiles, unconvincingly)
           So I don't want you to take this the
           wrong way. But there are some
           questions I've been told to ask.
                         
          The man looks petrified, like he's been instructed to grill
          George Washington on his expense reports.
                         
                          COOPER
           Shoot.
           149.
                         
                          ADMINISTRATOR
           The rangers who found you reported
           that you had released a sample of an
           alien life-form into the wild. Which
           is, unfortunately, against
           regulations.
                         
                          COOPER
           It was last of its kind. Their planet
           was destroyed.
                         
          The administrator cues up a series of images on his computer.
                         
                          ADMINISTRATOR
           The rangers attempted to isolate the
           life-form, but it had already spread
           out of control. It seems to be
           thriving.
                         
          He shows Cooper a satellite image of north america. A
          considerable portion of the frozen tundra is glowing.
                         
          Cooper begins laughing. Which makes the administrator even
          less comfortable.
                         
                          ADMINISTRATOR (CONT'D)
           Can you tell me why you... elected
           to release the life-form back on
           earth?
                         
          Cooper is still laughing.
                         
                          COOPER
           Because that was the plan.
                         
                          ADMINISTRATOR
           Whose plan?
                         
                          COOPER
                          (SMILES)
           I don't know.
                         
          The administrator tries to smile back. Makes a few notes in
          his file. Changes the subject.
                         
                          ADMINISTRATOR
           My assistant tells me you've applied
           for a position with the exploration
           fleet.
                         
                          COOPER
           Feel like I should be pulling my
           weight.
           150.
                         
                          ADMINISTRATOR
           That's admirable, Mr. Cooper. The
           truth is, most of the fleet's
           personnel are automated. There are
           a small number of crewed ships. But
           there are great numbers of candidates.
           Very well trained candidates.
                         
                          COOPER
           I was hoping to enroll in a course.
           Try to get myself up to speed on the
           new systems.
                         
                          ADMINISTRATOR
           I don't want you to take this the
           wrong way, Mr. Cooper -- like I
           said, you're a hero. But the truth
           is we have somewhat limited resources.
                         
          Cooper remembers this conversation. He looks down.
                         
                          COOPER
           No one's heard anything from Brand?
                         
                          ADMINISTRATOR
           I'm sorry. Officially, she's been
           listed as missing for over 200 years.
           Mind you, I guess you turned up
           eventually, didn't you?
                         
                          COOPER
           Am I really going to hurt anybody by
           going to look for her? I just need
           a small ship. I made a promise.
                         
          The bureaucrat looks down. Is he really going to have to
          tell this guy the lay of the land?
                         
                          ADMINISTRATOR
           Listen. Mr. Cooper. You're a hero.
           You're the oldest man in the human
           race. Don't you want to take it
           easy?
           (off his look)
           I hope you understand, we all you
           hold you in the highest possible
           regard.
                          (QUIET)
           Which is why they're never going to
           let you go off by yourself in a
           spaceship. I'm sorry.
                         
          Cooper looks at his hands. He's got a couple centuries on
          the bureaucrat in Earth years, but looks ten years younger.
          He puts his hands in his pockets.
           151.
                         
                          ADMINISTRATOR (CONT'D)
           I've got some good news, however.
                          (BIG SMILE)
           We all know about your early life,
           Mr Cooper. I wrote a paper on it
           when I was a boy. And I think we
           found something you'll really enjoy.
                         
          EXT. CORNFIELD, COOPER STATION -- DAY
                         
          Corn blows in an artificial breeze. A red tractor makes its
          way through the field, which curves gently up in the distance.
                         
           ADMINISTRATOR (V.O.)
           The machines do most of the work, of
           course, but we were able to get you
           a few acres. You're going to be a
           farmer again.
                         
          After a moment, the tractor stops. Cooper climbs down from
          the seat. Looks at the front steering linkage, which is
          jammed with an errant tree branch. He wipes his forehead
          and begins working the branch out of the machine.
                         
          He looks miserable.
                         
          A robot, a similar unit to Tars, walks over. Offers Cooper
          a bottle of water. Cooper accepts it.
                         
          EXT. HANGAR BAY, COOPER STATION
                         
          Cooper stands on an observation deck, high above the hangar
          floor. Below him, bright young things in uniforms climb
          into sleek-looking spaceships and prepare to set out.
                         
          EXT. BASEBALL DIAMOND, COOPER STATION
                         
          Cooper sits in the stands, listening to the familiar crack
          of the bat as an intramural team from the university
          practices.
                         
          Cooper watches. He looks bored.
                         
          The kid up to bat cracks a pop fly. For a second, the catcher
          shuffles back and forth, trying to get himself into position.
          But the ball never returns. The catcher YELLS out a warning.
                         
          Above, the ball begins to slowly fall up, not down, toward
          the town center above.
                         
          After a second, the ball smashes through a skylight of a
          building high above them.
                         
          Cooper watches as the kid rounds the bases, laughing.
           152.
                         
          INT. KITCHEN, FARMHOUSE, COOPER STATION -- DAY
                         
          Cooper's robot sits at the kitchen table. Cooper is fiddling
          around in the back of his head.
                         
                          ROBOT
           Settings: general settings, security
                          SETTINGS--
                         
                          COOPER
           Curiosity. New level setting. 100
           percent.
                         
                          ROBOT
           Confirmed. Would you like to make
           any additional changes?
                         
                          COOPER
           Sense of humor. New level setting.
           100 percent. Wait.
                          (THINKS)
           80 percent.
                         
          He begins putting the robot back together.
                         
          EXT. FARMHOUSE, COOPER STATION -- TWILIGHT
                         
          Cooper sits on his porch, joined by the same robot as before.
          They watch as the space station rotates lazily out of
          alignment with the local star, casting the inside of the
          cylinder into shade, then darkness.
                         
          The shadow races past them. Another day. Another night.
                         
          EXT. HANGAR, COOPER STATION
                         
          A maintenance worker finishes looking over one of the sleek-
          looking spacecraft. He packs up his tools and heads out.
                         
          After a moment, two figures pick their way across the hangar
          floor, sticking to the shadows.
                         
          As they reach the first ship in the line, we get a better
          look. It's Cooper and his robot pal. The robot is wearing
          a baseball cap and carrying a toolbox.
                         
          Cooper gestures to the robot, who sets down the toolbox with
          a click against the mirror-like floor.
                         
          Cooper shakes his head, annoyed, at the robot, and puts his
          finger to his lips. The robot nods, bashful.
                         
          Cooper waves a small handheld computer near the skin of the
          ship until it lights up. Then he punches in a few codes.
          Nothing happens. He punches in a few more.
           153.
                         
          Suddenly, the hatch opens with a HISS.
                         
          INT. SHIP
                         
          Cooper moves quickly to the cockpit of the ship. Looks over
          the controls. The robot straps himself in next to him.
          Cooper looks up through the windows.
                         
          The inky black void of space beckons.
                         
          Cooper smiles and reaches for the controls.
                         
                          COOPER
           Where do you want to go first?
                         
          The robot thinks it over.
                         
          EXT. HANGAR, COOPER STATION
                         
          The technician walks back into the hangar. He walks along
          the row of ships till he reaches the last one.
                         
          It's not there.
                         
          He looks out into the blackness of the void. Sees a tiny
          glowing speck, getting smaller and smaller.
                         
                         END
INTO THE WILD

1   EXT. THE STAMPEDE TRAIL - DAY                                    1

    SUPER:
    Tuesday, April 28th 1992

    WIDE-SHOT: A vast, snow-blanketed wilderness that sits
    beneath the icy summits of the highest mountain range in
    North America. This is BIG Alaska.

    A beat up 4x4 pick-up enters very small into the upper
    left corner of frame on an unkept, snow-packed road, and
    comes to a stop. A figure exits the passenger side and
    moves around the front of the truck. We can just make
    out the rifle sticking out of his backpack. We HEAR a
    very distant "Thank You" as the figure walks away from
    the road and away from the truck, seemingly into nowhere.

                           DRIVER
              Hey!

    The figure with backpack and rifle, henceforth BACKPACK,
    stopping in his tracks, turns around in the direction of
    the truck.

                           DRIVER (CONT'D)
              Come here.

    BACKPACK walks back to the truck.    As he approaches the
    driver's door, we

    CUT IN TO: TIGHT SHOT over the back-packed shoulder onto
    the DRIVER.

                           DRIVER (CONT'D)
                     (referring to items we see
                      sitting on dashboard)
              You left your watch, your comb, your
              change...

    We STAY on the DRIVER as BACKPACK speaks:

                           BACKPACK
              Keep it.

                           DRIVER
              I don't want your money.    And I already
              have a watch.

                           BACKPACK
              If you don't take it, I'm gonna throw it
              away. I don't want to know what time it
              is, what day it is, or where I am.
                           (MORE)

                                                                2.

                          BACKPACK (CONT'D)
             I don't want to see anybody. None of
             that matters.

The driver reaches behind the seat of the truck, pulls
out an old pair of rubber work boots.

                          DRIVER
                    (handing him the boots)
             Take em.

There is a pause as Backpack considers accepting the
boots.

                          DRIVER (CONT'D)
             If you make it out alive, give me a call,
             and I'll tell you how to get the boots
             back to me.

We can feel over Backpack's shoulder that he has taken
the boots and is putting them on but we STAY on the
driver.

                          BACKPACK
             Hey, do me a favor, will ya?     Take a
             picture of me.

Backpack hands him an Instamatic camera and starts
walking backwards. We PULL BACK with him. And he
maintains his back to us. When he stops, we CONTINUE
until he is FULL-FRAME, head-to-toe from behind, posing.

                                                          CUT TO:

CU: driver

CLICK.   He snaps the shot.
Backpack re-enters frame in an OVER-SHOULDER.          Driver
hands him the camera.

                          DRIVER
             You gonna be alright?

                          BACKPACK
             I'll be better than that.
                    (I'll be who I am.)

As Backpack exits the frame, we SLOWLY ZOOM past the
concerned face of the driver onto the loose change, the
comb, and the watch on the dash.

                                                              3.



    Throughout the ZOOM, the SOUND of FOOTSTEPS CRUNCHING THE
    SNOW, FADE into the distance.

    ORIGINAL WIDE-SHOT:

    We see the small form of the truck and the smaller form
    of the Backpacker walking away from the truck until the
    Backpacker has exited the frame. The truck takes a BEAT,
    turns around in the snow, and accelerates back into the
    direction from which it came. As the truck exits frame,

2   EXT. COMMENCEMENT GROUNDS, EMORY UNIVERSITY, ATLANTA -         2
    DAY

    SUPER:
    May 1990

    The crowd of family and friends, and of course, students.
    Assembled on fold-out chairs. The broad lawn.

    INTERCUT: CHRIS MCCANDLESS. We don't see his face, just
    feet pounding the pavement at an increasing pace.

    One by one the names of graduates announced. Their
    bright young faces, capped heads, and gowns, glide up to
    the podium to accept their diplomas.

    INTERCUT: Chris, on his run, sweatshirt hood over head.
    Amongst assembled crowd and family we find: THE
    MCCANDLESS': BILLIE, mid to late forties with dark
    striking eyes; WALT, a taciturn man, early fifties; and
    CARINE, eighteen, pretty with her mother's eyes and waist
    length brown hair, a gold crucifix dangles from her neck.
    They look around, looking for Chris, he's nowhere in
    sight.

    INTERCUT: Chris, in a shower (PHOTO-SONICS) He TURNS INTO
    CAMERA, the water streaming down his face.

    From the announcement podium comes the name of their son
    and brother, CHRISTOPHER JOHNSON MCCANDLESS. The
    McCandless family increasingly panicked over Chris'
    absence, when almost magically, he appears in full cap
    and gown.

                                                       4.



Disregarding the steps that lead up to the podium
platform, the small-framed but athletic CHRIS MCCANDLESS
leaps jubilantly onto the stage in a single bound,
frightening Billie, a little wince from Walt, and Carine
"That's our Chris." And just as quickly as Chris has
been handed his diploma, he civilly descends the platform
steps.

                                                TIME CUT:

SLO-MO: A ballet of graduation caps float upward into a
frame of blue sky. We HEAR Chris' voice OVER this image
as we intermittently cut away from the caps against the
sky to focus on his parents.

(HIGH ANGLE: floating caps in FOREGROUND, Walt and Billie
delight upon the caps.) An outer glee in sharp contrast
to voice over:

                       CHRIS (V.O.)
          I see them standing at the formal gates
          of their colleges,
          I see my father strolling out
          under the ochre sandstone arch, the
          red tiles glinting like bent
          plates of blood behind his head,
          I see my mother with a few light books at
          her hip
          standing at the pillar made of tiny
          bricks with the
          wrought-iron gate still open behind her,
          its
          sword-tips black in the May air,
          they are about to graduate, they are
          about to get married,
          they are kids, they are dumb, all they
          know is they are
          innocent, they would never hurt anybody.
          I want to go up to them and say Stop,
          don't do it--she's the wrong woman,
          he's the wrong man, you are going to do
          things
          you cannot imagine you would ever do,
          you are going to do bad things to
          children,
          you are going to suffer in ways you never
          heard of,
          you are going to want to die. I want to
          go
          up to them there in the late May sunlight
          and say it,
          her hungry pretty blank face turning to
          me,
                       (MORE)

                                                             5.

                           CHRIS (V.O.) (CONT'D)
              her pitiful beautiful untouched body,
              his arrogant handsome blind face turning
              to me,
              his pitiful beautiful untouched body,
              but I don't do it. I want to live. I
              take them up like the male and female
              paper dolls and bang them together
              at the hips like chips of flint as if to
              strike sparks from them, I say...

    The last graduation cap falls out of the `blue sky'
    frame, and into...

                                                         CUT TO:

    (Graduation ceremony wardrobe)

    Walt and Billie sit at a table. A Cadillac can be seen
    through the window (ATLANTA LANDMARK), parked beside the
    restaurant.

                           BILLIE
              Here they are.

    Walt looks out the window and sees Chris drive up in his
    old yellow Datsun with Carine in the passenger seat
    beside him, and pulls up to the space beside the
    Cadillac.


4   INT. DATSUN                                                    4

    Chris is holding a book from which he reads aloud the
    LAST LINE OF THE POEM...
                           CHRIS
              I say...Do what you are going to do,
              and I will tell about it.

                           CARINE
              Who wrote that?

                           CHRIS
              Well, it could've been either one of us,
              couldn't it?

    He hands a book of Sharon Olds' poetry to her.

                           CHRIS (CONT'D)
              There's a lot of great poems in there.

                                                            6.

              Thanks, big brother.

    They exit the car and frame.

    Chris and Carine join Walt and Billie at the table.
    Billie gets up and gives Chris a big hug.

                           BILLIE
              You scared the daylights out of me,
              jumping on to that stage, oh my god.

    Chris gives Carine a look.   Walt extends his hand to
    Chris.

                           WALT
              Congratulations, son.

    They all sit and pick up menus.

                           CHRIS
              I'm starving.

                           CHRIS
              My grades are gonna be good enough, I
              think, to get into Harvard Law.
                           WALT
              That's a big deal. What do you have left
              in your college fund?

                           CHRIS
              It's an inheritance, dad. I've only been
              spending it as a college fund...Exactly
              twenty-four thousand five hundred dollars
              and sixty-eight cents.

                           BILLIE
              That's very specific.

                           CHRIS
              I had to go to the bank this morning.

                                                   7.



                       WALT
          Well, we'll certainly contribute the
          balance for Harvard.

                       CHRIS
          Yeah. I've got to figure out what I'm
          going to do. I got a lot of things to
          pack and organize here first.

                       BILLIE
          I'm so glad you're getting out of that
          place you're living. It was so much
          nicer when you lived on campus.

                       WALT
          You'll come to Annandale before you
          disappear on us, won't you?

                       CHRIS
                 (reluctantly)
          Sure, I will.

Carine's not so sure.

                         BILLIE
          You promise?

                       CHRIS

          Mom.

                       BILLIE
          Well, your father and I want to make a
          present to you.
                       WALT
          We want to get you out of that junker.
                       CHRIS
          What's a junker?

Walt points outside to the Datsun.

                         CHRIS (CONT'D)
          The Datsun?

                        WALT
          Yes.   We want to get you a new car.

                       CHRIS
                 (appalled)
          A new car? Why the hell would I want a
          new car? The Datsun runs great.

                     (Mocking the Cadillac)
              Do you think I want some fancy boat? Or
              are you worried about what the neighbors
              might think?

                           BILLIE
              We weren't going to get you a Cadillac,
              Chris. Just a nice new car that's safe
              to drive. You don't know when that
              thing's just going to suddenly blow up.

                           CHRIS
              Blow up? Blow up?! Are you guys crazy?
              It's a great car. I don't need a new
              car. I don't want a new car. I don't
              want anything. Thing, thing, thing.

    Under the table, Carine jabs Chris' leg.    Chris returning
    to polite -

                           CHRIS (CONT'D)
              But, thanks anyway.

                           WALT
              Everything's gotta be difficult.

                           CHRIS
              I said thank you. I just don't want
              anything.

    The group returns to some superficial calm.

                           CARINE
              I wouldn't say no to a new car.

              Shut up, Chris.

              Seriously, I'll pay you back.

    OVER Chris' shoulder, he frisbees his graduation cap from
    the upstairs window to his parents parting Cadillac on
    the street.

                                                             9.


    As they wave goodbye, Carine catches the cap from the
    backseat window. And with a parting smile to her
    brother, she poses with it on her own head. Chris smiles
    and waves goodbye.

    As the Cadillac drifts away, his smile disappears into
    something other than sadness.

    In a warm ambient light, we SEE a black and white poster
    on a barren wall: Poncho-clad Clint Eastwood from "The
    Good, The Bad, And The Ugly."

    We TILT DOWN a stack of books sitting on the floor -
    Tolstoy, Stegner, Thoreau, Jack London, and Pasternak.
    Beside them, a camper's backpack.

    Chris sits in introspection at his desk by candlelight.
    The room is spare, supporting his monkish lifestyle. But
    on the desk before him, he counts out $500.68 from a bank
    envelope. He pockets those bills and change, then removes
    a check for $24,000 made out to OXFAM America from the
    same bank envelope. He scribbles a note: These are all
    my savings. Feed someone with it. Signed, Chris
    McCandless. He then slides the note and the check into a
    pre-addressed Oxford Famine Relief Fund (in Boston)
    envelope.

    He pulls his wallet from his back pocket. Pulls all the
    cards and pictures from its sleeves. Considering each,
    he flicks them into a trash bin, one by one. Finally
    coming to his social security card, he holds it to the
    candles flame. As the flame burns bright we -

towns and open highways, landscapes and landmarks, days
and nights, that lead to the Mojave desert in the West.

     The Datsun sits in the magical pastel twilight just
     before darkness slides over the desert. It is positioned
     at the foot of a wash wall that edges the soup bowl.

     ANGLE: EAST-FACING

     The Datsun, a yellow speck in the frame. Coyotes yap at
     the moon. Other than that, no sound on the desert floor.

     In the distance, voluptuous cumulonimbus clouds boil
     upward catching the last rosy glow of the west-setting
     sun over the rim of the upper Detrital watershed.
     We see strobe bursts of lightning followed by muffled
     thunder illuminating the thunder clouds from within.
     Short SERIES OF ANGLES as we MOVE IN on the distant
     gullies and ravines, starting to run with copious amounts
     of water.


12   INT. DATSUN - NIGHT                                         12

     Chris McCandless, in the same clothes he had been in back
     in the rooming house, sleeps in the back seat of the
     Datsun. His head supported by his backpack. We begin to
     HEAR a rumble. But this rumble is not thunder. It
     rapidly builds into an alarming ROAR. The roar grows to
     a deafening level. Chris awakens.

                                                            11.


     As he peeks up from the backseat looking forward through
     the windshield, he just barely catches sight of the
     leading edge of a flash flood. A four-foot high wall of
     water, mud and debris makes impact with the Datsun,
     momentarily enveloping it in water. Suddenly the car is
     SLAMMED against the cliff. CRACK! Chris sits upright,
     disoriented.

     POV: As far as the eye can see in the desert moonlight,
     water has taken over the desert with a flash flood.

     However, there's no panic in Chris' face as we observe
     him past a new crack in the wet windshield. The water,
     while violent seems to have topped off just above the
     wheels. Chris gets a slight smile on his face, as the
     car settles into its new position below the cliff. He
     returns to sleep.

                                                       CUT TO:


13   EXT. DESERT - DAY                                          13

     What remains of Chris' travelling money burns in a pile
     beside the Datsun on the sun-lit but muddy desert floor.

     We follow a very long set of footprints (CAMERA
     TRACKING/TRUE VERTICAL) away from the burning cash
     through the mud, finally tilting up to the footprint
     maker, Chris. Slogging toward high ground.

     WIDE-SHOT: We see the abandoned Datsun nearly a mile
     behind Chris as he walks toward us wearing his backpack.
     He comes very close to camera (only a day or two's
     stubble on his face) and as we PAN him 180, we see as
     much wilderness before us as we did behind.

Chris McCandless speaking to camera holds a microphone in
a shadowy room, doing his Geraldo Rivera. It's tongue-in-
cheek at best.

                       CHRIS
          This is Emory University freshman Chris
          McCandless reporting from the vault at
          Thompson Hall.

He indicates a hatchway in the floor leading to a
brightly lit corridor below.

                       CHRIS (CONT'D)
          We have just dynamited the hatchway and
          are the first human beings to step foot
          into this vault in over a hundred years.
          Somewhere in here lies the secret of the
          great beast within us all. A beast built
          on lies, corruption, and greed.

We HEAR a GROWLING SOUND from behind Chris.

                       CHRIS (CONT'D)
          And there it is! The legendary beast
          Mocra.

CAMERA quickly PANS to a blanket-wrapped, crawling FELLOW
STUDENT in a grotesque Halloween mask.

We MOVE INTO CU on the monster growling.

QUICK PAN back to Chris.

                       CHRIS (CONT'D)
                 (in mock fright)
          We've got to get out of here quick and re-
          secure the hatch while we make a plan of
          how to kill the beast.

CAMERA SHAKES all over like a bad horror film trying to
stay with Chris as he makes a quick escape down the
hatchway into the University dorm corridor.

CLUMSY VIDEO TIME CUT: Chris nailing the last nail in
the hatchway from below. He climbs down the steps where
he exchanges his hammer for his microphone from an off-
camera source.

                       CHRIS (CONT'D)
          Well, it looks like we've succeeded -

We HEAR the monster's GROWL from above.

                                                              13.



                            CHRIS (CONT'D)
               - at least for the moment, in sealing the
               beast back into the vault. Your humble
               reporter, Chris McCandless will now
               struggle with the journalistic question
               of ethics: Will he retain his reporter's
               objectiveness or save the future of human
               truth by slaying this awful beast?

     He gives us a look of vaudevillian puzzlement - what will
     he do?

     We pick up with Chris in a corridor outside a door with a
     cheap paper-and-tape label announcing the adjacent room
     as the office of Ted Turner.

               Once again, your humble reporter Chris
               McCandless.

     We HEAR OS students commenting on Chris and his video

     Chris speaking straight to camera, still tongue-in-cheek:

                      (with a Wizard of Oz tone)

     A FELLOW STUDENT PLAYING TED TURNER with obvious fake
     mustache is locked into an episode of Matlock on his
     television set as our bold reporter, Chris, barges in.

                            CHRIS
               Ted! We've got a monster in the vault.
               It represents all the corruption, the
               deceit, and greed within us all. I must
               slay it.

                                                       14.



                        TED TURNER/STUDENT
                 (worst acting we've ever
                  seen)
          McCandless, how many times have I had to
          tell you? I've had to tell you that you
          are a journalist and you can't get
          personally involved in your cases...or
          your stories.

                       CHRIS
          Ted! I know how to kill it. And I'm the
          only one who knows. You can't keep
          sending me on stories and expecting me to
          do nothing! I look like some kind of an
          idiot.

                       TED TURNER/STUDENT
          Do you know who you're talking to?   I'm
          Ted Turner.

Behind Chris in the corridor outside Ted's office, a
PANICKED STUDENT arrives at the door.

                       PANICKED STUDENT
          McCandless! You've got to hurry! The
          monster is scratching at the hatchway.
          He'll be out in no time.

                       TED TURNER/STUDENT
                 (threatening)
          It'll mean your job, Chris McCandless.

                       CHRIS
                 (to Ted)
          That's it, Ted. Fire me if you want but
          this beast must be slayed.
Microphone in hand, Chris makes haste. The CAMERA RUNS
WITH HIM out the door, through the corridor, up a set of
steps to the hatchway. As he arrives, the monster
appears above him in the hatchway crawl space having
pulled off the board Chris had nailed.

                       CHRIS (CONT'D)
                 (into camera)
          This is the only thing that can kill the
          monster. It's gonna be risky but without
          great risk, there is no freedom. So we
          will now hear from the famous singer -
          Chris McCandless.

                                                      15.



A piano is PUSHED INTO FRAME beside Chris. A YOUNG BLACK
STUDENT pulls a stool in front of the piano and begins to
play. Chris begins to serenade the monster,
intermittently sharing the serenade directly into camera
as well. He bursts into an uninhibited solo of Tender Is
The Night.

CAMERA TILTS UP to the monster looking out the hatchway,
slowly dying from the song being sung.

As the song continues to be sung and the monster
continues to die, the AUDIO RECEDES and VIDEO IMAGES GO
TO SLO MO.

                       CARINE (V.O.)
          When we were little, Chris was very to
          himself. He wasn't anti-social, he
          always had friends, and everybody liked
          him - but he could go off and entertain
          himself for hours, he didn't seem to need
          toys or friends. He could be alone
          without being lonely. The secrets our
          parents kept, though unknown to Chris and
          I, led to bouts of rage and even violence
          between them that we had been forced to
          witness since we were very young. It
          seemed like they never fought without us.
          I remember the first family meeting to
          let Chris and me in on their plans for
          getting a divorce. They wanted us to
          choose which of them we'd live with. I
          cried my eyes out. But the divorce never
          happened, though the threats and meetings
          never stopped. It wasn't long before
          Chris and I shut off -- we would tell mom
          and dad to go ahead and get the divorce.
          Chris and I just wanted to get away from
          their fights and mom kept promising to
          get out and take us with her as soon as
          their company made enough money. Dad had
          been the young genius [that] NASA
          enlisted to do [crucial] designs for the
          American satellite radar systems that
          would be our answer to the Russian
          Sputnik. And mom and he later started up
          a consulting firm combining her get-up-
          and-go resourcefulness with his wealth of
          knowledge. By the time the company
          actually made its first million, the
          careerism and money seemed to erase her
          memory of the promise she'd made us.

                            CARINE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
               I think this is when Chris began to see
               "careers" as a diseased invention of the
               twentieth century and to resent money and
               the useless priority people made of it in
               their lives. He'd begun planning to
               "slay the beast"...to make himself free.

     Delirious in the heat, we WIDEN OUT to see that he's
     filthy (2 weeks of growth on his face and naked.) He
     makes his way out of the tent, peers at the relentless
     sun and scurries to his backpack where he removes a
     canteen, barely a sip of water left in it. He downs it.

     He takes a swallow of water. Rinses his mouth. Spits it
     out. Then checks his bearded face in the mirror. He
     likes what he sees.

     As he wipes the corners of his mouth with a tissue and
     throws it into the bin below the sink, he notices a
     discarded tube of lipstick. He picks it up. It's down

               When they got home, I had to hand them
               all the letters they had sent Chris that
               summer which had been returned in a
               bundle.


25   INT. MCCANDLESS HOME, ANNANDALE                             25

     The bundle of letters are splayed out on the kitchen
     table - "Return to Sender" stamps visible.

                            CARINE (V.O.)
               Chris had instructed the post office to
               hold them until August 1st so that mom
               and dad wouldn't know that anything was
               up. Some part of me understood what he
               had done. That he had spent the previous
               four years fulfilling an absurd and
               onerous duty in graduating from college.

     We return to the image of Carine sitting on her bed as
     she plops on Chris' old graduation cap. We slowly ZOOM IN
     on her throughout the remaining V.O.
                            CARINE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
               And now, at last he was unincumbered.
               Emancipated from the stifling world of
               parents and peers. Abstraction,
               security, and material excess. Those
               things that cut Chris off from the raw
               truth of his existence. I only hoped he
               was safe...and I missed him.

     HELICOPTER SHOT: (MUSIC OVER: PHILIP GLASS) WE FIND
     CHRIS MAKING HIS STRIDES THROUGH PINES AND PEAKS, IN AWE
     OF THE SCALE AND POWER OF THIS LANDSCAPE.

     TRACKING SHOT (GROUND LEVEL): CLOSE ON Chris, surrounded
     by a summit grove embraced in its nature.

     ANGLE: A DEER drinking from a creek, pops its head up
     between trees and scrub, watching the alien human pass.

     An EAGLE soars above (perhaps it was this POV represented
     in our helicopter shot)

     WATER babbling in a mountain creek.

     ANGLE: Chris -   In his eyes we see the landscape inject
     itself.

     Wrapped in his own "The Good, The Bad, And The Ugly"
     poncho, Chris eats rice while crouched beside a campfire
     reading from Jack London's White Fang.

     Chris is on the move north through the gorgeous landscape
     of the Sierras, humming as he walks, when he comes upon a
     sign on the trail: PERMIT CAMPING IN DESIGNATED
     CAMPGROUNDS ONLY.

     Chris bows to the sign as one would to speak to a small
     child.

                            CHRIS
                      (singing)
               Sign, sign. Everywhere a sign. Fuckin'
               up the scenery, breakin' my mind.

                 Do this. Don't do that. Can't you read
                 the sign?

     And then, very impulsively, he karate kicks the sign off
     its post into a log collapsing into ---

32   INT. TENT                                                   32

     Chris is awakened by the SOUND of TWIGS SNAPPING in a
     nearby thicket. He quickly grabs a knife from his
     backpack, unzips six inches of the tent door open. We
     see his eyes peering out. The CRACKLING moves closer.
     His grip on the knife tightens.

     Suddenly a hot white light hits his face.   And a VOICE
     comes from behind the light.

                              FOREST RANGER
                 U.S. Forestry. Could you step out of the
                 tent please?

     Now we see the FOREST RANGER appear from the thicket.
     Chris exits the tent, catching himself holding the knife.
                             CHRIS
                       (as he drops the knife to the
                        ground)
                 Sorry. I thought you were a bear.

                              FOREST RANGER
                        (approaching)
                 I don't blame you. You're less than a
                 hundred yards from the nearest den.
                 That's why I came over here to talk to
                 you. Do you have some identification?

                                                         22.



                       CHRIS
          No. I'm sorry. My name's Alex. I've
          been travelling a lot and I got robbed
          and my identification was taken.

                       FOREST RANGER
          You mind if I take a look in your tent?

                        CHRIS
          Go ahead.

The Forest Ranger bends over. Pops his flashlight
through the tent door and peers around a bit before re-
addressing Chris.

                       FOREST RANGER
          You're not the character who knocked down
          our sign, are ya?

                      CHRIS
                (giggles)
          No.

                       FOREST RANGER
          Because there was a sign indicating that
          camping was allowed by permit only.

                       CHRIS
          Well, I don't have a permit.

                       FOREST RANGER
          No, I'm sure you don't. Listen, it looks
          like you've got your food secured pretty
          good, so I'm not gonna make you move on
          tonight. But, these bears out here are
          nursing young and you know how that goes.
          Next time, stop at the Rangers station
          and get yourself a permit.

                       CHRIS
          Alright. I appreciate it. I'm gonna be
          headed towards the coast tomorrow.

                        FOREST RANGER
          Be careful.

They shake hands and the Forest Ranger disappears into
the thicket.

33    EXT. THE NORTHERN CREST - DAY                              33

      Chris descends the mountains where they meet the
      Redwoods. Every perilous step creates a mini landslide
      down the hill; dirt and gravel.

      Chris stops briefly to observe an over-flying commercial
      airliner.

                             CHRIS
                       (mocking imaginary
                        conversation among
                        passengers)
                Is that a man mommy?
                That's no mere man, sweetheart. That's
                Alexander SuperTramp! King of the wild
                frontier!

      Chris briefly waves to the airplane above and continues
      his descent.

      A car slows to a stop.


36    INT./EXT. CAR-HIGHWAY                                      36

                             DRIVER
                This is where I turn off.

                               CHRIS
                Alright man.    Thanks a lot.

      Chris is dropped off. The driver veers off the highway
      and into the distance. Chris is left behind to hitch
      another ride.

36A   EXT. HIGHWAY                                              36A

      CAMERA is across the road from Chris as one by one cars
      pass him by. He turns to move north by foot and we track
      with him, his back to oncoming traffic, he continues to
      hitchhike with an extended thumb. Something catches his
      eye in the treeline beside the road.

                                                         24.



REVERSE: Chris, moving to the mysterious object. As he
lifts it, we see that it is a goofy looking straw hat.
He dusts it off, and snugs it onto his head, when a
police car comes into frame and stops beside Chris.

With a quick blast of the siren, Chris turns to regard
the police car. The POLICEMAN gets out of the car and
moves to Chris.

                       POLICEMAN
          How're you doin' this evening?

                       CHRIS
                 (reluctantly)
          I'm alright. What's the matter?

                       POLICEMAN
          You wanna put your backpack down on the
          hood of my car.

Chris does not oblige.

                         CHRIS
          Why?

                       POLICEMAN
          Because I asked you to, sir.

                       CHRIS
          But I haven't done anything wrong.   These
          are my personal items.

                       POLICEMAN
          Do you know that it's unlawful to
          hitchhike on this stretch of highway.
                       CHRIS
          You're kidding.

                       POLICEMAN
          Do you see a safe area for a vehicle to
          stop? We got a tree-lined highway
          without a substantial shoulder here. And
          we've had a lot of accidents on this road
          from people stopping in the traffic lane
          for hitchhikers.

                       CHRIS
          Alright, but...I mean, you stopped your
          car. You're in the traffic lane. And
          you can see, there's hardly any cars out
          here. Plus, it's a straight road; you
          can see for a long ways.

               There's really been accidents along here?

               May I see some identification?

     Now Chris is worried.

                            CHRIS
               I don't have any.

                            POLICEMAN
               You don't have any identification?

     Chris shakes his head "No."

                      (pulling out a ticket)
               Well, I'm gonna site you for unlawful
               hitchhiking. You don't have to appear.
               You can send a check directly to the
               Humboldt County Clerks Office for
               restitution. If you don't pay it within
               30 days, you're subject to fine and
               warrant. I'm gonna trust that you're
               gonna give me accurate information.
               What's your name?

               If Chris were trying to disappear, it
               would have been a pretty uncharacteristic
               lapse for him to give the police his real
               place of residence. Though my parents
               had already contacted the Annandale
               police with their initial concerns, this
               ticket arriving from California made them
               frantic.

               My father called one of his old
               government friends who put him in touch
               with a private investigator, someone
               who'd done work with the DIA and the CIA.
               Using the Willow Creek ticket as a
               starting point, the investigator began
               chasing down leads. Most of them led far
               afield -- to Europe and South Africa.
               Ultimately turning up nothing. What my
               dad couldn't believe was that he'd given
               up his car. He seemed to love that
               Datsun so much. It sounded just like
               Chris to me, though. He was very much of
               the school that you should own nothing
               except what you could carry on your back
               at a dead run.


38   EXT. NORTHERN CALIFORNIA HIGHWAY, NEAR ORICK, 60 MILES     38

     With his backpack lunging and a free hand holding his
     goofy new hat onto his head, we find Chris at a "dead
     run" to catch a ride that had overshot him. (Director's
     note: Don't leave this image too soon.) An old van idles
     waiting for him. As he gets to the passenger side, the
     woman passenger gets out. This is JAN BURRES, early
     40's, looks to be still on the long road home from
     Woodstock. A little heavyset, dark wavy hair with a lot
     of premature grey in it.

     Jan moving to the side door.

                            JAN
               Hi. We just barely saw you there, under
               that crazy hat of yours. We couldn't
               back up - the van's reverse is broken.

               put my thumb out.

                            JAN
               Probably, the rest of the time, that hat
               scares `em away.

     Chris checks himself in the rearview mirror and gets a
     kick out of what he sees (That hat's staying on.) Jan is
     looking at the rearview mirror too, observing Chris with
     mild concern.

                            JAN (CONT'D)
               When's the last time you ate something?

     Chris pulls out a bag of berries and edible plants he's
     collected.

                            CHRIS
                      (excited)
               See that? I've got this book and it
               shows you all the plants and berries that
               are edible. You can find things wherever
               you go.

     Jan steals a glance to Rainey.      He's hip.

                                                           28.



                            RAINEY
               We were just in town getting some beads
               and stuff. Jan does handicrafts, so
               we're usually going from one swap meet to
               another. She's so good at what she does,
               we sold everything. So, we set up camp
               at Orick Beach. You're welcome to camp
               there with us.

                            JAN
               And eat there with us.

     Chris is beaming at the thought of real food.

40   EXT. CAMPSITE, ORICK BEACH - NIGHT                         40

     Chris, Jan, and Rainey are beside a campfire, sitting on
     blankets. Their tents loom behind them.

     Jan is weaving some sort of craft art. Chris is chomping
     on chicken and beans like they're going out of style.

                            CHRIS
                      (between large swallows)
               So, I just left the car. It was a great
               car too. I'd driven it cross country the
               first time when I got out of high school.
               I had some really great adventures with
               it. That thing would just go and go. I
               mean, it was an `82 but if I'd kept it,
               it would've lasted me forever.
                            RAINEY
               So, you're a leather now.
                            CHRIS
               I'm a leather?

     Rainey nods, smiling.

                            CHRIS (CONT'D)
                      (looking to Jan)
               What's a leather?

                            JAN
               You're a leather tramp. That's what they
               call the ones that hoof it on foot. So,
               we're technically rubber tramps.

                                                     29.



                       RAINEY
                 (interjecting)
          As we have a vee-hi-cle.

Rainey makes a move to put his arm around Jan. She goes
a little stiff and fends it off. Chris notices.

                       JAN
          Alex could have a vehicle. If he didn't
          burn his money. Why would you want to do
          that?

                       CHRIS
          I don't need money.   It makes people
          cautious.

                       JAN
                 (a little irritated)
          Well, you have to be a little cautious
          Alex. That book of yours is all well and
          fine but you can't depend entirely on
          leaves and berries.

                       CHRIS
          I don't know if you'd want to depend on
          much more than that.

                       JAN
          Where's your mom and dad?

                       CHRIS
          Makin' their money somewhere.

                       JAN
          Come on Chris. You look like a loved             *
          kid. Be fair.                                    *
                      CHRIS
          Fair?

                       JAN
          You know what I mean.

                       CHRIS
          I'll paraphrase Thoreau -- "Rather than          *
          love, than money, than fairness, give me         *
          truth."                                          *

                       RAINEY                              *
          You look like shit.   There's the truth.         *

They all laugh.                                            *

41   INT. CHRIS' TENT, ORICK BEACH - LATER                       41

     Chris sits up reading, his tent entry flap ajar to let
     the small candle lantern ventilate.

     OS we HEAR a ZIPPING SOUND. It's Rainey. We see him
     from Chris' POV coming out of his tent deep in thought.

     As he moves to the glowing embers of what remains of the
     campfire, Rainey's face goes out of frame and all Chris
     can see are his booted feet, tapping bits of glowing wood
     into the center of the fire. The tapping is slow and
     thoughtful. Micro-embers float upward into the night.

     Chris' tent flap closes by his own hand.

     ANGLE: Chris' dog-ears his book and puts out the lantern.

                                                          CUT TO:


42   EXT. ORICK BEACH - DAY                                      42

     We see Chris foraging for firewood in the bluffs above
     the beach. He's got it tied to his back and his front.
     If we didn't know better, we'd think he was camouflaging
     himself.

     Chris' POV: The rocks beside the water's edge. We see
     Rainey sitting beside the water, staring out to sea. We
     follow Chris' gaze to Jan, some fifty yards down the
     beach, walking melancholically in the opposite direction
     of Rainey.
     ANGLE: Rainey at the water's edge.   Chris appears beside
     him.

                            RAINEY
                      (regarding Chris wrapped up
                       in wood)
               Geez. If I struck a match to you, I'd
               have warmth and dinner at the same time.

                                                       31.



But Rainey's humor does not hide an inner turmoil.

                       CHRIS
          Where's Jan going?

                       RAINEY
          Well, my friend, all is not well on the
          hippie front.

Chris pulls out his pocketknife, cuts the twine that
binds the firewood to his body, and takes a seat beside
Rainey.

                       RAINEY (CONT'D)
          You're an industrious little fucker,
          aren't ya... Yeah, it's funny how things
          happen at particular times. I've loved
          that woman for a lot of years. But you
          know, she's got a...story. We've been
          going through this thing real quietly
          cause, well...So, after running into you
          last night, this thing we were going
          through quietly, she started talking
          about. You know what I mean?

                        CHRIS
          I think so.

                       RAINEY
          You think what?

Chris is looking off at Jan walking in the distance.

                       CHRIS
          I think she's probably quietly
          disconnecting. It doesn't feel right to
          her to be close to you if there's a hole
          of some kind somewhere else.

                       RAINEY
          That's a helluva insight. Jesus!...
          You're not Jesus, are you? You gonna
          walk on that water and get her back for
          me?

                       CHRIS
          Actually, I'm a little afraid of water.

Rainey gives him a sideways glance.

                       CHRIS (CONT'D)
          It's true. But it's something I've got
          to get over sometime.
                       (MORE)

                                                              32.

                            CHRIS (CONT'D)
               So, I'll swim in it if you'll carry the
               firewood back to the campsite.

                             RAINEY
               I'll carry.   Shit-yes I'll carry.

     And with that, Chris runs down the beach toward Jan.
     Rainey watches Chris and Jan chat briefly. Then they
     strip down to their underwear and jump into the ocean,
     splashing and laughing.

     ANGLE: Rainey. A warmth comes over him, watching his old
     lady having some fun. He grabs two armfuls of wood and
     heads to the campsite.

     ANGLE: Chris and Jan swimming in the chilly water, having
     a ball.

     Jan increasingly indulges herself a motherly closeness
     and joy with Chris. And Chris allows it. She pushes the
     stringy hairs from his eyes, worries when he descends
     below the surface for too many seconds, and smiles and
     laughs in tender relief when from below surface one of
     her toes is pulled on by the big fish Chris. As he re-
     surfaces, she gives him a splash right in the face.

                                                        TIME CUT:


43   EXT. CAMPSITE, ORICK BEACH - LATER                          43

     Through a burning campfire in the late afternoon, we see
     the chilly bodies of Chris and Jan carrying their clothes
     run shivering toward us.

     Rainey sits beside the campfire.
                            RAINEY
               I thought you guys might need a little
               heat.

     Jan smiles appreciatively.

                            JAN
                      (moving to Rainey)
               That's not hot enough. Put your arms
               around me.

     As they embrace, Chris throws a coat on from his tent,
     puts on his funny straw hat, and grabs a book.

     Rainey has wrapped a blanket around Jan and they sit
     beside the fire.

                                                             33.



                            CHRIS
               I'm going to go down the beach a ways and
               read a little bit. I'll bring the rest
               of that wood back before nightfall.

                            RAINEY
               Alright. We might take a run into town
               to grab some food for tonight.

                              CHRIS
               Sounds good.

     He heads off down the beach.

     Jan and Rainey on a blanket sharing a joint. Chris lying
     beside the campfire in his sleeping bag. Jan takes a
     toke, passes the joint to Rainey.

                            JAN
               You know what Alex ought to do, Rainey?
               He ought to come out to the Slabs this
               winter.

                                                         34.



                        RAINEY
          Oh yeah.

Rainey takes a toke on the joint.

                       RAINEY (CONT'D)
          You'd like that if you're still on the
          road. Lot of fellow travelers.

Rainey offers the joint to Chris.   Chris passes it up
with a hand gesture.

                       CHRIS
          What is that? The Slabs?

                       RAINEY
          It's down in Niland, California.   You
          know where the Salton Sea is?

                       CHRIS
          Near San Diego, yeah?

                       RAINEY
          Well about 200 miles Northeast of there,
          but yeah. Niland's off the east shore of
          Salton. Wild place. The navy bulldozed
          and abandoned a base there. All that's
          left is a grid of concrete foundations.
          They're scattered over about a square
          mile or so.

          When the weather turns cold across the

               Oh yeah. And a lot of second-hand goods.
               There's a swap meet. The people are
               cool. There's even some kids running
               around sometimes. Most everyone there,
               if they're not avoiding the cold, are at
               least dodging the IRS.

                             RAINEY
               Or the FBI.   CIA! DDT!!!

     The three of them laugh.

                            JAN
               It's good. You should check it out. If
               you come, I'll make a proper hat for you.
                      (standing, shaking out her
                       blanket)
               Well, Alex. I'm gonna clean up and the
               old man and I are gonna get some rest.
                      (indicating the sleeping bag)
               Looks like you got yourself a good bag
               there.

                            CHRIS
               Yeah...my mother made it from a kit.

     Jan sees an almost imperceptible mother pang in Chris,
     but he pushes it away quickly.

                            CHRIS (CONT'D)
               I'm gonna sleep out here by the fire.     I
               want to read a little bit.

     Jan moves to Chris, hugs him, kisses him on the cheek.
                            JAN
               You're wonderful.   Don't make me worry
               about you.

     The fire is burning low. Chris reads from Thoreau's
     WALDEN from the chapter on "Higher Laws" as we move
     slowly in toward him, we begin to HEAR quiet sounds of
     what may be love-making coming from Rainey and Jan's
     tent. A gentle smile comes over Chris' face and in its
     irony, he looks to the page before him.

     Chris' sliding fingertip underlines the following
     passage:
     Chastity is the flowering of a man; and what are called
     genius, heroism, holiness, and the like, are but various

47   EXT. CAMPSITE, ORICK BEACH - MORNING                       47

     Gulls pierce into the grey morning ocean, snapping from
     schools of fish. And the subtle crackling of a
     campfire's death. There on the beach, Jan and Rainey's
     van, their tent, and the fireless coals of last night.
     But no sign of Chris, his bag or his tent.

     Jan appears from her tent, rubbing her eyes. She wears a
     sarong which she re-secures at the breast, then notices
     that Chris has left. But where his tent had been, the
     words:

     THANK YOU JAN AND RAINEY

     are spelled out in the sand with bits of driftwood.

     CU: Jan - We see her sadness. Rainey appears at her
     shoulder. He understands what is inside his woman.

                            JAN
               He reminded me...

                            RAINEY
               I know.

49   EXT. CUT BANK, MONTANA - SUNSET (SEPTEMBER 10 1990)        49

     We see Chris hitching down a lonely two-lane road
     surrounded by fields and distant mountains.

                            CARINE (V.O.)
               In early September, mom and dad got a
               call from the Annandale police notifying
               them that Chris' abandoned car had been
               identified by the Arizona Highway Patrol
               after a group of rare flower hunters
               stumbled upon it in the desert. There
               were no signs that Chris had intended to
               return to it. But there wasn't any
               evidence of struggle. The police said
               they thought Chris had chosen to leave it
               behind and not that it had been taken
               from him. Nonetheless, the initial
               comfort that gave mom and dad, quickly
               turned to their realization that Chris
               was actually trying not to be found.


50   EXT. ANNANDALE STREET - DUSK                               50

     We see Walt. He walks out the door of his house into the
     street. He keeps walking. And we go with him in his
     silent but internal Armageddon. We PULL him in CU
     throughout all that follows...(Refer to SCENE 171: "Dad
     calls it `suspended animation.'" This may affect our
     visual approach)

                            CARINE
               The year Chris graduated high school he
               bought the Datsun, used. He wanted to
               drive it cross-country and visit our old
               neighborhood in California. The day
               before he left was my dad's birthday.
               Chris made a speech...

                                                             38.




51   INT. MCCANDLESS HOME, ANNANDALE (PAST)                      51

     Chris stands beside the family piano, speaking to a party
     of his parent's friends, Walt and Billie among them.
     Beside him, a large gift-wrapped present. Carine sits at
     the foot of the stairs at the back of the room watching
     her brother with a hint of concern.

                            CHRIS
                      (a little drunk, a little
                       emotional)
               Dad, you and I have had our differences
               over the years...but on your birthday I
               want to tell you how grateful I am for
               all the things you've given me. And that
               you did it starting from nothing to
               working your way through college and
               busting your ass to support us kids. So,
               in return, I've been busting my ass a
               bit...at Domino's Pizza -

     Chris moves to the gift.

                            CHRIS (CONT'D)
               and I've gotten you this token, this
               damned expensive token, as a token of
               that appreciation.

     Chris holds the large gift toward Walt. Walt moves
     through his friends to Chris and strips the paper,
     exposing a beautiful Questar Telescope.

                            WALT
                      (patting his son the back)
               Would you look at that.
     Walt holds the telescope up for all to see.   And the
     party responds with applause.

     Chris walks through the cheering family friends to take
     his place beside Carine at the bottom of the steps.

                            CARINE
               Jesus, you must've had a lot to drink.

                            CHRIS
               Too much and not enough. I used to
               believe all that stuff. That whole
               story. I thought maybe if I said it
               again, I'd believe it. But I don't.

                                                            39.



     Tears have come to Chris' eyes. He puts his head in his
     hands. Carine puts an arm around him.

     PRESENT:   Walt expressionless, walking into camera.

                             CARINE (V.O.)
                The day after the party, Chris left on
                his trip and ended up staying away most
                of the summer. It was nearly three months
                before he walked back into our house in
                Annandale. He had a scruffy beard, his
                hair was long and tangled, and he was
                rail thin. As soon as I heard he was
                home, I ran into his room to talk to him.
                In California, he'd looked up some old
                family friends who still lived there.
                He'd found out that long after he had
                been born, our dad had continued a
                relationship with his first wife Marcia
                in secret.

     BRIEF CUTAWAY to Chris hitching on the Montana highway.

                             CARINE
                And that one lie had led to another.
                That two years after Chris was born, dad
                had had another son with Marcia. Worse
                yet was that it was Marcia to whom he was
                still legally married at the time. And
                it was Chris and I who were the bastard
                children.

     Walt.

                             CARINE
                Dad's arrogance made him conveniently
                oblivious to the pain he caused. And
                mom, in the shame and embarrassment of a
                young mistress, became his accomplice.

             CARINE (CONT'D)
She and my dad had decided to bend the
truth about this other child saying that
dad wasn't the father and they maintained
that their fraudulent marriage was real.

                                            39A.

             CARINE (CONT'D)
Chris was quiet when he told me this. He
said it made his "entire childhood seem
like a fiction"; that "the truth had been
dying everyday." If something bothered
Chris, he'd usually keep it to himself.
And he made me promise to do the same.

                                                           40.

                            CARINE (CONT'D)
               He never did tell mom and dad that he
               knew. But Chris measured himself and
               those around him by an impossibly
               rigorous moral code. He loathed what he
               considered mom and dad's hypocrisy and
               resented what they considered guidance.
               Chris submitted to dad's authority
               through college but I knew he raged
               inwardly the whole time. It was
               inevitable that Chris would rebel. And
               when he did, he did it with
               characteristic immoderation.

     Walt suddenly collapses to his knees weeping, heartbroken
     and ashamed on a quiet Annandale street in the shadowless
     light of dusk.

                            CARINE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
               My father is a brilliant man. But he had
               made some terrible mistakes. And to some
               extent, it seemed Chris was making him
               pay an awful price.

     The image of Walt DISSOLVES INTO...

55   EXT. CUT BANK, MONTANA (SEPTEMBER 10, 1990)                 55


     A pick-up truck pulls over for Chris. As Chris jumps in,
     we see on the passenger side door, the name WAYNE
     WESTERBERG boldly painted across it. Chris hops in
     beside a hyper kinetic man with thick shoulders and a
     black goatee.
                            WAYNE
                      (rolling a cigarette without
                       moving forward with the
                       truck, his knees rattling up
                       and down)
               How're you doing? Wayne Westerberg.

                            CHRIS
                      (shaking hands)
               Hi Wayne. Alex McCandless.

                            WAYNE
               Seems like every time I come on this
               road, there's somebody hitching out here
               who looks as skinny and unfed as you.

     Chris nods with a laugh.   Wayne continuing...

                                                              41.



                            WAYNE (CONT'D)
               Look, I gotta stop in Ethridge to drop
               something off (know what I mean?)

     Chris is not sure about the "drop something off" part.

                            WAYNE (CONT'D)
               How `bout you and I grab something to eat
               down there?

                            CHRIS
               Oh, I wouldn't want to burden you.

                            WAYNE
               How long has it been since you've had
               anything to eat?

                            CHRIS
               Couple of days. I kinda ran out of
               money.

                            WAYNE
               Well, there's no choice about it.    I'm
               gonna get you some dinner.

     Wayne lights his cigarette, puts the truck in gear and
     they head down the road.

     As the sun dips behind the horizon we TILT UP off the
     departing truck to the sky. Ominously mounting clouds
     stunningly reflect the red rays of the hidden sun:

                                                          CUT TO:

56   EXT. SUNBURST - NIGHT                                       56
     Wayne's truck cuts through a track in a wheat field
     moving toward a compound of three trailers, one a double-
     wide, the other two on wheels, smaller. Beside them, a
     Wyeth-esque farmhouse. He eases the engine and comes to
     a stop in front of the double-wide.

     As he and Chris dismount the truck, Wayne gives him a
     hushing finger across the lips. They tip-toe up to the
     door, where Wayne shuffles a bunch of keys.

     A little thunder kicking in the distant sky.

                                                           41A.




56A   INT. DOUBLE-WIDE - NIGHT                                  56A

      As Wayne and Chris enter, they tip-toe over empty booze
      bottles and passed out work crew; Wayne's harvesting
      team.

      They make their way to a small table in the kitchenette.
      Remains of the evening's dinner are on the stove. Wayne
      turns on the stovetop coils to heat it up.

                             WAYNE
                So where is it you're headed?

                             CHRIS
                I was thinking about doubling back
                through the Canadian side of Glacier
                Park.

                             WAYNE
                Yeah, I used to have a girlfriend who'd
                go there, camp on the Black Feet Res.
                She was into all that American Indian
                stuff.

          I can bring you to the border at Sweet
          Grass once you've had some food.

                       CHRIS
          Well, that'd be great.   What do you do
          out here?

                       WAYNE
          Well, I do a lot of things. Computer
          programming. Video game repair. I'm a
          licensed pilot, own a grain elevator in
          Carthage and another one a few miles out
          of town. But in the summertime I run a
          combine crew, follow the harvest from
          Texas way the hell north to the Canadian
          border. We just got done cutting barley
          for Coors and Anheuser Busch. But then I
          got this little black box deal on the
          side (You know what I mean?)

                       CHRIS
          You mean those free satellite TV deals?

                       WAYNE
                 (as though he hadn't brought
                  it up)
          You said it, not me.

Chris is dazzled by this renaissance man of the plains.

Wayne stands to dish out a couple of plates of heated
food. As Chris starts digging in, a major gust of wind
rocks the trailer.

                       WAYNE (CONT'D)
                 (smiling, responding to wind)
          OOOOOOH.
Chris doesn't respond, digs into the food. Points to the
unconscious tribe splayed out. SIX GERMANIC-LOOKING
UNCONSCIOUS BODIES.

                       CHRIS
          Who are these guys?

Wayne gets a little giggle.

                       WAYNE
          Those are my Hudderites. Agriculture's a
          pretty transient business. These guys
          come off the Hudderite colony looking for
          work. I always got work for people.
          Then that guy -

                       of his snore)
               That's Kevin. He's with me most of the
               time. He's not a Hudderite. He's from
               Madison.

                              CHRIS
               Madison.    Okay.

     Just then, the rain kicks in full gear outside, pounding
     the trailer shell. A couple hits of lightning follow.

                            WAYNE
               Listen, you don't want to go out there on
               the road tonight. Why don't you just
               roll your sleeping bag out and play like
               a Hudderite until morning.

     Chris looks about. There's not much room but it beats
     the pelting outside.

                            CHRIS
               Thanks Wayne. I will.

     Chris, with a grin on his face, lays in his sleeping bag
     between a Hudderite and the sleeping KEVIN. Wayne comes
     from the back bedroom, tip-toes through the sleeping
     bodies to hand Chris a pillow.

                            WAYNE
               Get a good sleep. See you in the
               morning.

     Chris waves a thanks, puts the pillow beneath his head
     and closes his eyes.

     We are TIGHT on Chris' hand atop the shifter of one of
     Wayne's lumbering harvesters.

                                                              43.



                            WAYNE (O.S)
               Okay. Now take hold of the joystick, get
               the feel of header, idle it down with the
               toggle switch...

     As Chris makes the attempt, we immediately hear the
     grinding of gears, the instrument alarms in chaos.

     WIDE SHOT: Chris and Wayne sit atop a combine. In the
     background we see Wayne's trailer and two other combines
     piloted by Wayne's crew members on the ocean of ripe
     blond grain.

     Chris tries his hand at the shifter once more.   This time
     the thing starts to move.

                            WAYNE (CONT'D)
               That's it. That's it. Now take it on
               out and make yourself some money.

     Wayne jumps off the combine and Chris begins to cut his
     pattern, intermittently struggling with the shifter.

     Wayne laughs his ass off.

     Chris gets a hang of the machines a little more at a
     time.

     Six men including Wayne and Chris, two among them -
     Hudderites, crowd in to the small dinner area of the
     trailer. Talking politics and bullshit, and eating a
     welcome meal.

                            WAYNE
               I'm gonna break out some whiskey. Alex,
               you want anything other than that beer?

                            CHRIS
               I'd take a White Russian if you've got
               it.

     The group of men laugh at the youngster's order of a
     fancy drink.

                                                              44.

                What are you Alex, a Commie?

                             CHRIS
                No, I just like White Russians.

                             WAYNE
                I haven't got anything like that here.
                But I tell ya what. And I know I speak
                for everybody. You wanna come work with
                us in Carthage, we'll hook you up on the
                grain elevator and get you a White
                Russian down at the Cabaret.

                               CHRIS
                Really?

                             WAYNE
                Dawn tomorrow, engines roaring.

                        blues singer)
                "Pot o Gold. Oh that pot o gold."

      They all join in to the chant/song:

                "Pot o Gold.    Gotta get that pot o gold!"

      MAGIC HOUR. TELEPHOTO LENS. The harvesting convoy rolls
      toward us like a herd of mammoths.

                                                           44A-45.




63    EXT. CARTHAGE - NIGHT (LATE SEPTEMBER 1990)                63

      A series of silent, quaint establishing tableaus.
      (Director's Note:    Condor above street)

      It's a sleepy little town. Population: 274. Cluster of
      clapboard houses, tiny yards, and weathered brick
      storefronts rising humbly from the immensity of the
      northern plains. Stately rows of cottonwoods shade a
      grid of streets, seldom disturbed by moving vehicles.

      From UNDER CAMERA, the series of tableaus is interrupted
      as the convoy roars into our frame from BENEATH CAMERA.

                                                           CUT TO:

      In the passenger seat, Chris is glowing at his new
      surroundings. Wayne picks up the CB radio.

                             WAYNE
                Okay Kevin, get all the machines back to
                the elevator. I'm gonna show Chris to
                his room.

                             KEVIN (O.S.)
                       (over CB)
                I've got dibs on that shower, that
                shower's all me.

                       (laughs)

     A two-story Victorian in the Queen Anne style. Wayne
     veers his truck into the front yard, parking under the
     big cottonwood that towers above.

                                               SHORT TIME CUT:


67   INT. WESTERBERG'S CARTHAGE HOME - SAME                     67
     Chris follows Wayne up the narrow stairwell.

                                                             47.

                      (carrying Chris' pack for
                       him)
               Come on up in here. This'll be your room
               for as long as you hang about.

     Wayne opens the door at the top of the stairs.


68   INT. CHRIS' ROOM, WESTERBERG'S CARTHAGE HOME - SAME        68

     Wayne plops Chris' pack beside a single bed in the tiny
     but comfortable room. Chris enters, very happy with his
     new quarters.

                            WAYNE
               Shower's down the hall. If you hurry you
               can beat the rest of the boys to it. But
               you do want to grab a shower cause we're
               all heading over to the Cabaret in
               exactly thirty-six minutes. So, get your
               dancing shoes on. There's foo-foo in the
               medicine cabinet. I think it's Brut.
                      (slaps his own face as if
                       he's putting on cologne)
               Then you want to put your charm in
               overdrive cause we like to PAH-TAY!

     Wayne gives Chris a wink and exits, shutting the door
     behind him.

     Chris takes in his new surroundings. He's on a work crew
     and he likes it. Chris makes the move for the shower but
     by the time he opens his door to the hall, all the other
     crew members are barreling up the stairs in front of
     them, clamoring for dibs (Chris' POV)
                              MAN #1
               I got first!

               You had first last night!

                            MAN #1
                      (entering the bathroom)
               Well, if you wanna wash my back,
               cowboy...

                            MAN #2
               You go ahead, fairy.    Just don't use all
               the soap.

     ANGLE: Chris. He gets a kick out of these guys.    He
     closes the door.

69   INT. CABARET BAR, CARTHAGE - NIGHT                          69

     The Jack Daniels is flowing. Wayne's crew drinks,
     smokes, and strikes out with every fat woman in the
     place. GAIL BORAH, an on-again, off-again girlfriend of
     Wayne's tends bar. A petite sad-eyed woman, slight as a
     heron, delicate features and long blond hair. Wayne and
     Chris sit at the end of the bar.

                            WAYNE
               Alex, this is Gail . This is the one to
               go to for that White Russian you've been
               wanting. Of course the quid pro quo can
               be hazardous.

                            GAIL
               Shut up, Wayne.
                      (to Chris)
               You want a White Russian, sweetie?

                            CHRIS
                      (shyly)
               Yes please, ma'am.

                            WAYNE
               Yes please, ma'am?

     Wayne slaps Chris on the back.
                            WAYNE (CONT'D)
               Ain't he great?
                            GAIL
                      (to Chris)
               Don't pay any attention to him.

     With that Wayne reaches over the bar, grabs Gail and
     gets her in a lip-lock, to which she ultimately gives in.

                                                       TIME CUT:

     Wayne and Chris are both drunk.

                       WAYNE
          Anything to do with hunting, preserving
          the meat, smoking it or whatever, you
          talk to Kevin over there. That's your
          man.

ANGLE: KEVIN.   He looks every bit the Grizzly Adams part.

                       WAYNE (CONT'D)
          Outdoors-man. What's the interest in all
          that?

                       CHRIS
          I'm thinking about going to Alaska.

                       WAYNE
          Alaska, Alaska? Or city Alaska?     The
          city Alaska does have markets.

                       CHRIS
                 (with a drunken, excited
                  energy)
          No, Alaska, Alaska. I want to be all the
          way out there. On my own. No map. No
          watch. No axe. Just out there. Big
          mountains, rivers, sky. Game. Just be
          out there in it. In the wild.

                         WAYNE
          In the wild.

                      CHRIS
          Yeah. Maybe write a book about my
          travels. About getting out of this sick
          society.
                       WAYNE
                 (coughing)
          Society, right.

                       CHRIS
          Because you know what I don't understand?
          I don't understand why, why people are so
          bad to each other, so often. It just
          doesn't make any sense to me. Judgement.
          Control. All that.

                       WAYNE
          Who "people" we talking about?

                       CHRIS
          You know, parents and hypocrites.
          Politicians and pricks.

                                                               50.



     Chris is clearly troubled by his own words.      Wayne leans
     into Chris.

                              WAYNE
                        (tapping a long finger
                         against Chris' forehead)
                 This is a mistake. It's a mistake to get
                 too deep into that kind of stuff. Alex,
                 you're a helluva young guy, but I promise
                 you this: You're a young guy. Blood and
                 fire! You're juggling blood and fire!

                              GAIL
                        (chimes in)
                 Who are you to be giving advice to
                 anybody?

                              WAYNE
                 Blood and fire...What? Mr. Happy.
                 That's who I am. Gimme a kiss.

     Gail    pushes him off with mock disgust.

                              WAYNE (CONT'D)
                        (mock opening his zipper, in
                         a high-pitched voice)
                 Come on, give Mr. Happy a kiss!

     On the television above the bar appears Reverend Jesse
     Jackson. We can't hear him but we can see him. Chris
     points at the television and yells out to the entire bar
     of cowboys and ranch hands -

                              CHRIS
                 Now, that's who could be President!
     Wayne buries his face in his hands.

     Chris is sacked out from his night of drinking when -

     BOOM!   BOOM!   BOOM!

     The door knocks blast into Chris' head. He awakens to
     Wayne opening his bedroom door. Wayne, despite his own
     drinking the night before, is wide awake and fresh as a
     daisy.

               So, what do you think about all this?
               (The working life)

     While Wayne and most of the crew get a little rest in the
     shade of the grain elevator and eat their lunches, Chris
     and Kevin are deep in a bald patch in the field.

     Kevin is taking Chris through the paces of smoking and
     curing meat in the wilds. Chris listens and takes notes.
     (Director's note: Cast a "Kevin" who knows this shit and

     The place is packed and Chris is taking over the piano,
     surprising everyone with a tremendous talent. Segueing
     from honky-tonk country to ragtime, he's become the life
     of the party.

     The MUSIC continues OVER:


75   EXT. GRAIN ELEVATOR - DAY                                   75

     All the men of Wayne's crew (who by now we've come to
     know) and Chris are working their asses off.

     POST LAP MUSIC FADES OUT as we:

INTERCUT the crew at work with a SERIES OF MYSTERY
ANGLES: Tires kicking up dust on dirt roads, through
town, and into the field behind the grain elevator. Back
to the work, back to the tires. Back to the work, back
to these several cars hauling ass through the field.
Back to Wayne, up high in the grain elevator -

                       WAYNE
                 (to Chris, as he lowers
                  himself down the man-lift)
          I gotta take a piss.

Chris' POV: from high in the grain elevator. He watches
Wayne below, as Wayne saunters out to the field to take a
piss. With his back to us, Wayne whips it out and starts
pissing about 25 yards from the grain elevator.

CU Wayne. He looks up from his urination, the grain
elevator behind him. We see a slight mischievous smile
come to his face. He puts his hands up into the air when
suddenly -

Six unmarked FBI vehicles surround him.
(Director's note: Triangulate three long lenses on Wayne
as the mysterious cars enter each frame, as they skid to
a dusty stop on all sides of him.)

Chris and the men of his crew look on.

                       MAN #1
          I warned him about those little black
          boxes.

As Wayne is handcuffed and led away, he nods up to his
boys.
                        WAYNE
                 (to arresting agent)
          You wanna get that zipper for me?
                 (and then calling out to his
                  crew)
          Sorry boys. Gonna have to shut down for
          a while. Alex! You come back and work
          for me anytime.
                 (to Chris and the men)
          Gail's got all your checks, guys. I
          shouldn't be away too long.

With that, the FBI agents have hustled the good-natured
Wayne into the back of one of the cars.

                                                             53.



     As they take off into the distance, we move in on Chris,
     bemused.

               I've been thinking a lot about Alaska.

                            GAIL
               Alaska? What kind of nut-nut are you?
               Alex, it's October for Christ's sake.
               You go to Alaska, you go in the Spring.
               This time of year you wanna head south.
               Personally, I like Las Vegas. One-armed
               bandit. That's what I like.

                            CHRIS
               Yeah, maybe I ought to put off going to
               Alaska, at least so I can get settled up
               there in decent weather.

                            GAIL
               South. You want to go south. You want
               me to take you out to the highway?

                            CHRIS
                      (putting on his cowboy)
               Little lady, I walked in, I can walk out.
     He puts a few bills down on the bar, saddles up his
     backpack, and gives Gail a hug.

                            GAIL
               You take care of yourself now, Alex. You
               got a whole family here depending on it.

                            CHRIS
               I will. Thanks Gail .   And tell Wayne,
               I'll drop him a line.

     He gives her a kiss on the cheek and he's off.

     SERIES OF ANGLES: Chris walking south through the desert
     following the river bank. He covers twelve miles before
     he arrives in an Arizona town, a dusty weigh-in station.


80   EXT. ARIZONA TOWN - NIGHT                                   80

     The town is quiet but along the storefront lane where
     Chris walks, he comes upon a sporting goods store. In
     the window, a fiberglass river kayak. Chris stares at
     it.

     belongings. He makes sure he's got his check from
     working with Wayne in his pocket. He packs only the
     essential items, burying all else. He gets into his
     sleeping bag and goes to sleep.

                             CHRIS
                Yeah. If I wanted to paddle down the
                river, where's the best place to launch
                out of?

                             GREEN SUIT
                "To launch out of?" What's your
                experience level?

                             CHRIS
                Not much.

                              GREEN SUIT
                Any?   Do you have a permit?

                             CHRIS
                A permit for what?
                             GREEN SUIT
                You can't paddle down the river without a
                permit. If you like, you can apply for
                one here, get yourself some experience,
                and I'll put you on the wait-list.

                              CHRIS
                Wait-list?   To paddle down a river?

               Well, you could always join a commercial
               raft trip and go with a licensed guide.
               They usually have a few last minute
               cancellations. I think it's about two-
               thousand dollars.

     Chris busts a gut.

                            CHRIS
               Thanks for your help.

     The Green Suit eyes Chris' departure with suspicion.

83   EXT. COLORADO RIVER - DAY                                    83

     Chris stands beside a dramatic section of rapids.    The
     whitewater roars.

     As we SLOWLY ZOOM INTO Chris' face, terrified and
     absorbed by the torrent, a bead of sweat drops across his
     forehead, TILTS OUR CAMERA to his trembling hands and
     legs, when Peter Gabriel's I Have The Touch begins to
     play.

                                                         BACK TO:

     ZOOM INTO Chris' face...a decision:
     Fear becomes determination
     We SMASH CUT ON CUE with Peter Gabriel's vocals. SLO MO,
     SUPER DRAMATIC - Chris blasting out of a shoot in the
     rapids in the kayak we saw the night before. It's
     outrageous. Hair-raising. Just like Peter Gabriel sings
     it, he has the touch.

     This kid's never kayaked before, certainly never on
     rapids. But it's that immortal stage of life, no care,
     no helmet, no life-jacket, pure adrenaline. He can
     hardly believe he's surviving it as he goes but there's
     no looking back now. And with every thump of the music,
     we share his rush. His pure unadulterated exhilaration.

     With the culmination of the music, Chris has successfully
     shot the rapid. He paddles through quiet waters.

                                                            57.


     We move in on him as he maneuvers the kayak to face
     upstream. There before him, the impossible rapid he had
     just completed.

                            CHRIS
                      (to himself)
               I'm Superman. SuperTramp.

     He feels immortal. He makes his about-face and is about
     to head down stream when he sees at the river's edge, a
     group of RIVER TOURISTS and their GUIDE lunching beside a
     pontoon raft. The tourists look like a bunch of
     bewildered tubby-troopers in their misfitted orange life-
     vests and cereal bowl helmets. The RIVER GUIDE yells out
     at Chris as Chris moves PAST CAMERA and away. The guide
     gets on his satellite phone to alert the Rangers. We
     ZOOM SLOWLY away from them toward the rapid.

     from hundreds of feet below the canyon crest.

85   EXT. FURTHER ALONG THE RIVER - LATER                         85

     The canyon has widened to beach-like banks.   Music FADES.

     Along the banks he sees a YOUNG BLONDE COUPLE. This is
     MADS and SONJA, in their 20's, Danish. They play at the
     river's edge beside their campsite, hotdogs cooking on a
     Hibachi. Chris averts his eyes when Sonja rises from the
     water, topless.

                              MADS
                        (yelling out to Chris)
               Hello!

                              CHRIS
               Hello.

                            MADS
               You can join us!

     Chris doesn't know quite what to do. But Mads seems
     quite comfortable inviting a stranger into the presence
     of his topless girlfriend.

                                                         58.



                       MADS (CONT'D)
          We have hotdogs!

Chris - can't turn that down!   He paddles to within feet
of the water's edge.

                        MADS (CONT'D)
          I am Mads.

          Hi. Alex.

                        SONJA
          I am Sonja.

Chris gives Sonja a little wave. She bypasses it, wading
up to the Kayak, giving him a big hug.

                        SONJA (CONT'D)
          Hello Alex.

This couple is extremely energetic. Can't wait to
please. And a bona fide American adventurer in their
midst. It's everything they could've wanted.

                       MADS
          We are from Copenhagen.   And you are from
          the rapids.

                        CHRIS
          I am.

                        SONJA
          My Got!
                       MADS
          Crazy man. You're a crazy man!    Sonja,
          he is a crazy man.
                 (to Chris)
          I'll make you a hotdog.

Mads grabs a hotdog from the Hibachi.

                       MADS (CONT'D)
          Just one minute. One minute...

Sonja has moved to the tent to put on a dry T-shirt. But
as she moves back to the water's edge, those nipples keep
saying Hello.

Chris, meanwhile, simply cannot wipe the smile off his
face in the presence of these warm, open people.

                                                      59.



                      MADS (CONT'D)
          I love this. Don't you love this? This
          is nature. We see it in the American
          movies. How come you're crazy?

                       CHRIS
          Well...

                       MADS
                 (interrupting)
          Because that's crazy! You come down the
          rapids. What do you want on your hotdog?
          Mustard and relish?

                       CHRIS
          You have ketchup?

                       MADS
          No, I have mustard and relish.

                       CHRIS
          Mustard and relish it is then.

                       MADS
          Sonja, you want a hotdog?

                       SONJA
                 (in Danish)
          Of course I want a hotdog.   Why are you
          stupid?

Mads plops two more hotdogs onto the grill.

                       MADS
                 (translating)
          She asked me why I'm stupid. And I say,
          well...like I ask you why you're crazy
          and you say "well." Where are you going?

                       CHRIS
          I haven't decided.

                       MADS
          We like it here very much. We went to
          Los Angeles. And then, we went to Las
          Vegas.

                       SONJA
          Las Vegas is very nice.   The universe is
          very good.

                                            59A.



             MADS
And then, we come here.   Maybe you go to
Mexico.

                       MADS (CONT'D)
          You can take kayak around Lake Mead and
          then take the river down to Mexico.

Chris likes the idea.

                       CHRIS
          How far are we from Lake Mead?

                       MADS
          Sonja, how far is Hoover Dam?

Sonja grabs a map from the tent, opens and scrutinizes
it. We follow her finger tracing the river.

                       SONJA
          Maybe three hundred thirty
          kilometers...like two hundred miles.

Sonja walks the map over to Chris at water's edge and
hands it to him. He studies it.

                       CHRIS
          Man, I wonder if I could go all the way
          down into the Gulf of California.

Chris traces his finger along the impossibly long route
leading to El Golfo de Santa Clara.

                  Chris' hotdog)
          I go with you. We leave Sonja here.    You
          and me in kayak - we go to Mexico.

                       SONJA
                 (in Danish)
          You're embarrassing.   Idiot.
Mads with a burst of re-exhilaration, grabs Chris' hand,
shaking it violently.

                       MADS
          I like the meeting you.

                      CHRIS
          Thank you. I'm very happy to meet both
          of you too.

Sonja heads back for her hotdog taking her T-shirt off on
the move. Chris is about to bust a gut. Sonja returns
to her sunbathing. These two are a hoot.

                                                     60A.



Just then, something catches Chris' attention upriver.
We can just barely make out the SOUNDS of a jet boat
motor. His eyes narrow a bit, then -

                                                             61.



                            CHRIS (CONT'D)
               Well, guys I really appreciate the
               hospitality but I wanna make camp down-
               river a ways so I better take off before
               dark.

86   EXT. COLORADO RIVER - MOMENTS LATER                        86

     Chris, back in the kayak is paddling down river. Mads
     and Sonja on the bank, wave a boisterous goodbye. And
     they just keep waving. And Chris keeps waving until he
     has drifted out of sight, when around the upriver bend
     arrive the RIVER PATROL.

     At river's edge, Mads, thinking quickly, waves for their
     attention. Pointing the river patrol back upriver, he
     yells:

                            MADS
               He went thattaway!   The crazy man - he
               went thattaway!

     And miraculously, the river patrol makes an about face
     and heads in the opposite direction of Chris. Suddenly
     Sonja thinks Mads is the most clever man on earth. As
     she jumps his bones right there on the river's edge -

                            SONJA
               Just like in the movies.

     heading down river by road. We pass the Hoover Dam.

                            CARINE (V.O.)
               It would be Christmas in a couple of
               months. And the last news we'd had was
               about his car being found. I woke up a
               couple of days ago, and for the first
               time, I was surprised to realize that it
               wasn't only my parents who hadn't heard
               from Chris. I wondered why he hadn't
               tried to call in case I might answer. He
               could've hung up if it wasn't me.


88   EXT. COLORADO RIVER, TOPOCK, ARIZONA - DAY                  88

     Chris is re-stocked on some food items which he packs in
     his bag and shoves into the bow of the kayak. This lower
     stretch of the river has little in common with the
     unbridled torrent that explodes through the Grand Canyon.
     Emasculated by dams and diversion canals, the lower
     Colorado burbles indolently from reservoir to reservoir,
     through some of the hottest, starkest, most austere
     country on the continent.

                                                              63.



                             CARINE
                But why he didn't send a letter, maybe
                through a friend. I got mad. But I told
                myself it was good. It made me remember
                that there was something more than
                rebellion, more than anger that was
                driving him. Chris had always been
                driven, had always been an adventurer.
                When he was four years old...

      A freight train cranks up its great engines and starts
      its move west.

      Chris POV: We see a BULL (hobo slang for a railway
      security guard) making his rounds. As the bull
      disappears around the caboose, and the trains motion
      picks up, Chris appears from behind a fuel pump. He
      makes his move in the shadows to the passing freight
      cars, not quite sure how to board them. He begins to
      slowly jog beside the train. There is a vertical steel
      rod on each passing car. He times the train by putting
      his hand out and letting the vertical rods slap it.

                                                     71A.



And with that he accelerates to a run, throws his pack
into the moving freight car before him, simultaneously
leaping up to grab the rail and throw himself into the
car.

                                                              72.



      But his left foot misses and he's suddenly dangling from
      the moving train. He grabs hand over hand on the rail.

      ANGLE: Dangling feet and razor sharp wheels.

      ANGLE: Chris. He puts everything into pulling himself
      up, growling the strength into his muscles finally...

      it.) Chris uses his pack as a pillow, lays back on it and
      begins to sing Roger Miller's King of the Road.

      walking up Grand Street, backpack on his shoulders. We
      find he is not such an unusual sight, there are homeless
      to the left and homeless to the right.

                Can you tell me how to get an ID card?

                       SOCIAL WORKER
          Did you lose your identification sir?

                       CHRIS
          Yeah.

                       SOCIAL WORKER
          No birth certificate? Nothing?

Chris shakes his head apologetically.

                       SOCIAL WORKER (CONT'D)
          Ouch. Alright. Well you're gonna have
          to work that out with the DMV. You can
          catch them in the morning.

The social worker begins to write an address on a piece
of paper.

                       SOCIAL WORKER (CONT'D)
          The closest one is Montebello and we can
          help you with a bus voucher.

She hands the Montebello address to Chris.

                       SOCIAL WORKER (CONT'D)
          So, just come to this desk when you need
          the voucher.

                       CHRIS
          And, if I want to apply for a job
          somewhere, can you help me with that?

          If you know how to cook, we might have a
          space for you in our mobile kitchen. But
          I'll have to talk to my supervisor about
          it in the morning.

                       CHRIS
          Alright then. Thank you. Oh, one last

      Chris goes into his pack, grabs his canteen and drinks
      some water. Mid-sip, the train begins to make a
      surprising stop. Screeching wheels on track. Chris is
      alarmed. As he moves to peer out the door, even before
      he has a chance to see what's coming -- WHAM! He's
      smashed in the head with a baton. A BULL jumps into the
      car with him.

                             BULL #2
                Lay down on your stomach, spread eagle!

      Chris turns to reason with the man. And that's all it
      takes -- six straight blows to the ribs, legs, and arms.
      We hear it more than we see it. Chris is in agony.

                             BULL #2 (CONT'D)
                Let me see your face.

      The bull shines a flashlight into Chris' eyes.

                I never, ever, ever forget a face. If I
                see yours again, I won't arrest you.
                I'll kill you. This is the god-damned
                railroad. And we will do whatever we
                have to, to keep you freeloaders from
                violating our liability.

      Chris is trying to understand what the man is saying.

                Thanks very much.

      He closes the door and the car drives off. We follow
      Chris as he goes to the overpass edge. He drops his pack
      over the side. Chris climbs down the edge of the
      overpass, grabs his pack, and scurries into the UNDERPASS
      below. (We suddenly recognize this as his pre-river run
      campsite)

      He digs up his buried belongings, returning them to his
      pack. Last to come out of the ground, Chris' copy of
      Jack London's Call of the Wild. He pulls off a temp
      wrapping and dusts it off.
      Chris lights his candle lantern and begins to read.

                             CARINE (V.O.)
                In the nine months since Chris'
                disappearance, my parents went through
                enormous changes. Guilt was giving way
                to pain. And pain seemed to bring them
                closer. My father had humbled
                dramatically. And what had always been a
                sort of curt arrogance, the kind of man
                who actually thought he could cancel
                Christmas, had given way to the
                vulnerability of a father's heart. Even
                their faces had changed. It made me sad
                that I couldn't share with Chris the new
                closeness I felt toward our parents.

      The image of Chris reading begins a SLOW DISSOLVE INTO...

                I close my eyes at night sometimes and
                imagine where Chris might be.

      Suspicious, ghostly faces briefly appear in the strobing
      lights that hit the train car from outside. They're
      toothless and tattooed. Aged and young. Punks and
      piercings. They're train tramps.
      We see Chris observing them.   Warmly he speaks but we DO
      NOT HEAR, "I'm Alex."

                By some kind of supernatural osmosis?
                Chris once wrote to me from college
                saying he wanted to talk to me about all
                the problems he had with mom and dad.

      We see what may be Chris' POV from a train car snaking
      through a mountain pass.

      HIGH ANGLE CU: We see Chris walking the streets of
      Seattle. As we WIDEN OUT, he becomes a dot in the
      Seattle landscape.

                In those silent moments, with my eyes

                might be at that very moment, probably
                climbing some scary mountain, I want to
                reach into that picture and bring him
                back to see what mom and dad, what our
                family might become.

                But instead when I open my eyes, what I
                see is my mother, sitting at the dining
                room table, sifting through photo albums
                and pictures of Chris. It's all she can
                do to examine the snapshots. And, though
                she breaks down from time to time, she
                studies them with a sort of hungry
                intensity - like looking at food you
                can't eat, or into a window at a family
                around a table that you were once a part
                of and can be no more.

      We see Billie driving out of the Annandale supermarket
      onto the boulevard. She sees a hitchhiker roadside. She
      cranes her head - is it Chris? It's not.

                She convinces herself it's   Chris; that
                it's her son, whenever she   passes a
                stray. And I fear for the    mother in
                her...

                Instincts that seem to sense the threat
                of a loss so huge and irreparable that
                the mind balks at taking its measure - I
                begin to wonder if I do understand what
                Chris is saying any longer. But I catch
                myself in doubt and remember that these
                are not the parents he grew up with.
                That in the forced reflection that comes
                with loss, indeed everything Chris is
                saying, has to be said. And I trust for
                him that everything he is doing has to be
                done. This is our life.

      Chris is in the passenger seat of a Mac truck cab. Both
      Chris and the TRUCKER look outward as though to find an
      address or landmark.

                             TRUCKER
                I don't know where to drop you.
                Bullhead's kinda haphazard - there's no
                "center." You sure you don't want to be
                in Laughlin? It's casinos versus
                chiropractors.

                              CHRIS
                Yeah, no.   This is good.   Right here.

                             TRUCKER
                Alright then. Chiropractors it is.

      He pulls over. Chris grabs his pack and exits the truck
      in front of a laundromat. As the truck pulls away, Chris
      sees a "Help Wanted" sign for Burger King on the
      laundromat window.

      The place is packed with a line out the door. LORI, the
      second assistant manager, hurries back into the kitchen,
      where we find Chris in paper cap, bunning whoppers at a
      leisurely pace.
                             LORI
                Chris, you gotta go faster.   We've got a
                line out the door.

                              CHRIS
                        (a bit oblivious)
                Okay.

      But then just continues on at his leisurely daydreaming
      pace. Lori is about to say something but by now she
      knows there's no getting through to him. She looks down
      to the floor where we see that Chris wears no socks.

                Right, right. I forgot.

      Chris pedals up a dirt path to find many of his
      belongings strewn about. And in particular, some food
      supplies have been torn into. A coyote yips in the
      distance as Chris finds his old straw hat torn to shreds.
      Across the desert, scurrying away beyond the tumbleweed,
      three young coyotes head for the hills. Chris picks up
      his tattered hat and smiles.

      in tents and trailers, a quarter inch to the right of a

      swap and trade. Even a few makeshift food stands.

      know their characters, their history. Jan and Rainey are
      doing great. And while Chris is intermittently aware
      that the eyes of a pretty 16-year old girl are upon him,
      Chris lays out his travels and his PLAN FOR ALASKA.

      a canoe down to Mexico, hop freight trains, and score
      beds at inner-city missions, you can figure out Alaska

      At this point, the PRETTY 16-YEAR OLD GIRL who had had
      her eyes on Chris, takes the stage with an acoustic

                I'm going to start a calisthenics
                routine. I think after the check comes
                in, I'll try to find some mountains I can
                climb everyday till spring comes. I
                gotta see how far the money's gonna go.

          I'm going to have to pick up a lot of
          supplies before spring. So, I might take
          another job or I might be okay.

                       RAINEY
          Well, you know, we'll give you a little
          something for every day you work the
          booth.

                       CHRIS
          I'm not taking any money from you,
          Rainey.   It's been a real great twist
          meeting you two. You look like you're
          doing good.

                       RAINEY
          We are, and you were a big part of that,
          coming along when you did. Yep, things
          are good.
                 (gives a little giggle)
          Man, I used to think Tantric sex was just
          a bunch of reading. Speaking of which,
          don't you think you ought to introduce
          yourself to Joni Mitchell over there?

Chris looks up from his book to the wide open 16-year old
smile of Tracy. Rainey laughs aloud. Chris smiles back,      *
and against his better instincts, gives her a little wave-
over with the paperback. Tracy jumps off her step,           *
putting her guitar inside the rig, and trots like a
little wood nymph to Chris.

                               CHRIS
                That's good.    I heard you play your song
                last night.

                             TRACY                                    *

      Rainey amused by all of this.

                             CHRIS
                You are not terrible.

                I'm not?

                              CHRIS
                No.   You sing sweet.

                             TRACY                                    *
                Thank you. I was going to go watch the
                kids play in the mud. Do you want to go?

                              RAINEY
                Go on.   I'll watch the store.

                              CHRIS
                I'm sorry.   This is Rainey.   And I'm
                Chris.

      Whoops, a slip on the name, but...

                             RAINEY
                Hi. Rainey. And this is Alex. ("Don't
                lie to her.")

      Chris realizes his slip but before Rainey can question
      anything, Chris stands and goes off with Tracy.                 *

      Rainey and Jan share a conspiratorial smile.

      on folding chairs, out of Rainey and Tracy's earshot.           *

                             JAN
                I wasn't much older than Tracy when I got             *
                pregnant. And I thought my husband and I
                were going to invent peace on earth and
                stay together forever. But it didn't
                work out that way. He left. History.
                Now ancient history. And that was the
                end of that. So, I raised Reno by myself
                - that's my son. Then I met Rainey. And
                that was really good for a while. But
                Reno was already a teenager and was
                becoming a man in his own way. And then,
                I don't know. He kinda followed in his
                father's footsteps - out the door and
                gone. And I really don't know where he
                is. I haven't heard from him in two
                years.

                             CHRIS
                I hope I get to meet him sometime.
      Jan looks into Chris' eyes and smiles with pure love.
      She leans over and gently kisses Chris on the cheek.

                             JAN
                Do your folks know where you are?

      Chris aims to deflect the question as Tracy enters the          *
      scene.

                             TRACY                                    *
                Soup's on. Oh, I'm sorry.   Are you guys

                 No, sweetheart. Just hungry. You've
                 been doing a fantastic job over there.
                        (to Chris)
                 Shall we eat?

                             CHRIS
                 Yeah.

      Tracy grabs Chris' hand and proudly leads him to supper.         *

      OS VOICES exchange Christmas greetings.

                              RAINEY
                 I really ought to get myself doing that.

                              CHRIS
                 You should Rainey. Makes that Tantric
                 stuff go even better.

                                                     93.



                       RAINEY
          How the hell would you know? That poor
          girl over there is about ready to vault
          onto a fence post. And here you are, the
          monk of Jack LaLane.

They share a laugh. Chris comes to the end of his sit-
ups. Wipes his brow with a towel. Rainey squats down
next to him.

                       RAINEY (CONT'D)
          I guess Jan filled you in. About Reno
          and everything. Children can be harsh
          judges when it comes to their parents.
          They don't grant clemency easily. I
          think Reno tended to see things in black
          and white. I just hope he lives long
          enough to forgive her.

The connection is not lost on Chris.

                       RAINEY (CONT'D)
          But painful as it is, you turned a light
          on in her and I'm grateful.

                       CHRIS
          Me too.

                       RAINEY
          For what?

Chris doesn't answer. A kid rides by on a bright new Big
Wheel. Must be from the rich side of the commune.

                       RAINEY (CONT'D)
          Do your folks know where you are?
                       CHRIS
          No.

                       RAINEY
          Don't you think they ought to?

                       CHRIS
          They should. But I can't. Not yet,
          anyway. I got a sister though, Carine.
          She's the most beautiful girl in the
          world. But, it's all got to stay behind
          me until I get where I'm going.

                       RAINEY
          Alaska?

                Yeah, Rainey. Alaska.

      Rainey won't intrude any further. He just nods. Chris
      notices Tracy in the door of her parent's rig, stealthily       *
      waving him over. Chris gives Rainey the "Uh-oh" look,

      has disappeared inside.

                             CHRIS (CONT'D)
                New Year's resolution?

      Rainey gives him a wink and puts his arm around Tracy as        *
      Chris jumps into the car. Then he and Jan hit the road.

168   EXT. MARKET POST OFFICE, SALTON CITY - DAY                168

      This market/liquor store/post office serves as the
      cultural nexus for the greater Salton Sea area.

      As Jan's van pulls up opposite the post office and makes
      a U-turn to curbside, Chris gets out of the van. Now
      Jan's eyes really well up.

                             JAN
                       (sweetly)
                Just get your pack out of the back and
                get out of here. I can't take a hug.

      Chris says nothing. He just looks at Jan. They
      understand each other. Chris closes the door. He
      fiddles with the broken handle of the back door, gets it
      open, gets his pack out. On top of his pack, A WRAPPED
      XMAS GIFT and when he closes the back door, Jan heads
      straight off back to the Slabs. Chris opens the
      giftwrap; it's the new hat Jan had promised. Chris is
      touched.

169   EXT. TWO-LANED ROAD, ANNANDALE, VA (PAST) - DAY           169

      TELEPHOTO LENS: A long two-laned road before us rises and
      falls in a series of saddles and peaks. The narrow
      shoulders are densely wooded. SLOWLY APPEARING over the
      near most peak, a TEAM OF EIGHT SHIRTLESS HIGH SCHOOL
      RUNNERS. Leading the group - 17 YEAR-OLD CHRISTOPHER
      MCCANDLESS. Lean, softly handsome, and graceful.

                             CARINE (V.O.)
                In high school, Chris became captain of
                the cross-country track team. They
                called themselves the Road Warriors.

      REVERSE ANGLE: The group of young runners, led by Chris
      suddenly veer off the paved road into the adjoining
      woods.


170   EXT. TRAILS, ANNANDALE (PAST) - DAY                       170

      SERIES OF ANGLES: The runners, led by Chris, pace
      unchartered trails, grassy hillsides, and shallow
      streams.
                             CARINE
                He'd take them on what he loved to refer
                to as "epic" runs. The whole point was
                to run until they were completely lost
                and so exhausted that they were on the
                verge of puking. Then they'd slow down a
                little, somehow he'd find their bearings,
                and lead them home again at full speed.
                This was my brothers idea of fun.

      We FAVOR Chris as he jogs in place at the exhilarating
      point of being lost. When he has identified a most
      likely return route, he quickens his pace, leading the
      group in the direction of return.

171   INT. MARKET/POST OFFICE, SALTON CITY                      171

      Chris heads out with his last Burger King check in hand,
      proudly wearing his new hat and in search of mountains to
      climb.

                             CARINE (V.O.)
                A year and a half into Chris'
                disappearance, each day that goes by now
                feels like two. Dad calls it "suspended
                animation." I kept telling myself that
                he had to get lost to prove his
                independence to himself. But this was no
                day run for the Road Warriors and after
                so much time, I could no longer keep out
                the haunting thoughts.


172   EXT. MARKET/POST OFFICE, SALTON CITY - DAY                172

      Chris, with pack and new hat walks away from camera
      toward the interstate and the brittle mountains beyond.

                             CARINE (V.O.)
                In many ways, my life and even my parents
                had begun to move in new directions. I'd
                fallen in love. And mom and dad had even
                ventured out on a brief vacation. But,
                when a search of tax records uncovered
                Chris' contribution to OXFAM, the weight
                of his disappearance just seemed to lie
                down on us full length.

      pools lined with rocks and shaded by palm trees. A small

      We ZOOM past them to the sheer rock faces and landforms
      of the badlands, several miles beyond.

      Chris rests on the sand under a tarp, hung from a
      Creosote branch. A plate of beans and rice eaten nearly
      clean and an empty water jug beside him. Flies buzz and
      pick.

      carrying an empty water jug. A quick wave to one of his
      distant "neighbors" at the spring's camp as he runs by.

177   EXT. PAVED TWO-LANE ROAD INTO SALTON CITY - DAY           177

      Chris continues his jog, cars whisk by and dust kicks
      into the air. But Chris is undeterred, keeps running.


178   EXT. MARKET/POST OFFICE, SALTON CITY - SAME               178

      Chris approaches, slowing his jog to a walk. Chris sets
      down his water jug and stretches his calves. In the
      distance we see the peaks of the badlands landforms from
      where he ran.

                                                             100.



      Chris shakes off the jog, picks up the jug, and we go
      with him around the side of the building. There's a
      water faucet dripping slowly into the desert mud. Chris
      pops his jug under it and fills it up.

                                                        CUT TO:


179   INT. MARKET/POST OFFICE - SAME                           179

      Chris walks the aisles, sipping from his jug, as he comes
      across bags of rice on the market shelves. A HEAVY SET
      GIRL passes him in the aisle with her well-mannered dog
      following her.

                             CHRIS
                       (no high-pitched pet voice)
                Hey boy. You are a handsome fellow.
                       (over shoulder to the girl)
                Beautiful dog.

                               THE GIRL
                Thank you.

      As the girl continues on, the dog wants to stay with
      Chris.

                               CHRIS
                Go on, boy.    Go on.

      And the dog obeys him.

      As he sorts through the various rice selections, brown,
      white, wild, we notice a MAN peering over the opposite
      shelf at Chris. This is RON FRANZ, between 70 and 80
      years old, six-feet, thick arms, barrel chest, and large
      ears. He wears old jeans, an immaculate white T-shirt, a
      decorative tooled leather belt, white socks, and scuffed
      black loafers. His deeply pitted nose demonstrates a
      purple filigree of veins which unfold like an finely
      wrought tattoo. And on either side of it, the wary blue
      eyes of a soldier. He is the archetypical American man.
      Chris has caught his sympathetic eye. Chris moves to the
      counter to pay for rice.

      In WIDE SHOT, we watch Chris from behind, walking out
      across the two-lane road. He puts out his thumb to hitch
      a ride.

      When a truck comes from BEHIND INTO FRAME heading
      straight for Chris, the truck makes a relaxed L-turn,
      pulling up beside Chris.

                Out past Oh-My-God Hot Springs.

                I've lived in and around here six years
                now and I've never heard of any place
                that goes by that name.

      Ron leans across the bench seat of the truck, opening up
      the passenger door.

                             RON (CONT'D)
                Show me how to get there.

      Chris hops in beside Ron, who extends his hand -

                               RON (CONT'D)
                Ron Franz.

                               CHRIS
                Alex.

                               RON

                West Virginia.
                             RON
                Okay, Alex from West Virginia. I like a
                fellow who doesn't raise the pitch of his
                voice when he talks to animals...shows he
                doesn't condescend.

      Chris remembers now the dog in the store and why Ron
      must've thought to give him a ride.

      And they head off.

                             CHRIS
                You go left here.

      Ron turns the truck down the 4x4 track.

      We watch the truck bump and grind on the mangled dirt
      road about a mile in.

      Out the window, Ron's eye has been caught by something.

      Ron's POV: Oh-My-God Hot Springs -

      We see a couple of day-glo vans and rusted out
      Studebakers that hadn't been turned over since Eisenhower
      was in the White House. Several of those living there
      mill about buck naked. And at the center of the camp,
      the steaming pools lined with rocks under the palm trees.

                             RON
                You live here?

                Another half-mile or so, out on the
                Bajada.

185   EXT. CHRIS' CAMP BESIDE THE STONE WALL - SAME             185
      Ron and Chris drive up in the truck. Ron shuts off the
      ignition and gets out of the truck to stretch his legs.
      Chris follows, puts his full water jug under the tarp at
      his campsite, hooking it onto a branch. He throws his
      shoulder bag with the rice in it into his backpack.

                             RON
                Well, this is somethin' out here. Don't
                you worry about those dope smokers and
                nudists down below there?

                             CHRIS
                No, they keep to themselves pretty much
                and so do I.

            RON
      (skeptical)
Hmmm. You strike me as a bright young
man. Am I wrong about that?

             CHRIS
I think I got my head on my shoulders
pretty good.

             RON
That's what I mean.    How long have you
been out here?

             CHRIS
Couple of weeks.

             RON
And before that?

A lot of places. I've been moving
around.

How old are you?

             CHRIS
Twenty-three.

             RON
Twenty-three years old! Son, don't you
think you should be getting an education?
And a job? And making something of this
life?
             CHRIS
Look Mr. Franz. I think careers are a
twentieth century invention and I don't
want one. You don't need to worry about
me. I have a college education. I'm not
destitute. I'm living like this by
choice.

               RON
In the dirt?

             CHRIS
       (laughs)
Yeah, in the dirt.

          Don't have one anymore.

                       RON
          That's a shame.

Chris can see some deep sadness in this man.

                       CHRIS
          Hey, Mr. Franz. I want to show you
          something.

Ron follows Chris to the rockface we'd seen Chris running
earlier. They begin to walk up it. It's tough on the
old-timer, walking this steep hill. But he's a tough old-
timer, at least for the moment...

ANGLE: The two men nearly half way to the summit.     It's
getting steeper and higher. Ron stops.

                       RON
          This is getting a little steep.     And a
          little high for me kid.

                       CHRIS
          Alright.   But look out there. Even from
          half way out, it's quite a sight isn't
          it?

Their POV: Enormous beautiful vista all the way across
the Bajada.

                       CHRIS (CONT'D)
          From the top you can see all the way to
          the Salton Sea too.
Ron looks up the precarious rock wall.   He ain't gonna be
seeing the Salton Sea today.

                       RON
          You can see the Salton Sea from up there?

                       CHRIS
          Yes, sir.

                        RON
                 (starting his way down the
                  hill)
          My goodness.

                       CHRIS
          You don't want to go up?

                                                                 105.



                                RON
                  Nope.   I don't do these kind of things.

      Chris smiles and follows Ron.       As they approach the
      bottom of the hill -

                               RON (CONT'D)
                  How about you and me take a drive? About
                  fifty miles or so up highway, I know a
                  place that's got a view, great food, and
                  requires no climbing. How's that sound?

      Chris thinks about it.     Then -

                               CHRIS
                  Yeah, sure. It'll take me a couple of
                  minutes to clean up.

      summit. It's high. Scary HIGH.

      MUSIC OVER: As Chris and Ron ride the tram to the peak,
      we watch Chris watching Ron, his kind, moist old eyes,
      slowly blinking at the wonder of the nature around him.
      Other passengers on the tram seem nervous, but Ron is
      meditative, almost hypnotized.

                                                                106.


      And with each roll-through of the tram through the cable
      towers, the tram car rocks and sways, but Ron's peace
      goes unbroken. And Chris continues to admire the gentle
      blinking of his eyes.

      The two of them sit in a quiet, corner   booth of the
      tramway eatery that sits on the summit   of San Jacinto
      overlooking the lights of Palm Springs   and the desert
      clear back to Salton Sea. Chris is on    a roll.

                Seventy-nine years old.

                             CHRIS
                Seventy-nine...see, all due respect, but
                the real difference between people is the
                quality of their soul and not on how long
                they've trudged around like a dip-shit.

      Ron laughs.

                             CHRIS (CONT'D)
                But it's true.

                              RON
                It is.   No question about that.

      Ron continues to let Chris vent.

                The government's the same as my parents.
                They don't respect anybody. Regulation.
                Regulation. Regulation. WE can't do
                this. But THEY can do that. I mean, the
                hypocrisy of the whole...culture.   Makes
                me crazy. My father was having children                *
                with two women at the same time, and then              *
                has the gall to think that he can be of
                some guidance to me? Make judgments on
                me? My mother, of course, goes along
                with all of it. Keeps the secret, which
                of course, makes my whole life a fiction.
                Everything I thought was, wasn't.
                They're such fools! Fucking idiots!

                Alex, please don't lump me in amongst

                prefer to not hear that kind of language.

                             CHRIS
                       (realizing his slip)
                Sorry. I don't usually use that kind of
                language either. I just get so angry
                thinking about it.

      Ron reaches across the table.    Puts his sturdy hand on
      Chris' shoulder.

                             RON

                Awww, that was a great time Mr. Franz.

                cooked meal tomorrow night. If I come
                out here about, say, four o'clock
                tomorrow, how would that be?

                             CHRIS
                That would be swell.

      Ron is thrilled.

                       CHRIS
          I'll take a guava juice, that sounds
          good.

Chris. They lift their glasses toward one another, then -

          Cheers.

                       RON
          I spent most of my life in the army. On
          New Year's Eve 1957, I was stationed over
          in Okinawa. My wife and son were here in
          the States, just driving down the road
          when a fellow who'd had too much to drink
          plowed right into them. Killed them
          both. Anyway, you might think that the
          last thing in the world I'd do, is go to
          the whiskey, but at the time, it felt
          like the only thing I could do. And I
          did it hard. But pretty soon, I figured
          I wasn't doing my wife and son any good,
          mourning them with a bottle. So, I
          pulled myself together and quit drinking,
          cold turkey. And then...

Ron, spinning his body around, points to the photographs
over the sink.

                       RON (CONT'D)

          Yeah, that's...

                  finger)
          Fuki, Kenjiro, Yoshiko, Keiko, Masaro,
          Junichi, Kimpei, Nayoko...

For the last picture frame, Ron stands and takes it off
the shelf -

          school.

sits back down.

                It did my heart some good but I guess
                really it was just writing a few letters
                and sending some money. Anyway, it was
                important to me. I get a letter from
                each of them from time to time. You
                know. So, since all that, this is pretty
                much me.

205   EXT. CHRIS' CAMP BESIDE THE STONE WALL - DAY           205

      AN ISOLATED CLOUD ECLIPSES THE SUN AGAINST A BLUE DESERT
      SKY.

      Ron is sitting on his tailgate, watching Chris, backpack
      on, climb the stone wall.

                             RON
                Alaska?

      Chris summits.

                             RON (CONT'D)
                Son, what the hell you running from?

                             CHRIS
                       (yells down from above)
                I could ask you the same question.
                Except I already know the answer.

                             RON
                You do, do you?

                             CHRIS
                I do, Mr. Franz. You've got to get back
                out in the world. Get out of that lonely
                house of yours, that little workshop,
                and go live on the road.

      Ron waves him off.

                             CHRIS (CONT'D)
                Really. You're going to live a long
                time, Ron. You should make a radical
                change in your lifestyle. The core of
                man's spirit comes with new experiences.
                And there you are, stubborn old man,
                sitting on your butt.

                             RON
                Sittin' on my butt, huh?

      Ron gets up off the tailgate.

                             RON (CONT'D)
                I'll show you sittin' on my butt.

      And Ron starts making the old man hustle. Shifty
      shoulders and all, up the stone wall.

                                                     115.



                       RON (CONT'D)
                 (mumbling)
          "Stubborn old man."

Chris is laughing and clapping.

                       CHRIS
          Come on, old man! Come on!

                       RON
                 (mumbling)
          Ya little pinhead.

Chris is jumping up and down, thrilled for Ron's efforts.
Now the old man's shuffle has turned into an old man's
walk. But he ain't stopping. And bit by bit he shows
he's got it in him after all.

As Ron is just about to mount the summit, Chris extends a
hand. Ron swats it away.

                       RON (CONT'D)
          Ya little pinhead.

Ron drops down onto his back to catch his breath and let
his thumping heart slow down.

                         CHRIS
          You alright?

Ron, after taking one more deep breath, sits up and Chris
sits next to him. He's actually pretty happy with
himself. He looks out and sees the distant Salton Sea.

                       RON
          I'm going to miss you when you go.
                       CHRIS
          I'll miss you too, Ron. But you're wrong
          if you think the joy of life comes
          principally from human relationships.
          God's placed it all around us. It's in
          everything. In anything we can
          experience. People just have to change
          the way they think about those things.
          You ought to put a little camper on the
          back of your pick-up and go take a look
          at some of the great work god's done out
          here in the American west.

                       RON
          Alex...You're probably right.   And I'm
          going to take stock of that.

                                                             116.



      Chris offers a skeptical glance.

                              RON (CONT'D)
                No, I am.

      A second skeptical glance.   Which Ron squashes with
      genuine sincerity.

                              RON (CONT'D)
                        (almost to himself)
                I am.

      Chris buys it this time and feels he's accomplished
      something with Ron.

                             RON (CONT'D)
                But I'll tell you something. The bits
                and pieces I've put together, you know,
                what you've told me about your family.
                Your mother and dad. And I know you got
                your problems with the church too, but
                there's some kind of bigger thing that we
                can all appreciate. And it sounds like
                you don't mind calling it God. But when
                you forgive, you love. And when you
                love...God's light shines on you.

      Miraculously, it is just at that moment that the cloud
      clears from the sun and the light shines in Ron's eyes.
      Chris points at Ron's face at the light shining on him -

                              CHRIS
                Holy Shit!

                             RON
                I told you about that language.
      The two men, their eyes welling up, fall back laughing.

      EXTREME WIDE SHOT FROM BELOW: The two men on the summit
      with the echoing of laughter and Ron's screams -

                             RON (CONT'D)
                I told you so! I told you so!

                                                         CUT TO:


206   INT. LAUNDRY ROOM, RON'S HOUSE - NIGHT (MARCH 11, 1992) 206

      Chris pulls his laundry out of the dryer. He's got his
      pack sitting in the doorway to the kitchen. He folds his
      things and tucks them into his pack.

                                                         117.



Ron appears in the doorway dressed for travel.

                       CHRIS
          What are you doing up?     It's three-thirty
          in the morning.

                       RON
          Heard you get up off the couch half an
          hour ago, and had a funny feeling you
          might not be here for our breakfast.

Chris says nothing.

                       RON (CONT'D)
          I'm going to drive you a hundred miles to
          somewhere where you can pick up a train,
          a plane, or hitch a ride without getting
          stuck on this desert. I'd take you all
          the way to Alaska if I didn't have to get
          to an eight o'clock mass.

                       CHRIS
          Ron, you don't have to do that.

                       RON
          I want to do it.     Get you started on this
          thing of yours.

                       CHRIS
          On my Great -

                       RON
                 (interrupting)
          I know. On your "Great Alaskan
          Adventure."
From just out of Chris' eye-line, Ron leans out of frame,
picking up a zippered duffel bag. He opens it,
displaying the contents to Chris.

                       RON (CONT'D)
          There's a machete, an arctic parka,
          collapsible fishing pole, and a few odds
          and ends I threw in there for you.

                       CHRIS
          Ron...

                       RON
          Oh, just take it.

Chris does, nodding his thanks.

                                                            118.



                             RON (CONT'D)
                I'll wait for you in the truck.

                                                          CUT TO:


207   EXT. HIGHWAY 10, OUTSIDE SALTON CITY - DAWN                207

      We follow the two men (on this nondescript locale)
      driving along the highway east from dawn through sunrise.
      They ride in silence through Coachchella Desert Center
      and Blythe.

                                                          CUT TO:


208   EXT. HIGHWAY 10                                            208

      The truck exits at a North/South junction 95.


209   INT. RON'S TRUCK                                           209

      As Ron begins to pull over.

                             RON
                Well my friend.

                             CHRIS
                Yep.

      Both of them are uncomfortable. Chris goes for the door
      handle. Ron's gnarled hand reaches out to take Chris'
      elbow.
      After a long beat, Ron speaks without looking at Chris.
                             RON
                I had an idea. You know my mother was an
                only child. So was my father. And I was
                their only child. Now, with my own boy
                gone, I'm the end of the line. When I'm
                gone, my family will be finished. What
                do you say, you let me adopt you. I
                could be, say, your grandfather.

      This takes Chris by surprise.   He knew it would be hard
      but not this hard.

                             CHRIS
                How about we talk about this when I get
                back from Alaska, Ron. Would that be
                alright?

                                                               119.



      Silence.   Ron nods.   Releases Chris' elbow.

                              CHRIS (CONT'D)
                 Alright, Ron. We'll talk about it then.

                               RON
                         (trying to mask. The
                          blinking, moist eyes again)
                 Yep.   We can do that, yep.

                                CHRIS
                 Thanks, Ron.

      Ron nods. Chris gets out of the truck. Ron watches as
      Chris saddles up his bag including the duffel that Ron
      gave him.

      Chris crosses the exit junction to where he can pick up a
      ride north on the far side of the road.

      We ZOOM SLOWLY through the windshield into Ron's face as
      he watches Chris hitching away.

      We HEAR the first bars of Neil Young's My My, Hey Hey.
      This will carry throughout the following MONTAGE.

                                                        DISSOLVE TO:


210   INT./EXT. VARIOUS - MONTAGE                                 210

      1. We ZOOM into Walt McCandless' face as he looks through
      the Questar telescope that Chris had given him. ANGLE:
      The stars through the telescope. The same stars his son
      walks under...somewhere. We PAN ACROSS SPACE.
      (Note: This montage will intercut Chris' traveling POV
      with objective shots. However, we never SEE Chris.)

      2. We PULL BACK from the starry night sky to see it
      framed from within a moving train.

      3. Carine in her shower, water cascades over her face.

      4. Billie in her kitchen, making dinner.

      5. Through the windshield of a semi-truck, the sun rises
      on Glacier National Park.

      6. A HANDHELD ZOOM-OUT from Canadian border crossing,
      CAMERA TURNS to the woods beyond and MOVES INTO THEM.

                                                        120.

9. Ron holding a garage sale, while hooking a trailer to
his truck.

10. Wayne being released from jail.

11. Mads and Sonja, side by side, one-armed bandit-ing in
a Vegas casino.

12. Tracy at a high school dance, slow-dancing with her        *
young date.

13. Looking through the windshield of another semi. A
bear lopes across the two-lane road before us. We PAN
and ZOOM with it into the tundra beside the road.
HANDHELD, WALKING, we pass Mile 0 of the Alaska highway:
The sign: Fairbanks 1523 miles.

18. Melting blue ice-walls.
19. A lynx skittering across a snowy mound.
20. Walt and his telescope.

21. The hitchhiker's VIEW on a two-lane road, walking
past a highway sign for the Yukon Territory. (Through
Johnson's Crossing, Whitehorse, and Beaver Creek.)

211   INT. MCCANDLESS HOME, ANNANDALE - DAY                     211

                             CARINE (V.O.)
                About a month short of the second
                anniversary of Chris' disappearance, I
                had gotten engaged to my boyfriend Jerry
                Ray and was moving in with him...

      Carine, packing her belongings into boxes, stumbles upon
      the Sharon Olds book Chris had given her on his
      graduation day.

                             CARINE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                ...when I stumbled upon the book Chris
                had given me on his graduation day. For
                some reason, it was the last line of the
                poem he read that really stuck out.

      FLASH BACK: (From page 2-3)


212   INT. DATSUN                                               212

      Chris is holding a book from which he reads aloud the
      LAST LINE OF THE POEM...

                             CHRIS
                ...and I will tell about it.

                             CARINE (V.O.)
                I asked Chris who had written the poem.

      What we SEE of Carine plays with the VOICE OVER TRACK and
      SILENT with the production track; in essence lip synching
      herself.
      Chris' dialogue comes directly from the flashback image.

                             CARINE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                Who wrote that?

                             CHRIS
                Well, it could've been either one of us.
                Couldn't it?

      We see pictures of Chris on the night-stand of Walt and
      Billie's bedroom

                             CARINE (V.O.)
                What would he tell about now?   What did
                his voice sound like now?
                             (MORE)

                                                             122.

                             CARINE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                I realized that the words to my thoughts
                were of less and less meaning. Chris was
                writing his story and it had to be Chris
                who would tell it.

      The pictures in the scene BLUR as -

                             CHRIS (O.C.)
                       (in a far away, tunnel-like
                        sound)

      Billie sitting bolt upright in the middle of the night,
      tears rolling down her cheeks.

      Walt awakens beside her.

                              WALT
                What is it?

                             BILLIE
                I wasn't dreaming! I didn't imagine it!
                I heard his voice, Walt. I heard Chris.

      Walt takes her in his arms, trying to squeeze life into
      both of them.

215   EXT. ALASKAN RANGE (STAMPEDE TRAIL) - DAY                  215

      We return to the area of Scene #1.
      MUSIC OVER: Of religious scope.    Perhaps choral.
      HELICOPTER SHOT: We travel a long ways across snowy
      peaks and valleys (clearly far from anywhere) passing
      between two escarpments of outer range bordering
      bottomlands five miles wide until we barely see a tiny
      form within it trudging through the snow. We overfly it.

                                                           CUT TO:


216   EXT. STAMPEDE TRAIL - DAY                                  216

      Chris, crunching through two to three feet (not more) of
      snow, in arctic parka, big boots, his warm hat, rifle
      slung over his shoulder, and pack.

                                                              124.



      He moves TOWARD CAMERA. We PAN AROUND with him as he
      walks past, where beyond Chris on the snow plain, rises a
      tree line.

217   EXT. TEKLANIKA RIVER - DAY                                217

      Its banks lined with a jagged shelf of frozen overflow.
      At its center, a channel of gently flowing water, opaque
      with glacial till. Beyond the far ice shelf, Chris
      appears from the riverside treeline. He eases across the
      ice, then wades through the latte-colored channel and on
      to the other side.

      REVERSE ANGLE: Chris moving toward the opposite tree
      line, he turns back to the gentle river behind. Chris'
      POV scanning the terrain.

      From the river to a distant mountain peak and then to a
      second mountain peak, triangulating his location. He
      makes a drawing on a pad of paper and piles some medium-
      sized rocks to mark the spot before moving on into the
      trees.

221   EXT. UPRIVER - DAY                                        221

      As Chris walks upon a clearing in the tree line, he
      catches his first glimpse of Denali's (Mt. McKinley's)
      high-blinding white bulwarks. Chris stands in awe. We
      remain in his WIDE-SHOT POV as it -

      But now Chris' tent sits in its foreground with the
      moonlit Denali still visible.

      CAMERA ANGLED SKYWARD into the broken rays of grey light.
      We TILT DOWN to find (and TRACK through the trees with)
      Chris moving along the river, when he sees something just
      OFF CAMERA.

      Chris' POV: Through the trees and fireweed, he sees
      something metallic and rusty. Chris moves up through the
      underbrush and the snow into the narrow tree line and on
      into the clearing, where before him:

      A DERELICT SCHOOL BUS. It is a vintage International
      Harvester from the 1940's.

      Chris approaches the bus, lifts the hood a little bit
      seeing that the engine is gone. As he moves around the
      vehicle, we see several windows are cracked or missing
      altogether. The green and white paint is badly oxidized.
      Weathered lettering: Fairbanks City Transit System Bus

223   INT. BUS                                                  223

      Broken whiskey bottles litter the floor. Chris may well
      have found his new home. The bus is outfitted with a
      bunk and a barrel stove. Previous visitors had left it
      stocked with matches, bug dope, and other essentials.


224   EXT. BUS                                                  224

      We follow Chris back out of the bus, surveying the area
      of the clearing. He loves what he sees.

                                                               126.



      CELEBRATORY MUSIC OVER:

      He runs up a berm to look down into the river.

      He runs from corner to corner of this "Magic Bus" area
      like a new bride surveying her honeymoon suite with glee.

      He climbs a tree, swings from its branch, doing a flip in
      the air, landing on his feet, but then slipping on the
      snow and onto his butt and then onto his back. He grabs
      a handful of snow, shoves it in his mouth, melts it into
      water, and swallows it.

      CRANE SHOT:   We PULL UP from Chris to high above the
      clearing.

      MUSIC FADES OUT

      He re-enters the bus and pulls his pen from his pocket,
      scribbling on the wall of the bus:


                TWO YEARS HE WALKS THE EARTH. NO PHONE,
                NO POOL, NO PETS, NO CIGARETTES, ULTIMATE
                FREEDOM. AN EXTREMIST. AND AESTHETIC
                VOYAGER WHOSE HOME IS...

      ANGLE: Chris:   He continues to write as he SPEAKS the
      words aloud:
                             CHRIS
                ...the road. Escaped from Atlanta. Thou
                shalt not return `cause the "west is the
                best." And now after two rambling years,
                comes the final and greatest adventure.

      Chris is cleaning up the bus.

                             CHRIS (CONT'D)
                The climactic battle to kill the false
                being within and victoriously conclude
                the spiritual revolution.

                              CHRIS (CONT'D)
                 Ten days and nights of freight trains and
                 hitchhiking, bringing him to the great
                 white north.

      Back to Chris, REAL TIME as he continues to write as he
      speaks:

                              CHRIS (CONT'D)
                 No longer to be poisoned by civilization,
                 he flees, and walks alone upon the land
                 to become lost in the wild.

      Chris signs his doctrine -

      Chris posts a found piece of paper on the inner wall of
      the bus alongside his doctrine.

      SERIES OF ANGLES:

      Chris searching for game. He moves through the woods
      along the river and at the base of a nearby mountain.
      Finding animals for food seems more difficult than
      expected.

      Chris, cooking rice. We see his single bag of rice.     Its
      amount tells us the hunting had better improve soon.

      We explore a PASSAGE OF TIME throughout which CHRIS GETS
      INCREASINGLY THIN AND PALE: hunting, sleeping, cooking,
      rice dwindling, line-ups of scrawny shot birds. He adds
      holes to his belt leather to accommodate his shrinking
      waistline.

      with concern, perhaps only a day or so left of his

      entries as the squirrel is mentioned on day seven.

      looks ready to charge Chris. There's no choice.

      Chris aims carefully and fires six straight shots into
      the moose's head, dropping it. Chris can hardly believe
      his own success. He puts the rifle back on his shoulder,
      just staring at the dead moose. He begins back-pedalling
      away from it. Bit by bit, his steps turn into a jog and
      then he turns and runs back toward the bus.

      In the trees beside the river, we find Chris. The river
      is not yet in sight but Chris starts to HEAR it: A
      building rumble.

      As Chris exits the treeline, there she is: The Teklanika
      at full flood. Seventy-five foot wide banks, replacing
      the narrow ice canal of four months earlier. Snowmelt
      from glaciers high in the Alaska range, its opaque
      glacial sediment the color of wet concrete. And what had
      been a distant rumble in the woods, now had the volume
      and power of a freight train, a seventy-five foot wide
      one.

      Chris grabs a hold of a riverside branch and takes one
      slow, careful step into the river. Without mercy, WHAM!
      the river kicks his feet out from under him! The branch
      he holds SNAPS! By some miracle, his hands move like
      lightening and he grabs a lower, sturdier branch below,
      saving himself from a certain death.

                                                             135.



      We SEE the broken branch catapulted down river and into a
      rocky shoot below. He pulls himself back onto the bank,
      drops his pack at riverside, and eases to a sitting
      position beside it.

      Pasternak's Doctor Zhivago.

                Here she stopped and, closing her eyes,
                took a deep breath of the flower-scented
                air of the broad expanse around her. It
                was dearer to her than her kin, better
                than a lover, wiser than a book.

                For a moment, she re-discovered the

                enchantment and call each thing by its
                right name.

      He puts down the book and brings one of the ripe berries
      in front of his face (as close as shot of when he picked
      it.)

      Chris then grabs Tanaina Plantlore, the flora and fauna
      book he had gotten from the library in Fairbanks. And it
      takes him out of the bus like a divining rod. His nose
      in the book, he follows it.

      drift over to Chris' face, his lips de-hydrated, and skin
      parched. He breathes heavily. He awakens. He tries to
      sit up. It's a terrible struggle. Barely makes it to
      his feet.

      Chris stumbles to the door of the bus, looking up at the
      hot sun. He has to sit back down on the small bus steps.
      From his position on the step, he leans back into the bus
      and is able to grab his water jug. He pours it into his
      mouth but nothing seems to satiate or hydrate him. He
      drinks it all. It spills over his face and chest.

      We observe Chris for a moment as the wheels turn inside
      his haunted eyes. And a curiosity seems to overtake him.
      He crawls back to his copy of Tanaina Plantlore, flipping
      the pages one by one until he arrives at the photograph
      identifying the wild potato root and the word "edible"
      beside it. He reads the page to its conclusion and as
      almost an afterthought, turns the page to see if there
      might be more.

      The word -
      POISON

      jumps off the page at him.

      The book describes the tiny green seeds of the potato
      root and warns that those with:
      lateral veins, such as those invisible on the leaflets of
      wild sweet peas are poisonous.

      The words -
      ...leading to partial motor paralysis...

      ...inhibition of digestion...

      ...nausea, starvation...
      ECU:   ...STARVATION

      CRASH ZOOM into Chris' face, realizing his desperate
      plight.

      Chris labors up the riverbank with his water jug full.
      He is shirtless and absolutely emaciated. Frightening.
      He pauses at the river's edge to take air into his lungs.
      It's all he can do just to breath.

      WIDE ANGLE TABLEAU (CONTINUOUS): Chris standing at the

       Now, maintaining this tableau, something moves from near
       CAMERA RIGHT into frame. Bit by bit we'll realize it's a
       LARGE BEAR ENTERING FRAME and moving away from camera
       toward Chris. It lumbers to within feet of him.

       BECOME TRAPPED IN THE WILD - NO GAME IN SIGHT.

       A SUBTLE DRUM (HEART)BEAT BEGINS OVER:

       Chris plops himself down into the middle of the bus. He
       shakes his head as if trying to say something, and then
       considers his rifle and abundant ammunition. But taking
       his own life to avoid the agony of starvation is not an
       option for him. "No, no, no, don't do this to me." The
       frustration builds enough adrenaline in him to scream
       out.

                                                       141.



He does, but with a low, gurgled animal sound. He shakes
it off and looks to his copy of Doctor Zhivago for
distraction. Thumbing through the pages he focuses his
eyes on the page -

ANGLE: The page: what he reads:

                       CHRIS (V.0)(O.C.)
          And that an unshared happiness is not
          happiness...

Chris steals his pencil from within the pages of the
book, scribbling across the page:

                       CHRIS (V.O.)(O.C.)
                       (CONT'D)
          HAPPINESS ONLY REAL WHEN SHARED.

He flips backwards a couple of pages to where he had
written the quote:

                       CHRIS (V.O.)(O.C.)
                       (CONT'D)
          CALL EVERYTHING BY ITS RIGHT NAME.

He tears the back cover off the book and scratching the
pencil across its blank side, writing these words
quickly, as if in panic:

I HAVE HAD A HAPPY LIFE AND THANK THE LORD.    GOODBYE AND
MAY GOD BLESS ALL!

And now, these words arrive slowly as we HEAR Chris
repeating:
                       CHRIS (O.C.) (CONT'D)
                 (with a weak voice)
          Call everything by its right name.

The drumbeat increases as he signs the note:

CHRISTOPHER JOHNSON MCCANDLESS.

We move from the page back up to Chris. We see that he
has put on his eyeglasses to strengthen the vision of his
weakening sight. He removes them, folds them, and lays
them by his side. His body begins to tremble. His eyes
dance wildly.

The drumming intensifies.

Chris takes one last look out the window. The sun is
covered by a well-defined and puffy cloud.

                                                           142.


      His arm nearing spasm reaches up to the bunk, grasping at
      the blue sleeping bag made by his mother.

      With great suffering and shattering trembles, he forces
      his body to defy its agony and pushes it into the
      sleeping bag.

      SKYWARD, the cloud obscuring the sun.

      Drumbeats ESCALATE - BOOM! BOOM! BOOM! BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!
      We TIGHTEN on Chris' anguished face.
      (Director's note: These CU's on Chris' face, combine
      both static and hand-held CUs, upside down and right-side
      up moving, zooms, and push-ins. Straight, side, and
      dutch angles. Perhaps some intermittent distortion.)


268   INT./EXT. BUS                                             268
                                                                      *

      We INTERCUT between Chris and the sky in a dance
      transitioning to the next world. It is hopeful,
      anguished, sad, and elated.

                                                              143.




269   INT./EXT. ANNANDALE HOUSE - DAY                           269

      Chris, approaching the Annandale house.    His backpack on
      and body healthy.

      Billie parts the curtains, ecstatic to see Chris
      approach, alive and healthy.

      We SEE but do not hear her call to Walt.

      A smiling Chris steps up the curb, approaching home.

      Walt and Billie - we PUSH INTO them as they gleefully run
      out the front door to their returning son.

      PUSH INTO Chris - he dispatches his backpack to the
      ground and runs toward his parents' embrace.

                              CHRIS (V.O.)
                 What if you saw me running into your
                 arms...


      Chris, Walt, and Billie on the cusp of a jubilant and
      loving embrace!

                              CHRIS (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                 Would you see then...

      The DRUMMING resumes with a BLAST OF BASS and before an
      embrace is possible...
                              CHRIS (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                 ...what I see now?
                                                 A SUDDEN CUT TO:


270   INT. BUS                                                  270

      TOTAL SILENCE

      Chris looking at the sky, a cathartic tear falls from his
      left eye. Another from his right as the obscuring cloud
      clears the sun.

                                                             144.



Chris: The LAST, AIRY EXPULSION OF HIS BREATH.

His open face as the clearing light of the sun shines in
his eyes. It is a face of peace, love, a face of true,
deep serenity.

The eyes joyously open and the corners of his mouth ease
into the subtle smile of euphoric wisdom.

That's the way he settles to stillness, looking directly
into our camera.

                                        And he died alive.
He made it.   He lived.   He loved.

Cat Stevens' Miles from Nowhere plays OVER:

As we PULL AWAY from Chris' face through the bus window
and up into the sky -

We drift further and further away, above the stunted
trees and the shimmering roof of the bus like a tiny
white gleam in a wild green sea grows smaller and
smaller.

REPRISE IMAGE of truck driver taking picture of Chris in
scene #1.

Then it's him:

The smiling STILL IMAGE we saw taken in the first scene
from behind, but now we are seeing it from the front and
it is the image of the real Christopher McCandless on the
edge of the Stampede Trail. As it takes over the screen,
we ZOOM SLOWLY into his smiling face. And then, these
words appear superimposed over it:
Dedicated to the memory of Christopher Johnson McCandless
February 12, 1968 - August 18th, 1992

As those words dissolve, these words appear:
On September 19, 1992, Carine McCandless flew with her
brother's ashes from Alaska home to the eastern seaboard.
She carried them with her on the plane...in her backpack.

               FADE IN:

               EXT. THE PORT OF GENOA, ITALY - NIGHT

               Forklifts RUMBLE. Workers WIPE FRAME. All the bustle and 
               cacophony of a major seaport.

               We FIND ourselves focusing on ONE LARGE CRATE. With the 
               GRINDING of gears, a crane lifts it off the dock and carries 
               it onto a ship.

               INT. HOTEL ROOM - SAME TIME

               Through night-vision binoculars, CHARLIE CROKER, 28, watches 
               the mysterious crate. Charlie is young to run his own crew 
               but he's a born leader.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Lyle?

               SWISH PAN TO: LYLE, 21, brilliant and punctilious, fingering 
               the keyboard of his strap-on supercharged laptop.

                         I've got the orbital data and SV 
                         clock corrections for each satellite 
                         that gets the signal. That'll make 
                         my reading as solid as the Precise 
                         Positioning Service that only the

                         vertical accuracy, .340 nanoseconds 
                         time accuracy.

               SWISH PAN TO: STEVE, 30, bearded. Steve has an arrogant 
               confidence mixed with the hint of a smile.

                         Why can't he talk like a person?

                         ...Because he's not.

                                     LYLE
                         I do need one more thing, Charlie.

                                     CHARLIE
                         What's that?

                                     LYLE
                         Someone to turn the goddamn homing 
                         device on. No signal, no score.

               The final member of the crew, JOHN BRIDGER, 50s, is a tasteful 
               man buying a very tasteful, and very expensive, diamond 
               necklace. The saleswoman wraps it up as he dials a number on 
               his cell phone.

                                     STELLA (V.O.)
                         Hello?

                                     JOHN BRIDGER
                         Hi, sweetie.

               INT. STELLA'S CONDO - PHILADELPHIA - INTERCUT

               STELLA BRIDGER, 27, crushingly attractive, has just stepped 
               out of the shower, hair still wet, body wrapped in a towel.

                                     STELLA
                         Daddy. How are you?

                                     JOHN BRIDGER
                         I'm sending you something.

                                     STELLA
                         Really? Does it smell nice?

                                     JOHN BRIDGER
                         No. But it's sparkly.

                                     STELLA
                         Does it come with a receipt?

                                     JOHN BRIDGER
                         I'm having it sent to you from the 
                         store.

                                     STELLA
                              (toweling her hair)
                         Why not bring it by yourself? We 
                         could have dinner.

               He leaves the store and heads for the HOTEL ELEVATOR.

                                     JOHN BRIDGER
                         Be a long trip. I'm in Genoa.

               She doesn't like the sound of that.

                                     STELLA
                         Let me guess. Checking out the 
                         birthplace of Christopher Columbus.

                                     JOHN BRIDGER
                         Something like that.

                                     STELLA
                         With your parole officer's approval.

               He steps into the elevator. Rides up.

                                     JOHN BRIDGER
                         I think I've paid my P.O. my last 
                         visit. I liked the guy, but we never 
                         really connected.

                                     STELLA
                         What are you into, Dad? Don't break 
                         my heart. You told me you were 
                         through.

                                     JOHN BRIDGER
                         After this, I swear to you, I am.

                                     STELLA
                         You promised me. Daddy, don't do 
                         this.

               The elevator door opens, Bridger steps out and starts down 
               the hall.

                                     JOHN BRIDGER
                         Everything's going to be fine. I've 
                         got to go now. I love you. Bye.

               He clicks off then uses his card key to step into the --

               INT. HOTEL ROOM - CONTINUOUS

               He eyes Charlie, who looks pretty tense.

                                     JOHN BRIDGER
                         Italians?

                                     CHARLIE
                         Not yet.

                                     STEVE
                         Don't worry, they'll come through. 
                         You can trust these guys.

                                     JOHN BRIDGER
                         I trust everyone. It's the devil 
                         inside them that I don't trust.
                              (then, to Charlie)
                         Got a sec?

                                     CHARLIE
                         My office.

               INT. HOTEL BATHROOM - NIGHT

               They step inside, Charlie closing the door.

                                     JOHN BRIDGER
                         How you feeling, boss?

                                     CHARLIE
                         Fine. I'm fine, fine.

               Bridger seems amused by that answer.

                                     JOHN BRIDGER
                         You know what fine, stands for, don't 
                         you? Fucked-up, Insecure, Neurotic, 
                         and Emotional.

                                     CHARLIE
                         You've become quite the philosopher 
                         since you quit drinking.

                                     JOHN BRIDGER
                         You don't like me sober?

                                     CHARLIE
                         No, I'm glad. Makes you a better 
                         thief.

               Bridger pulls out a fine cigar, still in its wrapper, hands 
               it to Charlie.

                                     JOHN BRIDGER
                         For after the haul.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Hope I get to fire it up. If Steve's 
                         Italians are a no-show, it's three 
                         months prep down the shitter and 
                         I've dragged you out of retirement 
                         for nothing.

                                     JOHN BRIDGER
                         This is kinda nice. You being the 
                         boss with all the worries, me just 
                         along for the ride.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Ain't you sweet...

               From the other side of the door, they HEAR --

                                     STEVE (O.S.)
                         Charlie!

               INT. HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

               Charlie takes the binoculars from Steve. He SEES TWO ITALIAN 
               CUSTOMS INSPECTORS climbing onboard the ship.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Your Italians.

                                     STEVE
                         Yup. Dixie cups.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Dixie cups?

                                     STEVE
                         I toss 'em away if there's a problem 
                         down the road.

               EXT. SHIP - NIGHT

               In ITALIAN, the Inspectors quiz the NERVOUS CAPTAIN about 
               the mysterious crate.

               One Inspector takes a crowbar and yanks out several strips 
               of plywood, REVEALING unmarked cardboard boxes inside. The 
               other Inspector pulls out one of the boxes and tears it open.

               It is filled with tomatoes. He takes a bite out of one.

               Nods. Everything seems to be order. The Captain looks 
               relieved. The inspector closes the cardboard box but...

               Watch carefully now, because as he does this, he hits a power 
               button on a small HOMING DEVICE and stuffs it in with the 
               tomatoes...

               INT. HOTEL ROOM - SAME TIME

               On Lyle's computer screen, a pulsating dot appears, BEEPING, 
               sending out precise longitude and latitude.

                                     LYLE
                         For those about to rock, we salute 
                         you.

               Charlie dials his cell phone.

               INT. HUMVEE (MOVING) - INTERCUT

               Handsome Rob answers.

                                     HANDSOME ROB
                         Yeah.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Let's get rich.

               Handsome Rob pulls over. They're at the port. They can see 
               the mysterious crate being lowered into the ship's hold.

               Half-Ear climbs out, taking a large duffel bag with him.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. SHIP (DOCKED) - LATER, NIGHT

               The Captain is doing his final checks before launch. OUR 
               CAMERA DROPS to --

               BENEATH THE WATER

               where we FIND Half-Ear, in scuba gear, applying Nitramon 
               explosive primer to the hull of the ship.

               INT. HUMVEE (MOVING) - NIGHT

               Plowing through thick brush that breaks out onto a secluded 
               beach. Handsome Rob is still behind the wheel but now Steve 
               is in the passenger seat. Lyle, in the back, is still on the 
               laptop, legs fidgeting like a drummer on meth. POP goes his 
               bubble gum.

                                     HANDSOME ROB
                         Can you chill out back there? You'd 
                         make a hummingbird nervous.

               EXT. UNDERNEATH THE SHIP - NIGHT

               Half-Ear finishes up. Speaks into the headset inside his 
               gear.

                                     HALF-EAR
                         I'm done. Over.

                                     LYLE (V.O.)
                         Copy that. Enjoy the ride, cowboy.

               Half-Ear grabs onto the bottom rung of a ladder that is bolted 
               to the side of the ship as it launches off the dock and into 
               deeper water.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               TWO BRIGHT CIRCLES IN A SEA OF DARKNESS

               Coming closer... becoming clearer... It's Charlie and John 
               Bridger, in scuba gear, riding torpedo-shaped Dive Propulsion 
               Vehicles (DPVs) that pull them through the deep blue sea at 
               a good 5 m.p.h. Both DPVs drag equipment bags.

               A Global Satellite Positioning Device is mounted on the 
               handlebar of Charlie's DPV, being fed information via Lyle's 
               laptop. A circle pulsates on the monitor, a beacon to the 
               crate in the ship.

               EXT. UNDER THE BOAT - NIGHT

               Half-Ear still clings to the ladder. It's a wild ride.

               Through the headset inside his gear, he HEARS:

                                     LYLE (V.O.)
                         Get ready. 3. 2. 1. Drop.

               Half-Ear lets go of the ladder. The ship's propellers speed 
               by just above his head. WHOOSH.

               He removes a radio-controlled detonator. Hits the button.

               EXT. SHIP - ON THE CUT

               The hull of the boat EXPLODES.

               INT. SHIP'S HOLD

               A very neat hole on the bottom of the boat beneath the crate 
               is opened. Water RUSHES IN and the crate falls right through 
               the cavity, vanishing.

               UNDERWATER

               The huge, heavy crate drops down... down... hits the bottom.

               ON THE SHIP

               Chaos rules. She's taking on water fast. No way to save her. 
               The captain orders the dinghy lowered into the water.

               INT. HUMVEE - NIGHT

               Parked in the sand at the top of the bay. Steve looks out to 
               the bay through infrared binoculars.

               The ship is going down. The crew on the dingy head back to 
               the port, which is in the opposite direction of this beach.

               EXT. THE BOTTOM OF THE SEA - NIGHT

               The DPVs are now attached by a tether to an underwater lifting 
               bag that is used to move heavy loads through water.

               The crate is surrounded by our three diver-bandits.

               Using crowbars they pull apart the plywood. The cardboard 
               boxes of tomatoes dump out, tomatoes spilling everywhere.

               And now we see what was hidden between the boxes...

               A large safe.

               They move like clock-work. Half-Ear aims an underwater light 
               at the dial. Charlie drills a small hole near the dial.

               John peers inside a horoscope and lines up the three wheels 
               of the combination lock... until the door pops open.

               As they stare at what's inside, they speak into their 
               headsets, heard by all.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Sweet Jesus.

                                     JOHN BRIDGER
                         "That for which all virtue is sold. 
                         And almost every vice -- gold."

               And now we see the contents of the safe: 160 glistening GOLD 
               BRICKS. Made in Singapore, they weigh 25 pounds and each one 
               is decorated with the face of an exotic Balinese girl. We're 
               talking thirty million dollars worth of gold.

               INT. HUMVEE (PARKED) - NIGHT

               They holler and high-five and it's just a great moment to be 
               alive. Steve takes another peek through his infrared 
               binoculars and sees --

               The last vestiges of the ship hang above the waterline, then 
               disappear.

               EXT. UNDERWATER - A LITTLE LATER

               The gold is now stacked and secured on the lifting bag.

               They attach an underwater parachute to the bag and hook a 
               hose from an air tank into press of a pressure release valves 
               which cause the parachute to INFLATE.

               Looking like a hot-air balloon underwater, the whole thing 
               floats up about fifteen feet. Half-Ear holds onto its side, 
               going along for the ride.

               Then Charlie and John Bridger speed off on the DPVs which 
               are tethered to the inflatable bag. As they glide through 
               the water towards the secluded beach, we...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. MOUNTAINOUS ROAD - FIRST LIGHT OF DAWN

               The Humvee climbs into the mountain ranges of the Alps.

               INT. HUMVEE (MOVING)

               The gold is in three crates in the cargo bay.

               Handsome Rob and Steve are still up front. The others are in 
               the back seats, the divers out of their scuba gear. They are 
               pouring champagne into paper cups; except for Bridger who 
               abstains. He holds up his empty cup.

                                     JOHN BRIDGER
                         My name is John and I'm a very rich 
                         alcoholic. And I'm going to live my 
                         life one very rich day at a time.

                                     THE CREW
                         Alright, John!

               They laugh and pound their fists against the roof of the 
               Humvee. Charlie pulls out the cigar Bridger gave him. As 
               Bridger lights it for him --

                                     JOHN BRIDGER
                         You planned this one down to a t, 
                         kid. It's a gift. You saw the big 
                         picture, made contingencies, covered 
                         the angles...

               Hearing this, Steve looks a little jealous.

                                     JOHN BRIDGER
                         Shit, you made thirty million dollars 
                         in gold drop out of sight without 
                         holding a gun. Who else could've 
                         pulled that off?

                                     CHARLIE
                         You could've. I had big shoes to 
                         fill.

                                     JOHN BRIDGER
                         Fill the shoes but don't follow the 
                         footprints.

                                     CHARLIE
                         What're you talking about? You've 
                         lived the life.

                                     JOHN BRIDGER
                         My life's been nothing but fake IDs, 
                         fake business cards and divorce 
                         papers. This is the only thing that's 
                         real.

               Bridger shows him a photograph of Stella that he keeps in 
               his wallet.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Stella's a beautiful girl.

                                     JOHN BRIDGER
                         She's amazing. And I spent half her 
                         childhood in prison. This is a once 
                         in a lifetime haul, Charlie. Bring 
                         down the curtain after this one. 
                         Make a new life. Find someone amazing 
                         and be there for her.

               As the advice escapes Bridger's mouth --

               EXT. MOUNTAINOUS ROAD

               A Jeep thunders out of a hiding place in the trees and blocks 
               the road. The Humvee brakes to avoid running into it.

                                     HANDSOME ROB
                         Shit.

               Click. That's the sound of a gun cocking as it's pressed 
               against Handsome Rob's temple.

                                     STEVE
                         Anyone acts stupid and his brains go 
                         on the windshield.

               They see the two Italian Inspectors jump out of the Jeep, AK-
               47s leveled at the crew. Steve has double-crossed them.

               ON THE CREW: shocked would be a good place to start.

                                     CHARLIE
                         What the hell do you think you're 
                         doing?

                                     STEVE
                         Sorry Charlie. But I want the box of 
                         Cracker Jack all to myself.

               The Italians pull the crates of gold out of the back of the 
               Humvee.

                                     CHARLIE
                         You're not thinking this through. 
                         It's a stupid move.

                                     STEVE
                         Think so? Well you're the brilliant 
                         one. The Master Planner. Isn't that 
                         so, John?

               Steve climbs out of the Humvee, gun still on Handsome Rob, 
               the AK-47s aimed at the others.

                                     STEVE
                         You bet on the wrong horse.

                                     JOHN BRIDGER
                         We'll hunt you down. You're gonna 
                         regret this.

               EXT. HUMVEE

               Safely outside, Steve turns his gun on Bridger.

                                     STEVE
                         No regrets, Dixie cup.

               BOOM. He shoots Bridger in the head. Just like that.

               The Italians follow suit, AK-47s SCREAMING out bursts of 
               full automatic fire at the crew.

               INT. HUMVEE

               They duck for cover as the vehicle is riddled with gunfire.

               Glass shatters. Bullets ricochet. They're in the epicenter 
               of hell.

               Handsome Rob jerks the steering wheel and stomps the gas.

               Driving blind.

               EXT. MOUNTAINOUS ROAD

               The Humvee hits the side of the Jeep, grinds alongside it, 
               metal tearing against metal.

               The Humvee's right side tires precariously hover by the cliff 
               and the raging water below.

               The gunners keep FIRING. Bullets rip into the Humvee's tires.

               EXT. HUMVEE

               It almost escapes, but it can't make it on shredded rubber.

               It careens off the road and --

               SERIES OF SHOTS

               The Humvee plummets through the air and plunges into the 
               raging river.

               INT. HUMVEE

               Water cascades in through the open windows. They're thrown 
               around as the Humvee rides the rapids. WHAM. The passenger 
               door caves in as the Humvee rams into a large rock then is 
               swept further downstream. Through the foam and spray, Charlie 
               looks over to Bridger. He's dead. The torrent ROARS.

               Only their chests and heads are above water. And that's not 
               all. There's a WATERFALL AHEAD.

               EXT. WATERFALL

               The Humvee is palmed in its deadly embrace and hurled over.

               It cartwheels into the pool below, sending up a huge geyser 
               of water.

               It sinks out of sight.

               EXT. MOUNTAINOUS ROAD - SAME TIME

               The crates of gold are now inside the Italians' Jeep. Steve 
               climbs in, leaving the crew for dead.

               UNDERWATER - SAME TIME

               The Humvee strikes the surface bottom with an ominous thud.

               EXT. MOUNTAINOUS ROAD - DAWN

               The Jeep jerks to a stop. A door opens and the bodies of the 
               two Italians, shot dead, are dumped out into the mud.

               Steve is alone now. Just him and the millions in gold.

               INT. HUMVEE - SAME TIME

               The water entombs them. Blood from Bridger's fatal gunshot 
               mists the water red.

               They manage to get the door open. They start to swim out but 
               Charlie won't go without Bridger. He grabs his friend's body 
               and pulls it up with him.

               EXT. RIVER - SUNRISE

               They drag themselves ashore, Handsome Rob helping Charlie 
               pull Bridger's corpse. Charlie is shocked, tormented, grieved, 
               and angry beyond description. Against the rocky embankment, 
               he holds Bridger. Not wanting to ever let go.

                                     CHARLIE (V.O.)
                         If you would have told me that I 
                         would spend the next three years 
                         searching for Steve Bandell, I would 
                         have said that was nothing. Cause I 
                         would have spent a lifetime looking 
                         for that bastard if I had to.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               INT. OFFICE - DAY

               SOMEONE'S POV. A top of the line safe. The only light in the 
               office is the beam of a penlight on the dial.

               GLOVED HANDS spin the dial, feeling for "contact points", 
               areas on the dial where a slight resistance can be felt -- 
               if you have the touch.

               NEW ANGLE. A woman holds the penlight in her teeth while 
               trying to crack the safe. It's Stella Bridger, now 30.

               SUPERIMPOSE:

                              Three Years Later Philadelphia

               She manipulates the dial. Click. She grabs the safe's lever 
               and swings the heavy steel door open, her face a mixture of 
               pride and relief. But before we see what's inside -- LIGHTS 
               TURN ON.

               TWO COPS lurk at the doorway.

                                     FIRST COP
                         You always work in the dark?

                                     STELLA
                         Buzz of the fluorescents throws me 
                         off. She's all yours.

               The cops come closer and only now do we realize that they're 
               on the same team.

                                     SECOND COP
                         Damn. Chris Perley couldn't crack 
                         it. Neither could Michael Hoyt.

                                     STELLA
                         Now you know who to call first.

                                     FIRST COP
                         You're expensive, Stella. Those guys 
                         cut us a break on subpoena jobs. 
                         Goodwill, community service...

                                     STELLA
                         Well I do it for the money. I'll 
                         send you the bill.

                                     SECOND COP
                         Don't you want to see what's inside?

                                     STELLA
                         I never look. Bye, guys.

               And as she walks off, they do look -- at her.

               EXT. STREET - DAY

               A car RISES INTO FRAME on a bustling street: a 1960 Mini 
               Cooper S., a worldwide motoring icon. Its shape crouches low 
               to the ground and its tiny 10-inch wheel-at-each-corner gives 
               it the legendary Mini look.

               If when you see its headlights and classic grille it doesn't 
               bring a smile to your face, then you've got no automobile 
               soul.

               INT. MINI (CRUISING) - DAY

               Stella takes on the road like someone who loves to be behind 
               the wheel of a car that claimed victory in the Monte Carlo 
               Rally three times. She passes a minivan, a breeze with the 
               Mini's quick, go-kart-like handling.

               She searches for a parking space on a street lined with SUVs.

               Sees a spot, it's not really a space, just a gap between two 
               gas guzzlers, there's no way any car could squeeze in.

               Brake. Shift. Hard turn. She parallel parks the Mini with 
               ease. She's right in front of --

               HER SHOP

               Antique keys and locks dominate the storefront window with 
               the name of the shop stenciled across the glass: BRIDGER 
               LOCK AND SAFE COMPANY. Stella hops out of the Mini. With a 
               poised walk she heads inside.

               INT. SHOP - DAY

               It is filled with old cast-iron safes she has rebuilt along 
               with some new models. Stella's RECEPTIONIST greets her.

                                     RECEPTIONIST
                         How long?

                                     STELLA
                         Four minutes, forty-three seconds.

               High-five.

                                     RECEPTIONIST
                         You're the man.

                                     STELLA
                         So what's on the line-up?

                                     RECEPTIONIST
                         2:00. Home safe in Fairmount Park. 
                         Owner died and the wife never knew 
                         the combination. And Todd Milliken 
                         called. He has a prototype combination 
                         lock he wants you to test out tomorrow 
                         morning. Says he added two false 
                         contact points on the tumbler.

                                     STELLA
                         Tell him if I don't have it opened 
                         in six minutes flat, breakfast is on 
                         me.

                                     RECEPTIONIST
                         And there's a Charlie Croker in your 
                         office. He said you two know each 
                         other.
                              (an aside)
                         And he looks pretty fine for a white 
                         boy.

               Without a response, Stella heads over to --

               HER OPEN OFFICE DOOR

               and sees him fiddling with her collection of safe doors that 
               line the shelves.

                                     STELLA
                         Charlie Croker.

               He turns around. Smiles. Charming.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Hi, Stella.

               She steps inside.

                                     STELLA
                         Refresh my memory. After you came to 
                         see me and told me what happened to 
                         my father, I told you I never wanted 
                         to see you again, didn't I?

                                     CHARLIE
                         Yeah. You did.

                                     STELLA
                         So I'm a little confused.

                                     CHARLIE
                         I found him.

               At first it seems that Charlie's words have no effect on 
               her, but then he notices that her hands are trembling.

                                     CHARLIE
                         I can tell you where he is.

                                     STELLA
                         I don't want to know.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Are you sure?

               She doesn't answer.

                                     CHARLIE
                         He's in Los Angeles.

               She doesn't respond. Doesn't ask him to go on, doesn't ask 
               him not to. So he goes on...

                                     CHARLIE
                         The gold bricks he stole from us 
                         were minted in Singapore and decorated 
                         with the face of a Balinese girl. 
                         I've had my tentacles out and got a 
                         call from a friend of mine and your 
                         father's, Philly Steak.

               Stella remembers him.

                                     STELLA
                         When I was little he would play poker 
                         at the house and drop quarters under 
                         the table for me to find.

                                     CHARLIE
                         He got word from an L.A. connection 
                         named Skinny Pete that a gold dealer 
                         has been buying bricks with the 
                         Balinese girl on them, three or four 
                         at a time.

                                     STELLA
                         You ever heard the expression, cut 
                         to the chase?

                                     CHARLIE
                         I tracked Steve down to an address 
                         in the Hollywood Hills. He's changed 
                         his last name to Frezelli. And get 
                         this: he had a Worthington 1000 
                         installed in the house before he 
                         even moved in. We both know that you 
                         don't install a Worthington 1000 
                         unless you have something precious 
                         to guard.

                                     STELLA
                         Precious or not, I don't deal with 
                         ill-gotten goods.

                                     CHARLIE
                         We boosted that gold from a terrorist 
                         group that was about to trade it for 
                         bio-weapons. Now that doesn't exactly 
                         make us Robin Hood, but maybe in our 
                         own little way we were doing a good 
                         deed. Problem is, no one in my crew 
                         can handle that safe. And I need 
                         someone I can trust.

                                     STELLA
                         And you think that's me? Haven't you 
                         heard that I work for the other side?

                                     CHARLIE
                         What I heard is that you have your 
                         father's touch. And he was the only 
                         safecracker I knew who could open a 
                         Worthington 1000.

                                     STELLA
                         I'm not a safecracker. I'm a 
                         professional safe and vault 
                         technician.

                                     CHARLIE
                         You're John Bridger's daughter. And 
                         this is our chance to set things 
                         right.

               That sets her off.

                                     STELLA
                         Our chance? Who do you think you are 
                         coming in here? Stealing the gold 
                         isn't going to bring my father back 
                         to life.

                                     CHARLIE
                         No, it won't.

                                     STELLA
                         Then get out.

               EXT. STREET  DAY

               Charlie comes out of her shop and starts down the sidewalk.

               Suddenly, Handsome Rob appears out of the crowd and is walking 
               next to him.

                                     HANDSOME ROB
                         How'd it go with the chick?

                                     CHARLIE
                         I'm working on it.

                                     HANDSOME ROB
                         I don't want her on the crew, Charlie.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Gotta have her. Important piece of 
                         the puzzle.

                                     HANDSOME ROB
                         There has to be someone else. What 
                         about Bill Huchins?

                                     CHARLIE
                         Doing ten long at Levinworth.

                                     HANDSOME ROB
                         Red O'Reilly?

                                     CHARLIE
                         Chemo.

                                     HANDSOME ROB
                         Martin Hernandez?

                                     CHARLIE
                         Found Jesus.

               Handsome Rob stops Charlie.

                                     HANDSOME ROB
                         I don't want a civilian to screw 
                         this up.

                                     CHARLIE
                         She has the skill. And the motivation.

                                     HANDSOME ROB
                         Exactly. She's emotional. You know 
                         what happens when emotion gets into 
                         it.

                                     CHARLIE
                         It's emotional for all of us at this 
                         point. Don't kid yourself.

               INT. EXPENSIVE RESTAURANT/BAR - NIGHT

               RICHARD WORTH has his back to the bar. He's a blue blood 
               trial lawyer with an ego that has more horsepower than a 
               Ferrari.

                                     RICHARD
                         It's all in my patented sideways 
                         glance. Like this...

               He gives a sideways glance to Stella; it's their first date.

                                     RICHARD
                         I hit each woman on the jury with 
                         one of these. We make contact. And I 
                         know exactly what they're doing. 
                         Undressing me with their eyes.

                                     STELLA
                         I see...

               What a nightmare. Someone bumps into Stella, a mumbled, 
               "Excuse me." Nightmare continues...

                                     RICHARD
                         The case is all but won. That's why 
                         in jury selection I choose as many 
                         women as possible. Except lesbians, 
                         of course. I can tell in sixty seconds 
                         if they're a lesbian. Want to know 
                         how I know?

                                     STELLA
                         If they don't undress you with their 
                         eyes?

                                     RICHARD
                         Precisely. Like that waitress right 
                         there. See? She's looking at me right 
                         below my belt. Definitely not a 
                         lesbian.

               A waitress is indeed looking below Richard's belt. But Stella 
               notices that she was only looking because Richard's zipper 
               is all the way down. She smiles.

                                     STELLA
                         Your fly.

                                     RICHARD
                         I am fly. And I'm da bomb. Just wait 
                         until later tonight.

               Suddenly a BUSBOY stumbles and a tray of drinks fall, soaking 
               Richard's suit in red wine.

                                     BUSBOY
                         Oh, man. I'm sorry.

                                     RICHARD
                         You should be. Moron. What the hell's 
                         wrong with you?

                                     BUSBOY
                         It was an accident. I'm very sorry.

                                     RICHARD
                         Where's the manager? Richard Worth 
                         is not paying to have his suit 
                         cleaned. Damn.
                              (to Stella)
                         I'm going to... I don't believe this.

               He starts off to the bathroom and as soon as the space he 
               was occupying empties, Charlie fills it.

                                     CHARLIE
                         I think your date's going pretty 
                         well, what do you think?

               She shoots him a look that could reverse global warming.

                                     STELLA
                         What are you doing here?

                                     CHARLIE
                         What do you mean? I come here all 
                         the time.

                                     STELLA
                         I don't think so.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Sure. Lawyers, Judges, my kind of 
                         crowd. See that gentleman there, he 
                         sentenced me to 90 days in county 
                         once. We need to talk.

                                     STELLA
                         No, you need to listen. I want you 
                         to leave. Got it?

                                     CHARLIE
                         Hey, I paid valet parking prices to 
                         get in here, not to mention a twenty 
                         spot to the busboy to spill that 
                         drink on Mister Zipper.

                                     STELLA
                         You -- I don't believe this. You 
                         paid someone to spill that drink?

                                     CHARLIE
                         Actually, you paid for it.

               Charlie returns her wallet.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Didn't notice it was me who bumped 
                         into you earlier, did you? Anyway, I 
                         was hoping we could get to know each 
                         other a little better before we leave 
                         for Los Angeles. I already booked 
                         your flight.

                                     STELLA
                         You truly are a fatuous, odious man.

                                     CHARLIE
                         I have no idea what you just said, 
                         but I like the sound of it.

                                     STELLA
                         Well maybe you'll understand this. 
                         Hit the road, Jack --

                                     CHARLIE
                         Charlie --

                                     STELLA
                         Or you'll be sorry, Charlie, cause 
                         I'll kick you in the nuts so hard 
                         that your voice will be as high as 
                         my heels.

               She means it, too.

                                     CHARLIE
                         I'm beginning to worry about this 
                         whole relationship.

                                     STELLA
                         I'll let you in on a secret. You 
                         can't have a relationship with a 
                         pickpocket, gold robber, or any kind 
                         of thief.

               Charlie looks away, lets her have her point. This whole thing 
               is getting pretty heated so when he turns back to her, he 
               uses a whole new approach. His emotions are genuine.

                                     CHARLIE
                         John wasn't just a man I crewed up 
                         with, he was my friend, he was the 
                         closest thing to a father I ever 
                         had. I wish to God I could bring him 
                         back. But all I can do is go after 
                         this guy, the guy that killed him, 
                         and hit him where he lives.

               She feels the honesty in his words but before she can reply, 
               they're interrupted by --

                                     RICHARD
                         Everything alright, Stella?

               He's back, red wine splotched on his suit.

                                     STELLA
                         Fine. Richard. Charlie. Charlie was 
                         just saying goodbye.

               But for now, Charlie is just staring at Richard, boring into 
               to him...

                                     RICHARD
                         Can I help you with something?

                                     CHARLIE
                         Oh, sorry. I was just undressing you 
                         with my eyes.

               And with that, Charlie goes. Stella can't help but smile.

               EXT. STELLA'S CONDO - NIGHT

               She comes home, having shed her date.

               INT. STELLA'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

               She goes through a drawer and pulls out a package she hasn't 
               looked at for years. She opens it.

               Inside is the beautiful necklace that her father bought her 
               in Italy. It brings tears to her eyes.

               INT. CHARLIE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

               He lies in bed, can't sleep. His phone rings. He picks up.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Hello.

               INT. STELLA'S BEDROOM - INTERCUT

               She's on the other end of the line.

                                     STELLA
                         I'm in this for one thing, Charlie, 
                         and one thing only. I want to see 
                         the look on his face when his gold 
                         is gone. He took my father from me, 
                         I'm taking this; it's the best I can 
                         do.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. STREETS - DAY

               Stella's Mini passes, weaves, tucks in between cars. She 
               drives like a madman.

               INT. MINI (SPEEDING)

               Charlie feels like he's inside a video game.

                                     CHARLIE
                         I see Drive Defensively is your motto.

                                     STELLA
                         Don't worry. Jack Daniels never let 
                         me down.

               She slaps the dashboard of her car.

                                     CHARLIE
                         By the way you drive, I'm not 
                         surprised you named your car after a 
                         bottle of whiskey. Left.

                                     STELLA
                         Jack Daniels was chief engineer of 
                         the Mini. And I drive it exactly the 
                         way it was meant to be driven.

               She whips down the avenue.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Another left.

               She hangs a left.

                                     STELLA
                         We're going in circles. Who's tailing 
                         you this week?

                                     CHARLIE
                         The possibilities are endless.

               EXT. STADIUM PARKING LOT - DAY

               The Mini parks in the middle of the huge, empty lot that 
               surrounds Veterans Field, home of the Philadelphia Phillies.

               INT. MINI

                         We're a little early. I didn't expect 
                         us to get here quite that fast. 
                         There...

               A Vespa pulls into the lot, headed their way. It's Lyle.

               Charlie starts the introductions.

                                     CHARLIE
                         That's Lyle. Gearhead. He's who really 
                         invented Napster...

               Below a Metallica poster, Lyle has fallen asleep on his desk.

               His roommate, Napster creator SHAWN FANNING, recognizable in 
               his trademark baseball cap, sneaks a peek at Lyle's computer.

                         At least that's how Lyle tells it.

               A 10 year old boy stands in front of a toilet in the stall.

               BOOM! Water geysers out of the bowl and soaks him.

               Some kids in the bathroom saw the whole thing.

               And now a RUMBLING in the distance. Stella looks. Sees a car 
               streaking their way, almost like a mirage in the heat waves 
               coming off the pavement. Closer. Faster. A classic Mustang. 
               Its engine rumbles like a jackhammer. It's had some serious 
               custom work done to it.

               Handsome Rob's behind the wheel, flicks a cigarette butt out 
               his open window --

               We watch it hit the pavement, ashes spark, and then behind 
               the fallen butt we see that every lane of the 405 is filled 
               with cop cars in pursuit.

               SEVEN YEAR OLD CHARLIE is shoved against a chain link fence

                         Cough it up, Charlie!

               Charlie hands the bully a dollar bill. The bully puts it in 
               a wallet that is over-stuffed with cash and saunters off, 
               laughing it up with his bully pals. Charlie turns to his 2nd 
               grade classmate who sports a fresh black eye.

               Lyle and Half-Ear have been kept in the dark until now.

               They disperse in separate vehicles. See Charlie at Avis, 
               renting a car.

               See Handsome Rob renting a U-Haul panel truck.

               See Stella on a hotel shuttle bus.

               See Half-Ear on the underground Metro Rail, taking the Red 
               Line.

               See Lyle in a taxi, headed south on Figueroa Street. He 
               notices a YOUNG WOMAN HITCHHIKING. For a moment, their eyes 
               connect. She is a beautiful waif and the feeling sweeps 
               through Lyle: if only... But the taxi passes by.

               Charlie checks into Shutters, with its Victorian beach house 
               feel and oceanfront view.

               Stella's at the Peninsula in Beverly Hills with its opulent 
               lobby.

               Handsome Rob's at the Standard, with its kitschy decor and 
               ironic style. He stares at a huge empty aquarium behind the 
               front desk where a performance artist writhes and a DJ spins 
               out rhythmic throbs. Very L.A.

               Half-Ear's at the new Renaissance Hollywood Hotel adjacent 
               to the dramatic Babylon Gate and the Kodak Theatre.

               And Lyle's at the Downtown Bonaventure, riding up the glass 
               elevator. Perfect gearhead hotel.

                         pounding in your ears. Perspiration 
                         on your fingertips. It's a whole

               Half-Ear peers through binoculars and says his notes into a 
               micro-cassette recorder. His binoculars focus in on the fence

                         Shit. Dogs. Why do black men hate 
                         dogs? I'll tell you why, Charlie. 
                         Because dogs are racist. That's a 
                         natural fact. Someone else deal with 
                         'em.

               EXT. 101 FREEWAY - DAY

               A sea of cars, gridlock in L.A. Crammed in the middle of the 
               traffic meltdown is Handsome Rob's rental car.

               INT. RENTAL CAR (CRAWLING)

               Timing out the getaway route. He's got a Thomas Guide on the 
               passenger seat and a stopwatch ticking away but he's going 
               nowhere fast. He futilely leans on the car horn.

               INT. U-HAUL - DAY

               Lyle's surveillance shift. He takes digital photos with a 
               telephoto camera. ZOOMS IN on a security pad on the front 
               door.

                                     LYLE
                              (into micro cassette 
                              player)
                         Advent Home Navigator Hybrid System. 
                         Monitors 132 points for intrusion, 
                         fire, and environmental hazards. 
                         Best way around it is to get a back 
                         door password, trip the alarm during 
                         the heist, then call it in as a false 
                         alarm.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. STEVE'S HOUSE - OFFICE - DAY

               A HAND turns the dial to a Worthington 1000 vault. The vault 
               opens and voila: stacks and stacks of gold bricks.

               EXT. STEVE'S HOUSE -DAY

               The same hand clutches a very heavy duffle bag. OUR VIEW 
               BOOMS UP to see Steve, three years older than when we last 
               saw him, his beard shaved away.

               INT. U-HAUL - SAME TIME

               Through his digital camera lens, Lyle watches Steve walk 
               towards his car: a Ferrari 550 Barchetta Pininfarina. It's 
               the first time he's seen Steve in three years.

                                     LYLE
                              (into micro cassette 
                              recorder)
                         15:25. There he is. He's gained 15 
                         to 20 pounds living off our money. 
                         And Handsome Rob, you're going to be 
                         pissed when you see his wheels.

               Lyle watches the security guard hit a switch in the guard 
               booth. The gate rises like the blade of a guillotine in 
               reverse. The Ferrari zooms away.

               EXT. FIGUEROA STREET - DAY

               Another route. Handsome Rob's rental car is in the left turn 
               lane waiting for the light to change.

               INT. RENTAL CAR

               The light finally is a green arrow but the lady in front of 
               Handsome Rob is so preoccupied with applying her make-up 
               that she doesn't go until he honks but by then it's too late 
               as she makes it through the light but he doesn't.

               He checks his stopwatch. Simmers.

               EXT. PENINSULA HOTEL - POOLS SIDE - DAY

               In a bikini, Stella lies on a lounge chair under a cabana, 
               reading a copy of Vogue magazine.

               But as we take a closer look, we see that she's really reading 
               the owner's manual for the Worthington 1000 safe which she's 
               inserted in the fold of Vogue.

               INT. U-HAUL - DAY

               Charlie's shift. He sees a Latina housekeeper get into her 
               car.

                                     CHARLIE
                              (into micro cassette 
                              recorder)
                         Housekeeper leaves at 17:30.

               EXT. COIN & BULLION STORE - EVENING

               Steve bangs a fist against the steel security door that covers 
               the closed store. The steel door rises up and a Ukrainian 
               named YEVHEN unlocks another door. He is the gold dealer 
               that Philly Steak told Charlie about.

                                     YEVHEN
                         You're right on time.

               INT. COIN & BULLION STORE - EVENING

               Yevhen is 50 and like many in the gold trade, there isn't a 
               conspiracy theory that he doesn't embrace. As they make their 
               way to a back room, he keeps his mouth in overdrive --

                                     YEVHEN
                         All those poor bastards out there 
                         putting their life savings in banks 
                         and S&Ls and mutual funds. What do 
                         they think -- that when the collapse 
                         comes they can depend on the 
                         government? I don't think so.

               Steve motions to a security camera that looms down on them.

                                     STEVE
                         Is the camera off?

                                     YEVHEN
                         Of course. Just like you said. I 
                         never tape you, you can see for 
                         yourself.

               Steve sees the red light is off. He lays the duffel bag on a 
               table, unzips it, pulls out three 25 pound gold bricks with 
               the face of a Balinese Girl stamped on each one. As Yevhen 
               inspects them --

                                     YEVHEN
                         Governments are nothing more than 
                         puppets on the strings of the 
                         Trilateral Commission with their 
                         twisted gods.

               Yevhen retrieves a briefcase, opens it, presenting Steve 
               with stacks of Ben Franklins: $100,000 worth. As Steve 
               inspects the cash --

                                     YEVHEN
                         I mean, it's so obvious that in a 
                         world where NAFTA can overturn the 
                         Supreme Court, not to mention 
                         Microsoft's nefarious financial 
                         machinations, this, is our only 
                         refuge; gold.

               Steve closes the briefcase.

                                     YEVHEN
                         Plus a little walking around money.

               EXT. 7TH STREET - NIGHT

               A fender bender in the middle of an intersection has traffic 
               backed up for miles.

               INT. RENTAL CAR

               Handsome Rob checks the latest time on the stopwatch.

               INT. U-HAUL - NIGHT

               Through night-vision binoculars Charlie sees a (different) 
               security guard open the gate as Steve returns.

               He watches Steve go inside his house. Through the windows, 
               he sees him use a remote to turn on a TV.

               EXT. 101 FREEWAY - THE NEXT DAY

               A freeway sign says: UNION STATION 1/2 MILE

               INT. RENTAL CAR

               HANDSOME ROB can see the exit up ahead, but traffic is so 
               backed up and going nowhere that it feels like it's a hundred 
               miles away. And it's not even rush hour. Just life in L.A.

               Idling on the freeway, he looks at the drivers in the cars 
               beside him. He sees a businesswoman reading the Wall Street 
               Journal. Sees a man with his finger deep, deep up his nose.

                                     HANDSOME ROB
                         Where's a grenade launcher when you 
                         need one?

               EXT. YAMASHIRO RESTAURANT - DAY

               Our crew walks along the pathways of Japanese gardens that 
               wind along outside the restaurant. It's a breathtaking view 
               from high in the Hollywood Hills. Some tourists take in the 
               vista.

                                     HANDSOME ROB
                         Doesn't matter what time it is. It's 
                         either bad traffic, peak traffic, or 
                         slit-your-wrists traffic.

                         I'm sure it's ideal for carrying a 
                         ton of gold, genius.

                         If we had all green lights, fourteen 
                         minutes. But in the twenty times 
                         I've done it, the average is thirty-
                         two minutes, with a top time of fifty 
                         minutes.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Then we'll travel like Rockefeller.

               They don't know where Charlie is going with this, but they've 
               been around him long enough to know it's going somewhere.

                         When cars first started catching on, 
                         workers on tall ladders would use 
                         these swiveling colored boards for 
                         traffic signals. Now whenever 
                         Rockefeller would take the drive 
                         from his mansion to his office on 
                         Wall Street, the workers would make 
                         sure that he got green boards all 
                         the way.

                         We'll never get by the guard unless 
                         they're certain it's legit. I'm 
                         thinking cable TV. We cut his cable, 
                         he calls the cable company. We show 
                         up. Send a cable technician into the 
                         house with a pinhole video camera

                         Who plays cable technician? Steve 
                         thinks we're all dead.

               But Stella knows that's not exactly true. He doesn't think 
               Stella is dead; he doesn't know her at all.

                         If you're all dead, I guess I'm the

               Service trucks pull into the lot. Technicians are getting 
               out, finishing their shifts.

               INT. RENTAL CAR (PARKED NEARBY)

               Handsome Rob behind the wheel. Lyle shotgun, aiming his

                         I'm telling you. He claims he named 
                         it Napster because his hair is so 
                         nappy underneath that cap of his. 
                         But I know the real reason. It's 
                         because I was NAPPING when he stole 
                         the idea from me. I should've been 
                         on the cover of Wired magazine.

                         Would you clam up. You'd give a 
                         woodpecker a headache.

                         Okay. You're the Napster. Heads up: 
                         cable chick.

               They see a female service tech getting out of her work truck.

               Lyle zooms his camera lens in on her Adelphia Cable work 
               shirt. It has BECKY sewn in above her right breast.

                         Becky. Nice name. I wonder what she 
                         calls the other one.

                         And it's such a mystery why you don't 
                         have a girlfriend.

                                     LYLE
                         I had a girlfriend. Unfortunately 
                         even though the relationship ceased 
                         in an objective reality, it's still 
                         going on in my mind.
                              (tapping his head)
                         That woman's lived in here rent-free 
                         for four years.

               Lyle takes a few more pictures of Becky.

                                     LYLE
                         Okay. All we need now is a work shirt 
                         like this one and a service truck 
                         like that one. You think Stella will 
                         be able to pull it off?

                                     HANDSOME ROB
                         I have my doubts, but there's no 
                         talking to Charlie.

                                     LYLE
                         Maybe he's been inserting his hard 
                         drive into her software. Clouds the 
                         judgment.

                                     HANDSOME ROB
                         He knows better than to mix business 
                         with pleasure.
                              (getting out of the 
                              car)
                         Only I'm allowed to do that.

                                     LYLE
                         Where you going?

                                     HANDSOME ROB
                         To get a work shirt and a service 
                         truck.

               Lyle watches him stroll over to Becky and strike up a 
               conversation in the parking lot. Lyle can't hear what's being 
               said, but Becky smiles, and lest we forget, his name is 
               Handsome Rob for a reason.

               INT. BECKY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

               OUR CAMERA FOLLOWS a trail of clothes, hastily littered, 
               that lead to the cable chick's bed. Lit candles are on the 
               bedside table. The couple is asleep under a tangle of sheets. 
               Handsome Rob has clearly mixed business with pleasure. His 
               eyes flash open.

               He slips out of bed. Pulls on his pants. Reaches into her 
               pants and removes her key chain.

               He selects the key to her service truck and does an old trick: 
               he blows out one of the candles and presses the key against 
               the warm wax, making a clear impression of the key's ridges.

               He returns the key chain. Takes a couple more steps, past 
               her panties, past her bra and.

               He snags her work shirt. Then he's gone.

               INT. HANDSOME ROB'S HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

               Using locksmith equipment, he cuts a key that matches the 
               impression on the candle wax.

               EXT. ADELPHIA CABLE PARKING LOT - DAWN

               Stella, wearing Becky's work shirt, arrives before any other 
               workers. Using the key Handsome Rob made, she unlocks the 
               door to the cable truck and gets in.

               EXT. NEARBY STREET - MORNING

               The cable truck pulls over. Charlie and Lyle climb into the 
               back where they can't be seen.

               EXT. OPORTO DRIVE -MORNING

               The cable repair truck pulls over, parking down the street 
               from Steve's house.

               Charlie gets out. He quickly uses a crowbar to lift up a 
               sidewalk cement grate that says CABLE on it. Inside are cable 
               wires that feed the street. He crouches over and uses pliers 
               to disconnect one of the cables.

               INT. STEVE'S HOUSE - MORNING

               He drifts into the kitchen for a cup of coffee. He hits the 
               remote control for a TV. It turns on but there's nothing but 
               snow.

               He goes into the living room and checks out the plasma TV.

               The cable's not working in here, either. He hits an intercom 
               button on his telephone.

               INT. GUARD HOUSE - INTERCUT

               A SECURITY GUARD answers the intercom.

                                     SECURITY GUARD
                         What can I do for you, Mister 
                         Frezelli?

                                     STEVE
                         The cable's out. See if you can get 
                         someone over here to fix it'.

                                     SECURITY GUARD
                         Yes, sir.

               He finds the number and dials.

               INT. CABLE TRUCK (PARKED) - MORNING

               Lyle monitors a digital copy of the security guard's call 
               that's being routed to his laptop. Then he takes off his 
               headphones and tells Charlie and Stella:

                                     LYLE
                         Whoa. I've never heard the Muzak 
                         version of Purple Haze before.

                                     CHARLIE
                         When's the appointment?

                                     LYLE
                         Thursday between 9 a.m. and 3 p.m.

               Charlie dials a number on his cell phone.

               INT. GUARD HOUSE - INTERCUT

               The security guard answers the phone.

                                     SECURITY GUARD
                         Hello.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Yes, I'm calling from Adelphia Cable. 
                         I understand your service is out and 
                         an appointment was set up for 
                         Thursday.

                                     SECURITY GUARD
                         Yes.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Well we have a technician working in 
                         your area who finished with an 
                         appointment earlier than expected. 
                         Will someone be there for the next 
                         hour?

                                     SECURITY GUARD
                         Sure. That'd be great.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Our technician will see you then. 
                         Have a nice day.

                                     SECURITY GUARD
                         You too.

               Charlie hangs up.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Let's check the camera.

                                     LYLE
                         Stella, you're going patriotic today.

               Lyle puts an American flag pin on her work shirt. Then he 
               hits keys on his laptop and an image pops up on his monitor 
               via an RF antenna: the POV of the pin.

                                     CHARLIE
                         He's got cable lines in the kitchen, 
                         living room, bedroom and a cable 
                         modem on the computer in the office. 
                         Try to get a 360 look at each room. 
                         And walk slowly or the image will 
                         streak.

               Lyle hands her some papers.

                                     LYLE
                         I printed these up to look like 
                         paperwork from Adelphia. When you're 
                         done, ask him to sign and date the 
                         bottom.

               Stella looks very tense.

                                     CHARLIE
                         How you doing?

                                     STELLA
                         Fine. I'm fine.

               Charlie seems amused by that answer.

                                     CHARLIE
                         You know what fine, stands for? Fucked-
                         up, Insecure --

               Stella joins in with him...

                                     STELLA & CHARLIE
                         Neurotic and Emotional.

               They look at each other a moment... and smile.

               INT. RENTAL CAR (MOVING) - DAY

               While the others deal with the cable, Handsome Rob and Half- 
               Ear drive down Sunset.

                                     HALF-EAR
                         Here's our spot.

               They pull up in front of a strip joint.

                                     HANDSOME ROB
                         Girls girls girls.

               Half-Ear pulls a switchblade out of his boot and puts it in 
               the glove compartment. Handsome Rob gives him a questioning 
               look.

                                     HALF-EAR
                         Philly Steak said we'd be frisked.

               INT. STRIP CLUB - DAY

               Outside the doorway of a back room they're frisked by a BURLY 
               MAN. He's very thorough, digging hard into their crotches.

                                     HANDSOME ROB
                              (scowls)
                         Y'got a great job.

                                     BURLY MAN
                         Pays the rent, asshole. You got a 
                         problem, talk to Skinny Pete.

               He opens the door to the --

               INT. BACK ROOM

               Where we meet SKINNY PETE, who is the FATTEST MAN YOU'VE 
               EVER SEEN. He takes up an entire couch in the rear of the 
               room.

               His catcher's-mitt-sized hands motion them to come closer.

                                     SKINNY PETE
                         Philly Steak sent you?

               His voice is raspy, it's like a climbing-ten-floors-effort 
               just for this guy to get out the words.

                                     HALF-EAR
                         That's right.

                                     SKINNY PETE
                         So was I right-on about the gold 
                         bricks or what?

                                     HALF-EAR
                         That's really not what I'm here to 
                         talk about. Philly Steak said you 
                         could get us some supplies.

               The fattest man you've ever seen attempts a nod, triple-chins 
               colliding like a train wreck.

                                     SKINNY PETE
                         What do you need?

                                     HALF-EAR
                         A four inch can of Nitramon. Nitramon 
                         primer. Detonating cord. Two triple 
                         charger chemical grenades. Launcher.

                                     SKINNY PETE
                         Nine p.m.

                                     HANDSOME ROB
                         Should we hang here? Check out the 
                         dancers?

                                     SKINNY PETE
                         Nothing's going down here. I don't 
                         shit in my own yard, do you?

                                     HANDSOME ROB
                         No, but I take a whizz off the deck 
                         sometimes.

               With his distended belly and bursting shirt, his eyes glazing 
               with repletion, Skinny Pete writes down an address.

                                     SKINNY PETE
                         Five thousand dollars. And don't be 
                         late.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. SECURITY GUARD BOOTH -DAY

               Looking at a monitor, one of Steve's security guards sees 
               the Adelphia repair truck pull up to the gate. He hits a 
               button and the gate rises, beckoning it inside.

               INT. CABLE TRUCK (MOVING)

               Stella heads up the driveway, apprehension painted on her 
               features. Lyle is hidden in the back.

               She parks next to the Ferrari and finds herself surrounded 
               by the four Rottweilers. They snarl and flash their teeth 
               outside her door until a shrill WHISTLE yanks their attention 
               to --

               EXT. STEVE'S HOUSE

               where Steve has just stepped out the front door. The dogs 
               immediately back off.

               Stella gets out of the truck as Steve walks over, smiling at 
               her.

               She comes face to face with the man who killed her father.

                                     STEVE
                         It's all right. They won't bother 
                         you now.

               She's not sure she's going to be able to speak or pull this 
               off.

                                     STELLA
                         It's okay. I'm used to running into 
                         all sorts of dogs on my job.

               He holds out a hand.

                                     STEVE
                         I'm Steve.

                                     STELLA
                         Becky.

               She shakes his hand. She hates this, feeling his skin touch 
               hers, but she can't betray her feelings. He stands there a 
               moment.

                                     STELLA
                         You want to show me the problem?

                                     STEVE
                         Yeah. Course. This way.

               INT. STEVE'S HOUSE - SAME TIME

               She enters, moving her body to give the pinhole camera a 
               full sweep of the entryway.

                                     STELLA
                         I'd like to check the cable modem 
                         first.

               INT. BACK OF THE CABLE REPAIR TRUCK - SAME TIME

               Lyle watches Stella and Steve on his laptop via the pinhole 
               camera and hears them talking through his headphones.

               INT. HALLWAY - INTERCUT

               Steve leads Stella down the marbled hall...

                                     STEVE
                         I'll show you.

               They step into the --

                                     OFFICE
                         She turns her body so the mini-lens 
                         can stare at the gleaming black 
                         Worthington 1000 safe. Then she goes 
                         up to his desk and pretends to work 
                         on the cable line that feeds into 
                         his computer.

               He stares at her as she bends down...

                                     STEVE
                         The cable guy who hooked this up 
                         weighed about 300 pounds, didn't 
                         wear any underwear, and his pants 
                         slung a little too low if you know 
                         what I mean.

               She tries her best to ignore his flirtatious stare and his 
               words.

                                     STELLA
                         There we go. Now onto the TVs.

               INT. BACK OF THE CABLE TRUCK - DAY

               Lyle sees a perfect view of the main hallway as Stella walks 
               down it.

               INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY

               He escorts her inside. She works on the cable connection to 
               the plasma TV. Finishes.

                                     STEVE
                         Is it fixed?

                                     STELLA
                         Turn it on and see.

               EXT. OPORTO DRIVE - SAME TIME

               Back at the spot where Charlie disconnected the cable.

               Wearing a headset with a mic, he gets the word from Lyle --

                                     LYLE (V.O.)
                         Now.

               Charlie reconnects the cable just as --

               INT. LIVING ROOM

               Steve turns on the TV and the picture is --

                                     STEVE
                         Perfect.

                                     STELLA
                         Then it looks like you're all set.

               Steve stares at her a moment.

                                     STEVE
                         Have we met before?

               She's hoping to get out as quickly as she can.

                                     STELLA
                         I don't think so. Sign here, please.

               She hands him the paperwork and a pen. He signs it.

                                     STELLA
                         Date.

                                     STEVE
                         You read my mind.

                                     STELLA
                         Oh, no. I meant that I need you to 
                         put the date by your signature. It's 
                         the 26th.

                                     STEVE
                         I know what you meant.
                              (he smiles)
                         This might seem a little sudden, 
                         but... would you like to have dinner 
                         with me?

                                     STELLA
                         I don't think that'd be a very good 
                         idea.

                                     STEVE
                         Why? Is there some kind of cable-
                         rule against dating customers?

                                     STELLA
                         No, it's my rule. I don't accept 
                         dates from men I've just met. I've 
                         only known you five minutes.

                                     STEVE
                         Then I guess I'll have to sabotage 
                         my cable over and over again until 
                         you get to know me better.

               He's being charming, and she has to act like he is being 
               charming, but she really wants to throw-up.

                                     STEVE
                         Look, I'm just talking about dinner. 
                         Friday night. It's no big deal. If 
                         you don't like me, you never have to 
                         see me again. You know I'm not going 
                         to stop until you say yes.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. CABLE TRUCK (MOVING) - DAY

               Stella drives in heavy traffic down Sunset. Charlie and Lyle 
               are in the back.

                                     CHARLIE
                         I know it was tough in there.

                                     STELLA
                         He touched my hand. And he came-on 
                         to me. That slimy, disgusting man 
                         came onto me and I had to pretend 
                         that I liked it.

               Stella keeps her eyes forward, on the road, so Charlie and 
               Lyle can't see her face. But Charlie catches her reflection 
               in the rearview mirror and watches a tear glide down her 
               cheek. She wipes it away.

                                     STELLA
                         You do know what this means... I've 
                         created our window of opportunity.

                                     CHARLIE
                         I know. When Steve leaves Friday 
                         night, we go in. By the time he 
                         realizes you've stood him up, we'll 
                         be long gone with the gold.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. HOUSING PROJECTS - NIGHT

               A different world. A different vibe. That feeling in the 
               gut: you don't belong here.

               INT. RENTAL CAR (MOVING)

               Handsome Rob drives, Half-Ear in the passenger seat.

                                     HALF-EAR
                         Skinny Pete.

                                     HANDSOME ROB
                         The guy makes Jabba the Hut look 
                         like a spokesman for the Subway 
                         Sandwiches' diet.

               They pull over in front of the apartment building that Pete 
               sent them to.

                                     HALF-EAR
                         What do you think?

                                     HANDSOME ROB
                         I'm trying not to.

               EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT

               Half-Ear hits the buzzer for the apartment number on the 
               paper from the fat man. The door to the building buzzes in 
               response and they go inside.

               INT. APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT

               Climbing stairs. From behind closed doors: TVs, crying babies, 
               violent yelling. They start down a hallway. Ahead of them a 
               door opens and a suitcase is put in front of the doorway. 
               The door closes. They don't even get a glance at whomever is 
               inside.

               They go to the suitcase. Half-Ear clicks open the lock for 
               just a peek. He sees the goods.

               Handsome Rob starts to slide an envelope of cash under the 
               door frame. Its sucked out of his hand by someone on the 
               other side of the door and disappears.

               EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT

               Half-Ear carefully deposits the suitcase into the trunk of 
               the rental car. Handsome Rob closes the trunk.

                                     HALF-EAR
                         Drive slow. We crash and we're a 
                         crater.

               They get into the car.

               INT. RENTAL CAR

               Handsome Rob keys the ignition.

               The beam of his headlights illuminate TWO HOMEBOYS. TWO MORE 
               step out of the shadows, one right up to the passenger's 
               door window. That one taps a 9 MM against the glass.

               Half-Ear lowers the window. The homeboy pats one hand against 
               the faux-leather inside of the door, his other hand clutches 
               the weapon.

                                     HOMEBOY
                         What'd you put in the trunk?

                                     HALF-EAR
                         Suitcase.

               The homeboy, bugging on crank, is not one to be fucked with.

                                     HOMEBOY
                         Just gimme the keys before I pop a 
                         cap in your head.

               Handsome Rob takes the trunk key off the chain and passes it 
               over to Half-Ear... who nervously drops it onto the carpeted 
               floor.

                                     HOMEBOY
                         Hurry up!

               Half-Ear reaches down for the key... but in the flash of an 
               eye... moving so fast it almost doesn't register... we see 
               him yank his switchblade from his boot, unleash its blade, 
               and stab it down into the homeboy's hand. The knife goes 
               through his hand and lodges into the faux-leather interior 
               of the door.

               The homeboy suffers as Half-Ear whacks the gun out of his 
               other hand -- while Handsome Rob keys the ignition and guns 
               it.

               The other homeboys are already POPPING OFF SHOTS at the car 
               with semi-automatic handguns. Half-Ear hits the deck. Glass 
               shatters.

               INT. TRUNK OF THE CAR

               Bullets slam into the trunk, illuminating the darkness with 
               streaks of light from the bullet holes. They barely miss the 
               suitcase filled with explosives.

               EXT. RENTAL CAR (MOVING)

               The homeboy is still attached to the car door by the knife.

               His legs scurry to keep up with the moving vehicle but it's 
               going too fast so pretty soon he's being dragged. Bullets 
               whiz by him. He cries out in agony until Half-Ear has the 
               time to yank out the knife and the homeboy rolls away on the 
               pavement.

               The car makes a sharp right at the next block and pulls over.

               The U-Haul is waiting for them.

               They get out of the rental car and open its trunk. Half-Ear 
               sees the bullet holes that surround the suitcase. An inch 
               closer and they would've been a crater.

                                     HALF-EAR
                         Christ.

               INT. U-HAUL - NIGHT

               They get in with the suitcase. Charlie is behind the wheel, 
               he's been waiting for them. He hits the gas. They take off, 
               leaving the shot-up rental car behind.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Looks like that went without a hitch.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. CHARLIE'S HOTEL ROOM - DAY

               An edited loop of the exterior and interior of Steve's house 
               plays on Lyle's laptop. The crew is huddled around.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Lyle, what's the distance from the 
                         front door to the vault?

               Lyle doesn't answer.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Lyle?

               Handsome Rob leans over to Charlie.

                                     HANDSOME ROB
                         He only answers to The Napster now.

                                     CHARLIE
                         I'm not calling you The Napster.

                                     LYLE
                         You call him Half-Ear.

                                     HALF-EAR
                         That wasn't my idea.

                         And him, Handsome Rob.

                         That's only cause he is Handsome 
                         Rob.

                         So here's the riddle. How do we get 
                         over a ton of gold from the vault to 
                         the getaway car?

                                     STELLA
                         How wide is the hallway?

               The video that Stella got of the hallway plays on the laptop.

               Lyle calculates:

                         Only six feet.

               OUR VIEW PUSHES IN FAST on Stella.

               MINI COOPER (MOVING) - DAY

               She's driving. Pure concentration. Then:

               Tires spinning over a marble floor. Then:

               The sideview mirrors scraping wallpaper. Then:

               The thin car is like a missile firing RIGHT DOWN STEVE'S 
               HALLWAY, a hair-raising fit.

                                                               CUT BACK TO:

               INT. CHARLIE'S HOTEL ROOM - DAY

               Her idea brings a smile to her face.

                                     STELLA
                         Jack Daniels, straight up.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Minis?

                                     STELLA
                         We could rumble right up the front 
                         steps, bring the getaway car right 
                         to the vault, and then straight to 
                         Union Station.

               Handsome Rob likes it.

                         We'll need three to hold the gold.

               EXT. CAR RENTAL COMPANY - DAY

               Parked in the lot are shimmering Supercharged Mini Coopers, 
               a new model that still captures the legendary Mini look and 
               feel.

               Half-Ear climbs in one Mini. Lyle into another.

               INT. CAR RENTAL COMPANY - SAME TIME

               In the background, a large window overlooks the lot.

               Handsome Rob fills out the paperwork on the Mini he's renting 
               while flirting with a petite COUNTER BABE.

                                     HANDSOME ROB
                         I'd say you're a Maserati 250 S. 
                         Just 4 cylinders but can go 0 to 60 
                         in 4.2.

                                     COUNTER BABE
                         As long as it's a convertible -- I 
                         always like to have my top down.

               At the same time, in the background, we see Lyle and Half-
               Ear's Mini pull out of their parking spaces and BACK RIGHT 
               INTO EACH OTHER. Just a little bumper hit.

                                     COUNTER BABE
                         Do you know them?

               They get out of their cars and start yelling at each other.

                                     HANDSOME ROB
                         Never seen 'em before in my life.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. YEVHEN'S COIN & BULLION STORE - NIGHT

               Steve bangs a fist against the steel security door that covers 
               the closed store. The steel door rises up and once again 
               Yevhen unlocks another door.

                                     YEVHEN
                         You're early.

                                     STEVE
                         And I'm in a hurry, okay?

               INT. YEVHEN'S COINS & BULLION STORE - NIGHT

               It doesn't seem to matter if Steve's in a hurry or not, Yevhen 
               still runs at the mouth while heading into the back room.

                                     YEVHEN
                         Of course the Florida vote rigging 
                         was a CIA and Mob operation.

                                     STEVE
                              (with total disinterest)
                         That a fact?

                                     YEVHEN
                         You want facts? Fact: CIA officials 
                         were allowed free -- and illegal -- 
                         access to official election material.

               Steve puts his duffel bag down on the table. It THUDS. Once 
               again, he pulls out three gold bricks that each weigh 25 
               pounds.

                                     YEVHEN
                         Now given the sordid history in Miami 
                         of joint ventures between Central 
                         Intelligence and the Mob, which led 
                         to the unsuccessful attempts to kill 
                         Fidel Castro and the successful 
                         assassination of your President John 
                         F. Kennedy, this conjunction raises 
                         numerous red flags.

                                     STEVE
                         And I'd love to hear more about it, 
                         but like I said...

                                     YEVHEN
                         Don't worry, we'll have you out in 
                         no time. The cash is on its way.

               Steve cocks his head, as if he could not have heard right.

                                     STEVE
                         On its way?

                                     YEVHEN
                         My cousin is bringing it over.

                                     STEVE
                         Your cousin?

                                     YEVHEN
                         Yes. Cousin Mashkov.

                                     STEVE
                         He's on his way?

                                     YEVHEN
                         Don't worry, he will be here any 
                         minute.

               Steve looks up to the security camera.

                                     STEVE
                         The tape's off?

                                     YEVHEN
                         Of course. Believe me, he doesn't 
                         want to be on video, either.

                                     STEVE
                         Yevhen. Didn't I tell you, many times, 
                         that I never wanted to meet with 
                         anyone but you?

               Yevhen sweats a bit.

                                     YEVHEN
                         I know. But it's his cash. He uses 
                         me to launder money. I'm just a 
                         middleman.

                                     STEVE
                         And a middleman is supposed to stay 
                         in the middle.

                                     YEVHEN
                         But you were early. Please. Don't 
                         worry. It will be fine. My cousin's 
                         a cool guy. Like I am.

                                     STEVE
                         What you are, is a Dixie cup.

               Yevhen smiles quizzically, not sure if he's being complimented 
               or insulted.

                                     YEVHEN
                         Dixie cup?

               Before the words are out of Yevhen's mouth, Steve grabs one 
               of the 25 pound gold bricks and slaps it across Yevhen's 
               face, shattering his jaw.

               Yevhen's falls to the floor and Steve lifts the brick again 
               and rams it down onto his head with an ugly THUD.

               And again.

               And again.

               He then takes the gold brick -- slathered in blood -- and 
               places it back in his duffle bag.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. YEVHEN'S COINS & BULLION STORE - TEN MINUTES LATER

               Yevhen's Ukrainian cousin, MASHKOV, stares down at the corpse. 
               Steve is long gone.

               Mashkov kneels down by the body and starts sobbing.

               INT. HOUSE - NIGHT

               Mashkov walks through a living room, past some lighting 
               equipment and a video camera and we get just enough of a 
               look to realize that a porno is being shot here but he 
               couldn't care less as he makes his way into the kitchen where --

               His boss, DANYA, 60, the owner of this house, is eating a 
               bowl of Frosted Flakes at the kitchen table. They speak in a 
               colloquial Ukrainian tongue that we SUBTITLE.

                                     MASHKOV
                         My cousin Yevhen was beaten to death.

                                     DANYA
                         By who?

                                     MASHKOV
                         That's what I'm going to find out.

               They stop talking for a moment as one of the "ACTRESSES" 
               comes in, plops herself down next to Danya and pours herself 
               a bowl of cereal. She puts her hand on Danya's leg. She's 
               young and it's a disturbing image and we RECOGNIZE HER: she's 
               the HITCHHIKER who Lyle passed in the taxi ride down Figueroa 
               Street when he first arrived in L.A.

               Danya goes back to speaking SUBTITLED UKRAINIAN.

                                     DANYA
                         And what will you do when you find 
                         this piece of shit who killed your 
                         cousin?

                                     MASHKOV
                         I'll hack off his limbs and bury him 
                         while he's still alive.

                                     DANYA
                         Okay. But now we should stop talking 
                         Ukrainian, it's rude to my girl.
                              (switching to accented 
                              ENGLISH)
                         How are you tonight, Karen?

                                     KAREN
                         Hungry.

                                     DANYA
                         Then eat your Frosted Flakes.

                                     KAREN
                              (like Tony the Tiger)
                         They're grrrreat!

               Danya laughs pleasantly.

                                     DANYA
                         Such a perfect girl.

               But as she eats her cereal, we see a troubled, sad look on 
               her face.

               INT. RENTED WAREHOUSE - DAY

               The three Minis are parked inside: one red, one white, one 
               blue. Handsome Rob and Stella are doing custom work under 
               the hoods. Lyle is wearing the strap-on laptop and typing 
               away. Half-Ear squeezes silver Haliburton suitcases into the 
               Minis' trunks as Charlie enters --

                         How are our matchbox cars?

                         Do I get to drive one?

                                     HANDSOME ROB
                         No.

                                     LYLE
                         Why not?

                                     HANDSOME ROB
                         Because you can't navigate your way 
                         out of a parking lot. Here's your 
                         ride.

               He pulls a blanket off a Vespa. Lyle points at Half-Ear.

                                     LYLE
                         But he ran into me.

                                     HANDSOME ROB
                         He's not driving either.
                              (to Stella)
                         You ever got a speeding ticket?

                                     STELLA
                         Let's put it this way: I can only 
                         get insurance through companies that 
                         advertise on TV at 3:00 in the 
                         morning.

                         You drive. I drive. Charlie drives.

                         I got us spots for three cars on a

                         The Traffic Control Center is on the 
                         top floor of a building on Olympic 
                         and Grand. They get their data from 
                         pavement loop detectors and video 
                         image vehicle detectors. That info 
                         is fused together by specially 
                         designed algorithms to predict traffic 
                         conditions and control the traffic 
                         lights. So all I have to do now is 
                         change the data by creating my own 
                         algorithm.

                         I need to hard-wire into the 
                         mainframes.

               EXT. TRAFFIC CONTROL CENTER - NIGHT

               Housed in a towering building on the corner of Olympic and 
               Grand in the heart of downtown L.A. OUR VIEW RISES UP to the 
               rooftop, where WE FIND Charlie and Lyle.

               OUR VIEW MOVES IN CLOSER on Charlie, who adroitly picks the 
               lock to an access door and they climb down a short set of 
               steps into the 

               INT. MAINTENANCE ROOM - CONTINUOUS SHOT

               From an equipment bag, Charlie pulls out a silent power drill 
               and uses it to remove an access panel from the AC vent.

               INT. AIR-CONDITIONING VENT - NIGHT

               Charlie leads, crawling through this tight space, his path 
               illuminated by the thin beam of a penlight.

               INT. TRAFFIC CONTROL ROOM - NIGHT

               A high-tech setting with a half-dozen workers overseeing the 
               large traffic information monitors that display multiple 
               images.

               OUR CAMERA PUSHES IN on the wall of monitors and then 
               BLACKNESS as OUR VIEW CROSSES to the --

               OTHER SIDE OF THE WALL

               Where the 70" tall mainframe computers are housed and running. 
               We see that the AC vent to this room is now open since Charlie 
               and Lyle have already snuck inside.

               They move fast. Charlie removes the rear panels of the 
               mainframes while Lyle adeptly hard-wires his laptop into the 
               computers. The laptop's screen lights up.

               Charlie fits two false panels where the rear panels of the 
               mainframes used to be. Lyle pulls an innocent looking filing 
               box out of his equipment bag. He places the box on a nearby 
               shelf where it enjoys line-of-sight to the false panels.

               He punches a key on his laptop and the false panels and the 
               filing box quietly clicks into action, communicating with 
               his laptop via infrared. His laptop now shows a guiltwork of 
               thumbnail views from the traffic information monitors.

               Typing commands, Lyle is clearly operating on a higher 
               bandwidth than the rest us.

               spot where everyone minds their own business. One of the OLD 
               TIME WAITERS leads OUR CAMERA to a table in the back where 
               Mashkov sits across from a LAPD HOMICIDE DETECTIVE. He slides 
               over an envelope of cash and a photograph of Karen.

                         What?

               He looks at her closely, really closely.

                                     STEVE
                         There's only person I've ever heard 
                         say that. Used to say it all the 
                         time.

               This worries her. Because of course, she used to hear it 
               from her father.

                                     STELLA
                         Who was that?

               Under the table, he grabs her by the wrist, squeezes it like 
               a vise.

                                     STEVE
                         A man named John Bridger. Where did 
                         you pick up that phrase?

                                     STELLA
                         Ow. I don't remember. You're hurting 
                         me.

                                     STEVE
                         John Bridger was a thief. And he had 
                         a daughter. About your age. He told 
                         me that she took over a safe and 
                         lock company that he used as a front.

                                     STELLA
                         Let go of my wrist. What is wrong 
                         with you? It's just a saying.

               Steve's voice is calm, so at ease that watching them you'd 
               think this was pleasant dinner conversation.

                                     STEVE
                         No wonder I liked you right away. 
                         Just like I liked your old man, right 
                         up until the moment I shot him in 
                         the head. Now tell me who you're 
                         working with and tell me the plan. 
                         Do it now or we'll go for a ride and 
                         I'll break every bone in your body.

               Stella intentionally knocks over a glass of wine. It shatters 
               on the floor. An emergency signal...

               Charlie, Half-Ear, Handsome Rob and Lyle appear around the 
               table.

               Steve is shocked to see the men he left for dead three years 
               ago standing before him, very much alive.

               They pull up chairs from another table, encircling him for a 
               tense and pointed talk.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Something wrong, Steve? You look 
                         like you want to call Ghostbusters.

               Half-Ear furtively slides the switchblade out of his boot.

                                     HALF-EAR
                         She's coming with us. You got a 
                         problem with that?

                                     STEVE
                         Fine by me. But it's you that has 
                         the problem.

                                     LYLE
                         How do you figure?

                                     STEVE
                         You've just blown the one thing you 
                         had going in your favor, the element 
                         of surprise. And I was surprised.
                              (he laughs unpleasantly)
                         Jesus Christ when I saw all you guys 
                         come out of the woodwork. For a minute 
                         I thought maybe you were ghosts. But 
                         you're screwed now.
                              (an arrogant sneer a 
                              Half-Ear)
                         Did you figure out how to take care 
                         of my security guard? I'll hire five 
                         more.
                              (at Lyle)
                         You know how to bypass my alarm 
                         system? I'll have a new one installed 
                         tomorrow.
                              (at Handsome Rob)
                         Does it tear you up inside seeing 
                         what car I drive? I'll buy a matching 
                         one in red.
                              (at Stella)
                         You think you can crack my safe? 
                         You'll end up the same way as your 
                         dad.
                              (then to Charlie, all 
                              smiles)
                         Looks like Good Time Charlie's got 
                         the blues.

                                     CHARLIE
                         You can wear that shit-eating grin 
                         on your face, but I know under that 
                         Versace shirt you're in a cold sweat. 
                         And you're not going to sleep a minute 
                         tonight. Cause you thought you'd 
                         gotten away with it free and clear. 
                         You thought you'd gotten rid of us. 
                         You're the one who's screwed. Right 
                         to the wall.

                                     STEVE
                         Give it your best shot. I'll outsmart 
                         you every step of the way. And this 
                         time, I'll bury you myself.

                                     CHARLIE
                              (taking the challenge)
                         Get more guards. Change the alarm. 
                         Buy a dozen Ferraris. We'll still be 
                         here. Sleep tight.

               Charlie grabs a bread stick off the table and goes. The others 
               follow.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. STRIP CLUB - BACK ROOM - NIGHT

               The door bursts open as the burly man we met earlier is 
               dragged inside at gunpoint. Five Ukrainians armed with MAC-
               11 machine pistols storm the room where Skinny Pete works.

               Mashkov walks behind the posse. He carries a duffel bag. He 
               takes in the sight of the fattest man he's ever seen.

                                     MASHKOV
                              (in accented English)
                         Do you know who I am?

                                     SKINNY PETE
                         You work for Danya.

                                     MASHKOV
                         Yes. And you are gonna be straight 
                         with me and everything's gonna be 
                         okay. You fuck with me, I will be 
                         ruthless.

                                     SKINNY PETE
                         I understand.

                                     MASHKOV
                         I don't want you to understand. I 
                         want you to overstand.

                                     SKINNY PETE
                         Overstand... Okay.

                                     MASHKOV
                         Because if you don't overstand, I 
                         will use this.

               Mashkov nonchalantly opens the duffel bag and pulls out a 
               short-handled ax. Skinny Pete sees dried blood on the blade.

                                     MASHKOV
                         Someone was asking about gold bars 
                         with a Balinese girl's face on them. 
                         I want the name of this man.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. SHUTTER'S ON THE BEACH - MORNING

               The sun shines over the ocean and the hotel.

               INT. CHARLIE'S HOTEL ROOM

               The crew is gathered. Lyle, monitoring digital surveillance 
               on his laptop, takes off his headphones.

                                     LYLE
                         Well we scared him alright. He's 
                         flying the coop. His security guard 
                         called Brink's Armored Car Service 
                         to confirm a 5 p.m. pick up at his 
                         house, then JetClub to confirm a 
                         MD11 cargo plane departing from the 
                         Imperial Terminal at LAX at 8 p.m.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Confirmed? How'd we miss the first 
                         calls?

                                     LYLE
                         They must have been cellular. The 
                         cargo plane is being chartered to 
                         Mexico City.

                                     HANDSOME ROB
                         Only place with worse smog and traffic 
                         than L.A.

                                     STELLA
                         Once the charter's in the air, he 
                         could change the flight path to 
                         anywhere. And good-bye gold.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Not so fast. This is good news for 
                         us.

                                     HANDSOME ROB
                         Good news?

                                     CHARLIE
                         Sometimes when you're up to your ass 
                         in alligators you forget that you 
                         started off trying to drain the swamp.

                                     HANDSOME ROB
                         Meaning what the fuck?

                                     CHARLIE
                         We've been trying to get to the gold 
                         in the safe. Now the safe is coming 
                         to us. We'll boost it in transit.

               He might as well have said they'll steal the Holy Grail before 
               sunrise.

                                     HANDSOME ROB
                         Charlie. He could take a dozen 
                         different routes to the airport and 
                         we have no idea which one. We can't 
                         take out an armored truck during 
                         rush hour.

                                     CHARLIE
                         We're already set to do it. Napster: 
                         how would you like to create the 
                         biggest traffic jam in the history 
                         of Los Angeles?

                                     LYLE
                         Keep talking.

                                     CHARLIE
                         You gridlock every route except the 
                         one we choose. Force the truck to go 
                         exactly where we want it to go.

                                     HANDSOME ROB
                         But where do we want it? We can't 
                         shoot it out with armed guards in a 
                         Brink's. We'd lose. And even if we 
                         pulled it off, the cops would be all 
                         over us, chasing us all the way to 
                         Union Station. We're outmanned and 
                         outgunned.

                                     CHARLIE
                         But not outsmarted.

               Charlie hums with focused energy. There's a term for it in 
               horse racing. When a thoroughbred is at peak condition, and 
               twitching with eagerness to run, he is "on the muscle." That 
               describes Charlie right now.

                                     CHARLIE
                         We'll do it like the Italian job. 
                         We'll make thirty million in gold 
                         drop out of sight.

               They're interrupted by Charlie's cell phone RINGING. This 
               throws them all off.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Who else has this number?

                                     HALF-EAR
                         No one but us.

               It's still RINGING. Charlie decides to answer it.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Hello?

               Because that's where he has a tatoo that says PHILLY STEAK.

                         Because you wanted, to know about 
                         the gold with the Balinese Girl. 
                         Plus I guess Pete was under duress.

               The home where the porno was made. Karen, wearing a backpack 
               stuffed with her only belongings, creeps into the kitchen 
               with two 3/4" videotapes in hand.

               She sets them down on the counter. They say MASTER TAPE on 
               the labels. She opens the microwave oven. Puts the tapes 
               inside. Sets the timer for 60 minutes at the highest level 
               and presses the start button.

               As the videotapes start to cook, we watch Karen flee out the 
               door.

               The U-Haul is parked on the side of the noisy, congested 
               boulevard. A large metal sheet is now mounted on the side of 
               the panel truck.

               HIGH ANGLE. Parked behind the U-Haul are two of the Minis 
               and Lyle's Vespa. We see traffic flowing through the busy 
               intersection next to the vehicles. Then WE BOOM DOWN, really 
               fast, right into the black pavement and --

               THROUGH THE DARKNESS and out the other side, so we are now 
               underground in the middle of the --

               METRO RAIL TUNNEL

               where Half-Ear is at work, mounting Nitramon primer to the 
               tunnel walls, Charlie assisting. They both wear orange 
               jumpsuits, plus headsets and mics.

                         diploma.

                                     CHARLIE
                         No shit. I thought you dropped out 
                         of high school.

                         How'd you manage that, all the jobs 
                         we've been pulling?

                         Quit going to strip clubs. Went to 
                         night school instead. City college 
                         is all.

                         Good for you. That's a real feather 
                         in your cap.

                                     HALF-EAR
                         I didn't want to say anything to the 
                         guys.

               There's a RUMBLING SOUND in the distance.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Secret's safe with me.

               The RUMBLING grows unbearable as a Metro roars closer, 
               headlights gobbling up the dark tunnel. They press themselves 
               into a crevice in the wall.

               With a ROAR and a gust of wind, the Metro howls by. It makes 
               their jaws clatter.

               Handsome Rob's Mini is parked on the side of the winding 
               road. Using binoculars, he looks down onto Oporto Drive at 
               Steve's house. Into his headset:

                                     HANDSOME ROB
                         Everything's quiet here. Over.

               INT. METRO RAIL TUNNEL - DAY

               The Nitramon is applied. Half-Ear closes his eyes. Charlie 
               observes him a moment.

                                     CHARLIE
                         You okay?

                                     HALF-EAR
                         Ah huh. Just need a moment's 
                         meditation.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Now?

                                     HALF-EAR
                         I'm about to insert a wire into a 
                         detonator tube and if the wire touches 
                         the sides of tube, we'll be blown to 
                         Kingdom Come. Best to be at one with 
                         yourself.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Take all the time you need.

               Another moment, then Half-Ear sets to work. Charlie holds a 
               mini-flashlight, illuminating the intricate detonator. Very 
               carefully, he inserts a wire into a tube. Remember, the wire 
               must not touch the sides.

               The wire is half-way in when a LARGE SPIDER drops onto his 
               hand. Frozen, he ponders this.

               Charlie sees the spider, doesn't know what to do.

               Half-Ear studies the spider... then he closes his eyes just 
               a moment... relaxes... breathes in, breathes out... and then --

               He leans forward, opens his mouth and clamps his lips over 
               the spider, comes back up. Finishes inserting the wire.

               Job done, he calmly opens his mouth. The spider puts a hairy 
               leg out and delicately explores his cheek. Half-Ear plucks 
               it off just as delicately, depositing the spider on the wall.

               Charlie just shakes his head in disbelief.

                                     HALF-EAR
                         My work here is done.

               Through binoculars, Handsome Rob is still keeping an eye on 
               Steve's house from the higher vantage point.

               The front gate rises. The Brink's truck and motorcycles are 
               let inside and head up the driveway.

               But then he sees a SECOND ARMORED truck drive up, also guarded 
               by two motorcycles. And a third Brink's followed by 
               motorcycles turns into the driveway.

                         Shit. Decoys. It's like a shell game 
                         on wheels.

               The caravan of armored trucks and motorcycles now head down

               Handsome Rob sees the vehicles head east on Oporto. He reports 
               into his mike:

                         How're we going to figure out which 
                         truck has the gold?

               Charlie is just as frustrated... but in a tight spot he always 
               comes up with an idea.

                                     CHARLIE
                         You can monitor the traffic video 
                         cameras from your laptop, right?

                         Where's the first camera the trucks 
                         will go past?

               Lyle hits a command key and we now see the intersection of 
               Woodrow Wilson Drive and Cahuenga where vehicles are driving 
               under the traffic signal that a traffic video camera is 
               mounted to.

                                     LYLE
                         Cahuenga Boulevard. They all have to 
                         cross that.

                                     CHARLIE
                         The weight of the gold will lower 
                         the suspension on the truck.

               Lyle hits the keyboard and lines of measurements appear across 
               the image of the Brink's truck. He strikes another key, 
               momentarily FREEZING the image. He makes a visual check of 
               the top of the armored truck against the Cahuenga Boulevard 
               street sign.

                         Next...

                                     STELLA
                         Did you have to be right?

               EXT. HOLLYWOOD & HIGHLAND - DAY

               The motorcycle guards strain, managing to shift the steel 
               sheet enough so they can see the armored truck below.

               INT. METRO RAIL TUNNEL - DAY

               CLOSE SHOTS on Stella's eyes, pure concentration. CLOSE SHOTS 
               on each number on the dial. Finally: CLICK.

               She grabs the safe's lever and swings the sturdy steel door 
               open. She instinctively looks away.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Don't you want to see what's inside?

                                     STELLA
                         I never look.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Trust me. You wanna look.

               So she does. Inside is a mountain of gold bricks...

               EXT. HOLLYWOOD & HIGHLAND - MOMENTS LATER

               The motorcycle guards heave, strain, finally getting the 
               steel plate off. But it's too late as --

               INT. MINIS - SERIES OF SHOTS

               Engines REV. Exhaust jets. Hands slam stick-shifts.

               INT. METRO RAIL TUNNEL

               The cars streak off deeper into the Metro Rail tunnel, 
               headlights bouncing off the walls.

               INT. CHARLIE'S MINI (MOVING) - DAY

               It's a rush cruising down the tunnel. Taking the Blue Line.

               Leading the pack. But they're not home free yet.

               EXT. 101 FREEWAY - DAY

               Rush hour gridlock -- no problem. The Ferrari's 12 cylinder 
               massive 210 hp engine bellows as it hits 120 m.p.h. in the 
               breakdown lane.

               A Highway Patrol car starts chasing after it, siren wailing.

               INT. FERRARI (HAULING ASS) - DAY

               Merging onto the 110 South, Steve sees the patrol car in hot 
               pursuit.

               He shifts into sixth and suddenly this car is a rocket 
               blasting off, doing a 1/4 mile in 1.3 seconds, leaving the 
               patrol car far behind. At the same time --

               INT. SAFE HOUSE - GARAGE

               Mashkov and the other heavily armed Ukrainians climb into a 
               SUV. The garage door opens and the vehicle charges out of 
               there. And at the same time --

               INT. METRO RAIL TUNNEL

               The three Minis speed by UNDERNEATH OUR CAMERA in streaks of 
               red, white, and blue.

               INT. CHARLIE'S MINI (MOVING)

               He spots the proverbial daylight at the end of the tunnel.

               EXT. FLOWER & PICO - DAY

               Where the Blue Line rises up to ground level. The Minis 
               thunder into the daylight, past the above ground platform, 
               just as two motorcycles come flying around the corner after 
               them.

               Picture this: two guards on each motorcycle with each man 
               seated behind the driver holding AK-47s in each hand, giving 
               them the appearance of having submachine guns growing out of 
               their shoulders.

               Fingers go flat against the AK-47s triggers. Blowing SHOT 
               after SHOT at the Minis. BAM-BAM-BAM.

               INT. CHARLIE'S MINI

               In the teeth of gunfire. Bullets explode through the back 
               window in a cacophony of CRASHING GLASS. A shot wings his 
               door. POP! Into headset:

                                     CHARLIE
                         Split up!

               EXT. FLOWER & PICO

               They head off in different directions through congested 
               downtown rush hour traffic.

               One motorcycle takes off after Charlie's Mini. The other 
               goes after Handsome Rob's Mini. So Stella's free and clear 
               except that Steve's Ferrari is barreling down Pico and coming 
               after her.

               INT. LAPD HELICOPTER (FLYING)

               An LAPD PILOT swoops in, barking out instructions to police 
               cars converging on the scene.

               EXT. CHARLIE'S MINI

               Turning onto Exposition, the motorcycle in pursuit, the 
               chopper overhead.

               His red Mini jumps a curve, now on a wide sidewalk, 
               accelerating full throttle for the horizon while pedestrians 
               flatten themselves against a high-rise in fear.

               INT. CHARLIE'S MINI

               He sees someone give him the finger. Mutters:

                                     CHARLIE
                         If you don't like how I'm driving, 
                         get off the damn sidewalk.

               Meanwhile:

               INT. HANDSOME ROB'S MINI

               He's got the other motorcycle on his tail, RELENTLESS GUNFIRE 
               dogging his every move.

               He shifts smooth as silk, squeezing between a car he's passing 
               and an oncoming car in the other lane. Half-Ear is trying 
               his best to remain calm but Jesus, that was close.

               Suddenly, Handsome Rob veers off the road and WHAM. He takes 
               down a chain link fence and is now in the parking lot of 
               the:

               EXT. CONVENTION CENTER

               His white Mini catapults across the asphalt, the motorcycle 
               still right behind.

               INT. HANDSOME ROB'S MINI

               Up ahead, he eyes the open door entrance to the Convention 
               Center. Stomps the gas.

                                     HALF-EAR
                         What are you doing?

               The turbine howls.

                                     HALF-EAR
                         What -- are -- you -- doing?

               EXT. CONVENTION CENTER

               The Mini squeezes through the doorway and into the --

               INT. CONVENTION CENTER

               It's the STAR TREK GRAND SLAM 2002 convention in full swing.

               Display tables are lined up in the cavernous hall and the 
               Mini snakes through the maze and the Trekkies as --

               The motorcycle follows right behind and the chase is really 
               on now.

               THUDA THUD THUDA, the Mini's wheels climb a flight of steps.

               Waves of people flee the path of the little car and --

               THUD, THUDA, THUD, the motorcycle follows right behind.

               The Mini zips down the wide Concourse Hall -- travels 
               underneath banners of Star Trek characters that hang from 
               the ceiling -- the motorcycle keeps up, tires tearing into 
               the carpeting.

               INT. HANDSOME ROB'S MINI

               He shifts, swerves, avoiding people, obstacles.

                                     HALF-EAR
                         Go that way!

               Handsome Rob turns, taking them down the --

               WEST HALL

               that stretches out toward the Staples Center.

               WHIZ. The Mini goes by. WHIZ. The motorcycle goes by.

               Then --

               The Mini steamrolls through the exit doors and --

               EXT. CONVENTION CENTER/STAPLES CENTER

               It bounds down outdoor steps and ramps onto the outside 
               entrance to the Staples Center, fitting snugly between cement 
               pillars that are designed to keep regular-sized cars out.

               INT. STAPLES CENTER - DAY

               The Mini bulldozes through glass doors. Across the lobby.

               Down an aisle that leads right to --

               CENTER COURT

               where OUR L.A. LAKERS are in the midst of practice. The Minis 
               do look like matchbox cars next to these towering players.

               The car's tires leave a streak of rubber on the parquet floor. 
               The team clears a path. The car is off the court before they 
               know it.

               But now the players see the motorcycle coming down the aisle.

               See the guns. See security guards running after it.

               KOBE BRYANT picks up a basketball.

               The motorcycle charges across center court.

               Kobe aims... hurls the ball. It RAMS into the motorcycle's 
               handlebars. The bike spins out of control and into a nasty 
               fall, spitting off the riders while --

               EXT. STAPLES CENTER

               The Mini crashes out the opposite side of the arena and glides 
               right through the L.A. Sports Arch of Fame before escaping 
               onto Figueroa. Meanwhile:

               EXT. SOUTH ALAMEDA - DAY

               The Ferrari is eating up the pavement as it hounds after 
               Stella. Two police cars are roaring after them both.

               INT. STELLA'S MINI

               She slaps the gears into action, maneuvers tight turns around 
               the cars in her path, just like she does at home with Jack 
               Daniels.

               EXT. SOUTH ALAMEDA

               A cop car tries to pass the same car as the Ferrari but 
               smashes into an oncoming vehicle. As it spins like a corkscrew --

               EXT. FERRARI

               The rear tires spin smoke and it launches like a missile 
               after the Mini.

               INT. STELLA'S MINI

               She keeps flooring it... the gauge rising... the customized 
               engine screaming...

               But the Ferrari, like an unstoppable force, hangs menacingly 
               in her rearview mirror.

               I/E FERRARI

               Steve RAMS into the rear bumper of the blue Mini. The bumper 
               tears off, rolls across the pavement. The Ferrari is about 
               to make another charge.

               INT. STELLA'S MINI

               She yanks the wheel left to avoid the hit. Suddenly finds 
               herself in the path of an ARROWHEAD WATER TRUCK. She yanks 
               the wheel right to avoid a collision.

               INT. ARROWHEAD WATER TRUCK

               The truck driver hits the brakes, over compensating as he 
               turns away from the Mini and --

               EXT. SOUTH ALAMEDA

               The truck falls over onto its side, sending those big jugs 
               all over the road, water exploding into the air and --

               The Ferrari crashes through the jugs, one rolling up the 
               hood and over the windshield, dousing it like a car wash.

               The lane is blocked by the wreck. Steve makes a right turn.

               The police cruiser hits the brakes but not fast enough. It 
               slams into the water truck.

               EXT. 5TH STREET

               Steve turned onto a one-way street and he's going the wrong 
               way. A Jeep Wrangler almost runs into him head-on but both 
               cars stop just in time.

               The DRIVER of Wrangler, a muscular fire plug of a guy, jumps 
               out, furious.

                                     FURIOUS DRIVER
                         What's wrong with you, you stupid-
                         ass, son of a bitch, dickhead...

               As more invectives are hurled, Steve gets out of the Ferrari 
               and walks towards the furious driver.

                                     FURIOUS DRIVER
                         What? You want a piece of me? C'mon, 
                         dumbshit. Bring it on. I'll be pulling 
                         peanuts out of your asshole --

               BANG. Steve shoots the guy's foot.

                                     FURIOUS DRIVER
                         Shit! Shit! You shot me in the foot!

               While the furious driver hops on one leg, Steve gets into 
               the Wrangler and takes off, abandoning the Ferrari. At the 
               same time --

               INT. BMW 750IL (MOVING) - SUNSET

               Lyle's coasting down Exposition Boulevard towards Union 
               Station. Clear sailing for him.

               He sees a young woman thumbing for a ride. It's Karen. And 
               he recognizes her: she was hitchhiking when he first arrived 
               in L.A. He pulls over. To Lyle, she might be an angel in the 
               empyrean if she wasn't, so completely, a woman.

                                     LYLE
                         Where are you going?

                         Away.

                         How about far, far away?

                                     KAREN
                         The farther the better.

               EXT. FIGUEROA & OLYMPIC - DAY

               Charlie's still having a helluva time getting rid of the 
               motorcycle. It screams like a Banshee as it streaks up 
               alongside the Mini. Charlie suddenly sees an AK-47 pointed 
               right at him.

               INT. CHARLIE'S MINI

               He jerks the steering wheel and swerves off the street, 
               driving through the parking lot of the historic Hotel 
               Figueroa.

               With the motorcycle dogging his heels, he looks up at the 
               building. It has three towers that rise up 12 stories, with 
               a giant mural of Albert Einstein covering one of the towers

               (it's an ad for Apple Computers: Think different.)

               Suddenly the LAPD helicopter swoops down towards the parking 
               lot, shattering the air, blowing up dirt and discarded 
               newspapers in a rush of turbo-wash, trying to box in the 
               Mini.

               INT. CHARLIE'S MINI

               He's got no place else to go...

               INT. HOTEL FIGUEROA

               The Mini squeezes through the entrance and into the lobby 
               with its exotic Moroccan decor. Horrified guests catapult 
               out of the way. The Mini drives past wooden statues, potted 
               palm trees.

               The motorcycle follows the car as it streaks towards the 
               elevator. Charlie looks back, sees the motorcycle. The 
               elevator door opens. Some tourists step off.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Going up?

               INT. ELEVATOR

               The Mini darts right in, not an inch to spare. Charlie reaches 
               out the window, presses the button for ROOF.

               He sees the motorcycle charging after him, burning rubber 
               across the beautiful tiled floor. Closer, closer.

               The door closes just in time.

               A second elevator opens, the motorcycle zooms inside, people 
               screaming at the sight of the guns.

               EXT. ROOFTOP - DAY

               The doors open, PING, and the Mini reverses out, spins.

               LOOKING DOWN onto the building's rooftop, we see that it is 
               shaped like a capitol E, three towers connected by a narrow 
               strip. Each tower has its own elevator.

               INT. CHARLIE'S MINI

               He wants to drive across the rooftop strip but there's a big 
               problem: the giant sign that exclaims HOTEL FIGUEROA in red 
               and white neon lights blocks so much of the strip that even 
               the Mini couldn't squeeze through.

               In his rearview, he sees the second elevator door open and 
               out comes the motorcycle. He's trapped up here. But he's not 
               about to abandon ship.

               EXT. ROOFTOP

               So he floors it, slaps the gears, hurtles to the edge of the 
               first tower and in --

               EYE-POPPING CGI SLOW MOTION SHOTS

               His car hurls into the wide blue empty space... The ground 
               deliriously distant... Spiraling through the air like a 
               football...

               NEXT TOWER - ROOFTOP

               The Mini lands right-side-up with a THUD. Charlie, rattled, 
               looks over his shoulder and sees the LAPD helicopter rising 
               over the rooftop, turbines SCREAMING.

               And here comes the motorcycle. Flying from one section of 
               the rooftop to the next. It lands and the driver REVS it 
               forward --

               I/E CHARLIE'S MINI

               He speeds toward the edge of the roof and launches off towards 
               the third tower some twenty feet away. Lands. Keeps going to 
               the last elevator, skids to a stop.

               He reaches out, punches the call button. Then looks over his 
               shoulder to witness --

               THE MOTORCYCLE

               going full throttle to make the final rooftop to rooftop 
               jump.

               But its front wheel hits the edge slightly off-kilter...

               It soars but with a slight downward trajectory...

               Towards a large window on the top floor...

               Then lower...

               And the look on the driver's face says it all as...

               The front wheel of the motorcycle SMACKS into the side of 
               the building, just below the window.

               The guards are flung off the bike and their bodies CRASH 
               through the window as --

               A hunk of exploding metal imbeds itself in the side of the 
               LAPD chopper and --

               INT. HOTEL FIGUEROA

               The guards land in the Tangier Suite in a hailstorm of glass 
               shards.

               I/E. LAPD HELICOPTER

               Smoke billows out where the hunk of metal hit. The pilot 
               keeps it under control but it's time to go. With a WHINING 
               THROB, the injured chopper banks away.

               INT. HOTEL FIGUEROA LOBBY - DAY

               PING. The elevator door opens. Charlie's Mini shoots out 
               then skids out the lobby's exit. He made it.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. STELLA'S MINI (SPEEDING) - DAY

               She checks the rearview mirror. No sign of the Ferrari.

               Just a Jeep Wrangler back there.

               Stella looks relieved. Feels like she's home free.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. UNION STATION - SUNSET

               Stella's Mini pulls up to the ramp of the enclosed car carrier 
               at the end of Amtrak Train 59, bound for New Orleans.

               She can see the other two Minis are already inside. She gets 
               out and hands the cargo loader a ticket.

               EXT. UNION STATION - NIGHT

               The "All Aboard" announcement goes out over the PA system.

               Then the Superliner train pulls out of the station, quickly 
               picking up speed.

               INT. FIRST CLASS CAR - NIGHT

               The outside streaks by through the window. It's a happy crew. 
               Champagne is poured. Charlie holds up his glass and gets 
               their attention.

                                     CHARLIE
                         I want to make a toast. Cause there's 
                         somebody missing here today, and we 
                         all know who it is.

               They all raise their glasses.

                                     CHARLIE
                         To John Bridger. The most brilliant 
                         master planner of them all. We wish 
                         he was with us.

               We PAN ACROSS their faces. It's been a three year odyssey 
               for them. They got the gold, but they lost someone they loved.

                                     ALL OF THEM
                         To John.

               Clink.

               INT. CAR CARRIER - NIGHT

               OUR CAMERA MOVES past the three Minis parked inside...

               And STOPS at the last car in the carrier -- the Jeep Wrangler. 
               Its rear hatch rises and Steve creeps out. Looks around. 
               It's safe.

               He walks over to Stella's Mini. Pops open the trunk REVEALING 
               a silver Haliburton suitcase. He unzips the case.

               It's filled with stacks and stacks of gold bricks, the exotic 
               face of a Balinese girl on each one.

               Steve pulls out a brick, embraces it. He knows his gold.

               These bricks are real.

               But as he has a moment with his gold, BEHIND HIM, the trunks 
               of the other two Minis RISE in unison.

               Then Mashkov RISES out of the trunk of the white Mini.

               Another Ukrainian RISES out of the trunk of the blue Mini.

               Four more Ukrainians slide out from underneath the Minis.

               They cock their M-lls.

               CLICK CLICK CLICK CLICK CLICK CLICK.

               Steve hears the sound from behind him. He turns around to 
               see the weapons pointed at him.

                                     MASHKOV
                         Take out your gun and drop it on the 
                         floor.

               Steve has no choice.

                                     STEVE
                         Who are you?

                                     MASHKOV
                         You knew my cousin. Yevhen.

                                     STEVE
                         I never knew anyone named Yevhen.

                                     MASHKOV
                         Get in the trunk. Not that trunk, 
                         this one. That gold is for us. A 
                         gift from some old friends of yours. 
                         They said to tell you that they didn't 
                         mind sharing the box of Cracker Jack, 
                         as long as you didn't get any. Not 
                         even the toy surprise.

               The Ukrainians force Steve into the trunk of the white Mini.

               And for the first time, he's scared. Looking up at Mashkov, 
               he begs.

                                     STEVE
                         Please. Don't shoot me. Please...

                                     MASHKOV
                         Don't worry. That wasn't the deal. 
                         I'm not going to shoot you.

                                     STEVE
                         Thank you. Thank God.

                                     MASHKOV
                              (to the others)
                         He really thought I was going to 
                         shoot him.

               The Ukrainians laugh. Steve tries to laugh.

                                     MASHKOV
                         No. No. I'm not going to shoot you. 
                         I'm going to hack off your limbs and 
                         bury you while you're still alive.

               And with that, he closes the trunk. THUD. Like the lid of a 
               coffin. And for Steve, the world falls into BLACKNESS.

               INT. FIRST CLASS CAR - SAME TIME

               Underneath the crew's seats, we see the other two silver 
               Haliburton suitcases filled with the rest of the gold. We 
               BOOM UP to our five thieves...

                                     CHARLIE
                         New IDs.

               Handsome Rob passes out new fake driver's licenses for when 
               they arrive in New Orleans.

                                     LYLE
                              (re: his fake license)
                         Simon Quackenbush? Could I -- just 
                         once -- have a cool name?

                                     HALF-EAR
                              (also complaining)
                         250_pounds?

               They're interrupted by the RING of Charlie's phone. He 
               answers.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Did you get what you wanted?

               INT. CAR CARRIER - INTERCUT

               Mashkov is on the other end of the line.

                                     MASHKOV
                         I'm happy.

               During this, Lyle types commands into his laptop that is 
               connected to a phone jack in the car.

                                     CHARLIE
                         It was good doing business with you.

               Lyle hits a final command and --

               INT. ENGINEER ROOM - SAME TIME

               signal box receives the command and --

               The coupler between the car carrier and the rest of the train 
               is electronically disengaged.

               This causes the train to separate from the car carrier. The 
               train speeds on without it at 100 miles per hour.

               The car carrier slowly comes to a stop in the middle of 
               nowhere.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               windows for scenic dining. Lyle walks over to a table where 
               Karen is waiting for him. She looks resplendent.

                                     LYLE
                         Is this seat taken?

                         It is now.

               He sits. And as OUR CAMERA HOLDS ON Lyle, ready to embark on

                         to ask you, Stella. But I've just 
                         been so busy lately, what with the

               OVER BLACK

               Sounds of the innerspaces rushing forward.

               Then a splinter of blue light in the center of the picture.

               It breaks wide, showing the top and bottom a silhouetted 
               curtain of razor sharp teeth suggesting that we are inside 
               of a tremendous gullet, looking out at the onrushing undersea 
               world at night. HEAR a symphony of underwater sounds: 
               landslide, metabolic sounds, the rare and secret noises that 
               certain undersea species share with each other. Also, the 
               hint of familiar music, twisted and distorted by the depths.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. BEACH  NIGHT  SHARK'S POINT OF VIEW  RISING OUT OF 
               THE WATER, LOOKING AT

               It is a pleasant, moonlit, windless night in mid-June. We 
               see a long straight stretch of white beach. Behind the low 
               dunes are the dark shapes of large expensive houses. Hear a 
               number of voices singing. It sounds like an eastern 
               university's alma mater, no longer distorted.

               EXT. BEACH  NIGHT  ANOTHER ANGLE

               Around a blazing bonfire, a group of young men and women, 
               beer cans (or maybe a keg) in evidence, as well as the bota 
               Spanish leather wine-bag much in favor by beach and ski-bum 
               types.

               The group is swapping sentimental alma maters, weepily singing 
               eastern Ivy League anthems - Dartmouth, Cornell, Harvard, 
               Penn, etc. Two young people break away from the others. They

               are Tom Cassidy and Chrissie. Behind them, there is 
               considerable necking activity; Tom and Chrissie are more 
               serious.

               TOM

               Makes a clumsy attempt at snaring Chrissie, cups her from 
               behind. She squirms playfully out of his grasp. We discover 
               he's not especially sober.

                                     TOM
                         Hey! Hey hey! I'm with you, right?

               EXT. ANOTHER PART OF THE BEACH  NIGHT

               Tom and Chrissie are separated from the others, silhouetted 
               against the fire, she pauses and looks at the ocean, he is 
               plodding along in the sand, winded.

               Chrissie runs down the slope of the dune towards the water, 
               leaving Tom reeling atop the dune. As she runs, she is 
               shedding her clothes. Tom is trying to trail her by her 
               clothes, like Hansel following bread crumbs through the woods.

               But Chrissie is way ahead of him.

                                     CHRISSIE
                         C'mon!

               She runs headlong into the inviting sea, plunges cleanly 
               into the water with a light "Whoops!" as the cold water sweeps 
               over her.

               Behind all this, we continue to hear the sentimental, beery 
               chorus of alma maters.

               Then we see it -- a gentle bulge in the water, a ripple that 
               passes her a dozen feet away. A pressure wave lifts her up, 
               then eases her down again, like a smooth, sudden swell.

                                     CHRISSIE
                         Tommy? Don't dunk me...

               She looks around for him, finds him still on the beach, his 
               feet tangled in his pants, which have dropped around his 
               ankles. She starts to swim back in to him.

               EXT. CHRISSIE IN THE WATER

               Her expression freezes. The water-bulge is racing towards 
               her. The first bump jolts her upright, out of the water to 
               her hips. She reaches under water to touch her leg. Whatever 
               she feels makes her open her mouth to scream, but she is 
               slammed again, hard, whipped into an arc of about eight feet, 
               up and down, submerging her down to her open mouth, choking 
               off any scream she might try to make. Another jolt to her 
               body, driving her under so that only her hair swirls on the 
               surface. Then it too is sucked below in a final and terrible 
               jerking motion. HOLD on the eddies and swirls until we're 
               sure it's all over.

               EXT. CLOSE ON TOM ON BEACH

               In his shorts, laughing to himself, turning in slow stoned 
               circles, held prisoner by his windbreaker which seems to 
               have him in an armlock, as he struggles to free his arm from 
               a tight sleeve. As he turns, we hear the alma maters in the 
               background, from the fire.

               INT. BRODY HOUSE - BEDROOM - EARLY MORNING

               A shaft of morning sun blasts through the crack between the 
               bottom of the shade and the windowsill, falling across the 
               heads of the sleeping couple on the bed. It catches Martin 
               Brody right across the eyes, bringing him up from sleep.  
               The job is completed by the clock radio, which clicks on 
               with local fisherman's report and weather.

                                     RADIO ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
                         Hayes Landing reports conditions 
                         good, with stripers and jacks. The 
                         Coast Guard has no storm warning 
                         from Block Island to Cape Hatteras; 
                         a light chop with freshening winds, 
                         continued clear and mild... (etc.)

               Ellen Brody burrows her head under the covers, avoiding 
               morning for a few precious minutes more.

                                     BRODY
                         How come the sun didn't used to shine 
                         in here?

                                     ELLEN
                         'cause when we bought the house it 
                         was Autumn. This is summer. Feed the 
                         dogs.

               We hear the scampering toenails of two cocker spaniels 
               scrabbling around the foot of the bed. Brody swings out of 
               bed, wearing shorts, socks, and tee shirt.

                                     BRODY
                         Right.

                                     ELLEN
                         Do you see the kids?

                                     BRODY
                         Probably out in the back yard.

                                     ELLEN
                         In Amity, you say 'Yahd.'
                              (she gives it the 
                              Boston sound)

                                     BRODY
                         The kids are in the yahd, playing 
                         near the cah. How's that sound?

                                     ELLEN
                         Like you're from N'Yawk.
                              (gives it Brooklyn 
                              sound)

                                     BRODY
                         Give me 30 years, I'll get it.

               He leads the dogs out of the bedroom and down to the kitchen.

               INT. BRODY KITCHEN - MORNING

               Brody enters, sets down some dog food, goes to make coffee, 
               starts to fill kettle to boil water, the cold water rushes 
               through and out the burnt-out bottom of the kettle.

                                     BRODY
                         Did you burn another kettle? Y'know 
                         you're a fire hazard? This is the 
                         third one!

                                     ELLEN (O.S.)
                         I never hear the whistle.

                                     BRODY
                         Feed the dogs.

               Ellen Brody, a tall, attractive blonde woman, enters from 
               upstairs. She's still slightly sleepy, not what you'd call 
               an "Instant-On" person. Mornings are not her best time.

                                     ELLEN
                         You want to go through those?
                              (she indicates bag of 
                              clothes)
                         I'm taking them to the Thrift Shop.  
                         It's Marcia Vaughn's pet charity.  
                         Pick out what you want to keep -- 
                         it's mostly your city clothes.

                                     BRODY
                              (looking through bag, 
                              remembering)
                         I used to wear this to the Garden. 
                         Garbage strikes. Dog shit. Muggers.
                              (he puts it all behind)
                         Ship it.

                                     ELLEN
                         Don't be silly - You're going to 
                         make summer better for them...

               Before Brody can answer, Michael, his oldest boy, enters, 
               holding his hand. There is bright new blood on it, but he is 
               sensibly unconcerned. It's a normal childhood scrape.

                                     MICHAEL
                         Cut my hand. Hit by a vampire.

                                     BRODY
                         On the swing? I told you not to play 
                         near there until I sanded it down.
                              (to Ellen)
                         See what your son did?

                                     ELLEN
                         Go upstairs and bring Mommy a band-
                         aid.

               Michael goes on out and upstairs. Ellen fumbles in her pocket 
               and produces Brody's new glasses, which she holds out to 
               him.

                                     ELLEN
                         Don't forget these.

                                     BRODY
                         Oh, yeah.
                              (he puts them on)
                         How do I look? Older, huh?

                                     ELLEN
                         I think they make you look sexy.

               Brody reacts to this, and bends to kiss her lightly. Then 
               more seriously.

                                     BRODY
                         Sexy, hm? What was I before?

                                     ELLEN
                         Older, sillier.

                                     BRODY
                              (as he goes to make 
                              coffee, he fumbles 
                              with the new glasses)
                         I don't want to depend on these 
                         things, y'know - sometimes you can 
                         weaken your eyes.

               He looks out the window to the view beyond, discovering some 
               new wonder in the fresh sunlit morning.

               BRODY'S POINT OF VIEW  OUTSIDE THE HOUSE

               Sean, the younger child, is happily romping in the summer 
               air, enjoying the very air he breathes.

                                     BRODY
                         Let's see...

               The phone rings.

               INT. BRODY KITCHEN  DAY

               Brody answers one of two phones on the wall.

                                     BRODY
                         Brody... yeah, what's up... mmm... 
                         Well, what do they usually do, float 
                         or wash up? Really?... okay, I'll 
                         meet both of you at the beach in
                              (checks watch)
                         ...20 minutes, okay? Okay.
                              (hangs up)
                         First goddamn weekend of the summer.

               Michael reenters in bathing trunks, with a towel on his 
               shoulder, his hand washed, holding a band-aid ready for 
               application. Ellen takes it, and bandages the finger with 
               care and affection.

                                     ELLEN
                         There.
                              (to Brody)
                         What was that?

               Michael heads toward the beach.

                                     BRODY
                              (struggling to get 
                              his shirt on over 
                              his glasses)
                         The office.

               He gets his shirt on with Ellen's help. She flicks imaginary 
               dust from the badge on his chest.

                                     ELLEN
                         Be careful.

                                     BRODY
                         Here? You gotta be kiddin'.

               He gives her a light kiss, starts to go, with his cup.

                                     BRODY
                         Love ya.

                                     ELLEN
                              (kissing him back)
                         Hey Chief. Bring my cup back.

               At the door, he takes a windbreaker off a peg and goes on 
               out.

               We can see the Amity Police shoulder patch as he goes to a 
               van parked outside.

               EXT. ISLAND HIGHWAY - MORNING

               Martin Brody's Country Squire police wagon rushes past, taking 
               the view to an enormous billboard depicting a typical summer 
               day in Amity. A beautiful model splashes in the gold surf, 
               languishing in a Solarcaine sun. AMITY WELCOMES YOU is written 
               above her flailing arms.

               EXT. AMITY BEACH - DAY

               Three small figures in the landscape, walking the beach. The 
               surf is rough and there is sea-floor debris strewn about 
               from the receding tide.

               CLOSER ANGLE

               Deputy Hendricks is searching the shore about one hundred 
               yards down wind. Meanwhile, Brody, in his casual police 
               attire, and Tom Cassidy, still in the clothing we saw him in 
               last night, walk down the beach. Brody fingers the missing 
               girl's shoes, purse and clothes. In the daylight, Cassidy 
               misconducts himself, wavering between inflated maturity and 
               tear-blown adolescence.

                                     BRODY
                         Christine what?

                                     CASSIDY
                         Worthingsly... Worthington -- no one 
                         ever died on me before.

                                     BRODY
                         You picked her up on the ferry.

                                     CASSIDY
                         I didn't know her.

                                     BRODY
                         And nobody else saw her in the water?

                                     CASSIDY
                         Somebody could've -- I was sort of 
                         passed out.

                                     BRODY
                         Think she might've run out on you?

                                     CASSIDY
                         Oh, no, sir. I've never had a woman 
                         do that. I'm sure she drowned.

                                     BRODY
                         You from around here?

                                     CASSIDY
                         No. Cambridge. Harvard. My family's 
                         in Tuxedo, New York, though.

                                     BRODY
                         You here for the summer?

                                     CASSIDY
                         Some friends and me took a house.

                                     BRODY
                              (genuinely curious)
                         What d'you pay for a place just for 
                         the summer?

                                     CASSIDY
                         A thousand apiece, something like 
                         that. There's five of us. And we 
                         each kick in a hundred a week for 
                         beer and cleaning, stuff like that.

                                     BRODY
                         Pretty stiff.

               A shrill whistle makes them turn. Hendricks is fifty yards 
               away, on his knees. He blows again, a feeble report this 
               time.

                                     BRODY
                         Maybe that's your girl.

               Brody runs toward Hendricks, Cassidy hesitates, then follows 
               with:

                                     CASSIDY
                              (pathetically)
                         You can't make me look -- !

               MASTER ANGLE - THE SAND DUNE

               A skein of seaweed garnishes the base of this isolated dune.

               The booming waves and fizzing surf make dialogue inaudible.

               Deputy Hendricks on hands and knees, looking white as a sheet.  
               Brody tells Cassidy to wait at the foot of the dune, and 
               ventures up. Hendricks stops him with a wave-off, saying 
               something at the same time. Brody nods understanding and 
               steps up cautiously and looks down. He adjusts his glasses, 
               trying to make sense of what he is looking at.

               Whatever he sees has a marked effect on his entire physique.

               Kicking out with his foot, Brody sends dozens of angry 
               horseshoe crabs into an escape frenzy and they boil over the 
               top of the dune and down its slopes.

               Cassidy takes a few uneasy steps backwards when Brody waves 
               him over. He shakes his head. An awkward moment. Then Cassidy 
               shuffles forward and up the few remaining feet, his eyes 
               looking everywhere but down. Brody says something else and 
               Cassidy shakes his head again, eyes out at sea. Brody puts 
               his hand gently around the quaking man's shoulder.

               Nodding, he starts to look down, an inch at a time. He looks.

               He, too, can't make out what it is at first. Then he 
               understands.

               The jolt that assaults Cassidy is not unexpected. He falls 
               backward in a sitting position as though shot. Nods yes -- 
               it's her. Brody turns and slides off the dune, stumbling 
               close. Hear his breathing. He looks around, envisioning the 
               week ahead of him....

               QUICK SHARP CUT

               Chrissie's remains, incomplete from the chest down, horribly 
               bitten. (NOTE: See Hooper's dialog in Sc. 91 for complete 
               description of corpse.)

               INT. BRODY'S OFFICE - DAY

               Brody walks through the door and enters his office, holding 
               a fizzing glass of Alka-Seltzer. Polly, his sixty-one year 
               old secretary follows close on his heels with her shorthand 
               pad of messages and reminders.

               In the outer office, Hendricks and Cassidy slump into chairs, 
               sipping from fizzing dixie cups.

               Brody dips into file drawers for the appropriate forms. He 
               gently turns on Polly, who is behind him.

                                     BRODY
                         If this is going to work, you've got 
                         to keep current stuff out here, and 
                         put 'closed' files in there. The 
                         'Pendings' stay on my desk, okay?

               Brody slips behind his typewriter, putting paper in the 
               machine with the effortless ease of years of practice. He's 
               obviously no stranger to paperwork. He touch types, hardly 
               ever looking down, checking his notes and listening with one 
               ear to Polly.

               He is affected by what he's seen, but there's work to be 
               done.

                                     POLLY
                         This is in no order of importance, 
                         Chief: There's a meeting on the Amity 
                         Town Council on Aging this Monday 
                         night, Bentoncourt Hall. The Fire 
                         Inspector wants you to go over the 
                         fireworks site with him before he 
                         catches the one o'clock ferry. Mainly, 
                         you have a batch of calls about that 
                         new Karate school.

               CLOSE - ACCIDENT REPORT

               Brody has just typed the girl's name. He skips the space for 
               Cause-of-Death, and just under it types the Next-of-Kin 
               information he has collected from her wallet.

                                     POLLY
                         Searle's Rent-a-Bike, the Rainy Ale, 
                         Tisberry's Hardware... they say it's 
                         those nine-year-olds from the school 
                         practicing karate on all those nice 
                         picket fences.

               The phone rings and Polly picks it up.

                                     POLLY
                         It's the Coroner. Somebody pass away 
                         in the night?

               Brody nestles the phone between ear and collar, listening, 
               as he turns to the typewriter.

                                     BRODY
                         Jesus, Santos.

               INSERT - ACCIDENT REPORT

               Cause-of-Death line rolls into place. The hammers punch out: 
               SHARK ATTACK.

               BRODY

               leans forward, staring at what he just wrote. Polly cocks 
               her head and removes the phone from his ear.

                                     POLLY
                         What's the matter?

               Brody takes a breath. A new resolve comes over him.

                                     BRODY
                         Polly, I want to know what water 
                         recreation is on for today.

                                     POLLY
                         Right this minute?

               Brody gets up and moves hastily toward the door.

               BRODY'S OUTER OFFICE

               Cassidy and Hendricks look up as Brody enters.

                                     BRODY
                              (To Hendricks)
                         Where'd you hide the 'Beach Closed' 
                         signs?

                                     HENDRICKS
                         We never had any. What's the problem?

               A local merchant comes through the door.

                                     LOCAL MERCHANT
                         Glad I caught you. There's a city 
                         truck with New Hampshire plates parked 
                         right in front of my...

               Brody pushes past him and out the door.

               EXT. AMITY MAIN STREET  DAY

               In the busy center of a town preparing for the big Fourth of 
               July weekend, Brody wends his way around sidewalk activity, 
               purpose and haste in each stride. As he turns a corner a 
               little man in a white smock emerges from the Funeral Parlor.

               This is Carl Santos, Amity's part-time coroner. Santos looks 
               both ways before crossing Colonial Drive.

               Brody passes Keisel's Bicycle Rental, navigating an awkward 
               course through an odd assortment of Schwinns that line the 
               sidewalk in front of a demolished white picket fence. Keisel 
               intercepts Brody on the run.

                                     KEISEL
                              (he stares at Brody's 
                              face)
                         Wait-a-minute.
                              (stares some more)
                         Glasses, right?

               Brody nods yes, and starts to move away, but Keisel holds on 
               to him.

                                     KEISEL
                         Look at those fences! Little guys 
                         about eight to ten years old. And 
                         look at this!

               He holds up bicycle. The bicycle's spokes are bent and broken 
               from some sort of blows.

                                     KEISEL
                         They did that with their bare hands.

                                     BRODY
                         Call me later in the day, okay, Harry?

               ANGLE - AMITY GAZETTE NEWSPAPER OFFICE - PORCH

               Santos emerges with Ben Meadows, the stylish, late-thirties 
               editor of the Amity Gazette. Together they cut a beeline for 
               the other side of the street.

               ANGLE - AMITY STREET

               Past taverns and chowder shacks, past bleacher construction 
               and July Fourth posters, Brody enters Hardware and Sporting 
               Goods... so overstocked that beach umbrellas, aluminum deck 
               chairs, and rainbow beach towels splash a surplus of color 
               from the display window to the sidewalk.

               INT. HARDWARE STORE  DAY

               The store proprietor is busy at work on an inventory list 
               with a mainland delivery man.

                                     LYNWOOD
                         Stuff's no good to me in August when 
                         the Pilgrims come in June...
                              (to Brody)
                         Go on and help yourself to whatever 
                         you need, Chief. Can you work the 
                         register?

               EXT. HARDWARE STORE AND STREET - DAY

               Brody emerges with enough poster-board, wooden stakes, nails, 
               paint, and brushes to close every beach on the island. He 
               starts back the way he came when Hendricks shoots up the 
               street in the patrol jeep. He stops fast enough to call 
               attention, leans out the window.

                                     HENDRICKS
                         Polly told me to tell you there's a 
                         scout troop in Avril Bay doing the 
                         mile swim for their Merit Badges. I 
                         couldn't call them in, there's no 
                         phone out there.

                                     BRODY
                              (hands him the sign 
                              material)
                         Get out of there  take these back 
                         to the office and make up some 'Beach 
                         Closed' signs, and let Polly do the 
                         printing.

                                     HENDRICKS
                         What's the matter with my printing?

               EXT. VAUGHN'S REALTY  DAY

               Revealing Larry Vaughn, the Mayor of Amity, exchanging 
               anxieties with Ben Meadows and Coroner Santos and two other 
               city Selectmen. They come out in a group, reach the sunlight, 
               and squint down the street as Brody careens around the corner 
               and out of sight. Deputy Hendricks, laden with his arts and 
               crafts, passes them on the street front.

                                     VAUGHN
                         What have you got there, Lenny?

                                     HENDRICKS
                         We had a shark attack at South Chop 
                         this morning, Mayor. Fatal. Gotta 
                         batten down the beach.

               Vaughn and group exchange horrified looks, but we get the 
               impression it is not in response to the shark-attack news.

                                     VAUGHN
                         Who've you told this to, Lenny?

                                     HENDRICKS
                         I just found out about it -- but 
                         there's a bunch of Boy Scouts in the 
                         water a coupla miles down the coast 
                         from where we found the girl. Avril 
                         Bay, thereabouts. Chief went to dry 
                         them off.

                                     VAUGHN
                              (to Meadows)
                         Take my car, okay?
                              (to Hendricks)
                         You come with us, Lenny.

                                     HENDRICKS
                         I've got all these signs here...

                                     VAUGHN
                         C'mon, it'll give us time to think 
                         about what they're going to say.

               They all crowd into a Cadillac El Dorado with Vaughn Realty 
               signs on the doors.

               EXT. AVRIL BAY - DAY

               A flotilla of twenty exhausted Boy Scouts round a buoy that 
               marks the official course. A rowboat with Scoutmaster using 
               a bullhorn keeps pace, and urges the boys on.

                                     SCOUTMASTER
                              (bullhorn effect)
                         Let's go, Robbie. You too, Hofner. 
                         Boyle, keep your head up. Alberts, 
                         keep kicking...
                              (etc., ad lib)

               EXT. ON THE BEACH AT AVRIL BAY - DAY

               Two older Seascouts look on with stop watches and clipboards, 
               while some Parents shade their eyes from the sun, watching 
               their offspring. Brody pulls up in the Amity Police jeep, 
               and starts toward the people. Behind him, Vaughn's Cadillac 
               pulls up and skids to a stop. In it are Vaughn, Meadows, the 
               Doctor, maybe a Selectman, and Hendricks, with his arms still 
               full of sign material. Vaughn intercepts Brody, the others 
               circle around him, effectively slowing his progress through 
               the sand to the scouts.

                                     VAUGHN
                         Martin!
                              (he catches up with 
                              him)
                         Are you going to shut down the beach 
                         on your own authority?

                                     BRODY
                         Do I need any more authority?

                                     MEADOWS
                         Technically, you need the instruction 
                         of a civic ordinance, or a special 
                         meeting of the town selectmen...

                                     VAUGHN
                              (the good guy)
                         That's just going by the book. We're 
                         just a little anxious that you're 
                         rushing into something serious here. 
                         This is your first summer.

                                     BRODY
                         Now tell me something I don't know.

                                     VAUGHN
                         All I'm saying is that Amity is a 
                         summer town -- we need summer dollars, 
                         and if they can't swim here, they'll 
                         use the beaches at Cape Cod, or Long 
                         Island.

                                     BRODY
                         So we should set out a smorgasbord?

                                     MEADOWS
                         We're not even sure what it was.

                                     BRODY
                         What else could've done that?

                                     VAUGHN
                              (to Doctor)
                         Boat propeller?

                                     DOCTOR
                         I think, possibly... sure. A boating 
                         accident.

                                     VAUGHN
                         Some weekend tramp accidentally goes 
                         swimming too far, she's a little 
                         drunk, a fishing boat comes along --

                                     MEADOWS
                         Remember when Fred Ganz went 
                         scalloping in his BVD's? He was going 
                         to swim to New Bedford, he said.

               The men all laugh, ad lib their remembrances of this 
               foolishness.

                                     MEADOWS
                         ...and Bill Mayhew almost caught him 
                         in his net...?

                                     BRODY
                              (interrupting the 
                              merriment)
                         Doctor, you're the one who told me 
                         what it was!

                                     DOCTOR
                         I was wrong. We'll have to amend the 
                         report.

                                     MEADOWS
                         We never had that kind of trouble 
                         here.

                                     VAUGHN
                         I don't think you can appreciate the 
                         gut reaction people have to these 
                         things.

                                     BRODY
                         I was only reacting to what I was 
                         told.

               Brody looks out to the water where the scouts are rounding 
               another buoy on the home stretch.

                                     VAUGHN
                              (taking Brody aside)
                         It's all psychological, anyway. You 
                         yell 'Barracuda' and everyone says 
                         'huh'. You yell 'Shark' and we've 
                         got a panic on our hands. I think we 
                         all agree we don't need a panic this 
                         close to the 4th of July.

               Vaughn indicates the beach where the Scouts are flopping out 
               onto the sand, exhausted, glad to be finished.

                                     BRODY
                         I can't work in a vacuum. Why don't 
                         you make Hendricks Chief? His family's 
                         been here since the Puritans -- half 
                         this island are his cousins.

                                     VAUGHN
                         Martin, we hired the best man we 
                         could find.

               All ad lib agreement.

                                     VAUGHN
                         We need someone who isn't prejudiced 
                         by old feuds or family ties, someone 
                         who can referee things.

                                     MEADOWS
                         You have our complete support.

                                     VAUGHN
                         Now then. We've got a vandalism 
                         problem we ought to talk about...

               The others surround Brody as Vaughn leads the way back to 
               the cars, ad libbing their problem with the little karate 
               choppers.

               Hendricks puts the signs back into the trunk of Vaughn's 
               Cadillac. Vaughn waves casually to the Scouts and swimmers 
               who are vigorously toweling off in the background.

               EXT. AMITY STREET - DAY

               In front of Amity's only Music Store, a battered old pick-up 
               truck pulls in to the curb. Quint and his mate cross silently 
               heading into the music store.

               INT. AMITY MUSIC STORE - DAY

               A gently tinkling bell tolls Quint's entrance. Inside the 
               store, a ten-year-old boy is being shown a clarinet. He is 
               playing a mellow low tone, and running "Ode to Joy." Quint 
               looms past him like Neptune rising from the deep, and lets 
               his hand drop on the counter with a slap that sounds like a 
               club on flesh. The Shopkeeper abandons the little boy and 
               meets Quint.

                                     SHOPKEEPER
                         Hello, Mr. Quint.

                                     QUINT
                         Four spools of Number 12 piano wire, 
                         Okay? I ordered them.

                                     SHOPKEEPER
                              (finding them under 
                              the counter)
                         Yessir, right here. What do those 
                         fish do, eat this stuff?

                                     QUINT
                         They choke on it.

               Without waiting for it to be wrapped, he picks up the gleaming 
               wire in his gnarled fist, and drops a bill on the counter.

                                     SHOPKEEPER
                         Bye now.

               No answer from Quint, who stops and sings along with the 
               boy.

               The little kid's music degenerates into a series of awkward 
               squeaks and blurps, as Quint stares at him. Quint continues 
               out the door, threading his way through the people in the 
               street like some great fish. As he gets up into the cab of 
               his pick-up, its door swings open so we can see a crude 
               stylized shark decorating its side. It slams behind him as 
               Quint gets in and drives away.

               EXT. AMITY BEACH - DAY

               A plump jelly-bowl of a woman plunges into the ocean. There's 
               enough there to satisfy the most gluttonous shark. Buoyant, 
               joyful, she splashes away in abandon. From her, we pan off 
               to reveal other cheerful bathers enjoying that last 
               uncluttered weekend before the season starts in earnest.

               ANGLE ON THE WATERLINE

               A Man and his dog are romping at the water's edge. The Man 
               is throwing a stick out into the surf, the dog, a happy 
               retriever, is bounding into the waves after it.

               TWO YOUNG PEOPLE ON THE BEACH

               A Girl and her Boyfriend leave their blanket and run for the 
               water, playing tag, chasing each other, having a wonderful 
               time.

               ANGLE ON BIRTHDAY PARTY ON THE SAND - MARTIN AND ELLEN BRODY

               He is sitting stiffly in a beach chair, scanning the beach 
               with careful, cautious looks, eyeballing everything that's 
               going on.

               Around their particular blanket and umbrella are a number of 
               adults and their kids, the youngsters gathered to celebrate 
               Michael's birthday. Ellen is dishing out ice cream and cake 
               from a cooler chest to the raucous 10-year-olds. Michael's 
               hand is still bandaged.

                                     MAX TAFT
                              (an adult)
                         Looks like another big season. Gets 
                         worse every year.

                                     MRS. TAFT
                         And none of them from the Island. 
                         Just a lot of bother.

               Brody (and we) hear a shrill scream from the water. He 
               stretches to look past the group, to see what's happening 
               out there.

               BRODY'S POINT OF VIEW - THE WATER

               The young lady is disappearing under the water, pulled under 
               the waves by some force. She is shrieking. She pops right up 
               again riding the shoulders of her boyfriend, who pulled her 
               under. She's laughing hysterically. Brody is unamused.

               THE ADULTS

                                     BRODY
                              (to Taft)
                         What?

                                     TAFT
                         Present company excepted, but off-
                         islanders are a pain in the butt. 
                         Pardon my French.

               Ellen captures Sean, and holds him playfully, an example.

                                     ELLEN
                         What about this kid? What if he were 
                         born here. That make him an islander?

                                     TAFT
                         Just 'cause a cat has kittens in an 
                         oven, it don't make them muffins.

                                     SEAN
                         I'm not a muffin! I'm a boy!

               Brody rumples his hair and sets him off to play.

               ANGLE ON ANOTHER SMALL BOY, PLAYING ALONE

               It's Alex Kintner, and his mother, nearby, reading a novel.

               Alex is towing a funny rubber raft, and headed for the water.

                                     MRS. KINTNER
                         Alex! Alex Kintner! Where do you 
                         think you're going?

                                     ALEX
                         Water. Just once more, please?

                                     MRS. KINTNER
                         Let me see your fingers --

               He holds out his hands.

                                     MRS. KINTNER
                         They're beginning to prune. 10 minutes 
                         more.

               Alex starts for the ocean. Behind him, Michael and his gang 
               are also heading for the inviting waves. Brody is watching 
               them go, his spine rigid with tension.

               MAN AND HIS DOG

               As Alex and the boys hit the water, we see the man throwing 
               his stick into the waves, his dog swimming strongly after 
               it.

               BRODY'S POINT OF VIEW

               Out beyond the kids and the dog, the Fat Lady is bobbing 
               around, out way too far, isolated from the other swimmers.

               UNDERWATER VIEW - EXT. - DAY

               A fish's-eye view of the bathers: lots of little kicking 
               legs, rafts with tasty arms dangling in the blue, slowing 
               circling, favoring one raft (little Alex's). The Kintner 
               boy's legs and arms are kicking and paddling, producing 
               bizarre underwater vibrations of more than passing interest.  
               Dog goes by, dog-paddling along.

               ON THE BEACH

               Brody is half-rising, looking out over the water. The Fat 
               Lady is not where he remembered her. He scans the water 
               anxiously.

                                     ELLEN
                         Do you want the boys to come in? 
                         Honey, if you're worried...

               A Black Object swims across the water. It's the dog, breasting 
               against the surf.

               ANGLE ON THE WATER - BRODY'S POINT OF VIEW

               It's the Fat Lady, floating, relaxing. A black object swims 
               up to her. It's not the dog. It rears up out of the water.

               It's a man in a black bathing cap. They exchange distant 
               pleasantries, he strokes away.

               ANOTHER ANGLE - WATER

               Alex Kintner, paddling around, making boat sounds, tooting, 
               going "vroom, vroom."

               ANGLE ON THE BOY AND GIRL

               They kiss, embrace, kiss again. Strong stuff. They sink 
               beneath the waves, knotted in an embrace.

               ANGLE ON MICHAEL BRODY AND HIS FRIENDS

               He's trying to salvage a soggy piece of birthday cake, holding 
               it above the water, paddling with his other hand. The bandage 
               has come part way loose, and his cut is trailing in the water.

               BRODY AND ELLEN ON THE BEACH

               Ellen is rubbing suntan oil on his back, and he is allowing 
               himself to relax part way. His eyes still nervously scan the 
               beach in a constant surveillance. Mr. Keisel is coming out 
               of the water, toweling off vigorously, exclaiming to himself.

                                     BRODY
                              (to Keisel)
                         How's the water?

                                     KEISEL
                         Too cold. I'm going in again Labor 
                         Day. Hope we get this weather next 
                         weekend.

                                     ELLEN
                         You're very tight, y'know?
                              (digs in)
                         Right there.

                                     BRODY
                         Ow.
                              (he sees something)
                         He's gotta be more careful in the 
                         water...

               ANGLE ON THE GANG PLAYING IN THE WATER

               Michael has just been drenched. He splashes back. A big 
               waterfight ensues, the boys splashing and chopping at the 
               water, shouting battle cries and karate whoops. Alex is 
               paddling around near them, but not involved with them.

               ALONG THE WATERLINE ON THE BEACH

               The Man with the Dog is whistling into the ocean, looking 
               for his dog.

                                     DOG MAN
                         Buster! Hey, Buster! Here boy!
                              (whistles)
                         He continues to ad lib calling his 
                         dog, but there's no answer, no dog 
                         in the water.

               THE WATERFRONT

               A huge splash explodes in the water near the gang, an eruption 
               of foam and spray that stops everyone cold for a moment.  
               They stop to see who was responsible.

                                     A KID (MATHEW)
                         Hey, no fair splashing in the eyes!

               Before anyone can answer, another kid (P.J.) renews the 
               battle, whooping a karate cry, and slashing at the water 
               with his hand like a little kung-fu warrior, advancing through 
               the waves.

               CLOSE ON MATHEW, SPLASHING BACK

               He hits the water, which sprays up suspiciously pink. He 
               stares at it, surprised.

               CLOSE ON P.J.

               His hands are dripping deep pink, the red matting his hair, 
               running into his eyes. He looks down. The boys are surrounded 
               with a deep pink slick, their little bodies ringed by a 
               spreading stain of blood.

               ANGLE ON SHORE, A TOURIST AND HIS WIFE

               He's pointing frantically out to sea.

                                     TOURIST
                         Something in the water. Right there! 
                         Didn't anyone see it?

                                     WOMAN
                         There's blood in the water.

               ANGLE ON BRODY

               He leaps to his feet, nearly knocking Ellen over, and starts 
               for the water.

                                     ELLEN
                         What is it...?

               Brody is pelting towards the water. He kicks sand over an 
               annoyed Mrs. Kintner, who looks up, just in time to hear 
               Brody's bellow.

                                     BRODY
                         Michael! Sean! Out of the water. 
                         Everybody out of the water! Michael! 
                         Get out!

               His urgency communicates itself to the others. Ellen snatches 
               Sean up from where he's been playing in the sand. Other 
               parents are calling their kids, hysteria mounting. People 
               rush into the water, dragging their children and families 
               bodily out of the ocean. The first kids coming out of the 
               surf are frantically trying to wash the sticky blood off 
               their bodies. The sight of the red sends the beach into a 
               full panic.

               CLOSE ON BRODY

               He rushes into the water, up to his ankles, and suddenly 
               stops, unable to move into deeper water. He is urging Michael 
               out, holding his hands out to his son, who is slogging through 
               the surf towards his dad. He stands there immobilized by the 
               water, nervously helping people out of it onto the beach.

               ANGLE ON MICHAEL

               As he emerges from the water, Alex Kintner's raft washes in 
               behind him, ripped in half, the water pink, the foam spreading 
               the stain onto the sand as the wave breaks.

               ANGLE ON MRS. KINTNER

               Her voice rising into panic and hysteria with each unanswered 
               cry.

                                     MRS. KINTNER
                         Alex! Alex? Alex...!

               EXT - THE COUNTY COURTHOUSE AND COUNTY OFFICES - DAY

               We are looking at the closed double white front doors of the 
               building, through which we can hear a rolling boil of agitated 
               conversation. After a beat, they open to reveal Mrs. Kintner, 
               looking as though she has been visited by the wrath of God; 
               in effect, she has. Her eyes are puffy and swollen from 
               weeping, her clothing is put on and fastened awkwardly, her 
               gait is not normal. As she walks toward us, Quint enters 
               with his back to us, they pass without notice; Mrs. Kintner 
               moving out of sight, Quint leading us through the doors into 
               the town hall.

               INT. COUNTY COURTHOUSE - DAY

               A crowd of angry men and women throng the central hallway, 
               their voices a babble of confusion. Many of them are gathered 
               around a roughly lettered notice that has been posted on the 
               town's official bulletin board. It reads.

               "A $3000 BOUNTY TO THE MAN OR MEN WHO CATCH AND KILL THE 
               SHARK THAT KILLED ALEX M. KINTNER ON SUNDAY, JUNE 29, ON THE 
               AMITY TOWN BEACH."

               Vaughn and Brody are on the outskirts of the crowd, which 
               includes Meadows, some selectmen, and others.

                                     BRODY
                         Look, I've got to talk to her. This 
                         isn't a contest we want the whole 
                         country entering.

                                     MEADOWS
                         I agree. If she's going to advertise, 
                         I wouldn't recommend out-of-town 
                         papers. Amity people could take care 
                         of this.

                                     BRODY
                         I'm responsible for public safety 
                         around here...

                                     VAUGHN
                         Then go out tomorrow and make sure 
                         no one gets hurt.
                              (addressing the crowd)
                         Everybody, could I have your 
                         attention? Since this affects all of 
                         us, I suggest we move into council 
                         chambers, where there's more room...

               There is a flurry and a bustle as everyone rearranges 
               themselves and makes their way into the Amity Selectmen's 
               Council Chambers.

               INT. COUNCIL CHAMBER - DAY

               The crowd is thronging into the large room. Already in the 
               room is a solitary figure, standing all the way in the rear, 
               watching everyone as they enter. Against the back wall is a 
               large blackboard used for town business during meetings.

                                     VAUGHN
                         Well, here we all are; anyone have 
                         any special questions?

                                     DENHERDER
                         Is that $3000 bounty on the shark in 
                         cash or check?
                              (laughter from all)

                                     VAUGHN
                         That's private business between you 
                         brave fishermen and Mrs. Kintner.
                              (to Brody)
                         -- Chief --

                                     BRODY
                              (stepping in)
                         I'd like to tell you what we're doing 
                         so far. These are some of the steps 
                         I've taken as Chief of Police...

                                     MEADOWS
                              (leading the direction 
                              of the discussion)
                         What's going on with the beaches, 
                         Chief?

               All react.

                                     BRODY
                         I'll get to that in a minute. First, 
                         I plan to start our seasonal summer 
                         help early, and to use shark spotters 
                         on beaches open to the sea. I'd like 
                         cooperation from local fishermen, 
                         and I've also contacted the 
                         Oceanographic Institute over on the 
                         mainland.

                                     VAUGHN
                              (Interrupting -- sotto 
                              voice to Brody)
                         No need to involve outsiders in our 
                         business, Martin.

                                     WOMAN
                         Are you going to close the beaches?

                                     BRODY
                         Larry and I have also decided to 
                         close the beaches for a short time.

               Pandemonium. A collective nerve has been touched.

                                     VAUGHN
                         Only 24 hours!

                                     BRODY
                         I didn't agree to that!

                                     MRS. TAFT
                         That official business could take 
                         all summer!

                                     MR. KEISEL
                         Maybe it's better to close.

               Two opinions have been expressed, and the crowd takes sides 
               vociferously, ad libbing assent or dissent depending on the 
               point of view held forth.

                     THOSE IN FAVOR

                         MR. WISEMAN
                 We should make sure 
                 there is no danger.

                         MR. HASSETT
                 I didn't raise my kids to be some 
                 fish's lunch! 

                                                       THOSE OPPOSED

                                                       MRS. TAFT
                                               The motel is all I own -- 
                                               you pull the plug on this 
                                               town and I go down the 
                                               drain with it.

                                                       MR. POSNER
                                               Nobody's seen a shark.

                                                       MR. POLK
                                               We'll lose business, we 
                                               lose taxes, we lose our 
                                               shirts!

               ANGLE ON QUINT, THE MAN IN THE BACK OF THE ROOM

               He has just run his large, coarse fingernails over the 
               blackboard. He is a large, rough man, a professional fisherman 
               marked by daily physical toil, About 45 or 50, it's hard to 
               tell where the scars leave off and the wrinkles begin. There 
               is a bit of the showman in him, as well as a bit of killer-
               whale.

                                     QUINT
                              (after taking a deep 
                              breath)
                         You all know me. You know what I do 
                         for a living. I'll go out and get 
                         this bird for you. He's a bad one 
                         and it's not like goin' down the 
                         pond chasing blue-gills and tommy-
                         cods. This is a fish that can swallow 
                         a man whole. A little shakin', a 
                         little tenderizing and down ya' go.
                              (a look to Vaughn)
                         You gotta get this fellow and get 
                         him quick. If you do, it'll bring a 
                         lot of tourist business just to see 
                         him and you've got your business 
                         back on a paying basis.
                              (beat)
                         A shark of that size is no pleasure 
                         and I value my neck at a hell of a 
                         lot more'n 3,000 bucks.
                              (a deadly look)
                         I'll find him for three. But I'll 
                         kill him for ten.

               Crowd reaction.

                                     QUINT
                              (he rises up)
                         The bastard is costing you more'n 
                         that every day. Do you wanna stay 
                         alive and annee up the ten or play 
                         it cheap and be on welfare next 
                         winter.
                              (a final moment)
                         I'm gonna kill this thing... just a 
                         matter of whether I do it now -- or 
                         at the end of summer.

                                     VAUGHN
                         Thank you very much, Mr. Quint, the 
                         Selectmen will take your offer under 
                         advisement

               INT. BRODY'S STUDY AT HOME - SUNSET

               A riffly blur, color alternating with black and white. The 
               dizziness stops on a book page showing a black and white 
               rendering of eight species of shark. The banner at the top 
               of the page reads: THE KNOWN AND REPUTED MANEATERS.

               The riffling begins again, stops on a grizzly photograph of 
               scar tissue on six former shark victims. Riffling -- stop.

               Photograph of five Ichthyologists posing on wooden stools, 
               framed by the enormous jaws of a prehistoric shark from the 
               family Carcharodon charcharias.

               BRODY

               his reading glasses reflecting a stack of twelve library 
               books, all on the subject of sharks and shark attacks. The 
               door opens and Ellen enters, quietly, in respect for Brody's 
               mood.

                                     ELLEN
                         Can you stand something to eat?

                                     BRODY
                         Love a cup of tea. With lemon.

               Ellen walks past Brody to the window and looks out the window 
               which overlooks the south bay. It is the hour of dusk.

                                     ELLEN
                         Mikey loves his birthday present.

                                     BRODY
                         Where is he?

                                     ELLEN
                              (with a slight laugh)
                         He's sitting in it.

               Brody gets up, concerned, and joins her at the window.

                                     ELLEN
                         Honey. He has it tied up to the jetty 
                         with a double-knot.

               BRODY'S POINT OF VIEW

               Michael is sitting in the boat, but two of his young school 
               chums are in the water, swimming around it. Brody opens the 
               window and calls down:

                                     BRODY
                         Son! -- Out of the water now!

                                     MICHAEL
                         My boat's neat, dad!

                                     BRODY
                              (turning to Ellen)
                         I want him out of the ocean.

                                     ELLEN
                         It's three feet deep, Martin

                                     BRODY
                              (angry now)
                         Michael! Come inside!

                                     ELLEN
                         It's his birthday present, and you 
                         closed the beach, Honey. I told him 
                         not to go in the water after what 
                         happened yesterday. I don't believe 
                         he'll ever do it again.

                                     BRODY
                         I told him not to go out until he 
                         memorized the handbook and the safety 
                         safety regulations, until he was 
                         sure of himself...

               Ellen's eyes drift down to the open book, which is displaying 
               a reproduction of the famous painting "The Gulf Stream," 
               showing a black fisherman in a small dinghy similar to 
               Michael's being assaulted by the jaws of three man-eating 
               sharks, circling his boat.

                                     ELLEN
                         You heard your father! Out right 
                         now!

               SUNSET ON THE BEACH

               Hendricks and another deputy are assisting Brody. Silhouettes 
               of townspeople look on like mourners at a funeral.

               In the background some workmen are taking down the shutters 
               from a quaint summer cottage. They pause to watch the 
               declining moments of the day.

               Three Selectmen also stand watching. One of them seems to be 
               whispering bounty news to three youngish men on a nearby 
               dune.

               Sounds: Surf and hammering.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. OCEAN AND PIER - NIGHT

               Selectman Denherder and his buddy, Charlie, a professional 
               angler, row towards a tumble-down jetty that leads fifty 
               feet out into the black water.

                                     DENHERDER
                         You wanna call it a night after here?

                                     CHARLIE
                         It's only two-thirty. What, are you 
                         tired?

                                     DENHERDER
                         Yeah, Charlie, I got my second wind 
                         three nibbles back.

               Denherder hefts a bloodstained laundry bag from the 
               wheelbarrow, revealing about a hundred feet of coiled dog 
               chain and a large patched inner tube. Charlie takes out a 
               monster hook and together they push the wheelbarrow onto the 
               rickety pier that is only about five feet across.

                                     DENHERDER
                              (reaching into the 
                              bag)
                         Leg of lamb this time?

                                     CHARLIE
                         Screw lamb -- let's shoot the sirloin!

                                     DENHERDER
                              (a hyena laugh)
                         We're blowin' half the bounty on 
                         bait --

               The splintered pier sways to and fro as the men reach the 
               end and start to work. Charlie baits the hook with a massive 
               chunk of sirloin while Denherder secures the loose end of 
               chain to a skinny piling. Charlie then fastens the inner 
               tube to the chain five feet from the end of the hook.

                                     DENHERDER
                         One more after this, then I'm going 
                         home.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Set?

               Denherder tugs the chain against the piling to prove that it 
               is. Charlie heaves the bait. Splash! The inner tube follows 
               and both men eagerly watch as it floats seaward, the chain 
               playing out from the wheelbarrow.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Tide's taking it right out.

               Charlie lights his pipe and sits back against a piling. He 
               turns on his transistor radio and loops one end around a 
               fractured board. Denherder paces, bored to death.

                                     DENHERDER
                         You do this all the time, right, 
                         Charlie?

                                     CHARLIE
                         Twenty years.

                                     DENHERDER
                         I can't believe that people pay money 
                         to go fishing. This is really dumb. 
                         This isn't even relaxing... it's 
                         just boring.

               CLOSE - CHAIN IN WHEELBARROW

               Suddenly zipping out, faster and faster, as both men 
               straighten.

               Denherder is goggle-eyed.

                                     DENHERDER
                         Hey! What's this?

               The chain is coming out so fast that it begins to drag the 
               wheelbarrow to the end of the jetty. A section of chain 
               tangles around the handle and flips the entire machine into 
               the air. Both men watch dumbfounded as the inner tube, racing 
               out to sea in a wake of white water, suddenly dips under.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Look at him take it!

                                     DENHERDER
                         Do I set the goddam hook?

                                     CHARLIE
                         Let him do it! Go-go-go-go-go!

               It is then that the chain whips taut against the narrow 
               pilings.

               CLOSE - PILING

               A lineup of five decrepit 2 x 4 inch pilings SNAP with a 
               resounding CRACK.

               ANGLE - JETTY

               The end of the jetty is yanked loose. Denherder is flipped 
               like a chip over the side and into the cold night water, 
               where he manages to snag hold of a splintered timber.

               DENHERDER'S POINT OF VIEW

               The severed section of jetty, a joined platform of footboards, 
               is being dragged seaward with Charlie sitting dazed on top 
               of it, his lit pipe still going.

                                     DENHERDER
                         CHARLIE! JUMP!

               Charlie rolls into the water, sputters, turns to watch the 
               flotilla of wood draw away.

               CLOSE - CHARLIE

               looking seaward.

               CHARLIE'S POINT OF VIEW

               The end of the jetty makes a 180-degree turn and heads back 
               in his direction.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Holy Jesus Christ!

               Denherder steps up on the broken-off piling just to be out 
               of the water.

                                     DENHERDER
                         Get the hell out! Charlie! Swim!

               Charlie, inhaling terror, trying to slog to shore. The jetty 
               is getting closer. Suddenly, an enormous black fin breaks 
               water like a periscope, making course corrections as it comes 
               for Charlie.

               Denherder jumps from piling to piling, almost losing his 
               balance on his way to help Charlie. Charlie has reached the 
               last pylon toward open sea, and his hands clamber for a hold. 
               But --

               INSERT - CHARLIE'S HANDS

               The algae is too slippery, and his fingers keep sliding back.

               That's when the fin behind him seems to reach up to the sky 
               and Charlie manages, with Denherder's desperate help, to 
               make it safely to shore. The remains of the pier float belly-
               up in the inlet.

               CLOSE ON THE HARBORMASTER OF AMITY - DAY

               He is sitting on a little canvas folding chair, eating a 
               bowl of Cheerios with milk and sugar, watching a panorama of 
               ineptitude and greed unfold before his old seaman's eyes.

               The Amity Pier area is a minor madhouse: out-of-state cars 
               elbow local vehicles for parking space at the foot of the 
               dock, and a parade of bounty-hunting townspeople, islanders, 
               off-islanders, tourist, and others shout and push their way 
               onto the crowded pier, each carrying some bizarre or 
               appropriate tool for the real or imagined capture of an 
               unarmed shark of indeterminate size.

               Rods and reels, drop lines, crossbows, slingshots, harpoons, 
               shotguns, rifles, nets and tridents; every fishing supply 
               store and sporting goods house within a hundred miles has 
               been cannibalized to equip this weird array.

               ANGLE ON BRODY AND HENDRICKS ARRIVING ON THE SCENE

               Not having room to bring their police vehicle anywhere near 
               this mess, they are proceeding on foot into the confusion.

                                     HENDRICKS
                         ...So then Denherder and Charlie sat 
                         there trying to catch their breath, 
                         and figuring out how to explain to 
                         Charlie's wife what happened to her 
                         freezer full of meat.

                                     BRODY
                         That wasn't funny.

               Some of the locals greet Hendricks with occasional nods of 
               recognition, or an ad libbed "Hi, Lenny," or "Hey, Lenny."

                                     HENDRICKS
                         Mrs. Kintner must've put her ad in 
                         Field and Stream.

                                     BRODY
                         Looks more like the readers of the 
                         National Enquirer.

               ANGLE ON BOAT RENTAL - PIER

               An argument is in progress between and Out-of-Towner and the 
               Boat Rental Man.

                                     OUT-OF-TOWNER
                         You're charging me double the usual 
                         rent! I didn't come up here all the 
                         way from New Rochelle to be gouged 
                         by some Yankee Cracker!

                                     BOAT RENTAL MAN
                         Prices go up June First every year. 
                         You want a nice cheap, leaky boat, 
                         you go down to the Hamptons.
                              (he sees Brody)
                         Right, Chief?

               ANGLE LOOKING OUT TO SEA

               Making its way through the channel towards the dock is a 
               sleek, expensive runabout with the name "Fascinatin' Rhythm" 
               on the stern. It's professionally handled, and rumbles in as 
               it coasts in towards the dock area. Some other boats clear 
               the way for it, zig-zagging in the harbor, causing an annoying 
               chop.

               CLOSE ON BOAT

               Matt Hooper, a bearded, bespectacled young man with an intent 
               look, is maneuvering the vessel peering through his windscreen 
               at the ragtag collection of seafaring loonies all around 
               him.

               BACK TO DOCKSIDE

               Hendricks is mediating the argument between the two men, and 
               we can hear a plaintive "But Lenny," from the local as Brody 
               sees something that makes him move towards the other side of 
               the dock. We see him cross to a little boat built for two or 
               three that is settling low in the water as a seventh man 
               climbs in with his gear.

                                     BRODY
                         Hey! You know how many men that's 
                         supposed to hold?

                                     MAN IN BOAT (WALTER)
                         Whatever's safe, right?

                                     BRODY
                         What you got ain't safe. You take 
                         some guys off or you don't go out.

               BEN GARDNER AND HIS BOAT, FLICKA

               Matt Hooper is gliding into the dockside, and Ben throws him 
               a line to help make fast as he moors. It's a small island of 
               courtesy in an otherwise discourteous mob. Hooper nods 
               politely as he ties his boat up and steps onto the dock.

                                     HOOPER
                         Hello.

                                     GARDNER
                         Hello, back.

               He's standing near where Brody is finishing after his 
               encounter with the chummers.

               Brody approaches Ben Gardner.

                                     BRODY
                         You going out too, Ben?

                                     GARDNER
                         Might give it a try. That three 
                         thousand bounty beats working for a 
                         living.
                              (yells to his Mate)
                         We ready?

               The Mate nods "Yes" and starts to prepare to get under way.

               Ben and his Mate move away from the dock, headed towards the 
               channel and the open sea leaving Felix and Pratt to scamper 
               around the dock looking for another ride.

               ANOTHER DOCK AREA, CLOSE BY

               A particularly awkward moment between a small sailboat and a 
               couple of powerboats. The sailboat is trying to hoist sail 
               to make it away from the pier under sail, a real yachtsman's 
               conceit, since Hornblower himself probably couldn't navigate 
               through this mess. Brody, a landlubber for sure, is trying 
               to direct traffic to untangle this new mess.

                                     BRODY
                         Just back up! No, the other way! Cut 
                         it to your left! Your other left! 
                         The big boat, your front end is out 
                         way too far. Little boat, stay still!

               Amidst all this, we can hear the angry shouts of the entangled 
               crews.

                                     SKIPPER 1 (THE SAILBOAT)
                         Dammit, a vessel under sail has the 
                         right of way!

                                     SKIPPER 2 (MOTORBOAT)
                         You schmuck, you ain't under sail, 
                         you're goddam drifting!

                                     HOOPER
                              (stepping in to help)
                         Ahoy, sail! You got an oar? Well, 
                         scull it out!

                                     SAILBOAT SKIPPER
                         Tell that stinkpotter to belay!

                                     MOTORBOAT SKIPPER
                         Tell that ragsetter I'm going to 
                         poke him in the snoot!

                                     HOOPER
                         Just cast off in turn and make for 
                         the channel, OK?

                                     BRODY
                         Thanks.

               Brody starts back towards the shore, Hooper is by his side.

                                     HOOPER
                         Excuse me, I wonder if you could 
                         tell me...

               Before he can finish, Brody spots something on shore that 
               moves him to shout to his deputy.

                                     HOOPER
                              (noticing something)
                         Is that dynamite?

               Brody looks, and stops by a boat that's about to cast off.

               He holds out his hand.

                                     BRODY
                         If that's dynamite, give it here, or 
                         don't leave port.

                                     MAN
                         Aw, c'mon, it's just fireworks. Sharks 
                         like fireworks, it attracts them.

                                     BRODY
                         Hand it over.

               The man passes Brody a cigar box filled with dynamite sticks.

               Brody tucks the dynamite under his arm, and continues down 
               the pier. Hooper is still with him.

               All around them are two distinctly different breeds; the 
               quiet pros, like Ben Gardner, in well-worn, comfortable 
               clothes, with efficient, sensible gear, and the amateur 
               crazies, with all manner of weapons and impractical, silly 
               tourist clothing.

               INT. DOCK SHED - DAY

               Brody is on the phone, talking to his office, trying to get 
               Hendricks' attention. He throws a handful of washers at the 
               window.

                                     HOOPER
                         There's a fantail launch out there 
                         that won't make it beyond the 
                         breakwater.

                                     BRODY
                         You're tellin' me. I swear, this 
                         town has gone crazy.

                                     HOOPER
                         Officer, I wonder if you could tell 
                         me where I could find Chief Brody?

                                     BRODY
                         Who are you?

                                     HOOPER
                         Hooper, Matt Hooper. From the 
                         Oceanographic Institute.
                              (holds out his hand)

               EXTERIOR - OCEAN - DAY

               Ben Gardner's boat is in the lead with Gardner's shouting 
               derisive comments at the crowd headed out from land. The 
               armada is spread out and moving in a ragged circle, fifteen 
               boats in all. One man heaves cherry bombs into the water. A 
               smaller boat going in the opposite direction offers us 
               Barwood, forking spaghetti leftovers into the ocean while 
               his friend pours out a bottle of ketchup.

               A speedboat chugs by, one of the occupants reading 
               instructions aloud from a book entitled "Sharks - East Coast, 
               Vol. I."

               boatload of impoverished scallop fishermen throw a net 
               overboard, full of gaps and split ends. The professionals 
               look professional, but the landlubbers out for the $3000 
               make it impossible for everybody. Collisions are barely 
               averted.

               THE RUBE GOLDBERG ERROR

               The Out-of-Towner in a small boat is bent over in a life and

               death struggle, his rod in a tight arc. His buddy leaps across 
               to lend a hand.

               Twenty yards away in another boat the same struggle ensues.

               This time it's the overloaded boat with the poor scallop 
               fishermen. Shouts of I'M ON! DIG IN! STRIKE! Then a tangle 
               of tackle springs from the water. They have hooked each other.

               Joy turns to swearing.  Arnold Felix stands up to applaud 
               the mishap, while his buddy Pratt takes careful aim with his 
               Remington 1100 12-gauge and blasts at the tackle as if it 
               were a clay pigeon.  The tangle explodes --

               Both the Out-of-Towners and the Scallop Fisherman falls over 
               backward --

               ANGLE - HARRY'S BOAT

               Three men are aboard, one holding a rod which holds a fast 
               arc. A few yards off stern we see a triangular dorsal fin 
               crossing back and forth, struggling, jerking, the mighty 
               tail threshing. One man is screaming success, the other two 
               slapping the angler on the back.

               CLOSE - PRATT AND FELIX

               They spot it and sour.

                                     PRATT
                         Well, get over there! He ain't caught 
                         it yet!

               The owner of Pratt's boat throws it forward and Pratt removes 
               a .45 automatic from the holster of his belt. He tests it, 
               firing once in the air. As they near the scene of the 
               struggle, eleven other boats begin converging, until --

               HARRY'S BOAT

               Everyone wants to get into the act. They are attacking the

               threshing beast with all they've got. Pratt uses his 
               automatic, another blasts point blank with a shotgun. There 
               are occasional water ricochets and the bounty hunters duck 
               from time to time as bullets skip by. Finally, the shark 
               stops threshing.

               FELIX AND PRATT

               Their boat has moved close to the shark, closer than Harry's.

                                     PRATT
                              (exultant)
                         Hand me that pole! Quick!

               One of his party in the over-filled boat grabs a gaff and 
               leans out to grab the moribund shark. But Harry won't give 
               up the line, still reeling in.

                                     HARRY
                         Beat it! I hooked him!

                                     PRATT
                         How's the family, Harry?
                              (to the man with gaff)
                         Go on and do it!

                                     MAN WITH GAFF
                         We split down the middle?

               Pratt nods reluctantly. The man swings, lodges the gaff and 
               hauls the shark up onto the gunwale. A paroxysm of cheers 
               from the surrounding boats. Smoke flares are fired into the 
               air.

                                     HARRY
                              (a tug-of-war)
                         Let go my shark!

               It is a ten-foot tiger, and what a mess -- splattered with 
               bullet punctures, gashes, bleeding from several orifices. 
               But it is not dead -- it kicks back to life and threatens to 
               capsize the boat. Pratt panics and fires six times with his 
               .45. The bullets pierce the shark's head, pass through, and 
               split the fiberglass hull through which a flood of water 
               rises. Everybody stands up as the boat slips beneath them.

               INT. MORGUE - DAY

               The Amity Morgue is also the Amity Funeral Home, a Victorian 
               house that normally serves as the community's mortuary. The 
               Coroner, a professional small-town GP, is standing by as 
               Hooper is speaking into a sophisticated cassette recorder 
               with a headpiece that leaves his hands free for measurement 
               with a calibrator or calipers.

                                     BRODY
                         Let's show Mr. Hooper our accident.

               With a shrug, the Coroner slides open the drawer.

               CLOSE ON HOOPER

               He is looking down as the drawer slides past him, still matter-
               of-fact, turning on his recorder.

                                     HOOPER
                         Victim One, identified as Christine 
                         Watkins, female Caucasian...

               The sheet has just been lifted, and Hooper stares down at 
               the lump on the slab. He stops, turns off his recorder as 
               emotions wage war with his senses. Rationality wins, and he 
               turns on the recorder again.

                                     HOOPER
                         ...height and weight may only be 
                         estimated from partial remains. Torso 
                         severed in mid-thorax, eviscerated 
                         with no major organs remaining. May 
                         I have a drink of water? Right arm 
                         severed above the elbow with massive 
                         tissue loss from upper musculature. 
                         Portions of denuded bone remaining.
                              (tense, to Brody)
                         -- did you notify the coast guard?

                                     BRODY
                         No, it was local jurisdiction.

                                     HOOPER
                         Left arm, head, shoulders, sternum 
                         and portions of ribcage intact.
                              (to Brody)
                         Please don't smoke. With minor post-
                         mortem lacerations and abrasions. 
                         Bite marks indicate typical non-frenzy 
                         feeding pattern of large squali, 
                         possibly carchaninus lonimanus, or 
                         isurus glaucas. Gross tissue loss 
                         and post-mortem erosion of bite 
                         surfaces prevent detailed analysis; 
                         however, teeth and jaws of the 
                         attacking squali must be considered 
                         above average for these waters.
                              (to Brody again)
                         -- Did you go out in a boat and look 
                         around?

                                     BRODY
                         No, we just checked the beach...

                                     HOOPER
                              (turns off the recorder)
                         It wasn't an 'accident,' it wasn't a 
                         boat propeller, or a coral reef, or 
                         Jack the Ripper. It was a shark. It 
                         was a shark.

               EXT. DOCK AREA - DAY

               We open close on ugly, open shark's jaws, still oozing blood 
               and gore. As the shark is hoisted up into the air on a gin-
               pole hoist dockside, Meadows is seen passing with his 
               secretary and a photographer from the Amity Gazette. A crowd 
               of returning fishermen from the Armada and townspeople are 
               gathering around the fish as it is hoisted tail-up into the 
               classic sports fisherman's trophy shot.

                                     MEADOWS
                         Ginny, get this out on the state 
                         wire to AP and UPI in Boston and New 
                         York. Have one of them pick it up 
                         for the national and call Dave Axelrod 
                         in New York and tell him this is 
                         from me and he owes me one... let's 
                         get a picture.

               As he and the photographer turn to mob, we see Hooper and 
               Brody arriving from the morgue. Hooper immediately heads 
               towards the shark, while Brody pauses and we see a look of 
               relief and delight cross his features.

                                     HOOPER
                         Well, if one man can catch a fish in 
                         50 days, then I guess 50 of these 
                         bozos can catch a fish in one day -- 
                         beginner's luck.

                                     BRODY
                              (crossing to men around 
                              shark)
                         You did it! Did Ben Gardner catch 
                         this?

               Men ad lib "No, I caught it..." "I hooked him," etc.

                                     MEADOWS
                         Okay, everybody, I want to get a 
                         picture for the paper -- could 
                         everyone clear out of the way?

               He continues to call directions and move people out of the 
               way to set up his shot. Hooper is measuring the shark.

                                     MEADOWS
                         Could you get out of the shot, young 
                         man?

                                     HOOPER
                         Who, me? Okay...
                              (he drifts off)

               The men (Felix, Pratt, et al) get Brody to join them in the 
               shot. The whole town and the Armada fishermen all line up in 
               a classic "high school" graduating class shot with the 
               victorious fishermen kneeling in front, and the rest of the 
               Armada and Townspeople arranged behind them. Hendricks hold 
               up the "Beach Closed" sign in ironic victory.

               ANGLE SHOWING VAUGHN APPROACHING THE DOCK

               Brody spots the Mayor coming towards the dock, and detaches 
               himself from the group to join him.

                                     BRODY
                         Larry, if you'd see these clowns 
                         leave, you'd never believe they'd 
                         come back with anything. But they 
                         got him!

                                     VAUGHN
                         That's good. That's real good. Ben 
                         Meadows getting pictures for the 
                         paper.

                                     BRODY
                         Sure he is.

               HOOPER AND THE FISHERMEN

               The men who landed the monster are in a tight cluster, 
               debating something with Hooper, who is dwarfed by the big 
               beer bellies and ham-fisted hands all around him. It's 
               probable we don't even see him.

               The Men ad lib "What kind of shark is this?" "It's a shark 
               like in the movies they got sharks." "It's a man-eater, for 
               sure." "I bet it's a record-breaker," etc.

                                     HOOPER (O.S.)
                         It's a tiger shark. Very rare in 
                         these waters, and definitely a 
                         maneater.

               Hooper enters the circle, and picks up where he left off, 
               measuring the shark's teeth. Others watch him. Charlie and 
               Denherder walk over to the shark. Charlie punches it.

               BRODY AND VAUGHN

               They are walking down to the shark together.

                                     VAUGHN
                         Who's that young man?

                                     BRODY
                         Matt Hooper, the specialist they 
                         send down from the Oceanographic 
                         Institute.

                                     VAUGHN
                              (speaking to everyone)
                         I think we all owe a debt of gratitude 
                         to these men for catching this 
                         monster.

               Brody and Vaughn are by now near the circle of fishermen, 
               who are surrounding Hooper, raising their voices at him.

                         Whadya mean, 'Bite Radius?' What's 
                         that?

                                     GAFFER
                         Teeth are teeth, right?

                                     HOOPER
                         I didn't say this wasn't the shark, 
                         I just said I wasn't sure this was 
                         the one...

                                     BRODY
                         What d'ya mean?

                                     HOOPER
                         There are hundreds of different kinds 
                         of sharks; makos, blues, hammerheads, 
                         white-tips... any one of them could've 
                         attacked. Look -- shark digestion is 
                         slow. We could open this one up, and 
                         find whatever he's been eating is 
                         still inside.

                                     VAUGHN
                         That's disgusting! This is the 
                         largest, meanest, most vicious shark 
                         ever landed off Amity Island, and a 
                         known maneater!

                                     HOOPER
                         Let's just cut him open and see what's 
                         inside...

                                     BRODY
                         Why not, Larry? We could get a 
                         positive confirmation that way.

                                     VAUGHN
                         Be reasonable, boys -- this isn't 
                         the time or the place to do some 
                         kind of half-assed autopsy on a fish. 
                         Ben...

               Felix, Pratt and the others ad lib disagreement. "You're not 
               gonna cut up my trophy," etc.

                              offstage, with low 
                              intensity)
                         I am not going to stand here and 
                         watch this fish cut open and see 
                         some kid fall out on the dock.

               We see Mrs. Kintner approaching, dressed in black.

                                     VAUGHN
                              (to Brody)
                         Chief, I'll take responsibility for 
                         this. Boys, cut this ugly sonofabitch 
                         down before he stinks up the whole 
                         island. Harve, tomorrow you and Carl 
                         take him out and dump him right in 
                         the drink.

               MRS. KINTNER JOINS THE GROUP

               She seeks out Brody, and stops in front of him.

                                     MRS. KINTNER
                         Chief Brody?

               He nods, she slaps him full across the face. There is an 
               embarrassed silence. Some people leave, following a trend 
               that began with the first mention of cutting open the shark.

                                     MRS. KINTNER
                         My Alex was a beautiful little boy 
                         and you killed him. Did you know 
                         that? You knew there was a shark out 
                         there. You knew a girl got killed 
                         here last week. I just found that 
                         out. But you knew. You knew it was 
                         dangerous, but you let people go 
                         swimming anyway. You knew all those 
                         things, and still my boy is dead now 
                         and there's nothing you can do about 
                         that. My boy is dead. I wanted you 
                         to know that.

               She stops, unable to continue. Her father takes her arm and 
               leads her away. Pratt, Harry and the others trail off after 
               her. During the rest of the scene, the camera tightens in on 
               Brody to the exclusion of the others.

                                     VAUGHN
                         I'm sorry, Martin. She's in a sick, 
                         terrible state.

                                     HOOPER
                         Look, maybe this is the wrong time 
                         to pursue this, but I'm not sure...

               Before Hooper can finish, Brody's shoulders slump and he 
               goes slack.

                                     BRODY
                              (almost to himself)
                         She's right.

                                     VAUGHN
                         Let's all get out of here, this place 
                         stinks.

                                     BRODY
                         I'm going home.

               He turns and leaves abruptly, surrendering the dock to Vaughn 
               and Hooper, who eye each other with mutual dis-admiration.

               INT. BRODY HOUSE - NIGHT - DINING ROOM

               Brody and Ellen, Sean and Michael, have all finished dinner.

               Brody's plate is untouched, a virgin meatloaf. His glass, on 
               the other hand, is well used, with the remnants of a stiff 
               scotch and ice. He is staring across the table at the 
               youngest, Sean, who makes a face at him. He makes a face 
               back.

               They play this game together for a few minutes.

                                     BRODY
                         C'mere and give Daddy a kiss.

                                     SEAN
                         Why?

                                     BRODY
                         Because he needs it.

               Sean gives Daddy the kiss. Brody shoos him and Michael off 
               to bed. Ellen, who is feeling progressively more left out 
               with each passing moment, gets up abruptly and clears a few 
               dishes. Brody is not letting her into his world for the 
               moment, and it shows. There's a knock at the door.

                                     HOOPER (O.S.)
                         Martin Brody residence?

               Ellen opens the door for him.

                                     HOOPER
                         Hi. I'm Matt Hooper. If your husband 
                         is here, I'd like to talk to him.

                                     ELLEN
                         So would I. Come on in.

               Hooper enters. He's carrying a couple of bottles of wine 
               which he picked up in town. He sits down near Brody.

                                     ELLEN
                         Would you like something? Some coffee?

                                     HOOPER
                              (seeing Brody's plate)
                         Is anyone having this...?

               He starts in on it, as soon as someone has indicated "go 
               ahead."

                                     HOOPER
                         Dynamite!
                              (to Brody)
                         How was your day...?

                                     BRODY
                         Swell.

               They exchange a long look that evolves into a slightly 
               desperate, but shared laughter.

                                     HOOPER
                              (producing wine)
                         Here... one red, one white.

               They laugh some more. Ellen is again left out of it.

                                     HOOPER
                              (boning his fish)
                         Ummm. Really good.

               Brody begins stripping the foil off the wine, screwing in a 
               corkscrew, etc.

                                     ELLEN
                         My husband tells me you're in sharks.

                                     HOOPER
                         I wouldn't put it that way. But I 
                         love sharks.

                                     ELLEN
                         You love sharks?

                                     HOOPER
                         I do.
                              (he tells a story 
                              about his boyhood 
                              and a shark)
                         But you've still got a problem here, 
                         there's a shark just off the island 
                         somewhere.

                                     BRODY
                         How come you have to tell them that?

                                     ELLEN
                         Excuse me, but what are you talking 
                         about? Didn't they catch the shark 
                         this afternoon? It was on the Cape 
                         station news.

                                     HOOPER
                         They caught a shark, not the shark. 
                         Big difference. I could've proved it 
                         this afternoon, by cutting that one 
                         open and examining his stomach 
                         contents. Also, his bite was too 
                         small.

               Brody has the cork out of the wine. Pop.

                                     HOOPER
                         I was lucky to find that in town -- 
                         it's an estate bottled vintage year...

               Brody takes the fine wine, and pours it into his drink glass 
               filling the tumbler to the top with ice cubes, diluted scotch, 
               and the wine.

                                     HOOPER
                              (as Brody pours)
                         We ought to let it breathe... 
                         Whatever.

                                     BRODY
                         Let's all have a drink.

               He extends the bottle to Hooper, who politely accepts a token 
               sip. He takes some for himself, and offers some to Ellen.

                                     BRODY
                         You too, sweetheart...

                                     ELLEN
                         Thank you.

                              (toasting)
                         Here's to your husband, the only 
                         other rational man on the island. 
                         Day after tomorrow, I'll be gone, 
                         and he'll be the only one.

                                     ELLEN
                         You're leaving?

                                     ELLEN
                         Is that a boat?

                         Like those Cousteau specials on

                         I saw a show with sea otters, and a 
                         big turtle... Mikey loved it. Made 
                         me promise to get him one. Will you 
                         live on the boat?

                                     HOOPER
                         Yep.

                                     ELLEN
                         Martin hates boats. Hates the water. 
                         On the ferry to the mainland, he 
                         sits in the car the whole way over. 
                         He's got this childhood thing, there's 
                         a clinical word for it.

                                     BRODY
                         Drowning. Lemme ask you something. 
                         Is it true most attacks take place 
                         in three feet of water, around 10 
                         feet from the beach?

                                     HOOPER
                         Yeah. Like the kid on your beach.
                         I wish I could've examined that shark 
                         they caught...

                                     BRODY
                         Something else. Do most attacks go 
                         unreported?

                                     HOOPER
                         About half of them. A lot of 'missing 
                         swimmers' are really shark victims.

                                     BRODY
                         There's a kind of a lone shark, 
                         called, uh...

                                     HOOPER
                         Rogue?

                                     BRODY
                         Yeah. Rogue. Picks out an area where 
                         there's food and hangs out there as 
                         long as the food supply lasts?

                                     HOOPER
                         It's called Territoriality. It's a 
                         theory.

                                     BRODY
                         And before 1900, when people first 
                         starting swimming for recreation, 
                         before public bathing and resorts, 
                         there were very few shark attacks, 
                         cause sharks didn't know what they 
                         were missing?

                                     HOOPER
                         You could say that.

               Brody digests all this; confirmation of facts he has gleaned 
               in his newly acquired knowledge of the shark species.

               There is a long pause.

                                     BRODY
                         Why don't we have one more drink, 
                         you and I, and then we go down and 
                         cut open that old shark and see for 
                         sure what's inside him, or not.

                                     ELLEN
                         Can you do that?

                                     BRODY
                         I am Chief of Police. I can do 
                         anything I want.
                              (to Hooper)
                         You want to come?

                                     HOOPER
                         I'm flattered you should ask.

               He gets up and they both start out. Ellen watches them go.

               INT. BOAT SHED - NIGHT

               Dark, spooky shed, with shadows of boats and strange 
               silhouettes of boat parts and scaffolding. At one end, the 
               large, symmetrical bulk of the shark's carcass lies on a 
               tarp. A single dark figure is bending over the dead shark.

               The large double doors at one end of the shed squeak open, 
               and the Shadowy Figure moves abruptly away from the shark.

               The new entrants move into the shed. It is Hooper and Brody 
               and they are continuing the conversation begun in the car on 
               the way over.

               As the Shadowy Figure moves silently into a vantage point 
               against one wall, he passes through the light from a window; 
               it is Quint, and we only see him long enough to recognize 
               him as he backs against the wall.

                                     HOOPER
                         ...And it was Dartmouth Winter 
                         weekend, and she was Homecoming Queen, 
                         and I was her date; then she got 
                         into the fact that her family had 
                         more money than my family, and she 
                         was right -- her great-grandfather 
                         was in mining, and my ancestors were 
                         Yankee shipbuilders. So we broke up 
                         and I went home with some beatnik 
                         from Sarah Lawrence.

                         We always had a summer place on the 
                         water -- Newport, the Vineyard, so I 
                         figured I'd major in something I 
                         knew about. Oceanography, marine 
                         biology. It was that, or design racing 
                         yachts like my older brother. Hmmm. 
                         He we go. Up the old alimentary canal. 
                         Hold the light.

               We hear a slurp and a squish as Hooper produces a big knife 
               and dips into the shark with a major incision.

                         Chum -- blood, waste meat, fish, 
                         anything. They can sense it miles 
                         away. If he's out there, we might be

                         It's a good time, too. They're night 
                         feeders...

               EXT. ABOARD HOOPER'S BOAT - NIGHT (TANK)

               We see Brody, looking sick and nervous, holding on anxiously 
               as the "Fascinatin' Rhythm" moves slowly ahead trolling at 
               night. His glasses are already flecked with the white salt 
               of dried seawater. He is wearing a life-preserver.

               Hooper is at the wheel, a chart spread in front of him, his 
               eyes scanning the sea restlessly, checking the dials and 
               gauges in front of him as well as the electronic depth-finding 
               and "fish-finder" gear mounted in the cockpit. A green glow 
               shines from the instruments on his face. Two closed-circuit 
               TV cameras mounted below the hull flash their pictures onto 
               monitors in the dash.

               In the aisle between the seats is a large container filled 
               with unpleasant-looking bait; Hooper is long-lining for signs 
               of shark, and chumming.

                         the stretch where he's feeding, if 
                         he's still here.

               Brody, bored, tired, and slightly queasy, is trying to 
               concentrate on anything but the motion of the boat. He stares 
               at the sophisticated electronics displays.

               Hooper looks up and cuts the wheel hard, as the same time

               It's what they've just run into -- flooded to the gunwales, 
               loose debris floating around, a tangle of lines and gear 
               looking like floating garbage in the cockpit. Hooper's light 
               sweeps across it.

               Hooper cuts his engines and drifts in; he scampers out to 
               the bow of his boat and makes a line fast to the Flicka.

               INSIDE THE COCKPIT OF HOOPER'S BOAT

               The electronic display is showing increased activity, but 
               only Brody, who is clinging to a support for dear life, can 
               see the blips and hear the chatter. Hooper is leaning out to 
               look at the Flicka.

               Hooper is examining the Flicka, tying a towline to it.

               The light picks its way across the ruined boat. The rail 
               where a cleat once was is broadly scarred down to the raw 
               timber, and the heady cleat has been torn bodily out of the

               death-grip.

               Hooper goes below decks, getting into his wet suit, buckling 
               on a weighted belt, holding a mask and hot flashlight.

               fascinated by the sea like a bird facing a cobra. He is very

               UNDERWATER SEQUENCE - HOOPER

               Hooper descends in a froth of bubbles. Warily he turns a 
               full circle with his hotlight. At first we see nothing out 
               of place about the Flicka except that it is lying so low in 
               the water. But as Hooper travels the bottom looking for 
               damage, he comes across a jagged hole two-thirds of the way 
               forward.

               The hole is about the size of a basketball, and the wood 
               around it has been bashed and splintered. Hooper explores 
               the hole with his hands, then takes the knife from its sheath 
               and begins to dig at something. Whatever it is comes free in 
               his hand. As he studies his find, his light wanders upward, 
               pointing directly into the dark hole. Hooper looks up...

               bumps his head in trying to get away, seems to yell through

               roar in the ears. His mask fills with water as he flails for 
               the surface. Miscalculating, he bumps into the hull of his 
               own boat, shocked, dismayed, his system jangling with 
               adrenaline shock, his hands open, and the object he pried 
               loose from the hull drifts down and out, falling into the 
               eternity of the ocean bottom. He finally bursts through the 
               surface.

               Hooper, despite his shock and surprise, is strangely elated, 
               almost giddy with the wonder of his discovery.

                                     HOOPER
                         Jesus Christ! A Great White! Who'd 
                         believe it! We're not talking about 
                         a shark, we're talking about a Shark!

               Brody sinks weakly into a chair. Brody huddles in the stern, 
               Hooper kicks the engine in with a roar, and still a-shiver 
               with excitement, turns the boat and its grim tow back to 
               port.

               EXT. ISLAND HIGHWAY - THE BILLBOARD - DAY

               Next to the "Amity Welcomes You" billboard is a group of 
               selectmen, Vaughn, Meadows, Hendricks, and another deputy 
               standing by with paint and brushes. Brody's wagon is there, 
               along with a few other cars. Busy late afternoon traffic is 
               starting to pile up as early weekenders and curiosity seekers 
               slow down to see what's happening.

               Behind the billboard, Brody and Hooper have gotten Vaughn to 
               one side. They are making a closely reasoned presentation to 
               him.

                                     BRODY
                         There is a kind of shark called a 
                         Great White Shark that every expert 
                         in the world agrees is a maneater.

                                     HOOPER
                         You're situation here suggests that 
                         a Great White has staked out a claim 
                         in the waters around Amity Island, 
                         and that he will continue to feed 
                         here as long as there is food in the 
                         water.

                                     BRODY
                         There's no limits to where he can 
                         strike, and we've had three attacks 
                         and two deaths in the past few days. 
                         It happened like this before, in 
                         1916, when a Great White killed five 
                         swimmers at Jones Beach, in Long 
                         Island.

                         A shark's attack is stimulated by 
                         the kind of splashing and activity 
                         that occurs whenever humans go 
                         swimming -- you can't avoid it!

                         wrecked boat out there.

                         chewed up.

                         depend on the summer people for our 
                         lives, and if our beaches are closed,

                         have got to get someone to kill the 
                         shark, we need non-corrosive mesh 
                         netting, we need scientific support...

                         this thing: you can kill it, or you

               He leads Brody around to the front of the billboard, on which 
               we see that some pranksters have painted a huge shark fin in 
               the water behind the swimmer, so she looks now like a frantic 
               bather fleeing a pursuing monster.

                         stay open this weekend.

               INT. FERRY BOAT - DAY

               Two cavernous iron doors. Then a crack of vertical light as 
               six burly crewmen muscle them apart. The Amity ferry landing 
               is approaching, people in colorful outfits waiting dockside 
               for the first filled-to-capacity shuttle of the summer season 
               and --

               Bach's Little Fugue is the musical accompaniment to this 
               wholly visual montage of disembarkation. The next two minutes 
               should be treated like a "short film" taking into account 
               all of the colors, episodes, faces and behavior of a variety 
               of Americans who colonize Eastern resort communities for the 
               ninety-day season.

               Intercut with this montage is Brody's home, where Ellen, 
               Hooper and Brody are in sweaty, gritty all-out effort to 
               enlist some support. Elements in this montage include:

               A.  A train of cars trundling down the ramp, bumper to bumper.

               B.  Young Beautiful People from Princeton, Yale, NYU, wearing 
               knapsacks, toting luggage, babies riding in papoose rigs, 
               energized children, senior citizens holding hands on the 
               pedestrian ramp, a few wheelchairs.

               C.  Hooper, bent over the phone: "I know it's a long weekend, 
               could you get me his home phone number?

               D.  Sidewalk vendors hawking "Shark Killed" souvenirs, big 
               photo "Personality Posters" of the dead tiger shark hung on 
               the dock.

               E.  Brody: "You're acting senior officer? Where's Chief Petty 
               Officer Feldman? Where's the Coast Guard Executive Officer?"

               F.  Souvenir stands selling Genuine Sharks Teeth from The 
               Amity Killer Shark, Captured This Week.

               G.  Amity Cab Company, small blue Toyotas lined up with their 
               college student drivers like a bomber wing.

               H.  Hooper:  "Well then, operator, could you try him in the 
               dining room?"

               I.  Brody: "All I get is a recording. Is there some other 
               number I could try...?"

               J.  Station wagons with pale winter faces pressed anxiously 
               to the window. Cadillacs with Rear Admirals at the helm, 
               their wives with blue hair remembering the way from years 
               before.

               K.  Hooper: "When did he check out? Did he leave another 
               phone number?"

               L.  Brody: "How can I reach him in Chambers if he's not in 
               Chambers?"

               M.  Little Karate Hands breaking picket fences.

               N.  Some local delinquents about 10 or 12 years old, towing 
               behind their bicycles a little dead sand shark with signs: 
               "Amity Monster Shark." "Killed Here." 5 Cents a Hit." Etc.

               Then six blonde and tanned Coney Island meatballs descend 
               the ramp. They all wear Men's Club Lifeguard patches and 
               matching collegiate windbreakers. They scour the landing, 
               looking for someone to save.

               The boat is empty. Everybody heading inland, anticipating 
               the best Fourth of July ever. Already there is debris on the 
               docks and the cleaning crew works away at it.

               INSIDE THE FERRY

               As Bach's Little Fugue ends, the six burly crewmen lean their 
               combined weight against the Cathedral doors, closing out the 
               light and locking in the trade. The doors latch shut with a 
               resounding clang!

               ANGLE ON BRODY, NERVOUSLY WATCHING THE BEACH

               He is studying everything, trying to make sure he has it 
               covered as well as possible. He almost doesn't hear the 
               approaching roar of a small helicopter until it settles down 
               behind him, and a Flying Officer gets out, starched, pressed 
               fatigues, a flawless fatigue baseball cap, and slick dark 
               aviator's sunglasses. The Steve Canyon of Amity. He presents 
               Brody with a clipboard.

                         Martin Brody?

                         What is this?

                              understand)
                         You pay for the gas.

               Brody signs. The Officer shakes his head as Brody makes an 
               error.

                                     BRODY
                         I signed on the wrong line...

                         Just erase your signature and initial 
                         your erasure.

               Brody complies, shaking his head. The Officer snaps him a 
               salute, jogs lightly back to his idling copter, buckles in, 
               and gives Brody a "thumbs up" as he lifts off in a flurry of 
               sand and ice-cream wrappers.

               EXT. BEACH PARKING LOT - EARLY MORNING

               And this is it -- the Dawn Patrol, the only forces that the 
               frantic phone calling produced. Hendricks, and the regular 
               summer extra deputies. The lifeguards. Half a dozen state 
               troopers. Some deputies from neighboring towns, and a Coast 
               Guard ensign with a handful of regulars in work dungarees.

               Some of Hooper's friends from the institute.

               Brody and Hooper, badly in need of sleep, are watching the 
               crew straggle in. Already the first of the holiday beach-
               goers are piling out of their cars in a brightly colored 
               cascade of beach balls, umbrellas, blankets, portable bar-b-
               ques, radios, sun visors, reflectors, rafts, balls, tubes, 
               and newspapers.

               Hooper watches one such group: A Family of Ten getting out 
               of a camper-van. He watches in dismay as the family bumbles 
               onto the beach for a day of fun in the sun.

               Brody addresses his troops, such as they are.

                                     BRODY

               "When's lunch?" "I hate holidays," etc.

                                     ENSIGN
                         I want to get our lines and repellent 
                         out, so we better shove off.

               He nods to his men, who head for some Boston Whalers (or 
               similar boat with surf-riding capability) and push off into 
               the surf to patrol the swimming areas.

                                     BRODY
                              (a last caution)
                         We're all on one channel, so let's 
                         keep radio traffic to a minimum, 
                         okay?

               Everyone kind of nods acknowledgment.

                                     HOOPER
                         I hope we get some more help.

                                     BRODY
                         I wish it would rain...

               EXT. BEACH - AMUSEMENT AREA - CLOSE OF SHARK MACHINE

               In a shed near the bandstand, a half-dozen pinball and arcade 
               machines sucking quarters from holiday beach-goers. A 
               mechanical shark traverses the screen, is hit with an electric 
               harpoon and red "blood" blossoms from its side, indicating a 
               hit.

               Sounds of electronic gadgetry, people having fun. Meadows is 
               there writing it all up for the paper. A move away from the 
               screen of this particular machine reveals the arcade, the 
               parking lot, and, finally, the beginnings of the panorama of 
               the beach that July 4th has created.

               EXT. SOUTH BEACH - THE FOURTH OF JULY

               four foot surfer's swell curls and crashes on shore, 
               riderless. The broad sandy beach is a mosaic of summer color 
               as one thousand vacationers practice fun in the sun, but not 
               in the water. Hot dog stands and ice cream vendors are 
               everywhere.

               ANGLE - LIFEGUARD STATIONS

               A half-dozen lookout lofts. As many handsome lifeguards with 
               Walkie-Talkies strapped to their trunks and loud-hailers at 
               arm's reach. Bored, two of the hot dogs train their binoculars 
               on some local color.

               ANGLE ON TV MOBILE UNIT

               A TV Mobile Unit Van is setting up: cables snaking to cameras, 
               a camera with a big sports zoom sitting on the platform atop 
               the truck, a spiffy announcer-type in a blazer with his 
               station's call letters on the pocket. Inside the darkened 
               control room, we can see the pale blue squares of monitors 
               in a mosaic against one wall, facing the switcher.

               AT SEA

               Hooper is methodically patrolling in his boat. Tactically 
               flanking a three-hundred-yard apron of black repellent are 
               four small watch-boats. A tiny pleasure boat darts around 
               the repellent line. Farther out, crossing back and forth, 
               are patrol boats. To top it all off, a Coast Guard helicopter 
               hovers and patrols three hundred feet above.

               INT. TELEVISION MOBILE UNIT

               At least eight monitors, reflecting the outputs of three 
               cameras and two tape machines, as well as line, preview, and 
               effects monitors.

               MONITOR: CAMERA 1: Holding on a group of happy citizen-bathers 
               as they unpack their gear, wave to camera, run into the water.

               MONITOR: CAMERA 2: The Repellent Line, set in place by Coast 
               Guardsmen in small boats, setting out floats, dumping 
               repellent into the ocean.

               MONITOR: CAMERA 3: Close on the Bandstand, where Amity's 
               band is playing lilting patriotic airs.

               After we've seen this activity, we can take a look at what's 
               going on: the preparation of the tape segment for the six 
               o'clock news.

                                     TV DIRECTOR
                         Put 1 on the line. In five. 4. 3. 2. 
                         1. Roll.

               On the "Tape 1" and "Line" monitors, we see Vaughn being 
               interviewed by the Announcer in the blazer.

                                     ANNOUNCER
                         ...and with me is the Mayor of Amity, 
                         Lawrence Vaughn. Mr. Vaughn, how 
                         about those rumors?

                                     VAUGHN
                         How about them indeed. I'm pleased 
                         and happy to repeat the news that we 
                         have, in fact, caught and killed a 
                         large predator that supposedly injured 
                         some bathers here. As you can see, 
                         it's a beautiful day, the beaches 
                         are open, and the folks here are 
                         having a wonderful time. Amity, 
                         y'know, means 'Friendship.'

               MONITOR: CAMERA 1: As Vaughn speaks to us on the monitors, 
               the monitor for Camera 1 pans over to show a Sightseeing Bus 
               pull up in the parking area, and a horde of media vultures 
               spilling out, carrying cameras with long lenses and tripods, 
               telescopes, sunshades and parasols, all the equipment of the 
               curious and none of the equipment of the holiday bather or 
               swimmer.

               TAPE 1 AND LINE MONITORS: Close on the Announcer, Vaughn out 
               of the picture.

                                     ANNOUNCER
                         Also here today is a Marine Biologist 
                         and Research Fellow from the 
                         Oceanographic Institute, Matthew 
                         Hooper. Mr. Hooper, what've you heard?

                                     HOOPER
                         What I've heard and what I've seen 
                         are two different things. I believe 
                         there is a large Great White Shark -- 
                         Carcharodon Cacharias - in the waters 
                         off this very beach, that he has 
                         killed and that he will kill again...

               Hooper's voice fades off as someone at the mixer panel dials 
               his mike off, and brings up the Announcer's lavalier.

                                     ANNOUNCER
                              (moving into center 
                              frame)
                         And there you have it -- two different 
                         opinions, by men of good will. The 
                         holiday crowd here at Amity seems to 
                         be making up its own mind...

               The camera pans off him to a happy family headed for the 
               beach.

               MONITOR: CAMERA 3: Zooms in on the puffing face of the tuba 
               player.

               MONITOR: CAMERA 2: Brody and the Announcer.

               MONITOR: TAPE 1 and LINE: Back on the Announcer, his lips 
               moving, but his sound turned off. We hear, instead, the sound 
               from Monitor Camera 2, Brody and the same Announcer.

                                     BRODY
                         I'm sorry, I just don't have the 
                         time.

                                     TV DIRECTOR
                         Recue the machines. 2, pan off the 
                         Chief and show me some tits and ass. 
                         1, get me some cute kids. 3... see 
                         if you got a shot at the water.

               MONITORS: CAMERAS 1, 2 and 3: The cameras seek out the 
               appropriate activity as the Director calls for it.

                                     ASSISTANT DIRECTOR
                              (holds up stopwatch)
                         Mayor, 43 seconds, Biologist 45 
                         seconds. That's equal time, right?

                                     DIRECTOR
                         Right.
                              (he presses "Talkback" 
                              button to his 
                              announcer)
                         Jerry, come on in and look at this.
                              (to his headset)
                         Roll 2. In five, 4. 3. 2. 1.

               TAPE 2 - MONITOR:

               Starts showing us the assembled interview segment we've just 
               seen, starting with the Announcer's opening remarks.

                                     ANNOUNCER (V.O. MONITOR)
                         Amity Island is famed for its clear 
                         air and white sand beaches. But a 
                         cloud appeared...

               His voice is dialed under as the Announcer himself appears 
               in the control room to watch himself on the monitors.

                                     ANNOUNCER (LIVE)
                         Look at that shine on my nose. It's 
                         a beacon.

                                     DIRECTOR
                         Close enough for remote.

               As Vaughn begins his spiel again, the other monitors show us 
               the action on the beach.

                                     VAUGHN (V.O.)
                         ...I'm pleased and happy...

                                     DIRECTOR
                         Think we ought to stick around?

                                     ANNOUNCER
                         What else you got?

                                     ASSISTANT DIRECTOR
                         Teachers' strike downtown.

                                     CAMERAMAN'S VOICE (O.S.)
                         Christenson, this is Al. Union says 
                         time for Engineering Five.

                                     DIRECTOR
                         That's five minutes, guys. Coffee.

               ANGLE ON THE BEACH

               Vaughn is in his shirtsleeves, having slipped out of his 
               jacket.

               He mops his brow, and surveys the beachfront. At this moment, 
               there's nobody swimming. He approaches a familiar Selectman, 
               nods hello, and squats beside him on the sand.

                                     VAUGHN
                         Why don't you get in the water?

                                     SELECTMAN
                         I don't want to wash off my suntan 
                         lotion. I'll get a burn...

                                     VAUGHN
                              (some urgency)
                         Nobody's going in!

               On an adjoining blanket, a spirited Ruth Gordon type is 
               sitting, watching brightly as her manservant, a polished 
               Eric Harrison type, prepares some tea from a thermos.

                                     WOMAN
                         Is there nobody going in? What a 
                         shame. Arthur, should I be going in?

                                     ARTHUR (THE BUTLER)
                              (pouring tea)
                         If you'd like.

               He puts down the tea service, and leads her towards the water.

               At the edge of the sea, she stops, and he walks in.

                                     ARTHUR
                              (as he enters the 
                              waves)
                         It's very nice. Not too cold... Quite 
                         refreshing... Very pleasant....

               He ducks his head under for a final look around. His dripping 
               head rises triumphantly from the surf.

                                     ARTHUR
                         No sharks, m'lady.

               She starts into the water, he takes her parasol, escorting 
               her the rest of the way into the ocean.

                                     WOMAN
                         This is marvelous! Arthur, I want to 
                         come back to this very spot. Will 
                         you make a note of where we are?

               WIDE - ON THE BEACH

               Encouraged by the sight of the Woman and Arthur, and Vaughn's 
               quiet urgings, people begin to wander into the surf, a few 
               at first, and then a rush, as people plunge in and begin 
               enjoying the pleasures of ocean bathing. The Selectman goes 
               in, his family follows, Vaughn watches it all, beaming.

               BOAT #7

               Hendricks is on the radio while a Coast Guard spotter works 
               the sonar.

                         Over.

               Pan to the water.

               UNDERWATER

               As before, 400 pairs of enticing, yummy swimmers' legs, 
               kicking like animated hors d'oeuvres.

               INT. HELICOPTER - AERIAL VIEW

               A breathtaking view. The copter spotter looks down with naked 
               eye and binoculars.

                                     COPTER SPOTTER
                         Nothing from up here, Daisy. Over.

                         False alarm. Must be this glare.

               ANGLE - BEACH - CLOSE ON BRODY

               He is walking down the beach, threading his way through the 
               happy hordes. Meadows nods "hello."

                                     VOICES
                         Who's scared to go in! I was in! Up 
                         to your knees, yeah -- So come with 
                         me -- I'll go again.

                         Beautiful day, Chief!

               A group of youngsters playing with Michael Brody's dinghy.

               They are hauling it toward the surf.

                                     BRODY
                         Hey Mikey -- !

               Michael turns as Brody trots toward him.

                                     BRODY
                         You're not going to the ocean with 
                         that, are you son?

                                     MICHAEL
                         I'm all checked out for light surf 
                         and look at it.

                                     BRODY
                         Do me this favor just once. Use the 
                         ponds.

                                     MICHAEL
                         Dad, the ponds are for old ladies.

                                     BRODY
                         Just a favor for your old man.

                                     MICHAEL
                              (confused)
                         Sure, Dad.

               TV CREW - NEAR WATER

               TV cameramen are packing up their gear. For them it's a wrap

               REPELLENT LINE - COUNTY POLICEMAN

               Suddenly his Walkie-Talkie fizzes, and the Copter Spotter's 
               voice overloads the speaker.

                                     COPTER SPOTTER
                         Copter to Daisy! Red Four, Red Four!

               BOAT #7 - HENDRICKS

               Guns are up, heads turning everywhere.

                                     HENDRICKS
                              (into walkie-talkie)
                         Where -- ?

                                     COPTER SPOTTER
                         Went under your -- There!

               The Coast Guard sonar operator spots it and pales. A slick 
               black dorsal fin is slicing a wake toward the swimming area.

                                     SONAR OPERATOR
                         Jesus Christ -- Shark!

               BEACH - BRODY

               Rigid and choked, he almost breaks the "send" button trying 
               to transmit.

                                     BRODY
                         Everybody out! Out of the water, 
                         please -- leave the water, please --

               A lifeguard in a loft behind him begins blowing on his 
               whistle.

               CLOSE - BRODY

               shouting hysterically.

                                     BRODY
                         No whistles! No whistles!

               THE BEACH

               Dozens of bathers halfway out of the water, turn to see. 
               More whistles, and they start toward shore. We hear panicky 
               voices ad-libbing; "Shark," "Look Out," etc. The loudhailers 
               sounding more urgent now, and a contagious dread seizes one 
               person after another. Entire groups of people begin pulling 
               toward shore, some of them obviously trying to control a 
               growing hysteria in others.

               BOATS #6 AND #7

               are converging, heading toward the repellent line as if 
               tracking an underwater shadow. The fin is beyond the repellent 
               cordons and heading into the crowds.

               HOOPER'S BOAT

               Caught on the other end of the line, he is wheeling in a 
               broad, hot-dogger's circle turn, headed back.

               THE WATER - BATHERS

               People begin screaming. Kids are suddenly separated from 
               their parents. Others seem to forget how to swim. One myopic 
               little girl has her glasses bumped off and she begins to cry 
               in blinded panic. Ellen Brody looks around frantic.

               BOATS #2, #3, #4

               The riflemen in the boats are trying to get a bead, but too 
               many civilians create a hazard. The Coast Guardsmen attempt 
               to sever the repellent cord to gain access to the bathing 
               area and the heaving fin.

               THE WATER - BATHERS

               This is a confirmation of our worst dread -- a full-blown 
               headlong water panic. Screaming vacationers claw their way 
               over the bodies of the less able. Some literally attempt to 
               walk over the bobbing heads and glistening backs of others 
               pulling for dry land.

               CLOSEUPS - PANIC

               Horrified faces. Some are stunned and wandering in slow, 
               tentative circles, while others are helped out by friends.

               Five people try to mount a rubber raft.

               Ugly reminders that each of us is Number One.

               Brody enters shot, yelling into his walkie-talkie, someone 
               charges past him to help an old man out of the water.

               EXT. THE BEACH

               Dragging the helpless from the surf. Tears well in Brody's 
               eyes. The screaming is deafening. The TV unit is hopping up 
               and down in rage and frustration.

                                     TV DIRECTOR
                         Why did we wrap? Get that! Somebody 
                         get that!

               One thousand survivors pack the beach, standing absolutely 
               still. A numbing cold sets in, and people shiver against 
               each other.

               Muted sobs, whimpering, coughing.

               The six burly lifeguards huddle together like Cub Scouts.

               ANGLE - BATHING AREA

               The monstrous black fin turns a slow circle as two Coast 
               Guardsmen manage to cut their own repellent line. All boats 
               converge on the dynamic fin. Men raise their guns to fire. 
               Others adlib nautical commands in a uniquely calculated 
               fashion.

               CLOSE - FIN

               It slips sideways, revealing for the first time a tiny blue 
               snorkel. Then appears the faces of two youngsters whom we 
               will recall from the coven behind the dune. The fin bobs 
               back, a beaverboard replica attached to a partially submerged 
               surfboard. One youngster looks up and is greeted by:

               YOUNGSTER'S POINT OF VIEW

               Twenty rifles and shotguns pointed directly at him. 
               Surrounding him on three sides. Some of the policemen start 
               to lower their guns -- struck dumb.

               HOOPER IN HIS BOAT

               He throttles back suddenly, subsiding into his own wake, his 
               eyes still restlessly searching.

               CLOSE - YOUNGSTER

               his only defense, he begins to cry -- and feebly raises his 
               hands in unconditional surrender.

               ANGLE - ESTUARY

               The narrow estuary leading into the half-mile is rough today.

               Two children digging in the sand and unaware of the beach 
               panic one hundred yards away look up, and the little girl 
               points.

               BLACK DORSAL FIN

               is cruising through the narrows and toward the busy pond.

               HOOPER IN HIS BOAT AGAIN

               He sees it, and jams his throttle forward. He steers with 
               one hand, fumbling urgently for his walkie-talkie with the 
               other.

               AERIAL VIEW

               The circle of boats around the little pranksters, the crowds 
               huddled on the beach, Hooper's boat suddenly arrowing towards 
               the estuary, leaving a huge boiling wake.

               CLOSE ON VAUGHN

               He catches Hooper's boat out of the corner of his eye. 
               Curious, he follows its progress. It's urgency finally 
               communicates itself to Vaughn, who begins a shambling trot 
               across the dunes towards a rise overlooking the estuary.

               OVERLOOKING THE ESTUARY

               Vaughn gets there just in time to see the disaster. He 
               watches, helpless, trying to shout, out of breath. Stunned.

               ANGLE - POND

               Michael is tacking full-sail in his boat with a friend, Kit.

               Kit is admiring the shark's tooth necklace around his own 
               neck while Michael rubs some water on the scratches left by 
               it.

               The fin, huge, black and real, crosses behind them. They are 
               not yet aware. The fin seems to circle and return. It heads 
               toward Michael's boat when another small dinghy gets in its 
               way -- a weekend novice just finishing a thermos of coffee 
               when he is "bumped." The entire boat is overturned. Michael 
               sees the fin now as it collides with him, the entire bow 
               lifting out of the water and rolling over on the port side.

               Michael and Kit are thrown head first.

               Three heads in the water come up sputtering, the fin between 
               them crossing back. Michael freezes. The fin comes directly 
               at him, growing into the sky, passing him so close he could 
               touch it, but ignoring him as it follows the flailing and 
               panicked weekend novice. Catches him. Michael watches. That 
               all too familiar explosion of water -- a choked off scream -- 
               the head and upper torso of the novice passing Michael swiftly 
               as though being carried off -- a current of blood trailing 
               behind.

                                     THE VICTIM
                              (passing a horrified 
                              Michael, who half 
                              extends one hand, as 
                              if to help)
                         It's no good. I'm dead...
                              (and he is)

               A renewed cry of shark!

               CLOSE - BRODY

               He turns. Oh God! Running through the slogging sand.

               CLOSE - ELLEN

               A sudden turn. She runs.

               CLOSE - HOOPER IN BOAT

               He's got the walkie-talkie to his mouth.

                                     HOOPER
                         Block the estuary! The estuary!

               Three boats racing to carry out the orders. The black fin re-
               passing the two children, racing to get out. Hooper reaches 
               the mouth before the others. The fin won't veer off. It smacks 
               into the little vessel, bumping it aside. The fin is left 
               racing into open water. Blood leavings. Hooper leaping over 
               the side, slogging towards Michael.

               WIDE ON WATER

               Copter roars in buzzing the shark, but too late.

               CLOSE - BRODY AND ELLEN

               They are pulling Michael out of the water as Hooper splashes 
               up. Michael is conscious but in shock -- his eyes staring at 
               nothing.

                                     BRODY
                              (feeling his face)
                         He's in shock. Get blankets!

               People gather and Brody snatches beach towels out of their 
               hands. They cover Michael and carry him off the beach, feet 
               raised above his head.

               INT. HOSPITAL - DAY

               Michael is wheeled out in the bed. Brody and Ellen are there.

               Sean is sleepy in Brody's arms. Vaughn is waiting in the 
               hall.

                                     NURSE
                         The doctor said it's okay -- mild 
                         shock. He can come home in the 
                         morning.

                                     ELLEN
                              (to Michael)
                         Hey, big guy -- you want anything 
                         from home?

                                     MICHAEL
                         My cars. And a comic book.

                         Take him home.

                                     ELLEN
                         Home... New York?

                         No. Home here.

               Ellen exits.

                                     BRODY
                              (crossing to Vaughn)
                         Got a pen on you?

                         Why?

                                     BRODY
                         There's only one thing you're good 
                         for anymore -- signing a damn voucher. 
                         Here. It's an authorization to employ 
                         a contractor.

                                     VAUGHN
                         I don't know if I can do that without 
                         a...

                              (interrupting)
                         I'm going to hire Quint to kill the 
                         fish. I want to see that shark dead.

                                     VAUGHN
                         Maybe we can save August...

                         Forget it. This summer's had it.
                         Next summer's had it. You're the 
                         mayor of Shark City. You wanted to 
                         keep the beaches open. What happens 
                         when the town finds out about that?

                                     VAUGHN
                         I was acting in the town's best 
                         interests...

                                     BRODY
                         The best interest in this town would 
                         be to see that fish belly-up in the 
                         water with a hole in his head. You 
                         do the right thing. You authorize 
                         me.
                              (indicates paper)
                         Right there. Whatever it costs.

                                     VAUGHN
                         My kids were on that beach...

                                     BRODY
                         Just sign it, Larry.

               Vaughn signs, and Brody takes the paper and exits.

               QUINT'S HOUSE - DAY

               Brody and Hooper are approaching Quint's house. They enter 
               through the big wooden doors, into another circle of Hell.

               Smoke and steam from two big oil drums sitting over fires 
               fills the air. Quint and his mate, Herschel, are grinding 
               pieces of pilot whale into chum. The whale lies bloody on 
               the floor, its ruined carcass adding to the stench of other 
               sharks being boiled in the drums, their tails suspended in 
               the air.

               Diesel fumes and decay fill the air, and tools, ropes, broken 
               bits of iron and engine parts litter the floor. Wall hangings 
               of rope and floats, and buoys, barrels, tackle and gear all 
               conspire to frame the killing floor.

               Brody and Hooper navigate the obstacle course.

                         This has got to be one big 
                         violation...

                         Keep your hands off my stuff.

               He emerges from the steam and smoke.

                         Cash? Or do we do this on a handshake

                         And, uh, a case of apricot brandy

                                     BRODY
                         Two cases. And dinner when you land.

               Herschel interrupts. He's stopped working, and is wiping his 
               hands on a bloody rag.

               Quint wheels to face him.

                         I'm not goin'. No sir.

                         Forget the money. You can't pay me 
                         enough. I ain't crazy. I worked some 
                         big mean fish with you, but I ain't 
                         goin' on this one.

                         This is the last time I hear from 
                         you. I don't want anyone with piss 
                         for blood on my vessel. Put that 
                         blackfish on board, pump the bilges, 
                         and top off the fuel tanks, and finish 
                         up in the morning. Then you're on 
                         the beach.

               Quint turns to see this new voice, and starts walking towards 
               him.

                                     BRODY
                         This is Matt Hooper...

                         He's from the Oceanographic Institute.

                         I'm not talking about day sailing or 
                         pleasure boating. I'm talking about 
                         working for a living. Sharking.

                         And I'm not talking about hooking 
                         some poor dogfish or sand shark. I'm 
                         talking about a Great White.

                                     QUINT
                         Are you now. I know about porkers in 
                         the water --

                         Here. Tie me a sheepshank.

               Hooper ties the knot effortlessly.

                         I don't need to pass basic seamanship.

                         Let me see your hands...

               He takes Hooper's hands in his own big bloody fists, and 
               feels them as he talks.

                                     QUINT
                         Ha. City hands. You been counting 
                         money. If you had a $5000 net and 
                         $2000 worth of fish in it, and along 
                         comes Mr. White, and makes it look 
                         like a kiddy scissors class has gone 
                         to work on it and made paper dolls. 
                         If you'd ever worked for a living, 
                         you'd know what that means.

               EXT. QUINT'S DOCK - MORNING

               The Mate is loading. He hands Quint the items on his check 
               list as Quint takes them aboard.

               As he talks, we see Hooper coming down to the dock. Wheeling 
               a wagon behind him are two long-haired Research Assistants 
               from the Institute. On the wagon, among other things, is a 
               big shark cage. At dockside, Hooper checks his list, as he 
               signs for his issue.

               Brody nods, and holds her hand for a wordless moment.

                         15 years she kept her virginity. Not 
                         a bad record for this vicinity.'

               There is a sputter and roar as the Orca's diesels kick on.

                                     BRODY
                         Yo-ho-ho and a bottle of rum.

                              (hugging him)
                         What'll I tell the kids?

                                     BRODY
                         Tell 'em I went fishin'!

               They laugh together, and exchange a short, fierce kiss.

                                     QUINT
                         Cast off the bow line! Now your stern!

               Its diesels chugging, the Orca pulls away from the pier.

               Ellen has already resolutely turned her back on it, and is 
               walking off the dock back onto dry land.

               ABOARD THE ORCA

               Quint has set a course out towards the open sea. He lashes 
               the wheel, and jumps down to address Hooper and Brody, who 
               are standing together in the stern.

                                     QUINT
                              (to Brody)

                         Starboard. Aloft, Below. It's not a 
                         staircase, it's a ladder, it's not a 
                         rope, it's a line, and if you don't 
                         get it right...
                              (indicates porthole)
                         I'll throw your ass through that 
                         little round window.

               He laughs at his joke. This is probably something he tells 
               all his charters.

                                     QUINT
                         Now hear this. You're aboard the 
                         fishing vessel 'Orca,' and I'm her 
                         Captain, Master, Mate, and Owner. 
                         You'll jump when I holler. We're 
                         doin' a job here, and Christ, I ain't 
                         got time to watch you birds get hooks 
                         in your ass and fall overboard. Ship 
                         with me, and you'll do all right. 
                         Cross me, and I'll slap you upside 
                         your heads. Now -- if you boys are 
                         ready -- let's go fishin'.

               He starts moving gear around, preparing chum barrels, setting 
               hooks, Hooper gives him a hand, Brody stays out of the way.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               EXT. THE OCEAN - NOON

               It is quiet as the Orca drifts along in the current, a wide 
               chum slick spreading behind it. A couple of flag buoys spread 
               along our perspective show us the miles the boat has gone.

               Quint spots something in the water -- a small blue shark 
               attracted by the chum. He rigs a small pole with a piece of 
               bait, and throws it over the side.

                                     QUINT
                         Here's something for you...

               The shark takes the bait, Quint brutally and efficiently 
               sets the hook, and reels the shark alongside. He hauls it 
               part way out of the water, and sticks it with a gaff. Hooper 
               and Brody watch.

               INSERT - SHARK WRIGGLING ON HOOK

               Tailrope dropping on him. Gaffed and bleeding, the shark is 
               immobilized by Quint's practiced hands. He takes one of his 
               big knives and poses for a moment beside the struggling fish.

                                     QUINT
                         These greedy sons-a-bitches will eat 
                         their own guts.

               He slices into the shark's underbelly. We hear the sound of 
               entrails plopping into the water. Brody is almost retching, 
               and Hooper is just displeased.

               ANGLE ON THE WATER

               The gutted shark swimming in circles biting at its own 
               entrails.

               Fins closing in on the wounded shark.

                         Go ahead, you cannibals. Tell 'em 
                         where you got it!

               SHARK FRENZY

               A boil of water and the flash of fins and teeth as the local 
               sharks erupt in a feeding frenzy, jaws snapping, blood 
               spewing, a sudden display of the fury and blind predatory 
               drive of the fearsome species.

                                     HOOPER
                         What's that supposed to prove?

                         Just a little appetizer. I want our 
                         porker to know we're serving. I want 
                         to put some iron into that big yap...

               HOOPER AND BRODY REACT AS WE

               EXT. THE OCEAN - AFTERNOON

               The Orca is drifting in neutral. The ocean is like gelatin, 
               the sun sucking heat waves from its surface. Brody at the 
               stern, handkerchief on his head to protect from further 
               sunburn, has been handed the slimiest job on a shark hunt:  
               the ladling out of chum. There are several empty chum barrels. 
               A flag buoy bobs in the wake of the boat, another waits to 
               be tossed over the side. Brody is reeling with nausea. He 
               opens his overnight kit and takes out a handkerchief and 
               some Old Spice after-shave. He pours the after-shave into 
               the cloth, presses it to his nose. Hooper is also in the 
               stern.

                         Keep that chum line going -- we've 
                         got five good miles. Don't break it.

                                     BRODY
                         Who's driving the boat?

                         Nobody. We're drifting with the 
                         current.

                                     HOOPER
                              (using the fish finder)
                         Nothing. Nothing, nothing, nothing.

                              (to Hooper)
                         Hell, in the old days we went out 
                         with good charts, good sounding lead, 
                         and a damn good compass. Nowadays, 
                         these kids are afraid to go out 
                         without depth finders, radar, radio, 
                         electric toothbrush, every stupid 
                         thing...

               Quint opens a can of beer and drains it in one long pull, 
               crushing the empty and throwing it over the side. Hooper 
               drains his coffee from a styrofoam cup, and cracks it in his 
               hand with a silly "plup." He stows the pieces in an empty 
               chum barrel.

                                     QUINT

                         Get a fresh barrel.

               Brody goes to unlash a fresh barrel, but can't figure out 
               the knots. He finally tugs on a piece of rope, and it all 
               comes loose... barrel, shark cage, and, most important, 
               Hooper's tanks, clattering and rolling on the deck.

                         didn't go to schools in electronics.

               The men are in different positions on the boat. Hooper on 
               the flying bridge. Quint in the stern, Brody hanging over 
               the rail, puking.

               Quint takes a wide red strip of whale meat and a gnarled 
               squid from the garbage pail, and searches for a No. 2 hook 
               rig. He holds up a strip of whale.

                         situation.

               Brody shades his eyes from the white sun as Quint baits up.

                         size of a radish.

               Quint sits in the fighting chair. He casts off, murmuring as 
               the line feeds out.

                                     QUINT

               Quint at ease in his chair, Brody near him, practicing tying 
               knots. The line starts to move, a few feet at a time; both 
               men watch. Then the line whizzes off the reel. Brody jumps 
               up. Hooper springs to the deck. Quint puts his hand on the 
               drag and addresses the situation softly.

               Quint tightens drag and strikes. The line goes whizzing out.

               Brody runs to Quint's side. Hooper springs up to the flying 
               bridge.

               Brody goes to get water, the boat surges, he staggers. Brody 
               pours water on the screaming reel, nearly unspooled now.

               Hooper is turning the boat around and the line changes 
               direction.

                         Where the hell is he going?

               Quint reeling in like mad.

                                     QUINT
                         Oh, this ain't foolin' me --
                              (rod arcs down with a 
                              surge)
                         Sure -- try it!

               He ad libs brief instructions to Brody as the line rushes 
               out and there is less tension. Quint is horsing up and down, 
               reeling in.

                                     QUINT
                         Makin' believe it's easy now.

               The line is almost vertical, and Quint shows a hint of 
               bafflement. He reels in suspiciously.

                                     QUINT
                         Gettin' ready to run again -- no? 
                         No?
                              (suspicious)
                         What's he playin' here?
                              (reels in furiously, 
                              to Brody)
                         Put the gloves on!
                              (to fish)
                         Let's see who's gonna tease who now!

                                     HOOPER
                         Let it go, don't waste your time.

                                     QUINT
                              (to Hooper)
                         Down here, Hooper!

               Hooper is rushing down.

                                     HOOPER
                         I don't know what it is, but it's 
                         not a shark.

                                     QUINT
                              (bathed in sweat; 
                              hauling, reeling)
                         Look -- you may be a big Yahoo in 
                         the lab, but out here you're just 
                         supercargo, and you'll do as I say, 
                         or you can take your gear and 
                         backstroke home. Now get down here!

               The leaders show above the water line. Brody is wide-eyed, 
               waiting for that first look.

                                     BRODY
                         The wire's showing!

                                     QUINT
                              (to Brody)
                         Unbuckle me -- fast!
                              (to Hooper)
                         Grab the leader. He ain't normal, 
                         this one... they never --

                                     HOOPER
                         It's too wild, too erratic. It's a 
                         marlin or a stingray. It's a gamefish.

               Hooper snaps the rope onto the leader and holds on.

                                     QUINT
                         Watch your hands --
                              (suddenly to Brody)
                         Grab onto this!

               Before he realizes what's happening, Brody is clumsily 
               clutching at the big rod, appalled. Quint skips away for a 
               flying gaff. He picks one, turns...

               That's when the leader lashes free, sending Hooper crashing 
               backward in a serious fall, and the rod whips at Brody's 
               forehead, drawing blood. Quint snatches up the rod and reels 
               in.

               The wires have been bitten through.

                                     QUINT
                              (to Hooper)
                         A marlin, or a stingray. Huh. Don't 
                         ever tell me my business again. Get 
                         back up on the bridge.

                                     HOOPER
                              (stunned)
                         I'm okay...

                                     QUINT
                              (to Brody)
                         Fasten the pole.

                                     BRODY
                         What's the point with hooks and Lines? --

                                     QUINT
                         Don't tell me my business!
                              (to Hooper, points)
                         Quarter-mile, that way. Full throttle.

               Hooper shakes off his dizziness and obeys. Brody watches 
               Quint rig up a new leader, hook up the same bait.

                                     BRODY
                              (nursing forehead, 
                              gesturing at rod and 
                              reel)
                         How -- if they're gonna keep on 
                         breaking?

                                     QUINT
                         What I do is trick him to the surface, 
                         got that? Then I can jab him, 
                         understand?
                              (goes to flybridge, 
                              muttering)
                         Think I'm gonna haul it in as if 
                         he's a catfish, like everyone else 
                         does?

               Brody goes inside to inspect his forehead.

               ON BRIDGE - HOOPER AND QUINT

                                     QUINT
                              (suddenly, pointing)
                         Over there!

                                     HOOPER
                         What do you see?

                                     QUINT
                              (still looking)
                         At least you handle the boat all 
                         right. Stop. Here... Cut the engine.

               Hooper cuts the engines as Quint swings nimbly down. He stands 
               stock still on the main deck, motioning Brody to be silent.

               Then picking up the newly rigged rod, Quint softshoes it 
               over to the chair. About to sit down, he freezes.

               CLOSE - QUINT

               looking hard at something.

               CLOSE - BRODY

               staring, eyes widening.

               CLOSE - HOOPER

               moving in, surprised, interested, fascinated.

               THEIR COMBINED POINT OF VIEW

               We see the shark. First the fin... then the head and upper 
               jaws, ten or twenty yards off the side of the boat. It finally 
               submerges, its tail giving a final slap.

               ANGLE ON QUINT

               He puts his rod away and stares at it. And stares. And stares.

               Hooper is the first to break the silence.

                                     HOOPER
                         20 feet, if it's an inch...

                                     QUINT
                         25 feet. And three tons of him there.

               Hooper is nearly beside himself with a strange ecstasy. He 
               leaps toward his gear.

                                     QUINT
                              (quietly, to Brody)
                         I never saw one that big.

                                     BRODY
                         What do we do? Get some help? Radio 
                         in?

               Quint ignores him and moves off into the pilot house, where 
               he swiftly takes out his green case, and opens it to begin 
               to assemble something inside it. Brody is alone on the deck 
               with Hooper.

                                     BRODY
                         How're we gonna handle this?

               Hooper is contained in his own excitement. He has finally 
               come up with what he was looking for -- an expensive Nikon 
               through which he peers intently at the shark alongside. He 
               is talking half to himself as he fine-tunes the range finder 
               and focus.

               He is squeaking and bubbling in an unsuppressed emotional 
               boil.

                                     HOOPER
                              (very, very high)
                         There's a formula! Girth, about 150 
                         inches, squared, divide by 800 -- 
                         son of a bitch, they are not going 
                         to believe this! -- divide by 2000... 
                         three tons!
                              (after Quint)
                         You're right, you old fart! Three 
                         tons!
                              (ad libs ecstasy)

               CLOSE ON QUINT IN THE PILOT HOUSE

               He is assembling the Greener harpoon gun, deftly screwing on 
               the long wooden stock, the heavy steel barrel, and big shaft 
               with the wicked barbs, the frame all rigged with line. Past 
               him, on the deck, we can still see Hooper. As Quint is working 
               with the gun, the radio suddenly squawks into life.

                                     RADIO VOICE (V.O.)
                         Amity Point Light Station to Orca. 
                         This is Amity Point Light Station, 
                         to Orca...

               Quint snaps the mouthpiece to his lips.

                                     QUINT
                         Orca here.

                         Put her on.

                         This is Quint, Missus.

                                     ELLEN'S VOICE
                         I just wanted to know if you were 
                         all right... the Coast Guard let me 
                         use their radio. Is Chief Brody there?

                                     QUINT
                         He's busy.

                                     ELLEN'S VOICE
                         Well... is everything all right?

                                     QUINT
                         Just fine, Missus. We'll be back 
                         soon. Everything's fine. We haven't 
                         seen anything yet. Orca out.

               He snaps off the radio, and, for good measure, pulls the 
               plug from the power source.

               ANGLE FROM DECK

               The big shark is slicing through the water just below the 
               surface, its fin high, the big gray back glistening, the 
               teeth gleaming.

               ANGLE - INCLUDING FOREDECK

                                     HOOPER
                              (on deck)
                         Damn it! I need something in the 
                         foreground to give it some scale. 
                         Martin! Stand here! No, to your left!

               He is positioning Martin frantically, trying to include Brody, 
               the shark, and the Orca in the same frame. Quint finishes 
               with the gun, and as a final gesture, snaps an explosive 
               cartridge into the breech. He empties the box of cartridges 
               onto the table, snatches up a big handful, and drops them 
               into a pocket, and heads out on deck, bound for the bow 
               pulpit.

               ON DECK

               Quint appears with the harpoon gun. He throws one end of the 
               line to Hooper.

                                     QUINT
                         Here. Rig this to the forward keg up 
                         there.

               He indicates the barrels on the foredeck.

                                     QUINT
                              (to Brody)
                         Get up there and steer her. Follow 
                         my hand, and hold 'er steady. I've 
                         got to get a clean shot at that 
                         porker's head.

               Quint moves up toward the bow, Brody goes up to the flying 
               bridge to take the wheel, Hooper starts for the foredeck, 
               but stops to rummage in his kit, throwing gear around as he 
               desperately hunts for something.

                                     QUINT
                         Hurry up, rig the line!

               ANGLE ON HOOPER

               He finds what he's looking for. A small, powerful strobe 
               unit, waterproofed, a miniature signal beacon. He triggers 
               it, and it begins to pulse with a light we can see even in 
               the sun.

               Hooper scampers to the foredeck and begins to rig the light 
               to the first barrel, as the shark begins to surface near the 
               bow.

                                     QUINT
                              (to Brody)
                         Come to port. Watch my hand. Steady 
                         now...

               He guides Brody with hand signals. Brody tries urgently to 
               get it right, not to oversteer, to try to hold the big boat 
               with its throbbing diesels on the course that Quint is 
               indicating.

                                     QUINT
                         The line, man, the line!

               Hooper is rigging like crazy.

               FROM THE FLYING BRIDGE

               Brody steering f.g., Hooper on the foredeck with the barrels, 
               Quint leaning out over the pulpit, the gun at the ready, the 
               shark crossing inexorably in front of them.

               CLOSE ON QUINT

               Agonizing over his shot as the shark approaches, glancing 
               back to see if the line is properly rigged and Hooper is 
               clear of it.

                                     QUINT
                         Get clear, damn you!

               The shark is in position, Hooper shouts, a moment too late.

                                     HOOPER
                         Clear!

               Quint fires. The harpoon slams into the shark behind his 
               head, half-way along the back in front of the big dorsal 
               fin.

                                     QUINT
                         Jesus H. Christ On a Crutch!

               INSERT - COILED ROPE AND BARREL

               The rope snaps out in a blur of violent motion, Hooper jumps 
               back, and the barrel leaps out of its rack, pulled by the 
               line rigged to the harpoon. It bounds forward and into the 
               sea, past Quint, who is already reloading, mounting another 
               steel shaft. In the distance, the barrel bobs and skips 
               violently in the water, dragged by the shark in his merciless 
               moves.

               THE FOREDECK - QUINT

                                     QUINT
                         Now you've done it, you piss-ant. 
                         Stop and rig a goddam tinker toy to 
                         my gear. Let the bastard fight the 
                         keg for a while. He can't stay down 
                         with that on.

               Hooper, furious with himself, runs for the flying bridge to 
               take the helm from Brody.

               THE FLYING BRIDGE, BRODY AND HOOPER

               Hooper has snatched the wheel, and is ramming the throttle 
               forward as he spins the wheel in a frantic 180 degree turn.

                                     HOOPER
                              (to Quint)
                         Rig another keg! I'm bringing her 
                         around!

               His eyes dart about the ocean, looking for the barrel, as he 
               hot-dogs the ship around in a violent expression of his own 
               disgust with himself.

                                     HOOPER
                              (to himself)
                         God damn it! We had him!
                              (to Quint)
                         I'm coming about!

               He spins the wheel again, trying to make the big boat handle 
               like a formula speedster. The decks tip and the rigging sways 
               under the sudden strain. Brody is caught unaware, and tumbles 
               off his feet, sliding across the deck to fetch up against a 
               wall. the M1 Rifle is close to his hand. He stares at it.

               FROM THE FLYING BRIDGE

               Hooper is anguished, intense, trying to find the shark, 
               spinning the wheel, compounding his error, tipping the boat 
               in rolling turns as he crosses his own wake. Quint has turned 
               his back to the sea, and is in the pulpit looking up at 
               Hooper, staring at him, excluding everything else.

               As Quint folds his arms and stares at Hooper, we realize the 
               sun is going down, and it's getting dark.

                                     BRODY
                         Why don't we go in? Get another crack 
                         at him tomorrow.

                                     QUINT
                         We got a barrel on him. We can't 
                         lose him. We stay out here until we 
                         find him.

               Hooper throttles back, and the roar of the diesels subsides 
               and the boat resumes an even keel, slowly circling the ocean.

                                     BRODY
                         Let's call in -- we can radio and 
                         have a big boat here in an hour...

                                     QUINT

                         $10,000. It's my shark...

               EXT. ORCA - OPEN SEA - NIGHT

               Throttled back to slow ahead, the boat circles the water 
               endlessly, staying over the shark like an avenging angel. 
               Its running lights gleam in the night, and a glow lights the 
               interior of the pilot house. A bright strobe glints on the 
               water winking once like a firefly.

               INT. PILOT HOUSE - NIGHT

               Brody and Hooper at the table, Quint at the wheel, keeping 
               his eye on the light.

                                     QUINT
                         He's up again.

               He corrects course slightly to keep the barrel buoy in sight.

               Hooper is sitting at the table, morose. Brody is staring at 
               a couple of open cans of beans or beef stew, or some other 
               crappy rations Quint has on board. Dirty spoons stuck in the 
               open cans show us this has not been a formal dinner. Quint 
               fumbles on the chart shelf and produces some of his home 
               brew.

               He takes a pull, and hands it to Hooper, who takes a double.

               Brody touches the fresh abrasion on his forehead, where the 
               fishing rod caught him.

               Quint bends forward and pulls his hair aside to show something 
               near the crown.

                                     QUINT
                         That's not so bad. Look at this: 
                         ...St. Paddy's Day in Knocko Nolans, 
                         in Boston, where some sunovabitch 
                         winged me upside the head with a 
                         spittoon.

               Brody looks politely. Hooper stirs himself.

                                     HOOPER

                         Steve Kaplan bit me during recess.

               Quint is amused. He presents his own formidable forearm.

               Brody is fascinated. Quint and Hooper take a long pull from 
               the bottle.

                                     QUINT

                         the sweetpeas.

               He hauls up his pants leg, revealing a wicked white scar.

               He starts rolling up his own dirty pants leg.

                         just like somebody caressed me with 
                         a nutmeg grater...

               Brody is drawn into their boasting comparisons. He secretly 
               checks his own appendix scar, decides not to enter the 
               contest.

                                     HOOPER
                         I'll drink to your leg.

                         And I'll drink to yours.

               They toast each other. Brody looks around, sees the strobe 
               blink once through the darkened window.

                                     QUINT
                         Wait a minute, young fella. Look. 
                         Just look. Don't touch...

               He starts lowering his pants to reveal a place on one hip 
               where the tissue is scarred and irregular.

                                     QUINT

                         I think I can top that, Mister...

               Hooper is pulling at his shirt, trying to get it off, but 
               it's tangling its sleeves, and won't come undone.

                                     HOOPER
                         Gimme a hand, here. I got something

               Brody lends a hand. The shirt slips part way off.

                                     HOOPER

                         Ellen.

               The two men raise their mugs in a toast.

               He drinks, Hooper follows.

                         Yeah. The U.S.S. Indianapolis.
                         June 29th, 1945, three and a half 
                         minutes past midnight, two torpedoes

                         near eleven hundred men went over 
                         the side. The life boats was lashed 
                         down so tight to make the bomb run 
                         we couldn't cut a single one adrift. 
                         Not one. And there was no rafts.

                         guess some officers knew... was the 
                         bomb mission had been so secret, no 
                         distress signals was sent. What the 
                         men didn't know was that they wouldn't 
                         even list us as overdue for a week. 
                         Well, I didn't know that -- I wasn't 
                         an officer -- just as well perhaps. 
                         So some of us were dead already -- 
                         in the water -- just hangin' limp in 
                         our lifejackets. And several already 
                         bleedin'. And the three hundred or 
                         so laying on the bottom of the ocean. 
                         As the light went, the sharks came 
                         crusin'. We formed tight groups -- 
                         somewhat like squares in an old battle -- 
                         You know what I mean -- so that when 
                         one come close, the man nearest would 
                         yell and shout and pound the water 
                         and sometimes it worked and the fish 
                         turned away, but other times that 
                         shark would seem to look right at a 
                         man -- right into his eyes -- and in 
                         spite of all shoutin' and poundin' 
                         you'd hear that terrible high 
                         screamin' and the ocean would go 
                         red, then churn up as they ripped 
                         him.  Then we'd reform our little 
                         squares. By the first dawn the sharks 
                         had taken more than a hundred. Hard 
                         for me to count but more than a 
                         hundred. I don't know how many sharks. 
                         Maybe a thousand. I do know they 
                         averaged six men an hour. All kinds -- 
                         blues, makos, tigers. All kinds.
                              (Pause)
                         In the middle of the second day, 
                         some of us started to go crazy from 
                         the thirst. One fella cried out he 
                         saw a river, another claimed he saw 
                         a waterfall, some started to drink 
                         the ocean and choked on it, and some 
                         left our little groups -- our little 
                         squares -- and swam off alone lookin' 
                         for islands and the sharks always 
                         took them right away. It was mainly 
                         the young fellas that did that -- 
                         the older ones stayed where they 
                         was. That second day -- my life jacket 
                         rubbed me raw and that was more blood 
                         in the water. Oh my. On Thursday 
                         morning I bumped up against a friend 
                         of mine -- Herbie Robinson from 
                         Cleveland -- a bosun's mate -- it 
                         seemed he was asleep but when I 
                         reached over to waken him, he bobbed 
                         in the water and I saw his body upend 
                         because he'd been bitten in half 
                         beneath the waist. Well Chief, so it 
                         went on -- bombers high overhead but 
                         nobody noticin' us. Yes -- suicides, 
                         sharks, and all this goin' crazy and 
                         dyin' of thirst. Noon the fifth day, 
                         Mr. Hooper, a Lockheed Ventura swung 
                         around and came in low. Yes. He did 
                         that. Yes, that pilot saw us. And 
                         early evenin', a big fat PBY come 
                         down out of the sky and began the 
                         pickup.  That was when I was most 
                         frightened of all -- while I was 
                         waitin' for my turn. Just two and a 
                         half hours short of five days and 
                         five nights when they got to me and 
                         took me up. Eleven hundred of us 
                         went into that ocean -- three hundred 
                         and sixteen got out. Yeah. Nineteen 
                         hundred and forty five. June the 
                         29th.
                              (pause)
                         Anyway, we delivered the bomb.

               EXT. OCEAN - NIGHT

               Quint has just finished his story, and we are looking across 
               the quiet night sea to the Orca slowly circling in the night, 
               the warm light in the pilot house barely revealing the figures 
               of the three men inside, the red and green running lights 
               winking along the ship's flanks. We hear the distant boom 
               and drawn-out hoot of a whale.

               INT. ORCA PILOT HOUSE - NIGHT

                                     BRODY
                         What the hell?

                                     HOOPER
                         It's a whale out there.

               There's a brief, eerie pause. Quint breaks the silence by 
               muttering into song, which he slowly swells.

                                     QUINT
                              (singing)
                         Show me the way to go home... I'm 
                         tired and I want to go to bed. I had 
                         a little drink about an hour ago, 
                         and it went right to my head.
                              (etc.)

               Gradually, Hooper and Brody join in, and the pilothouse 
               becomes a warm cozy place.

               EXT. OCEAN

               The Orca and its song in the night. In the foreground, the 
               barrel and strobe light flash up into view, and behind them, 
               the big dorsal fin surfaces, and glides ominously towards 
               the ship.

               INT. PILOT HOUSE

               The song is continuing, and we hear the barest hint of a 
               scraping sound from the hull deep beneath the men. Quint's 
               eyes abruptly narrow as his sensitive ears are the first to 
               hear the abrasion of his ship. Things vibrate on the shelves.

               Quint stops singing, Hooper and Brody continue a duet. The 
               scraping repeats, and Hooper now senses it. He drops out of 
               the song, leaving Brody singing solo.

                                     QUINT
                              (quietly, to Hooper)
                         Start the engines.

               As Brody hears this and is about to stop singing, the boat 
               is suddenly bumped from below, and the gentle scraping turns 
               to a violent assault somewhere on the understructure of the 
               vessel. Water bubbles up into the hold. Brody starts, and 
               looks at the radio. He is about to move towards it when 
               Quint's urgent instructions stop him.

                                     QUINT
                         He's busting the shaft! Start the 
                         pump!

                                     BRODY
                         Where...?

                                     QUINT
                         The bilge pumps. There --

               He leaves Brody in the pilot house, and runs onto the deck, 
               grabbing his M-1 rifle as he goes. Brody hits a switch and 
               we hear the pumps starting.

               ANGLE ON THE ORCA

               Hooper is on the flybridge, starting the engines, but the 
               diesels sound wrong.

                                     QUINT
                         Cut the engines!

               Hooper does.

                                     HOOPER
                         Rudder bearings?

               The boat is assaulted again. Quint fires over the stern, 
               emptying a clip into the water.

                                     QUINT
                              (to Brody)
                         Get up forward! Watch for him!

               Brody moves cautiously up to the bow.

                                     QUINT
                         Keep your eyes open, Mr. Hooper!

               Hooper stands ready on the bridge, Quint pacing the stern 
               deck.

                                     QUINT
                         Nobody sleeps! Nobody.

               He jams a fresh clip into the M-1. The men scan the seas 
               around them. Quint resumes their song, louder this time, 
               more defiant.

                                     QUINT
                              (sings)
                         Show me the way to go home... I'm 
                         tired and I want to go to bed.
                              (etc.)

               Hooper and Brody join in from their respective positions.

               EXT. OCEAN, WIDE ON THE ORCA

               The men in place, singing, the water sparkling towards the 
               horizon, the stars twinkling above. The sound of a distant 
               whale in distant counterpoint.

               EXT. THE ORCA - DAWN

               Brody is at the wheel on the flying bridge, while Hooper and 
               Quint have a hatch up on the stern, and are working together 
               to repair the damaged rudder controls torn loose by the shark. 
               Hooper is bucking the steel rod, while Quint is hammering 
               away at the joint, trying to drive a new pin.

               The engine is idling. Bits of iron clutter the deck, along 
               with a few rough, outsized tools and greasy rags and gaskets.

                                     QUINT
                         More left rudder! More! Left hand 
                         down now, Chief.

               Brody tries to comply.

                                     HOOPER
                              (shifting his grip)
                         Lemme get a better angle on it. Now.

               Quint hammers again.

                                     QUINT
                         He's bent the housing. You can hear 
                         it.

               And we can. The Orca's diesels are no longer smooth. Brody 
               suddenly sees something, and points.

               BRODY'S POINT OF VIEW - THE WATER

               The barrel is surfaced directly ahead of them, just off the 
               port side. They are drifting up to it.

                                     BRODY
                         The barrel!

               The strobe light winks at them. Quint holds up a hand:  
               "Quiet!"

               Everything stops as they watch the barrel coming slowly up 
               on them.

                                     QUINT
                         It's him.

               He takes a killing lance from the rack. Hooper gets a 
               boathook.

                                     QUINT
                         He's under the keg. Careful --

               Hooper leans out gingerly, snagging the barrel with the hook.

               It bobs lightly in the water, an innocent bystander. Hooper 
               shifts his pole, takes hold of the rope, poling it in.

                                     QUINT
                              (suspicious)
                         Easy -- just want to goose him up. 
                         The minute he runs, drop it or you'll 
                         lose your hands.

               Hooper gets the line and starts hauling it up. No resistance.

               It comes easily over the transom into a coil on the deck.  
               He and Quint exchange looks.

                                     QUINT
                         Here -- gimme. I don't see what he's 
                         been doin'.

               WATER - ANGLE

               Both men are draped over the side, their chins almost touching 
               the water on the aft side. From the opposite starboard 
               direction, fully unfastened from the barrel, comes the Great 
               White. First the fin, then the conical nose and the upper 
               border of wide, grinning teeth. It knifes through the water 
               in absolute silence, propelling itself with tremendous speed 
               toward the unsuspecting men.

               CLOSE - BRODY

               His instincts shine -- as does his newly-acquired sense of 
               direction.

                                     BRODY
                              (top of his lungs)
                         Shark! Starboard!

               CLOSE - HOOPER AND QUINT

               They turn just in time, and a long spine-stretch saves them 
               from instant decapitation. The Great White passes the transom, 
               the harpoon still in its side and trailing five feet of chewed-
               off cable. It rolls on its side and looks at them as it 
               passes.

               Past the stern the huge tail lashes out, ripping the rope 
               out of Quint's hands, shearing a huge swath through the paint, 
               peeling it off like a plane, taking one of the bronze letters 
               out of "Orca." The shark begins an arc to sea, its fin cutting 
               the water, and starts circling the boat. Quint notices his 
               cut hand, palm bleeding, realizing how close he came to losing 
               it.

                                     QUINT
                              (to Hooper)
                         Haul in that rope -- it'll foul us!
                              (then to Brody on the 
                              bridge)
                         Start the engine!

               The diesels start with a terrible grinding.

                                     QUINT
                         Easy! It'll tear right out!

                                     HOOPER
                              (hauling)
                         The shaft is giving.

               Hooper slams the hatch, kicks the tools to one side, clearing 
               the deck for action once again.

                                     BRODY
                              (on bridge)
                         That's it! Radio in for help!

                                     QUINT
                         Shut up! Just pump her out!

                                     BRODY
                              (coming down off the 
                              bridge)
                         Yeah, Captain, as soon as I make a 
                         call.

               Brody heads for the radio in the pilot house.

               QUINT - CLOSE

               A perfectly terrible look comes over him. He raises up and 
               starts after Brody. Brody disappears into the cabin. Quint 
               pauses outside and sees:

               INSERT - QUINT'S LEAD-CENTERED BASEBALL BAT

               his calloused hand grabs it up fiercely.

               INT. RADIO SHACK

               Brody picks up the radio, flicking on knobs and lights on 
               the complex console.

                                     QUINT (O.S.)
                         Beg your pardon --

               ANGLE - DOORWAY

               Quint appears, silhouetted in the hot light of the door, 
               raising his bat.

                                     QUINT
                         Duty first and pleasure after --

               CLOSE - BRODY

               looking up in horror, covering his face.

               CLOSE - QUINT

               Quint brings down the bat with all the strength he can summon.

               Crash!

               Sparks fly, lights blink and go out, plastic and sections of 
               metal ricochet all over the cabin as Quint demolishes the 
               ship-to-shore radio.

               Quint takes a happy breath, winks at Brody and hands him the 
               bat.

                                     QUINT
                         Excuse me!

               Brody's adrenaline turns his fear into rage. His glasses are 
               cracked or broken by flying pieces of radio. He seizes the 
               bat, and pound the shattered radio for emphasis.

                                     BRODY
                         Some great idea! Now where are we?  
                         Some goddamn skipper you are. You're 
                         certifiable, y'know that? You're a 
                         real treat! Certifiable! Bananas!

               His tirade is interrupted by an urgent bellow from Hooper.

               CLOSE - HOOPER

               Pointing at the fin.

                                     HOOPER
                         Coming right to us!

                                     QUINT
                         No -- comin' right at us! Slow ahead, 
                         he'll hit us head on --
                              (the engine clanks)
                         Slower! Throttle back ---

               ANGLE - OVER THE BOW

                                     QUINT
                              (raising harpoon)
                         Hard to port!

               Hooper pulls the boat into a tight turn and Quint has a shot 
               at the upward rolling flank. He sinks it with careful 
               precision.

                                     QUINT
                         Try shakin' that out!

               Brody emerges from the cabin as the rope zips overboard, and 
               the barrel, changing over, catapults into the air before 
               plunging into the ocean in a cloudy splash.

                                     BRODY
                              (shouting to Quint)
                         Did you get him in the head?

                                     QUINT
                              (to Brody)
                         No! No! No!
                              (to Hooper)
                         Swing around! After him!

               ON THE FLYBRIDGE

               Hooper can see the fin racing ahead of the barrel. Diving 
               down. Up again -- Quint prepares another iron. Brody is 
               digging in his bag. He comes up with his 2" .357 service 
               revolver.

                                     QUINT
                         More gas... go to half! Get me right 
                         alongside him --

               The engine thuds and knocks.

                                     HOOPER
                              (shouting down)
                         We can't rev it up this high --

               Suddenly the barrel gongs into the side of the Orca.

                                     QUINT
                         Watch it!

               Hooper skillfully avoids the speeding rope.

                                     QUINT
                         Atta boy!

               Quint leans to one side, harpoon over his head. The Great 
               White breaks water and...

                                     QUINT
                         Take two, they're small!

               He sinks it deep. We hear shots. As the new rope whips out, 
               Brody can be seen standing on the gunwale, in regulation 
               police combat pistol stance, holding his .357 in both hands, 
               firing at the shark's head.

               Quint shakes his head in amused disbelief at this, as the 
               barrel goes over.

                                     HOOPER
                              (shouting at Brody)
                         Don't shoot him any more! He's crazy 
                         on his own blood already!

                                     BRODY
                         I can't stand here doing nothing!

                                     QUINT
                         Order in the court!

               WATER LEVEL ANGLE

               He has seen the two barrels pop to the surface.

                                     QUINT
                              (racing over)
                         Three'll do it! He's havin' trouble 
                         with two!

               He yells to Hooper and Brody as he swings behind the controls.

                                     QUINT
                         Grab yourselves a couple of poles!

               Quint steers "Slow Ahead," engine protesting, as he maneuvers 
               toward the moving barrels. Quint peers down, steering closer 
               and closer.

                                     QUINT
                         Get ready! Now snag 'em!

               Together Brody and Hooper hook a barrel-rope and hold on for 
               dear life as the shark changes course.

                                     QUINT
                         Pull in the ropes and tie 'em onto 
                         the transom -- free ride.

               Brody and Hooper pull in with all they are worth as Quint 
               helps out by wheeling in a circle. He laughs to himself, 
               enjoying the spectacle.

               CLOSE - HOOPER

               securing the rope to a cleat but allowing the barrel to hang 
               overboard. Brody ties his now-perfect bowline adjacent cleat.

               WIDE ANGLE - ORCA

               The boat is jarred violently from side to side as the 
               underwater force of the Great White jerks and heaves them to 
               and fro, up and down, side to side...

               ANGLE - HOOPER AND BRODY

               are both torn off their feet as the boat is thrust forward.

               FLYBRIDGE - QUINT

               sees the fin ahead. It is pulling the boat.

                                     QUINT
                         Get tired! That's the idea! Here's a 
                         little reverse for you!

               The shark leaps partially out of the water, and the sight is 
               both horrifying and awesome. Its jaws break water, snapping 
               at the ropes that have him snarled and frustrated.

               Quint throws the Orca into neutral and shouts down:

                                     QUINT
                         Haul in -- watch the prop!

               With that, Quint slides down to the prow, putting another 
               shaft onto his gun, finding satisfaction in its heft and 
               balance. The shark can be seen directly ahead, threshing 
               closer.

                                     QUINT
                         Now! Untie 'em! Quick! He'll tear us 
                         to pieces.

               He fires the iron, and the shark veers downward in a gushing 
               shower of spray.

               HOOPER AND BRODY

               They are trying to untie from the cleats, but both ropes are 
               stretched too taut. They jump out of the way, falling flat

               on the deck as the ropes sweep over them, knocking over 
               objects, skeetering across the deck. A tight jerking motion, 
               and the Orca is dragged through the water -- backwards. And 
               much too fast. Water is splashing up over the transom in its 
               backward wake. The engines groan and complain.

                                     QUINT
                         Damn head is too far away. He's too 
                         big.

               Wrenched to one side, Quint is knocked from his feet.

               CLOSE - THE TWO CLEATS

               A moment of slackness, and then a great surge of raw strength.

               The rope snaps the cleats off, screws and splintered wood 
               spraying -- and the barrels fly over the water. They disappear 
               beneath the turbulent grey surface.

               The three men, breathing heavily, bruised and pouring sweat, 
               look out at the blank water.

               ANGLE - OCEAN

               Pop -- pop -- pop. One, two, three, the barrels surface -- 
               ready for more.

                                     QUINT
                              (amazed at the shark's 
                              strength)
                         He can't go so deep. Not with all 
                         those on him.

               Brody looks down at his feet. There is salt water up to their 
               shoe tops.

                                     BRODY
                         What about us?

                                     QUINT
                              (mentally assessing 
                              the damage)
                         Have to pump her steady, s'all.

               The barrels start a wide circle, each cuts through the water, 
               pushing a wave before it and leaving a wake behind.

                                     QUINT
                              (to Hooper)
                         Follow him --
                              (to Brody)
                         You start pumpin' out here.

               Quint tosses Brody the hand pump, then picks up his M-1, and 
               checks the load.

                                     HOOPER (O.S.)
                              (on bridge)
                         He's heading under -- !

                              (incredulously)
                         No way! He can't!

               ANGLE - OCEAN

               The barrels approaching the Orca dip below the surface, one -- 
               two -- three.

                                     BRODY
                         Where'd he go?

               Brody looks around. Hooper on the flying bridge searching in 
               all directions. Quint is looking more appalled every second.

                                     QUINT
                              (helplessly)
                         He can't stay down with three barrels 
                         on him! Where is he?!

                                     BRODY
                         Have you ever had one do this?

                                     QUINT
                              (and he means this)
                         No!

               Booming thud at the keel. Brody slides on the wet deck and 
               Quint loses his footing, falling into Brody's arms.

               WITH HOOPER ON THE FLY BRIDGE

               It seems the only place out of reach of the shark. Quint 
               climbs up, Brody following him, reloading his pistol.

               Just then, the barrels pop up ahead, veer left, and duck 
               under.

                                     QUINT
                         Follow him!

                                     HOOPER
                         He's under!

               BRODY AND HIS POINT OF VIEW

                                     BRODY
                         There!
                              (points wildly)

               The barrels have surfaced and we see the monster shadow 
               sliding under the Orca, seemingly endless. Violent scraping 
               sounds.

                                     BRODY
                         He's trying to sink us!

                                     QUINT
                              (to Hooper)
                         Dead astern! Zig-zag!

               Quint is grimly silent. Brody senses that Quint is in the 
               fight of (and for) his life.

               The Orca taking evasive action. But the three barrels are 
               closing the gap, the engines coughing and missing, destroying 
               themselves with every rotation of the damaged shaft.

                         BRODY
                 He's chasing us! I 
                 don't believe it. 

                                                       QUINT
                                               Full throttle! To port!

               ANGLE ON THE BRIDGE

               Hooper is jamming the throttle forward, but the engine is 
               pounding and knocking wildly. The barrels circle and move 
               in. Quint has his rifle ready.

                                     HOOPER
                              (suddenly giving Quint 
                              the wheel)
                         Hold her.

               He leaps to his gear, trying desperately to get his dart 
               gun.

               Just then, the shark attacks, breaking water and rising over 
               the boat like a rocket; snout, jaws, pectoral fins, belly, 
               falling sideways. A vast spray drenches the men. Quint fires 
               into the belly, the bullets pocking the smooth whiteness.

                                     HOOPER
                              (loading)
                         Keep him there! Keep him!

               The Orca shudders from side to side. From Hooper's point of 
               view we can the shark gripping the transom in his jaws, 
               shaking the boat as he saws his massive head from side to 
               side, trying to tear a chunk out of the very hull. Quint has 
               reloaded and is firing into the fish. Brody has a wicked 
               pointed gaff, and is swinging wildly at the snout, gashing 
               and gouging it, trying for the eyes. The killing lust is on 
               all three men.

                                     QUINT
                         Throttling back!

               The boat surges, the shark gives a final unbalances wrench, 
               and disengages. The dorsal fin circles off, beginning a wide 
               loop around the boat.

               The engine quivers and dies, the boat without power, rolling 
               half awash, a wounded victim.

               The fin dips, the barrels follow, the shark disappears beneath 
               the waves. There is complete silence.

               THE THREE MEN ON DECK

               In the dead quiet, we can hear the lap of waves against the 
               hull, the hoarse panting breathing of the men, the pings and 
               pops of the cooling, dying engines.

               QUINT AND THE TRANSOM

               He eyes the stern. Huge cracks and broken timber testify to 
               the fury of the attack.

                                     QUINT
                              (very quietly, to 
                              Hooper)
                         What can that gun of yours do?

                                     HOOPER
                         Power head with 20 ccs of strychnine 
                         nitrate. If I can hit him. I can 
                         kill him. But I gotta be close.  
                         Very close.

                                     BRODY
                              (the awful realization)
                         You gotta go in the water...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               ON DECK, LATER

               Quint and Hooper are assembling the shark cage, its shiny 
               bars the only undamaged things on deck. Brody is working 
               too, bolting the sections together.

                                     HOOPER
                              (in command now)
                         Rig the cable to the roof eyebolts.

               The men are speaking in near whispers, quiet in the silence 
               that surrounds them. Hooper is in his wet suit, adjusting 
               weights, mask, tanks, etc. The cage is standing in the stern.

               Quint runs a line from the gin pole to the roof section.

               Hooper climbs in though the top.

                                     HOOPER
                         Take me up.

               Brody cranks the winch, hoisting cage and Hooper into the 
               air. Quint balances the gin pole lines, Hooper crouching in 
               the cage, examining it for stresses; satisfied, he holds out 
               his hand. Quint puts the spear gun into it.

               CLOSE ON HOOPER IN THE CAGE

               He examines his weapon, checking the power load, with the 
               big wicked-looking syringe head uncapped to reveal its razor 
               point.

                                     HOOPER
                         Lower away, Chief.
                              (then, to Quint)
                         Try and keep him off me till I'm 
                         under.

               Hooper inside, looking out the bars of the cage, gives Brody 
               a reassuring smile, then pops his mouthpiece between his 
               teeth and checks his regulator. Brody steps back, and with 
               Quint guiding the cage, begins lowering it off the gin pole 
               boom arm into the sea alongside the boat.

               Brody and Hooper stare at each another as their faces pass, 
               Hooper sliding down into the cold grey ocean.

               As Hooper disappears beneath the surface, Quint and Brody 
               exchange a long look between them.

               UNDERWATER - CAGE

               HOOPER'S POINT OF VIEW

               Submerging. The sky, horizon, water line, clean fresh sea 
               air then... the magnificent innerspaces, with bubbles 
               sparkling in front of us.

               ANGLE - HOOPER IN THE CAGE

               as he floats to twenty feet Hooper never stops looking around 
               360 degrees. He removes the rubber guard from the needle and 
               waits.

               EXT. THE SURFACE - BRODY AND QUINT

               Their turning heads tell us that the barrels are still 
               circling.

               Suddenly, both heads stop turning.

               THE SEA

               The barrels have come to a stop. Delicately, they change 
               course and meander toward the lowered cage.

               UNDERWATER - HOOPER

               His back is to us. He is just now completing a visual sweep 
               and turns, eyes front into closeup and: fixes wildly on 
               something monstrous... and fascinating.

               HOOPER'S POINT OF VIEW

               The water is clear and shafts of sunlight streak downward in 
               the blue. From the deep gloom -- diving slowly, smoothly -- 
               comes the shark. It moves with no apparent effort, sinuous 
               beyond comparison. As it nears the cage, it turns, and its 
               ghastly length passes right in front of him: first the snout, 
               then the jaw, slack and smiling, then the black eye.

               Hooper tentatively reaches out. It is too far for the 
               strychnine pole. The vinyl flesh is pocked with bullet holes, 
               iron scars, gaffing hooks and strange open wounds that tinge 
               the passing currents with pink.

               SURFACE

               The trailing barrels gong and scratch the keel of the Orca 
               above. Brody and Quint leap back.

               HOOPER - CLOSE

               The shark has vanished into a cloud of rising silt. Hooper, 
               expecting the shark to attack out of that same general 
               direction, braces himself, pole extended through the bars, 
               breathing faster, straining his eyes into the gloom and... 
               we see that the shark attacking from behind him.

               The cage is sent careening. Hooper grabs the bars for dear 
               life. The shark has grabbed the steel struts in its brutal 
               jaws, shaking the cage relentlessly from side to side, bending 
               the bars like clothes hangers. Hooper can't turn the pointed 
               end of the pole around, his body jammed as far away from the 
               non-rational attacker as possible.

               Hooper is trapped.

               The shark withdraws to get some running room then charges 
               again. The bleeding snout thrust deeper into the yawing bars, 
               the jaws snapping and twisting, two feet from Hooper's torso, 
               the tail thrusting it forward. Hooper drops the strychnine 
               pole between the bars and it tumbles slowly toward rapture 
               depth.

               All the shark needs is one more good thrust before separating 
               Hooper at the waistline. Through frantic bubbles Hooper 
               fumbles with the overhead hatch cover, kicking up and out of 
               the cage. The shark backpedals with its tail, but the broad 
               head won't shake loose.

               Hooper rushes downwards, after the strychnine pole.

               ANGLE - SHARK

               The shark twists free of the cage and arrows downward after 
               Hooper.

               Hooper nearly recovers the pole. Again it slips from his 
               frightened grasp and this time disappears into a narrow abyss.  
               Hooper turns and looks up.

               The Great White is lunging at him, twenty feet above.

               SURFACE

               One of the barrel ropes snakes around the cage rope and pulls 
               taut.

               HOOPER - DEEP

               Turning to meet the monster which -- though held back for a 
               moment by the snarled rope -- now surges forward.

               SURFACE - BRODY AND QUINT

               The Orca is listing dangerously aft, the ginpole bent almost 
               to the breaking point. Brody is in a frenzy trying to haul 
               up the cage. Quint attaches the end of Brody's rope to a 
               hand-winch. The ginpole is splitting.

                                     QUINT
                         Let go of it!

               The pole gives way, the rope whipping down on the gunwale... 
               the pulling of the tonnage below is tipping the Orca, dragging 
               it, but Quint won't give up the winch. Brody hauls on the 
               rope barehanded.

               UNDERWATER - HOOPER

               maneuvering downward, away from the jaws... Suddenly the 
               crazed shark veers upward for the surface.

               SURFACE - QUINT

               The winch is working faster now, Quint demonically winding 
               it in. The crushed cage bangs against the hull then breaks 
               water.

               Brody is horrified. The cage is empty!

                         QUINT
                    (a horrible scream)
                 He's comin' up -- !

                                                       BRODY
                                               He's taken him!

               MASTER ANGLE

               The shark breaks water right beside the Orca, rising with a 
               great whooshing noise. It rises vertically, towering overhead, 
               blocking out the sun. The pectoral fins seem to reach forward.  
               The shark, in all of its monstrous glory, falls onto the 
               stern of the boat with a shattering crash, narrowly missing 
               Quint and Brody. It drives the stern underwater, the ocean 
               pours in over the transom. The jaws snap from side to side.  
               Brody flounders backwards away from it.

               CLOSE - BRODY

               He is clinging to the mast for dear life, as the ship begins 
               to tilt to stern, and everything starts to break loose around 
               him.

               NIGHTMARE ANGLE - DECK OF THE ORCA

               The giant jaws are snapping irresistibly at everything: great 
               chunks of wood torn out of the deck and superstructure.

               Deck chair, irons, rope, gear, beercans, bottles, Brody's 
               bag, all are food for the insatiable maw blindly churning 
               away.

               Quint is clinging next to a rack of lances: he is enraged at 
               this ultimate violation of his territory. He snatches up a 
               lance and hurls himself at the shark with a wordless bellow.

               The great head weaves side to side, the deck is at a 
               treacherous incline, slippery with blood and seawater. Quint's 
               footing falters and slips, he stumbles at the Mouth of Hell, 
               the big teeth seize him and snap.

               Quint's roar of rage and pain is choked off as his body is 
               clamped between the grinding, sawing teeth, and his head and 
               legs suddenly contort as the shark's teeth meet across his 
               torso. Blood gushes onto the deck. The remnants of his body 
               tumble from the shark's mouth.

               Brody sees the horror, hears the screams -- in his 
               desperation, he tears loose one of Hooper's remaining air 
               tanks, and hurls it at the monster. It tumbles into the bloody 
               well, wedging across the back of the mouth, the thick steel 
               blocking the cruel jaws.

               The shark's head shakes even more violently, trying to clear 
               the cold iron, but the tank is in to stay.

               DECK OF THE ORCA, LISTING BADLY

               To avoid sliding into the jaws, Brody scrambles on the titling 
               deck, bracing himself in the cabin door to avoid pitching 
               down into the bloody mouth. He fights his way into the cabin, 
               already a shambles.

               Below him, on the deck, the shark lunges again, shifting 
               weight so that the boat in now stern down, and listing to 
               the side. Water from the sea pours into the cabin.

               Another lunge by the shark. The huge snout and jaws slam up 
               against the doorframe, blocking escape, bloody, gnashing.

               More seawater. To stay in the cabin is to go down with the 
               ship.

               Brody clambers as far from the shark as he can, against the 
               forward wall of the pilothouse. He sees the window Hooper 
               used before. It's blocked by barrels and debris. He breaks 
               the side window highest above the water, edges out onto the 
               battered bridge.

               The shark rolls around, now half in the water. The ship is 
               sinking, the sea is not a viable alternative. Brody climbs 
               up into the flying bridge.

               The shark is still lunging and snapping. Brody is forced to 
               climb higher and higher as the ship slowly sinks beneath 
               him.

               CLOSE - BRODY

               He scrambles for his life onto the flying bridge, sees the M-
               1 stuck there, seizes it.

               OVER BRODY, LOOKING DOWN AT THE STERN

               He is bracing himself, aiming the rifle, taking a bead on 
               the steel tanks, silver gleaming in the bloody shark's mouth.  
               He fires. And fires. Bullets shatter the shark's teeth, 
               punching holes in the dripping snout.

               WIDE ON THE ORCA  EXPLOSION

               With a muffled boom, the perfect symmetry of the shark is 
               suddenly blown apart in a geyser of steel and blood as Brody's 
               shot hits the pressurized tank. A 30-foot cloud of water, 
               steel, shark and debris covers the sky.

               A gigantic convulsion hurls the Great White's mangled body 
               into the sea. The Orca slowly begins to turn over in its 
               death roll.

               UNDERWATER

               The shark's carcass floating down in a cloud of blood and 
               debris.

               A shadow clouds the waters, and the Orca's mass begins to 
               slip into the frame.

               CLOSE - HOOPER

               Emerging from beneath the surface, he raises his mask, spits 
               out his mouthpiece and kicks toward Brody.

               SURFACE - BRODY AND HOOPER

               Brody is holding onto a cushion, barely afloat, relieved the 
               shark is dead, yet stunned to see Hooper is still alive. The 
               two men share weak laughter, which soon trails off.

                                     HOOPER

               They swim through the debris, using two barrels as floats, 
               as dozens of seagulls feast on shark remains on the surface.

               FADE IN:

               UNDERWATER - DAY

               Dramatically lit by sunlight filtering down from the surface.

               A dim shape, massive, threatening, swims towards us from the 
               distance. Then it divides -- what was one is two, and the 
               shape becomes reality; two divers in Scuba gear swimming 
               side by side. They are wearing minimal rubber, considering 
               the cool New England waters: "Farmer John" wetsuits with cut-
               off legs, assorted sport-diving paraphernalia, including an 
               expensive camera with a flash attachment.

               One motions "Down there," the other signals "OK, I see it," 
               and they dive deeper, into darker waters, where the shafts 
               of sunlight pour into the depths, broken up by seaweed and 
               floating vegetation into cathedral-like columns of 
               illumination.

               SEA BOTTOM - DAY

               The wreck of the working fisherman's boat "ORCA," formerly 
               under the command of the late Captain Quint, deceased these 
               four years.

               Buried in the sand near it, still connected by rusting strands 
               of cable, the mangled remains of a shark cage, glimmering 
               with stainless steel highlights. A fitful flash of yellow 
               from under a mossy beard -- a battered barrel, similarly 
               tangled.

               The divers, Bert and Ernie, appear. They're fascinated by 
               the find, and Bert, with the camera, snaps a few flash shots. 
               The rapid sequence of flashes signals the presence of a motor 
               drive camera.

               ANOTHER POINT OF VIEW

               Distant flashes, obscured by vegetation in the foreground.

               SEA BOTTOM, THE ORCA

               Ernie is exploring the abandoned cabin; doors open and shut, 
               moved by invisible currents stirred by his passage.

               An occasional "Flash!" lights up the bottom as Bert continues 
               snapping away souvenir shots of this local landmark.

               BERT'S POINT OF VIEW - CAMERA VIEWFINDER (PROCESS)

               Ernie floats up out of a hatch, sees the camera, and strikes 
               a pose, clowning for the photographer's benefit. A big hand, 
               f.g., motions him up into clear water for a formal portrait.

               He obliges. Now he floats in front of us, gently paddling 
               his flippers to maintain vertical stability. One flash.

               Another. Then a large, dim movement in the b.g.

               Something's out there, moving towards us.

               Flash. It's bigger, bearing down like a train in a tunnel.

               Flash! It's on us. Flash! Teeth? Blood? Flash! Blackness, 
               Death.

               OCEAN BOTTOM, INSERT

               The camera floats gently down and settles in the sand. A 
               dark red mist eddies by. A last weak flash.

                                                         MATCH DISSOLVE TO:

               EXT. OCEAN - SUNDOWN

               Flash! An expensive cabin cruiser, the "Diver Working" flag 
               fluttering limply in the breeze, is riding alone at anchor.

               Flash! A distant lighthouse beacon winks at us. The boat 
               rocks in the ceaseless swell.

               On the stern, "Elizabeth T. - Newport, R.I." A long way from 
               home...

               EXT. AMITY BEACH - DAY

               A blue-and-white police jeep is bouncing over the sand. A 
               figure in civilian clothes driving alone on some urgent 
               mission. It's Martin Brody, Chief of Police on Amity.

               The jeep slows to a stop, and he takes a flight of stairs 
               leading to a concrete patio two at a time. A classical trumpet 
               solo is playing in the background. Brody charges through a 
               door, then abruptly slows and starts moving warily through a 
               hotel interior: The Holidome, a three-story extravaganza of 
               a motel, where some sort of formal ceremony is already in 
               progress. A banner announces: "Grand Opening Ball -- Amity 
               Scholarship Fund Benefit." Brody crosses under a High School 
               band, arranged dance-band style on a balcony; the trumpet 
               player, Polo, is finishing his solo, the assembled crowd 
               applauds politely. Brody is taking his place with some 
               dignitaries on the dais, as the presiding authority, Amity 
               Mayor Larry Vaughn, begins speaking.

                         Thank you, Paul Lohman, for that 
                         eloquent solo. Now, for that point 
                         in the ceremonies where we formally 
                         dedicate this magnificent resort-
                         hotel complex, a worthwhile addition 
                         to the recreational paradise we call

               of Amity's Selectmen, Real Estate Developer Len Peterson, 
               and Ellen Brody, very chic. Brody slips into the vacant chair 
               next to her. The following is conducted in urgent whispers, 
               sotto voce, while Vaughn drones on.

                 to the jeep in his 
                 pocket, and I couldn't 
                 find the spares.

                         ELLEN

                 you've been here all

                 How'm I supposed to do 
                 that?

               Brody settles into polite attentiveness, acknowledging a 
               wave from Hendricks, a politely bland young town cop in his 
               idea of civilian finery. Hendricks is fussing with the banner

               Tina (the girl in the bathing suit) escapes Hendricks'

               while Phil Fogarty, the local photographer, snaps away.

                         is made entirely of twenty-dollar 
                         bills, donated by Len Peterson, the 
                         builder of Amity Shores Condominiums, 
                         as a gesture of goodwill towards the 
                         community. $500 as a special gift to 
                         the Amity township scholarship fund...

               Applause from the crowd, Len takes a bow.

                                     VAUGHN
                              (prompting)
                         Go ahead, Tina.

               ANGLE ON TINA

               as she reaches out with the scissors. Something catches her 
               eye, and she winks at her boyfriend, Ed Marchand, smirking 
               in the crowd. He winks back, and makes "Cut it" motions with 
               his fingers.

               ANGLE ON THE CEREMONY

               Tina cuts the ribbon, and Tom Andrews, a local diver, pushes 
               a decorated float out into the pool; sparklers sputter, 
               balloons drop from the ceiling.

                                     VAUGHN
                         Thanks to Tom Andrews, of Amity Aqua-
                         Sports, for contributing the special 
                         decorations. And now, the Amity High 
                         School band. Refreshments on the 
                         patio, everyone...

               The band swings into "Downtown," and the crowd gets up to 
               dance, to eat, and to break into small groups to talk.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               INT. HOLIDOME - LATER

               Ellen is dragging Brody over to where Len Peterson and Larry 
               Vaughn, the mayor, are in conversation. They pass vignettes:

               Tina and Ed, Tom Andrews and Jane, Marge, other interesting 
               Amity townspeople.

                                     BRODY
                              (seeing Peterson and 
                              Vaughn)
                         Do I have to talk to those two?

                                     ELLEN
                         My boss and your boss. Sure.

                                     VAUGHN
                         Hello, hello. It went well, I thought.

                                     BRODY
                         Very impressive ceremony. Good speech.

                                     VAUGHN
                         Thank you, thank you. You know my 
                         son, don't you?

               He beckons over their heads to Larry Vaughn, Jr., a young 
               man uncomfortable in his correct tie and blazer. They exchange 
               perfunctory greetings.

                                     PETERSON
                         The speech was right on the money.
                              (to Ellen)
                         Be a love and make sure the bar's 
                         open, will you?

               He puts his arm around her, a little too familiarly for 
               Brody's liking.

                                     PETERSON
                              (to Brody)
                         Fantastic lady. Don't know what I'd 
                         do without her.

                                     BRODY
                         Me neither.

                                     PETERSON
                              (looking around)
                         Y'know, Brody -- for the first time 
                         in years it's worth putting money 
                         into this town.

                                     BRODY
                         All of us thank you, okay?

                                     ELLEN
                         Watch Sean for a minute?

               And she hands Sean off to Brody, leaving him with an over-
               active 10 year old, while she's gone.

                                     SEAN
                         Can I go swimming?

                                     BRODY
                         No. Find your brother, okay?

               Sean nods and runs off, happy to have a mission.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               ANGLE ON MICHAEL BRODY - NEAR THE BAND

               He is talking to Brooke Peters, a mop-maned teen-ager with a 
               pleasant face.

               Timmy Weldon, a grade behind, lurks nearby. A plumpish, curly-
               haired buddy, Andy Nicholas, is enjoying a cup of punch.

                                     MIKE
                         How old is your cousin?

                                     BROOKE
                         Seventeen. She's a senior.

                                     MIKE
                         I'm not crazy about blind dates.

                                     ANDY
                         They're okay, if they got little 
                         white canes and tin cups.

                                     BROOKE
                         That's awful.

                                     ANDY
                         What the hell.
                              (to Mike)
                         Did your mom put all this together?

                                     MIKE
                         Yeah, it's her job.

                                     ANDY
                         Is she responsible for the punch?

                                     MIKE
                         No.

                                     ANDY
                         Good. It's terrible.

                                     BROOKE
                         My cousin will be here tomorrow.

                                     MIKE
                         Great.

               Sean finds them, and bursts into their group.

                                     SEAN
                         Michael, Michael, Dad said to find 
                         you.

                                     ANDY
                         Okay, you did that.

                                     SEAN
                         Come on, Mikey, come on...

               He tugs at Mike's sleeve; Mike allows himself to be dragged 
               off.

                                     MIKE
                         Okay, okay. Got to go.

               Andy and Brooke are left standing together, Tim moves in.

                                     TIM
                              (to Brooke)
                         Want to dance?
                              (she shakes her head 
                              "no")
                         Okay. Later?

               On her shrug, as she turns to Andy:

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT./EXT. HOLIDOME PATIO/TERRACE - NIGHT

               It's later; night has fallen, the band is playing its version 
               of "When I Fall in Love." Many teen-agers are dancing out on 
               the patio, some adults are dancing inside, the buffet is 
               ravaged, Timmy is watching Brooke, who's dancing with Polo.

               Douglas Fetterman ("Doug") joins him, after asking Marge for 
               a dance and striking out.

                                     DOUG
                         Get a dance yet?

                                     TIMMY
                         Nope.

                                     DOUG
                         Me neither.

                                     TIMMY
                         Who'd you ask?

                                     DOUG
                         Tina Wilcox.

                                     TIMMY
                         You're crazy. She's Ed's girl friend.

                                     DOUG
                         Doesn't hurt to ask. Sometimes the 
                         most beautiful girls are the 
                         loneliest.

                                     TIMMY
                         That's a crock of shit.

                                     DOUG
                         I know.

               Bob Burnside, a tall pal of Larry Vaughn Jr.'s, turns up by 
               their side.

                                     BOB
                         Same tired old faces. You see Vaughn?

                                     DOUG
                         The mayor?

                                     BOB
                         Larry Vaughn Junior?
                              (Doug shrugs)
                         If you see him, tell him I got a six-
                         pack, a blanket, and the Brebner 
                         twins.

               He exits, on the prowl.

                                     TIMMY
                         No class.

                                     DOUG
                         None at all.
                              (pause)
                         I wonder what the Brebner twins are 
                         doing tomorrow night.

               ANGLE ON BRODY AND ELLEN

                                     BRODY
                         Can you take a little time out from 
                         your busy schedule to dance with the 
                         old man?

                                     ELLEN
                         Why?

                                     BRODY
                         Because they're playing our song.

               And sure enough, they are -- the band has turned to a Fifties 
               slow-dance standard: "I Wish You Love." Peterson approaches.

                                     PETERSON
                         May I have this dance?

                                     BRODY
                         Sorry, I'm all booked up...
                              (taking Ellen)
                         Come, m'dear.

               They slowly fox trot out onto the terrace. Both of them 
               nodding greetings to townspeople and kids -- everyone knows 
               the chief.

                                     BRODY
                         Remember 1959, the Jersey shore?

                                     ELLEN
                         And how. I thought you wouldn't 
                         respect me.

                                     BRODY
                         I did, I did.

               The music and the summer moon are working their magic.

                                     BRODY
                         Listen -- what are you doing later?

                                     ELLEN
                         Fooling around?

                                     BRODY
                         Right.

               He dips with her; they look up and notice Sean, sound asleep 
               on a bench.

                                     ELLEN
                         Let's get the kid home.

                                     BRODY
                         Home it is.

               He crosses to the sleepy Sean and hoists him with a grunt.

                                     BRODY
                              (to the kid)
                         You're getting a little big for this.

               Sean murmurs sleepily and hugs his dad. Mike, dancing with 
               Marge, waves good-bye. The Brodys start to leave, passing a 
               bucket with a bottle of champagne still in it. They exchange 
               a look, nod agreement, and Brody boosts the bottle, sneaking 
               it out of the building while Ellen giggles.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               INT. BRODY BEDROOM - DAY

               Brody and Ellen are snuggling under the covers while early 
               morning light streams under the blinds. It's The Morning 
               After, and the clothes from the night before are scattered 
               all over the room. Brody rolls against Ellen, spoon-fashion, 
               morning-horny.

                                     BRODY
                         Mmmm.

                                     ELLEN
                         MMMmmmorning...

               They start to move a little, then turn face to face. Outside 
               their door, the sounds of little feet; Sean padding 
               downstairs.

                                     BRODY
                         Sean's awake.

                                     ELLEN
                         Door's locked.

                                     BRODY
                              (kissing)
                         Good.

               Their bodies move under the blankets. There's a crash from 
               the kitchen. They stop for a beat. As they resume, little 
               feet return.

                                     SEAN'S VOICE
                         The milk fell out of the 'frigerator.

                                     ELLEN
                              (whispering)
                         Put a towel down. And shh -- daddy's 
                         sleeping.

                                     SEAN'S VOICE
                         Okay.

               His feet paddle off. Brody and Ellen start to slide together, 
               passion resumes.

                                     ELLEN
                         C'mere...

               Bigger feet go downstairs; Michael's up. The Brodys kiss, 
               trying to ignore the sounds of spirited discussion between 
               brothers over who's responsible for spilled milk. Then the 
               sound of a car pulling into the driveway, and a horn beep.

                                     BRODY
                         Mrs. Silvera?

                                     ELLEN
                         Mrs. Silvera.

               They try to kiss again, there's a door slam downstairs, and 
               talk between the boys and Mrs. Silvera. The Brodys look at 
               each other and break up laughing at the morning, and 
               themselves.

               ANGLE ON THE BED

               As Ellen and Brody, with the practice of 18 years of marriage, 
               swing back-to-back, and put their feet on the floor, each on 
               their side of the bed, still chuckling, up for the day.

                                     BRODY
                         Need a ride?

                                     ELLEN
                         As far as the office.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. AMITY STREET   DAY

               The police jeep is driving through the picturesque streets, 
               Brody behind the wheel, Ellen and Sean passengers. It slows 
               near the foot of the street, dockside, where a real estate 
               office marked "Amity Shores Development, Leonard Peterson, 
               Pres." sits. Peterson's big Cadillac is parked illegally at 
               the curb. It has the Amity Shores logo on its side.

                                     BRODY
                         Some people.

                                     SEAN
                         What's daddy doing?

                                     ELLEN
                         Writing a ticket.

               Brody is out of the car, his pad in his hand.

                                     ELLEN
                         Hey! That's my boss!

                                     BRODY
                         Better yet.

               Peterson, in shirt-sleeves and a tie, hustles out of the 
               office

                                     PETERSON
                         Wait a minute...

                                     BRODY
                         Too late, it's written.

                                     PETERSON
                         Heck of a way to treat a taxpayer.
                              (to Ellen)
                         Don't you have any pull with the 
                         chief, here?

                                     ELLEN
                         Do I have to?

                                     PETERSON
                              (taking the ticket)
                         Better get a sales kit together for 
                         after lunch. I'm taking some prospects 
                         out.

               Ellen kisses Brody, and starts in for her day's work.

                                     ELLEN
                         See you later.

                                     PETERSON
                              (to Brody)
                         Can't we fix it up to get this made 
                         into a green zone or something?

                                     BRODY
                         Len, pay the two dollars.

               Peterson shrugs and goes inside his office. Brody's attention 
               is drawn by some noise by the dock.

               EXT. DOCKSIDE, AMITY - DAY

               Hendricks and an old codger, Red, are working on Amity's 
               newest bit of police equipment; a blue power launch for 
               patrolling local waters. The boat is Hendricks' personal 
               pride and joy.

                                     HENDRICKS
                              (to Red)
                         Tie it off on your left. Your other 
                         left!

               As Red complies, Hendricks spots his boss.

                                     HENDRICKS
                         Good morning!

                                     BRODY
                              (walking onto the 
                              dock, Sean tagging 
                              along)
                         Aren't you off-duty?

                                     HENDRICKS
                         Till noon. This is on my own time.
                              (to Sean)
                         Hi, Shorty.

                                     SEAN
                         I'm not short. I'm eleven.

               There's a hoot from a passing boat horn. Sean waves happily.

               ANGLE ON THE BOAT

               It has slowed to a halt in front of the police berth; it's a 
               scruffy working fisherman, back from the banks with a full 
               load. The Skipper hails Brody.

                                     SKIPPER
                         Yo! Chief!

                                     BRODY
                         What?

                                     SKIPPER
                         You got a gold-plater drifting in 
                         the main channel. Big cruiser.

                                     HENDRICKS
                         Whereabouts?

                                     SKIPPER
                         Off the Point. No running lights, 
                         just a diver's flag.

                                     HENDRICKS
                              (aside to Brody)
                         Want me to run out there?

                                     BRODY
                         On your own time?

                                     HENDRICKS
                         Happy to do it.

                                     BRODY
                         Then check it out. I'll be in the 
                         office.

               Hendricks nods, and starts the engine importantly.

                                     HENDRICKS
                         Cast off your bow line. And your 
                         stern line. Spring line...

               While Red grumbles, Brody and Sean are walking up to the 
               street.

               Michael and some teen-agers are headed down to the dock.

               ANGLE ON BRODY AND THE KIDS

               It's Mike, Polo, Patrick, Lucy, Brooke, Ed and Tina.

                                     BRODY
                         Where to?

                                     MIKE
                         No place special. Just hanging out.

                                     BRODY
                         Sailing?

               Mike nods.

                                     BRODY
                         Watch your kid brother, huh?

               He gets into his jeep, leaving Sean with the teen-agers.

                                     BROOKE
                         Bye, Mr. Brody.

               The others ad lib appropriate greetings/good-byes, as Brody 
               drives off in his jeep.

               EXT. DOCKSIDE - DAY

               The Kids busy themselves with their boats while Sean hovers 
               around Mike, who's not happy at baby-sitting his kid brother.

                         POLO
                 Anyone want to sail to 
                 the lighthouse?

                         PATRICK
                 Machs nix to me.

                         LUCY
                 Anyone got a spare 
                 mooring line? Mine's 
                 shot.

                         TINA
                 I've got one...

                                                       SEAN
                                               Can I go too?

                                                       MIKE
                                               No.

                                                       SEAN
                                               Please.

                                                       MIKE
                                               I said, 'No.'

               Tina's in her boat, "Tina's Joy," a neat sloop. Mike is going 
               over his "Green Machine," a sleek catamaran.

                                     BROOKE
                         You're not going out right away, are 
                         you?

                                     MIKE
                         Waiting for Andy.

                                     BROOKE
                         I want you to meet my cousin.

                                     MIKE
                         I will, I will.

                                     SEAN
                         I want to go out with you. You need 
                         a crew, don't you?

               Before Sean can protest further, Mike spots his crew: Andy 
               Nicholas, a round-faced, frizzy-haired pal, wearing a bathing 
               suit, and carrying some scuba gear from an early-morning 
               diving class. Marge and Denise, two other divers, are with 
               him, with their gear. They ad-lib "good-byes."

                                     MIKE
                         I don't need you. Andy's here.

                                     SEAN
                         You always go with Andy.

                                     MIKE
                              (to Andy)
                         How was dive class?

                                     ANDY
                         Same as always -- glub-glub, bubble-
                         bubble, stroke-stroke. There sure is 
                         some weird shit on the bottom of the 
                         ocean.

                                     BROOKE
                         Shells and lobsters and stuff?

                                     ANDY
                         Mostly old garbage. Today we found a 
                         '48 Hudson.

                                     SEAN
                         Do I have to play with the little 
                         kids?

                                     MIKE
                         Yeah. Go on, beat it.

               Sean mopes away while Andy and Mike get their boat ready for 
               sea.

               FOLLOW SEAN OFF THE DOCK

               Up on the street, where a pretty girl with a sexy face and a 
               provocative post-pubescent walk is asking him directions.

               He points down at the dock. The Girl, Jackie Peters, waves 
               at her cousin, Brooke.

                                     JACKIE
                         Brooke! Hey!

               One of the boats has a portable radio going. It's playing 
               some medium-hot salsa. Jackie does a couple of dance steps 
               on her way down the dock.

                         Who's that? Quick -- I'm in love.

                                     MIKE
                         I hope that's the cousin.

                                     BROOKE
                         Over here. I want you to meet 
                         somebody.

                                     ANDY
                         Lucky. Lucky, lucky, lucky.

               As the four teen-agers come together in a tight quartet, the 
               music rocks up and we:

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. HARBOR - DAY

               Later in the day, sailboats with bright colored sails and 
               ornately painted hulls tack back and forth. Lots of chatter 
               between boats, horseplay, splashing, and general good times.

               It's cruising, on water.

               EXT. HARBOR, ABOARD MIKE'S BOAT - DAY

               with Mike, Andy, Jackie and Brooke.

                                     JACKIE
                         How fast does this go?

                                     ANDY
                         With the right wind, 15-20 knots.

                                     JACKIE
                         What?

                                     MIKE
                         Real fast.

               He sheets in, heeling the boat over in the stiff breeze.

                                     BROOKE
                         Far out!

               Jackie screams in excitement; for a city girl, this is more 
               fun than a roller coaster.

               ANGLE ON A RED CATAMARAN, "SIZZLER"

               overtaking Mike's boat. It's piloted by Larry Vaughn, Jr., 
               the Mayor's Son; with him is his good friend, Bob Burnside.

                                     LARRY
                         Coming up!

                         Gangway, Turkies!

               It's immediately a race between the red boat -- "Sizzler," 
               and Mike's "Green Machine." The Kids ad-lib -- "Faster," 
               "Lookout," "Gybe, gybe."

                                     ANDY
                         We're carrying weight.

                                     LARRY
                         We'll take your supercargo.

                                     JACKIE
                         Is that me?

                                     BROOKE
                         That's you.

                                     JACKIE
                         I've never been supercargo.

               Donny and Denise's boat cuts in, stealing the Sizzler's air.

                                     LARRY
                         Hey, get out of our air!

                                     DONNY
                         Want a passenger?

               ANGLE ON THE SIZZLER AND FELIX

               Denise hops nimbly from one boat to the other as Danny sails 
               tight as a tick to the red cat.

                                     BOB
                         Way to go!

               QUICK CUTS: FUN AT SEA

               The sailboats cutting up, cruising the harbor, the local 
               teen-agers partying with each other:

               --  Patrick and Lucy's Sol Cat, flying its hull.

               --  Susie's Laser heeled 'way over' in a stiff breeze.

               --  Polo and a pretty girl in his sloop, "Sea Witch."

               --  Timmy Weldon and Doug Fetterman playing catch-up in their 
               respective boats, the Doughdish and the Inflatable.

               --  Marge in her Lightening, sailing close to Ed and Tina in 
               Tina's Joy.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               UNDERWATER NEAR THE ORCA - DAY

               Silent, green-blue depths. A diver, Crosby, working the 
               bottom, running a search pattern. Another diver, Tom Andrews, 
               running close. They signal to each other, and make another 
               pass.

               Follow Tom Andrews as he skims the bottom, near the wreck of 
               the Orca, half-buried in the silt. A diver's line runs up 
               and

                                                      OUT OF THE FRAME, TO:

               EXT. OCEAN - DAY

               Bobbing on the surface are three boats: the Amity Police 
               launch, the deserted Elizabeth T., from Newport, flying a 
               diver's flag, and the ScubaVue, a local diveboat operated by 
               Tom Andrews and his partner, Crosby; it has "Amity Aqua 
               Sports" lettered on it somewhere. Hendricks and Red are on 
               the deck of the police boat, peering at the cruiser.

                                     HENDRICKS
                         Rich or poor, it's nice to have money.

                                     RED
                         Figure they split?

                                     HENDRICKS
                         Happens every season -- someone takes 
                         off. Once we had a schooner for a 
                         month while the owners went fox 
                         hunting.

               A sudden eruption in the water nearby startles them -- it's 
               Andrews, surfacing, holding up the underwater flash camera.

                                     ANDREWS
                         This is all there is.

               Crosby pops up next to him, shows empty hands.

                                     HENDRICKS
                         If that's it, that's it.

               The divers head for their boat, Hendricks fires up his engine, 
               and we:

               INT. BRODY'S OFFICE - DAY

               Brody is trying to reason with an indignant fat man.

                                     INDIGNANT MAN
                         I can't watch the news, I can't watch 
                         a ball game, I can't watch movies -- 
                         all I hear is that rotten kid with 
                         his rotten radio... "Breaker, 
                         Breaker..."

                         I'll do what I can, but you're talking 
                         about a federal jurisdiction...

                              (leaving in a huff)
                         So call the FBI!

                         Thanks. What else is out there?

                         One petty theft, one domestic 
                         disturbance, and an exhibitionist.

                                     BRODY
                         I'll take the exhibitionist, you 
                         handle the others.

                         Chief Brody? I want you to do 
                         something about my first husband.

               Brody is caught in the open.

                    (continuing)
                 Albert keeps coming 
                 around when I'm with 
                 gentlemen friends and

                                               of-state car in my driveway, 
                                               I lose another mailbox.  
                                               Those little iron sailboats 
                                               cost thirty-two dollars 
                                               each!

                         Her bedroom window faces my oldest 
                         boy's bedroom, and she's teasing 
                         him, dancing around in a towel, or 
                         less...

                         Dancing?

               Hendricks has entered, carrying the camera brought up from 
               the bottom by the divers.

                                     HENDRICKS
                         Chief...

                                     BRODY
                         Hendricks. I want to go over your 
                         reports and your Form 908.

               They go into Brody's inner office; the uproar continues behind 
               the door, but it's calm in here.

                                     HENDRICKS
                         I never heard of a 908.

                                     BRODY
                         I just made it up. It means, "Get me 
                         out of there."
                              (notices the camera)
                         What the hell's that?

                                     HENDRICKS
                         Diver's camera. Tom Andrews brought 
                         it up from under that abandoned 
                         cruiser.

                                     BRODY
                         Abandoned? It's a little early in 
                         the season for that.

                                     HENDRICKS
                         Rich people. Home port is Newport, 
                         Rhode Island.

                                     BRODY
                         If I had a $100,000 boat, I sure as 
                         hell wouldn't leave it anchored alone 
                         in the channel.

                                     HENDRICKS
                         If you had a $100,000 boat there'd 
                         be an investigation.

               Hendricks puts the camera in an informal "Lost & Found" box 
               sitting in the office. Brody makes the mistake of opening 
               the door, revealing the White-Haired Man.

                                     WHITE-HAIRED MAN
                         Grace Kinney is driving my boy to 
                         distraction.

                                     BRODY
                         Hendricks, get a description of that 
                         dance.

                              (to Brody)
                         Chief Brody? I want to talk to you 
                         about my daughter... she's 15, but 
                         mature for her age...

                         WOMAN
                 Chief, I've been telling 
                 Mrs. Prendergast that 
                 it's no good just 
                 talking about Albert, 
                 she's got to do 
                 something...

                                                       2ND MAN
                                               Look -- the township is 
                                               responsible for protecting 
                                               life and property, and my 
                                               property is unprotected... 

               As Brody turns to deal with the mess, we:

                                                                    CUT TO:

               UNDERWATER

               Looking up at the surface, where a hull floats in silhouette 
               against the daylight. There's a commotion, and a water ski 
               drops into view. Then another one. Pale legs churn the water.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. OCEAN - DAY

               Off Amity Beach, a bilious green lap-straked boat is bobbing 
               in the water, the engine idling. Two girls are fooling around; 
               the one in the water is Terry, the one driving the boat is 
               Diane.

                                     TERRY
                         Did you ever see a dolphin?

                                     DIANE
                         Sure. They like to play. We may see 
                         some today.

                                     TERRY
                         Great!

               She fumbles with her skis.

                                     TERRY
                         Whoops, almost lost one. Can't play 
                         with the dolphins without skis...

                                     DIANE
                         Ready?

                                     TERRY
                         Hang on, hang on... Okay, go.

               Diane goes to the controls, and puts the engine into gear, 
               starting forward. Terry waves "okay," Diane opens up the 
               throttle, the boat surges forward, pulling Terry upright.

               A wake boils out from under her skis.

               ANGLE ON THE BEACH

               Ed and Tina are camped on a blanket, necking in the shelter 
               of the dunes. There's a portable radio, a cooler with some 
               beer, and some sandwiches -- a perfect afternoon alone. Above 
               the dune, behind them lies the ocean, where the girls' ski 
               boat can be seen, raising a big wake. Tina disengages, and 
               sits up, brushing sand out of her hair.

                                     TINA
                         Take a break for a minute, okay?

                                     ED
                         Huh?

               Tina stands, and looks out to the sea, where the boat is 
               towing Terry on the water.

                                     TINA
                         Eddie, can we do that?
                              (no reaction)
                         Can we go skiing? We can use my 
                         Uncle's boat. Eddie?

                                     ED
                         Next week.

                                     TINA
                         With you, everything's next week. I 
                         want to go skiing soon. Tomorrow?

               Ed grunts non-comittally. Tina takes a beer from the cooler, 
               and goes up on the dune to watch Terry and Diane. She waves 
               to them, and to someone down the beach.

               EXT. BEACH HOUSE - DAY

               An old lady, Grace Witherspoon, is rocking on her porch, 
               also enjoying the view of young people enjoying themselves. 
               She acknowledges Tina's distant wave, and turns her attention 
               back to the skiers.

               ANGLE ON THE SKIERS

               having a wonderful time. Terry is good, criss-crossing the 
               wake, showing off.

               CLOSE ON TERRY

               rushing through the water, waving, stunting.

                                     TERRY
                         Faster! Faster!

               She waves at Diane, who leans over the controls, to coax 
               more speed out of the old engine.

               UNDERWATER

               following the skis effortlessly, closing in on the turbulent 
               wake.

               ON THE SURFACE

               Terry whipping along; a fin raises near her. She glances at 
               it, waves, thinking it's a porpoise.

                                     TERRY
                         Porpoise! Look! A dolphin!

               The fin slides low in the water, heading towards her. She 
               puts the rope around her waist, leaving both hands free.

               UNDERWATER

               Closing in on the wake, crossing it.

               TERRY - ON THE SURFACE

               The fin cuts across her path. Too late to maneuver, Terry 
               hits the looming gray back of the Shark. The skis bump, leave 
               the water, Terry takes a spectacular spill. The rope around 
               her waist tows her helpless through the water, gagging her, 
               preventing her from shouting. She flounders as Diane slows 
               the boat to see what's happened.

               ANGLE ON THE BOAT

               turning back to see if her friend hit a submerged log or 
               hurt herself.

                                     DIANE
                         Terry! You okay?

                                     TERRY
                         Help! Help!

                                     DIANE
                         Okay, okay, coming...

               She still doesn't realize the gravity of the situation -- 
               she hasn't seen the fin.

               ANGLE ON TERRY

               hysterical, pulling herself hand-over-hand up the rope, trying 
               to get to the boat.

               UNDERWATER

               Closing in on the thrashing figure.

               TERRY

               Screaming, as the Shark rises from the deep and takes her.

               Suddenly she's gone, a swirl of pink froth marking the water 
               where she went under.

               IN THE BOAT - DIANE

               Looking around for her friend, suddenly panicky. She pulls 
               the rope hard, and tumbles backward as it comes up with 
               nothing on it -- just a cleanly bitten end.

                                     DIANE
                              (screaming)
                         Terry!

               Then the Shark appears, blood on its mouth, lunging up and 
               butting the stern, jarring the engine loose. Fuel spills 
               from a ruptured line.

                                     DIANE
                         Help! God, help!

               She throws things at the Shark, which slides back under the 
               water.

               DISTANT ANGLE ON THE BOAT - FROM THE BEACH

               Diane can be seen flailing in the boat, very distant screams 
               floating across the water; at this range they sound like the 
               normal shrieks of teen-age girls having fun....

               ANGLE ON THE BOAT - CLOSE

               as the Shark hits from a fresh angle, this time taking a 
               chunk out of the boat, biting down with powerful jaws. Diane 
               hurls seat-cushions, oars, anything she can lay hands on.

               She fumbles desperately in a compartment, produces a flare 
               pistol. She cocks it and fires point-blank at the shark.

               CLOSE ON THE SHARK

               The flare hits, wet fuel glistening on the water and skin of 
               the Shark explodes in a sheet of flame.

               DIANE

               A last flash before the gasoline explodes.

                                     DIANE
                         No-o-o-o-o-o...!

               A sheet of fire, she's in the middle, screaming, aflame, the 
               Shark forgotten. She falls into the water as the ruined boat 
               overturns and there's an oily explosion.

               EXT. BEACH - DAY - ED AND TINA

               Ed and Tina look up as they hear the distant "crump" of the 
               boat blowing up.

               EXT. PORCH - DAY

               Mrs. Witherspoon looks up, startled by the sudden tragedy.

               She gets up to go to the phone, indoors, and we:

               EXT. OCEAN - DAY - AMITY POLICE BOAT

               The launch is anchored at the site of the explosion, offshore.

               Red is fishing up bits of flotsam with a boathook. Hendricks 
               is on the radio, talking to the shore.

                                     HENDRICKS
                         I can't find anyone out here. They 
                         must've gone to the bottom, or drifted 
                         with the current.

               BRODY ON SHORE

               He's on the porch of tile Witherspoon house, using his 
               portable walkie-talkie. Mrs. Witherspoon is waiting in the 
               b.g.

               Nearby, we can see a sign: "BURIED CABLE: Call New England 
               Light and Power Before Digging." The cable itself surfaces 
               in a chain-link fenced enclosure, and climbs a power pole 
               for distribution to the island. Ed and Tina are also there, 
               having given statements.

                         There should be bodies. Witnesses 
                         say two people; one in the boat, one 
                         skiing.

                         dark.

                         Stay on it. I don't care how long it 
                         takes.

               Brody turns to Ed and Tina, and takes out his notebook.

                         We heard this noise, like a 'boomp' 
                         out there, and when we looked, there 
                         was just this cloud of smoke.

                         That was the explosion. One minute 
                         they were having a wonderful time, 
                         the next, bang!

               BRODY

                                     GRACE
                         I don't know what could've done that.

               Brody stares out at the quiet sea -- what's lurking under 
               that calm surface?

                                     TINA
                         Can we go now?

               Brody's still looking past them, towards the ocean.

                         Chief Brody -- can we go? Please?

                         Oh, yeah. Sure.

               As he gazes at the ocean, we hear the sound of a distant 
               siren, and

               ABROAD THE POLICE BOAT - NIGHT

               Hendricks has the winch in operation, the cable in his hand, 
               with big grappling hooks attached. The boat is lit by its 
               powerful worklights. Hendricks heaves them out, watches as 
               the current takes them, then puts the winch in gear, hauling 
               back.

                         bored.

               It goes taut with a sudden strain.

                         I think we got something.

               Red moves to the winch, watching warily as it slows to a 
               near stall with the weight.

               There's a strain on the cable -- it's pulling the stern of 
               the boat down as it struggles with the weight.

               ANGLE ON THE WATER

               lit by the harsh worklights on the deck of the launch. The 
               cable from the winch is taut, pulling something up from the 
               black depths. What? The coupling appears, then the hook, and 
               an oily cable.

               He hits the release on the winch, and the cable whines as it 
               spins out and settles back on the bottom. Red jiggles the 
               line, trying to free it up.

                         Now you're talking. Let's get out of 
                         here before we do find something.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               INT. BRODY KITCHEN - DAY

               The next morning, the Brody family is downstairs, each getting 
               his own special breakfast. Mike gets cereal for himself and 
               Sean, Ellen is cracking some soft-boiled eggs, Brody is 
               drinking coffee and smoking.

                                     ELLEN
                         You have to smoke so early in the 
                         morning?

                                     BRODY
                         It's good with coffee.

                                     ELLEN
                         So's a donut.

                                     SEAN
                         I want Fruit Loops!

                                     MIKE
                         Eat Cheerios.

                                     SEAN
                         You eat Cheerios. I want Fruit Loops.

                                     ELLEN
                         Eat Cheerios.

                                     BRODY
                         What're you guys doing today?

                                     MIKE
                              (indicates Sean)
                         I don't know about him -- I'm going 
                         down to the dock, maybe go sailing.

                                     BRODY
                         Every day?

                                     MIKE
                         What else is there to do?

                                     BRODY
                         You could work out at the beach, 
                         make a few bucks for school.

                                     MIKE
                         Do I have to?

                                     BRODY
                         You'll have to make up your own mind 
                         about that.

                                     ELLEN
                         Where's my day book?

                                     BRODY
                         In the den.

               Ellen passes them on the way to the den to look for it.

                                     ELLEN
                         He doesn't have to work all the time, 
                         it's his vacation.

               Mrs. Silvera enters from the service porch.

                                     MRS. SILVERA
                         Good morning -- everyone up early 
                         today?

                                     BRODY
                         There's a lot going on.

               He follows Ellen into the den.

               INT. DEN - DAY

               Ellen is rummaging around the papers on the end table, looking 
               for her book.

                                     ELLEN
                         Why don't you take a half day and 
                         clean this junk up?

                                     BRODY
                         Because, I'm in the middle of a 
                         boating accident, I got only four 
                         regular cops and one secretary, and 
                         a Chief Deputy who is constantly 
                         fiddling with the police boat. He's 
                         another one.

                                     ELLEN
                         One what?
                              (she finds the book)
                         Ah-ha!

                                     BRODY
                         Boat nut. What is it about this place 
                         that makes everyone a freak for 
                         boating?

                                     ELLEN
                         It's an island.
                              (she pecks him on the 
                              cheek)
                         Got to run.

               She heads out the door for the office. Mike approaches.

               ANGLE ON MIKE AND BRODY

                                     MIKE
                         I'm going.

                                     BRODY
                         What about tennis? Riding? Fixing up 
                         old cars? Bartending?

                                     MIKE
                         Bartending? I'm 17.

                                     BRODY
                         Okay, not bartending. Why on the 
                         water every day?

                                     MIKE
                         Because.

                                     BRODY
                         Look, humor the old man -- just be 
                         careful.

                                     MIKE
                              (going)
                         I'll be careful. I'll see y'later.

               INT. KITCHEN

               Mike passes through on his way out, nodding to Mrs. Silvera 
               who acknowledges his passage.  Brody is close on his heels.

                                     BRODY
                         Don't go out if it's rough or 
                         anything, huh? We've had a lot of 
                         trouble.

                                     MIKE
                         Okay, okay.

               The back door slams behind him.

                                     SEAN
                         Can I go with you today?

                                     BRODY
                         You stay with Mrs. Silvera, Tootsie. 
                         Okay?

               Sean nods, resigning himself to the inevitable.

                                     MRS. SILVERA
                              (to Sean)
                         You can come with me to the market.

                                     SEAN
                         All right.

                                     BRODY
                         I'll be at the office.

               Mrs. Silvera nods, and pours Sean a glass of milk. Brody 
               sighs, and heads out the door. Sean calls after him.

                                     SEAN
                         Bye, Daddy. I'm going to be careful, 
                         all day.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. OCEAN - DAY

               Sitting snug and ship-shape on Mike's Green Machine are Mike, 
               Andy, Brooke, and Jackie. They are heeled over in a brisk 
               wind, making good headway; sailing nearby in the b.g. are 
               Patrick and Lucy and Donny and Denise, in their boats.

                                     LUCY
                              (from her boat)
                         Where're we going?

                                     ANDY
                         Oh, out a ways. Maybe the lighthouse.

                                     BROOKE
                         The lighthouse?

                                     ANDY
                         No big thing, we'll see who's out 
                         there, maybe picnic.

                                     MIKE
                         We got some stuff at the store. Ed 
                         and Tina are going to be there.

                                     BROOKE
                         Oh, sure, they would be.

                                     JACKIE
                         What's the lighthouse?

                                     MIKE
                         It's an island, near here, with a 
                         lighthouse. We sometimes hang out 
                         there, you know...

                                     JACKIE
                         Great. I got some wine.

               She opens her big floppy bag, revealing the top half of a 
               jug of Mountain Red. Brooke slides over to her.

               ANGLE ON BROOKE AND JACKIE

                                     BROOKE
                              (aside)
                         The lighthouse is a make-out spot.

                                     JACKIE
                         Now I really want to see it.

                                     BROOKE
                         You going to fool around with Mike?
                              (Jackie shrugs)
                         Well, I'm not doing anything with 
                         him.

               She indicates Andy, who pretends great indifference.

                                     JACKIE
                         Well, maybe I will, then.

               Andy does about a triple take before he regains his cool.

               Mike concentrates on his sailing, Jackie grins an impish, 
               vixen grin, Brooke shrugs.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. LIGHTHOUSE - DAY

               spectacular view from the top of the old lighthouse, showing 
               ocean, sandy beach, some of the Kids' catamarans pulled up 
               on the sand, other pleasure boats cruising in the b.g.

               Ed and Tina are running down the stairs, laughing.

                                     ED
                         Come on back up here!

                                     TINA
                         Nope.

                                     ED
                         Give me back my hat!

                                     TINA
                         Double nope!

               ANGLE ON THE SAND

               where Andy, Mike, Jackie, and Brooke are camped around a 
               blanket listening to a portable radio. Ed and Tina run by.

                                     ANDY
                         Why'd they decide to move?

                                     BROOKE
                         Too hot in the lighthouse?

                                     MIKE
                         Too hot for those two? I can't believe 
                         it.

                                     JACKIE
                         Is there something I don't know about?

                                     BROOKE
                         I told you, remember?

                                     JACKIE
                         Oh, yeah. So why aren't they doing 
                         it now?

               There's a little round of giggling.

                                     ANDY
                         Maybe by now they are.

                                     MIKE
                         They're moving pretty fast.

                                     JACKIE
                         He's cute...

               ANGLE ON ED & TINA

               running towards a dune and over it.

               ANGLE ON MASSIVE SHAPE

               in f.g., covered with birds. Ed and Tina appear over the 
               crest of a dune, and the frame explodes in a flurry of 
               seagulls, suddenly disturbed. The whir and drumbeat of wings, 
               and the shrieking of the gulls is a jarring shock.

               CLOSEUP - TINA

               reacting.

                                     TINA
                         Yech!

               HER POINT OF VIEW

               The huge hulk of a beached, decomposing dead whale, a few 
               birds still pecking at scraps of blubber and entrails. Big 
               festering red holes mark its sides.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               LONG SHOT -  SAND AND WHALE

               From the top of the lighthouse, we can see a group of 
               interested spectators, clustered around the whale like ants 
               at a picnic. A few more boats are beached and riding at anchor 
               just off the shore, including the Amity police boat.

               Three Ants are walking towards the crowd, one of them 
               gesturing.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               ANGLE ON BRODY, HENDRICKS AND A WOMAN

               She's Lureen Elkins, a marine biologist from the Oceanographic 
               Institute, and she's skeptical. Brody is the ant whose 
               antennae were waving in the long shot.

                                     BRODY
                         As soon as I heard about it, I called 
                         you. This thing is big!

               His arms indicate big.

                                     ELKINS
                         After we've looked, we'll talk.

                                     HENDRICKS
                         This is it.

               He moves forward to clear the crowd. Some kids are poking 
               the massive hulk with sticks. A tourist couple is snapping 
               away with a Polaroid SX-70. The whole mess stinks, too.

                                     HENDRICKS
                         Move back, please... back off... 
                         open it up a little...

               The crowd edges back, giving way to Brody and Elkins.

                                     BRODY
                         See? What'd I tell you?

               ANGLE ON THE WHALE

               Brody is holding a handkerchief to his nose as he approaches 
               the dead thing, indicating a huge open wound on the side.

                                     BRODY
                         Look at that!

                                     ELKINS
                         First things first.

               She produces a tape measure and gives one end to Brody.

                                     ELKINS
                         From the tip of the snout, please.

               Elkins is measuring the length of the creature. She calls 
               off numbers to Hendricks, who is officiously writing it all 
               down, repeating numbers as he hears them.

                                     ELKINS
                         Length, 22 feet, 8 inches.

                                     BRODY
                         Come on, let's check the bite radius.

                                     ELKINS
                              (cold)
                         The what?

                                     BRODY
                         Bite radius. You know, the size of 
                         the mouth?

                                     ELKINS
                         The whale's mouth?

                                     BRODY
                         The Shark's mouth.

                                     ELKINS
                         What shark?

               Brody pitches his voice low, so that the crowd won't listen.

                                     BRODY
                         The shark that did this. It was a 
                         shark, wasn't it?

                                     ELKINS
                         We don't know that, do we?

                                     BRODY
                         But that's what we're here to find 
                         out, right?

                                     ELKINS
                         You don't tell me my job, and I won't 
                         tell you about yours, okay?

                                     HENDRICKS
                         I can't hear you if you're going to 
                         whisper.

                                     MIKE
                         Can we go now?

               He turns to join the kids as they slip through the crowd to 
               return to their blanket, ad-libbing good-byes.

                                     BRODY
                              (to Mike)
                         You stay here a minute.

                                     MIKE
                         Oh, c'mon.

                                     BRODY
                         You heard me.

                                     JACKIE
                         We'll be over by the lighthouse.

                                     MIKE
                         I'll be right there. Wait up.

               They hang around, waiting for him. Elkins has reclaimed 
               Brody's attention.

                                     ELKINS
                         Could be a shark. But maybe not.

                                     BRODY
                         Look, I know a little bit about 
                         sharks.

                                     ELKINS
                         Do you?

                                     BRODY
                         I know that this was probably a Great 
                         White Shark. Car-cadon... Caradan...

               He fumbles for the correct Latin.

                                     ELKINS
                              (helping out)
                         Carcharadon Carcharias.

                                     BRODY
                         That's it.

                                     ELKINS
                         Okay, so that's it.

                                     BRODY
                         Is there one in these waters?

                                     ELKINS
                         What makes you think there might be?

                                     BRODY
                         Because this big fish has been bitten 
                         by some other big fish...

                                     ELKINS
                         This is a mammal, not a fish.

                                     BRODY
                         Jesus, don't quibble with me. I want 
                         to know if a Great White Shark did 
                         this.

                                     ELKINS
                         Probably.

                                     BRODY
                         That's it? Probably? Look, sharks 
                         are attracted by blood, and thrashing 
                         around...

                                     ELKINS
                         And sound.

                                     BRODY
                              (this is a new one)
                         Sound?

                                     ELKINS
                         Sound. Like sonar, or radar. They 
                         home in on irregular sounds, unusual 
                         sounds, any rhythmic low-frequency 
                         vibration.

                                     BRODY
                         So there's one around here.

                                     ELKINS
                         Not necessarily. These wounds could've 
                         been inflicted 30 miles out to sea, 
                         or more. None of them are immediately 
                         fatal. Currents could've carried the 
                         body 10 miles further.

                                     HENDRICKS
                              (chiming in)
                         We got a helluva tide this month.

                                     BRODY
                         Could you just keep that crowd back, 
                         please?

                                     MIKE
                              (fidgeting)
                         Pop...

                                     BRODY
                         You stay right here. You're going in 
                         with me.

               ANGLE ON BRODY AND MIKE

               As Elkins examines the whale, calling her observations to 
               Hendricks.

                         MIKE
                 We came out in my boat.

                         BRODY
                 Andy can sail in it.

                         MIKE
                 I got a date!

                         BRODY
                 She'll understand.

                         MIKE
                 She won't. 

                                                       ELKINS
                                               Lower jaw displaced and 
                                               lacerated by predator 
                                               attempt to seize the tongue. 
                                               Additional large tissue 
                                               loss in the dorsal and sub-
                                               dorsal areas, as well as 
                                               the caudal. Oriamal bite 
                                               radius 37 inches, allowing 
                                               for salt-water erosion and 
                                               subsequent small predator 
                                               and scavenger tissue 
                                               attacks...

               The Kids have moved a little closer to hear what's going on 
               between father and son.

                                     BRODY
                         I don't want to discuss it.

               Elkins crosses to Brody.

                                     ELKINS
                         It's either a Great White, or another 
                         killer whale.

                                     BRODY
                         Can't you tell?

                                     ELKINS
                         Not when it's like this. This animal 
                         has been ashore for 10, 12 hours, 
                         and drifting for a day, at least. 
                         Every little nibbler in the sea's 
                         taken a bite.

                                     BRODY
                         Look -- can Great White Sharks 
                         communicate? Send out signals, or 
                         something? You know, take revenge, 
                         sense an enemy...

                                     ELKINS
                         Don't be ridiculous -- Sharks don't 
                         take things personally.

                                     MIKE
                         Dad, please...

               Brody turns on him.  This at least, is something he can do 
               something about.

                                     BRODY
                         No more sailing. You come back with 
                         me, and that's it.

                                     MIKE
                         Why me?

                                     BRODY
                         Because I say so.

                                     ANDY
                         I'll tie up at the town dock, don't 
                         worry, man.

                                     JACKIE
                         See you later, Mikey...

                                     ED AND TINA
                         Later, bye...
                              (ad lib)

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               INT. AMITY TOWN HALL - DAY

               Vaughn and Brody enter, walking through the spare, empty 
               town meeting hall, towards the conference table. They are 
               alone.

                                     VAUGHN
                         I'm showing summer rentals. We got a 
                         helluva season going.

                                     BRODY
                         We have got to talk, and we have got 
                         to talk alone.

                                     VAUGHN
                         We're alone.

                                     BRODY
                         Larry, I don't know how to say this, 
                         but I think we got a shark problem. 
                         A real one.

               Vaughn stares at him, then unlocks the door to his private 
               office -- "Mayor" -- and leads Brody in.

               INT. VAUGHN'S OFFICE - DAY

               Small, expensively furnished in antiques, with a few symbols 
               of Amity boosterism cluttering one wall: a photo of the beach, 
               featuring a shark tower; an architect's rendering of the new 
               Holiday Inn, some charts and graphs showing upward progress, 
               a few stills of businessmen's luncheons, plaques, awards, 
               etc.

                                     VAUGHN
                         Are you serious?

                                     BRODY
                         Of course. Look -- I've got some 
                         missing persons, fatalities, evidence 
                         of a large predator...

                                     VAUGHN
                         No one has seen a shark -- no fin, 
                         no bites, nothing. Be realistic.

                                     BRODY
                         I got a feeling. I have to act on it -- 
                         you can understand that, can't you?

                                     VAUGHN
                         Of course I can, but can't it wait? 
                         These things cost money, and this 
                         town doesn't have much money.

                                     BRODY
                         We have to do something.

                                     VAUGHN
                         We have done something -- hell, we 
                         damn near went broke putting up a 
                         shark watch tower on the beach -- 
                         it's the only one in 2000 miles, 
                         y'know.

                                     BRODY
                         I know, I know...

                                     VAUGHN
                         And I stood by while you told the 
                         people from Ramada and Marriott that 
                         if they put up a hotel they'd need 
                         $800,000 worth of steel net around 
                         their beaches! In New England? We 
                         all lost on that one.

                                     BRODY
                         It's still a good idea.

                                     VAUGHN
                         Martin, when we build up our tax 
                         base a little, you can have everything 
                         you want; right now, the town's broke.

                                     BRODY
                         Please, Larry -- there's good reason.
                         Those water skiers...

                                     VAUGHN
                              (interrupting)
                         A tragedy. But that was a boating 
                         accident; no bites, no sharks, nothing 
                         but a boating accident.

                                     BRODY
                         Two of them are still missing!

                                     VAUGHN
                         There's always deaths in these waters 
                         that never turn up. Are they all 
                         shark victims?

                                     BRODY
                         Maybe they are!

               Brody's overstated his case, and he realizes it.

                                     VAUGHN
                         Bullshit.

                                     BRODY
                              (shouting)
                         Bullshit? I'll give you bullshit -- 
                         there's a dead whale out there with 
                         bites all over it!

                                     VAUGHN
                              (shouting back)
                         What am I, an ass? When you called 
                         me, I called Elkins, and her bosses. 
                         Nothing she saw is proof of anything.

                                     BRODY
                         Someone has to do something.

                                     VAUGHN
                              (back in control)
                         Don't push it this time. If you do, 
                         it won't turn out the way you want, 
                         I guarantee you that.

               The two men study each other for a long moment. Then,

                                     VAUGHN
                         I've got to get back to work.

               He holds the door for Brody, who walks out as Vaughn lags 
               behind, locking up his sanctum.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. AMITY BEACH ROAD - DAY (DUSK)

               Brody is alone in the jeep, headed for the safety of home 
               and family. He drives past the town's billboard: it's covered 
               with an architect's rendering of the Amity Holiday Inn. The 
               sign reads: "WHEN IN AMITY, ENJOY THE HOLIDAY INN."

               Plastered across it is an added streamer: "NOW OPEN." Barely 
               visible underneath are older notices: "UNDER CONSTRUCTION," 
               and "OPENING IN JUNE."

               As Brody passes the sign, he impulsively swings off the main 
               road and heads down towards the beach.

               EXT. BEACH - DUSK

               Brody is on restless patrol, checking the water's edge as he 
               continues on home. As he drives along, he sees: a clambake; 
               some teen-agers in a group, necking and dancing; and a few 
               solitary surfcasters and fishermen.

               The beach is deserted, the sun is setting, and Brody and his 
               jeep have the sand to themselves. It's then that he sees 
               something:

               BRODY'S POINT OF VIEW

               A big bow section of a ruined, burnt boat is bobbing in the 
               surf just off the beach ahead. It's a piece of the 
               waterskiers' boat; Brody heads towards it.

               ANGLE ON THE SURF

               As Brody slows his jeep just short of the water, and gets 
               out to look at the flotsam. His shoes get wet. He backs up 
               onto dry sand, then tries to edge closer to examine this 
               object.

               It bobs up and down in the surf; Brody makes "Get in here" 
               motions. The junk resists.

                                     BRODY
                         Come on, give a guy a break.

               No response. He takes off his shoes and socks, and rolls up 
               his trouser legs. A silly sight. He wades into the water 
               after it.

                                     BRODY
                         Come on. Here boy. Come to Poppa...

               It eludes him, and he flounders after it. A big wave breaks 
               across his crotch.

                                     BRODY
                         Hoo! Cold!

               He's almost there, it's just beyond his reach, he's got it, 
               he's lost it, he has it again, it's slippery...

                                     BRODY
                              (ad lib)
                         Come here. Come on, Sweetheart. You 
                         bastard. A little closer... Here 
                         y'go...

               Then, he's got it ---

                                     BRODY
                              (exultant)
                         Gotcha!

               CLOSE ON BRODY IN THE WATER

               As he grabs the ruined wood, and pulls it towards him. 
               Suddenly, the mass of wreckage breaks apart, and something 
               lunges out of the mess and into Brody.

               SHOCK CUT CLOSEUP - "THE THING"

               Brody is suddenly pinned under a soggy charred horror; the 
               gory remains of Diane, burnt beyond recognition,: flesh peeled 
               away, discolored, charred, ruined by days in salt water. He 
               screams, and scrabbles in the wet sand, trying to get out of 
               the dreadful clutches of the half-human thing he's dredged 
               from the water.

               ANGLE ON BRODY

               Extricating himself, puking, retching, splashing water on 
               his face, washing his hands frantically, just behind him, 
               The Thing lying on the sand, a gruesome joke played by the 
               sea.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               INT. BRODY'S OFFICE - NIGHT - EXTREME CLOSEUP - CYANIDE 
               BOTTLE

               Macro close on a pharmaceutical bottle of Sodium Cyanide, 
               from which a syringe is withdrawing a healthy dose. Follow 
               the syringe and reveal Brody, working at his desk in the 
               deserted office. He is injecting the deadly chemical into 
               some jacketed .38 hollow-point ammunition; a dozen cartridges 
               are lined up in neat array, he is filling the last of them, 
               sealing the points with wax from a burning red candle. The 
               radio scanner is monitoring the local police band: routine 
               reports faintly in the b.g. -- a slow night in pre-season 
               Amity.

               ANGLE ON BRODY

               As a sound at the door makes him look up. He hides the odd 
               gear as Hendricks enters, starched and crisp in his uniform.

                                     HENDRICKS
                         Chief?

                                     BRODY
                         In here.

                                     HENDRICKS
                         I missed you at the funeral home. 
                         Santos said you were here.

                                     BRODY
                         You didn't miss much. Christ, what a 
                         mess.

                                     HENDRICKS
                         Positive I.D.?

                                     BRODY
                         The woman passenger on the boat that 
                         blew up.

                                     HENDRICKS
                         Oh.

               There's an awkward pause. Brody sees the box with the divers' 
               stuff sitting where it was left earlier.

                                     BRODY
                         What about that camera?

                                     HENDRICKS
                         What camera?

                                     BRODY
                         That one -- from the wreck. You 
                         brought it up, did you look inside 
                         it?

               Hendricks' guilty look confirms he didn't.

                                     BRODY
                         Well, what the hell -- might be 
                         something worth seeing. Take it 
                         somewhere and see if there's film in 
                         it...

                                     HENDRICKS
                              (catching on)
                         If there is, develop it!

                                     BRODY
                         You got it.

               The Deputy rummages in the locker, happy to be on the trail.

                                     HENDRICKS
                         I know just where to go.

                                     BRODY
                         Not the drugstore!

                                     HENDRICKS
                         Of course not, They're closed. Phil 
                         Fogarty's place. He'll do it for me.

                                     BRODY
                         The drugstore's closed? What the 
                         hell time is it?

                                     HENDRICKS
                         Nine-thirty, ten maybe.

                                     BRODY
                         Shit -- I'm late for dinner... Close 
                         up, okay?

               And he runs for the door, the speed-loaders with the Cyanide 
               bullets safely in his pocket.

                                     BRODY
                              (at the door)
                         Oh yeah -- I'm expecting a long 
                         distance call, very important. Give 
                         them my home phone.

                                     HENDRICKS
                         Right.

               Brody pats his pockets to make sure the speed-loaders are 
               safe inside, then exits. As Hendricks watches him go,

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. BRODY HOUSE - NIGHT

               Brody's jeep pulls up, and he gets out, beat. He is slouching 
               towards the door when he hears the phone ring inside. He 
               perks up, and starts to move faster.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. BRODY HOUSE - NIGHT

               Ellen is on the phone in the den as Brody enters the house.

               The Kids are on the floor in front of the TV, playing an 
               electronic video game that pings and beeps softly under the 
               following.

                                     ELLEN
                              (into the phone)
                         Thank you. I'll tell him.

                                     BRODY
                         For me?

                                     ELLEN
                              (hanging up)
                         Sort of -- Matthew Hooper is aboard 
                         the research vessel Aurora, presently 
                         in the Antarctic Ocean, and won't be 
                         in radio range until half-past next 
                         spring.

                                     BRODY
                         Damn.

               He starts upstairs, casually concealing the towel-wrapped 
               package of gun and ammunition.

                                     MIKE
                         Is Hooper coming to dinner?

                                     BRODY
                         Not till next year.

               He goes upstairs, Ellen waits a few beats, then follows him.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. BRODY HOUSE - UPSTAIRS - NIGHT

               Brody comes up the stairs and goes into the bedroom, where 
               he carefully puts the gun in the bed table. Ellen finds him.

                                     BRODY
                         Oh, hi -- How was dinner?

                                     ELLEN
                         Oh, perfect -- a 75 per cent family 
                         affair. Where were you?

                                     BRODY
                              (getting up)
                         Santos' place.

               They both know what that means -- the morgue. Brody goes 
               into the bathroom and starts scrubbing his hands compulsively.

               INT. BRODY HOUSE - BATHROOM AND HALLWAY - NIGHT

               Ellen follows Brody, watches as he washes under too-hot water.

                                     BRODY
                         Oww!

                                     ELLEN
                         Careful. What's wrong?

                                     BRODY
                         Nothing.

                                     ELLEN
                         Nothing, huh?

                                     BRODY
                         That's what I said. Is there any of 
                         that hand cleaner stuff?

                                     ELLEN
                         Use the little brush there. Why were 
                         you at Santos'?

                                     BRODY
                         Found one of the missing victims 
                         from that boat deal.

                                     ELLEN
                         Oh. Want to talk about it?

                                     BRODY
                         No.

                                     ELLEN
                         Terrific.

               Mike comes up the stairs, and is starting into his room when 
               Brody spots him; Sean is just behind him.

                                     BRODY
                         Michael.

                                     MIKE
                         Yeah?

                                     BRODY
                         You want to come here a minute?

               Mike shrugs and crosses to his father; Sean whizzes past on 
               into his room.

                                     SEAN
                         Hi Dad.

                                     BRODY
                         Hiya yourself.

                                     MIKE
                         What is it?

               He expects something: this is a formal audience with the 
               Head of The House.

                                     BRODY
                         I got something for you to do 
                         tomorrow.

                                     MIKE
                         I kind of had plans...

                                     BRODY
                         Sailing?
                              (Mike nods)
                         Forget it. You're beached. Grounded. 
                         No more boats.

                                     MIKE
                         Hey, come on...

                                     BRODY
                         No backtalk! I spoke to Upton, at 
                         the beach, and he's got a job for 
                         you there. You can work until school 
                         starts.

                                     ELLEN
                         All summer?

                                     BRODY
                         He wanted a job, he's got one. I 
                         want to see that boat out of the 
                         water by tomorrow night.

               We see Sean's door opening as he peeps into the hall to see 
               what the fuss is about.

               ANGLE ON SEAN'S DOOR

               It opens a few inches, he looks out at the grownups and his 
               brother, decides he wants no part of this, and quietly closes 
               the door.

                                     MIKE (O.S.)
                         Dad, please...

                                     BRODY (O.S.)
                         Tomorrow night. Out of the water.

               ANGLE ON THE HALLWAY

               Mike silently storms into his room, not-so-silently slamming 
               the door as he exits. From inside the room, loud rock music 
               muffled behind the door -- an expression of teen-age 
               rebellion.

                                     ELLEN
                         Not so loud!

               The music lowers its volume. Brody turns to go into the 
               bedroom, to take his shoes off, to go to bed...

                                     BRODY
                         I know what you're going to say.

                                     ELLEN
                         Do you?

                                     BRODY
                              (on the bed)
                         In the city, it happened all the 
                         time -- some Kid o.d.'s on a rooftop, 
                         top, a drunk gets cut in pieces under 
                         the Brooklyn local, old people die 
                         alone in shitty apartments and three 
                         weeks later someone calls the cops 
                         because of the smell and the flies.  
                         Call the cops. What are we, immune?

                                     ELLEN
                         It was bad, wasn't it.

                                     BRODY
                         The goddamn smell is always the same.
                              (he shudders at the 
                              recollection)

                                     ELLEN
                         Are you going to be able to sleep?

                                     BRODY
                         Yeah. I think so.
                              (he raises his voice)
                         Mike! Keep it down, for chrissake!

               Ellen gets up, and quietly closes the door. The upstairs 
               hallway is empty, the doors closed. The Brody household 
               compartmented and closed for the night.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               EXT. AMITY BEACH - DAY

               The familiar striped cabanas flank the white sands; there's 
               a crowd of midweek seasonal tourists and locals oblivious to 
               the tall steel tower that dominates the beach.

               A classy van outfitted for passengers pulls into the parking 
               area, followed by Vaughn's Cadillac; the parking attendant 
               waves them into a preferential area, where they disembark:

               Vaughn, Peterson, Ellen, and some more prospects, including 
               a woman named Bryant and her daughter, Renee.

                                     PETERSON
                         This is the town beach; the 
                         development naturally has its own 
                         private access, but I wanted you to 
                         see the concession area. Look at 
                         that sand -- like sugar!

               He scoops up a handful of the fine powder. Ellen directs the 
               attention of the photographers.

                                     ELLEN
                         During the summer, the sun sets right 
                         there...
                              (she points)
                         Over the water. Beautiful.

                                     VAUGHN
                              (to Ellen)
                         I'll say hello for you.

               Ellen nods, preoccupied. Vaughn strolls away, headed in the 
               direction of the cabanas. Mary Nichols, a local Selectwoman, 
               emerges from behind the counter of one of the concessions.

                                     NICHOLS
                         Hello -- selling some more of the 
                         good life?

                                     ELLEN
                         A piece here, a piece there, it all 
                         adds up.

                                     NICHOLS
                         Your husband's been here all morning. 
                         What's he doing?

                                     ELLEN
                              (good-naturedly)
                         His job.

               Michael Brody, dressed in township workman's coveralls, is 
               repainting some flaking woodwork. Sean is happily mixing 
               paint. Vaughn joins them.

                                     VAUGHN
                         Your dad got you working?

                                     MIKE
                         Yeah.

               He continues his chore, without enthusiasm.

                                     SEAN
                         I'm helping.

                                     VAUGHN
                         You know where your dad is?

                                     MIKE
                         Up there.

               He points at the tower.

                                     VAUGHN
                         Oh, for Christ's sake.

               He crosses briskly to where Peterson is finishing.

                                     PETERSON
                         And if you have any questions about 
                         recreational possibilities, Ellen 
                         Brody here will be happy to answer 
                         them.

                                     VAUGHN
                         Len, can I see you a minute?

               Peterson excuses himself and joins the Mayor.

                                     PETERSON
                         I think we got a couple of live ones.

                                     VAUGHN
                         Brody's riding his tower.

                                     PETERSON
                              (looking up)
                         Oh, shit.

               BRODY IN THE TOWER

               sweeping the water with binoculars, restless eyes trying to 
               scan everything, a grim watchman high over the heads of the 
               unseeing crowd.

               ON THE WATER

               Larry Vaughn, Jr. comes skimming in close to the surf. Bob 
               is handling the sheets, Larry is giving young Jackie sailing 
               lessons -- at the moment he's showing her how the tiller 
               works.  He's on her like glue.

                                     JACKIE
                         This is fun! Can we go faster?

                                     LARRY
                              (to Bob)
                         Trim.

               Bob does, Larry trims the main, and the hull lifts.

                                     JACKIE
                         Yay!

               She snuggles in Larry's arms. He waves to someone.

                                     LARRY
                         That's my dad!

               Jackie waves without seeing.

               ON THE BEACH

               Vaughn waves back, preoccupied. Near him, Mike Brody looks 
               up, his face grim, jealous, and now a little nuts. He splashes 
               paint onto the wood with angry abandon.

                                     VAUGHN
                              (to Peterson)
                         Wave to my son.

                                     PETERSON
                              (waving)
                         How the hell do we get him down from 
                         there?

                                     VAUGHN
                         Maybe nobody will notice. Let's get 
                         them back in the bus.

               Mrs. Bryant approaches them, tugging her daughter.

                                     MRS. BRYANT
                         Renee wants to know what that man is 
                         doing way up there?

                                     PETERSON
                         He's, ah, watching. A lookout.

                                     MRS. BRYANT
                         For what?

                                     RENEE
                              (a precocious little 
                              girl)
                         It's a shark tower. I saw one in 
                         Florida. He's looking for sharks.

                                     VAUGHN
                         It's an observation platform. That's 
                         our Chief of Police. He's just 
                         checking it.

                                     PETERSON
                         Normally, it's used for, ah, bird 
                         watching. Nature observation. Weather 
                         measurements, that sort of thing.
                              (a little desperate)
                         Ellen, we're running late!

                                     ELLEN
                         Okay. Folks, if we could get back 
                         on, we'll show you the country club, 
                         and stop for lunch...

               At the mention of lunch, the prospects, all hungry, begin 
               flocking back into the van. Peterson herds them along.

                                     PETERSON
                         The country club has an 18-hole 
                         course, putting greens, and twelve 
                         tennis courts...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               BRODY IN THE TOWER

               still scanning. His body suddenly tenses. There's something 
               out there. He mashes his binoculars to his eyes, trying to 
               get a better look.

               HIS POINT OF VIEW (PROCESS)

               Through the binoculars, something big and black, moving under 
               the buoys and into the swimming area.

               BRODY AGAIN

               He can't believe it. But looking past him, we can see it 
               with the unaided eye: a seething dark mass, moving through 
               the water towards the unprotected bathers.

                                     BRODY
                              (screaming)
                         Out of the water! Everyone out of 
                         the water!

               No one can hear him. A few little faces look up, unable to 
               catch what he's saying. He starts climbing down the ladder 
               shouting.

                                     BRODY
                         Get out of the water! Tell everyone 
                         to get out! Now! Out of the water!

               ANGLE ON PETERSON, VAUGHN, AND NICHOLS

               reacting.

                                     VAUGHN
                              (recalling another 
                              panic)
                         Oh, my God...

                                     PETERSON
                         What the hell is he doing?

                                     NICHOLS
                         Oh, no!

               ELLEN, MIKE, AND SEAN

               Looking up, startled at Brody's sudden panic.

               THE WATER

               The dark mass almost on top of the swimmers, who are starting 
               to look around. Most of them are oblivious to what's happening 
               on shore.

               FOLLOW BRODY

               as his feet hit the sand and he starts running for the water, 
               fumbling for his gun and the speed-loader with the cyanide 
               bullets. He is bumping into people, knocking little kids 
               over, stepping on blankets and umbrellas, a madman.

                                     BRODY
                         Out of the water! Now! Everyone!

               VAUGHN

               Running too, half-stumbling, half-believing, remembering...

               ELLEN

               Moving after her husband, while Mike steadies Sean, holding 
               the impulsive kid back.

                                     ELLEN
                              (seeing something)
                         Martin! No!

               ANGLE ON BRODY AGAIN

               The gun is out now, he's trying draw a bead on the shape in 
               the water; chest heaving, he tries to steady his shaky grip. 
               People see the gun and scream, throwing themselves flat on 
               the sand, running, some of them going into the water.

                                     BRODY
                         No! Don't go in! Stay out! Stay clear!

               He fires. Again. Bullets ricochet off the water, howling 
               towards the horizon. Real panic now. Four more shots.

               Reloading, ejected rounds falling bright into the sand, Brody 
               on his knees, fumbling with bullets.

               ANGLE ON A LIFEGUARD

               standing on his platform, shocked, watching the Chief of 
               Police fumbling with his gun.

                                     LIFEGUARD
                         It's bluefish! It's a school of 
                         bluefish! Chief! It's bluefish!

               ANGLE ON THE WATER

               It is bluefish -- a tight mass of them, churning up the water 
               in a dark, dense group. The swimmers look around, confused 
               by the shots and excitement.

                                     A SWIMMER
                         What's going on?

                                     ANOTHER SWIMMER
                         Fish! Anyone got a net?

                                     3RD SWIMMER
                         Someone get me a rod and reel!

               Laughter defuses the tension in the water; bathers move 
               around, some getting closer to see the fish, others leaving 
               the water to join friends and families on the sand.

               ANGLE ON THE BEACH

               where Brody is now standing, panting, coming down as a crowd 
               collects at a safe distance around him: Ellen emerges from a 
               group that includes Vaughn, Peterson, and Nichols.

                                     BRODY
                         Sorry. I'm sorry. False alarm...

               Curious crowd murmurs as they watch this lunacy. Brody 
               realizes he's fired his weapon, that spent shells litter the 
               sand at his feet.

                                     BRODY
                         Okay, it's all over, go on, it's 
                         over. No trouble...

               Ellen joins him.

                                     ELLEN
                         It's okay. It's over...

               Brody drops to his knees, fumbling for the cyanide bullets 
               in his gun, trying to put things in order, scrabbling in the 
               sand for the empty shells.

               The crowd is curious and embarrassed. Some turn away, others

               drift back to their blankets, talking about what's just 
               happened, others stare rudely. Brody is coming apart.

                                     BRODY
                         It's all right, everything's all 
                         right...

               Sean emerges from the crowd, and helps his daddy pick up the 
               bullets, Ellen moves to disperse the rudely curious.

                                     ELLEN (O.S.)
                         Let's go, everyone... Mrs. Bryant, 
                         Len, please...

               CLOSE ON BRODY AND SEAN

               He sees Sean, his eyes fill with tears, and he grabs the kid 
               in a fierce hug.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               INT. TOWN HALL - DAY

               A hurriedly called meeting of the town's Selectmen is in 
               session: Vaughn, Peterson, and three others: Kaiser, an old 
               man still in his grocery clerk's apron; Sansom; and Nichols, 
               the woman on the beach.

                                     VAUGHN
                         Brody's a good man.

                                     KAISER
                         Nobody says he isn't.

                                     PETERSON
                         You should've been out there. You 
                         should've seen him waving that gun, 
                         like a maniac. There were shots fired!

                                     VAUGHN
                         He thought he had a good reason.

                                     MS. NICHOLS
                         But that's not rational behavior!

                                     PETERSON
                         That's what I'm saying!

                                     VAUGHN
                         How many people were there?

                                     MS. NICHOLS
                         Hundred! Literally hundreds. What 
                         are they going to say about us?

                                     PETERSON
                              (to Vaughn)
                         Larry, I'm a businessman, trying to 
                         make a buck like anybody else.

                                     VAUGHN
                         So? So?

                                     PETERSON
                         So it can't be done like that. The 
                         man's a menace, plain and simple.

                                     VAUGHN
                         Look, what am I supposed to do? It's 
                         done, it's over. We have to deal 
                         with the consequences.

                                     SANSOM
                         That's what we're here to do.

                                     VAUGHN
                         All right. Let's go into my office, 
                         where we can have a little privacy.

               ANGLE FROM INSIDE VAUGHN'S OFFICE

               as the selectmen troop into the cramped quarters. Vaughn 
               deliberately closes the door as they find seats around the 
               room.

                                     VAUGHN
                         I believe we have a quorum, and 
                         informally, I suggest we call this 
                         meeting an executive session and 
                         dispense with minutes...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. BRODY'S OFFICE - DAY

               Brody, alone, is sitting at his desk, morosely studying a 
               little gold statuette of a pistol marksman. What's done is 
               done, and Brody is trying to figure out how to live with it. 
               The phone rings, is answered in the other room. The buzzer 
               sounds. Brody picks up his end.

                                     BRODY
                         Polly, no calls, please...
                              (she insists)
                         Okay, okay.
                              (he punches a button)
                         Hello... Phil? Fogarty? What 
                         pictures... I'll be right down...

               He slams down the phone and gets up to go, suddenly possessed 
               with a purpose.

               INT. DARKROOM - DAY

               Amid the equipment, clutter and proofs, some shots of the 
               holidome opening, drying on wires. Phil Fogarty, the indignant 
               fat man and town photographer, is locking the door behind an 
               impatient Brody.

                                     PHIL
                         I don't know what you did, but that 
                         kid stopped. I haven't heard one 
                         peep, not one 'breaker breaker' for 
                         days. Believe me, it's a pleasure...

                                     BRODY
                         You said something about a camera.

                                     PHIL
                         Sure, sure -- Jeff Hendricks brought 
                         in this camera, see, from underwater, 
                         and I didn't know how to get it open, 
                         but my brother-in-law, in Montauk, 
                         he works at a hi-fi store, and they 
                         sell cameras, so he...

                                     BRODY
                              (interrupting)
                         Did you get any pictures?

                                     PHIL
                         Well, yeah, I did, that's the funny 
                         thing. You can't tell much from the 
                         negatives, I was going to blow 'em 
                         up. Here's a test I did...

               He holds out an 8 x 10 proof, Brody snatches it from him.

               INSERT - PHOTOGRAPH

               Brody stares down at it. Sure enough, the ghostly outlines 
               of the Orca, underwater, a diver on the deck making a gesture 
               at the camera.

                                     BRODY (O.S.)
                         Oh, Jesus. That boat...

               ANGLE ON BRODY AND PHIL

                                     PHIL
                         Not bad -- that's a real fast lens, 
                         probably 1.4. Look at the diffusion, 
                         though...

                                     BRODY
                         What else you got?

                                     PHIL
                         Let's see -- you got a minute?

                                     BRODY
                         Come on, Phil, don't jerk me around.

                                     PHIL
                         Okay, okay -- stand over there...

               He gestures, Brody steps to one side of a table with some 
               big enamel pans for washing and developing prints. Phil 
               switches to a red light, and takes some printing paper, 
               putting it under the enlarger.

               QUICK CUTS:

               --  Enlarger light going on.

               --  Timer ticking, the hand turning.

               --  Quick negative images: water, boat, diver, hand, boat 
               again, tantalizing fragments of the opening sequence projected 
               on the enlarger's flat base.

               --  Hypo and Developer sloshing in a pan under Phil's hands.

               --  Brody staring down.

               INSERT (PROCESS)

               Quietly gaining contrast in a pan of developer, a print of 
               what at first looks like seaweed, then is unmistakably the 
               grinning jaws of the Great White.

               SUBLIMINAL FLASH CUT - SHARK

               A quick nightmare vision of Brody, alone in a sinking Orca, 
               trapped in a battered cabin interior; a Great White crashes 
               through the glass, its head huge as it lunges.

               INSERT PHOTOGRAPH IN DEVELOPER (PROCESS)

               The close-up detail of this otherwise blurred and unreadable 
               photo is unmistakably a detail from a very close view of the 
               snapping jaws of a Great White; if you hadn't seen it as a 
               memory, it would make no sense at all. For Brody, the meaning 
               is all too clear; for anyone who's never seen the monster 
               face-to-face, it's nothing.

                                     BRODY (O.S.)
                              (shaken)
                         That one there. That one...

               Phil's hands, holding plastic tongs, gently slosh the print 
               in the bath. The shark's features are indistinguishable from 
               the surrounding detail.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. TOWN HALL - NIGHT

               Brody walks into view, and starts up the steps into the town 
               hall, already lit from within. He's carrying a large envelope.

               INT. TOWN HALL - NIGHT

               The Selectmen (Kaiser, Sansom, Nichols), Len Peterson, and 
               Vaughn are seated informally around the big table.

                                     PETERSON
                              (looking up)
                         Speak of the devil.

               Brody enters, carrying the envelope with the photo.

                                     BRODY
                         Thank God you guys were all together. 
                         I got something for you. Proof!

                                     VAUGHN
                         Martin, this is kind of an official 
                         meeting

                                     BRODY
                         Perfect. Look at this ---

               He fumbles with the envelope.

                                     VAUGHN
                         Chief -- the Board of Selectmen has 
                         a question only you can answer.

                                     BRODY
                              (preoccupied)
                         What?

                                     PETERSON
                         Is Jeff Hendricks qualified to fill 
                         in as an interim Chief of Police in 
                         your absence?

                                     BRODY
                         Temporarily? Uh... sure... The 
                         question's out of left field. Why 
                         are they asking?

                                     NICHOLS
                         So Jeff could handle things? He knows 
                         the routine, he has the authority?

                                     BRODY
                         Yeah. Why?

                                     PETERSON
                         It came up during the meeting.

                                     BRODY
                         Look -- I just got this from Phil 
                         Fogarty. It was in the camera 
                         belonging to the missing divers. It 
                         proves I was right, all along.

               He throws the picture down in front of them. They bend over 
               to study it, pass it around, look at it.

                         KAISER
                 Seaweed?

                                                       NICHOLS
                                               It's underwater, isn't it? That's 
                                               why it's so dark.

                                     SANSOM
                         I don't know -- what is it?

                                     BRODY
                         It's a shark! A Great White! Jesus, 
                         it's right there!

               He snatches up the photo.

               INSERT PHOTO

               Just as before, an ambiguous pattern of light and dark; not 
               proof of anything without Brody's inner vision.

                         It's nothing I can see.

               waving the picture.

                                     BRODY
                         What are you all, blind? It's a shark. 
                         Look -- teeth, jaw, gills.

                                     PETERSON
                         Is that what it is?

                                     BRODY
                         You're damn right that's what it is.

                                     NICHOLS
                         I'm sorry, I just don't see it.

               Sansom and Kaiser agree, ad lib, "That's nothing..."

                                     VAUGHN
                         Martin, it could be anything.

                                     BRODY
                              (exploding)
                         What the hell does it take to make 
                         sense to you numbskulls? Jesus, it's 
                         right there in front of you. I know 
                         what a goddamn shark looks like, 
                         I've been through it, don't you 
                         understand? I've seen this sonofabitch 
                         before!

               The Selectmen look at each other in the face of Brody's 
               agitation. Tempers are running high.

                                     PETERSON
                         What have you seen before? This is 
                         nothing. Seaweed. Mud. Something in 
                         the lens.

                                     BRODY
                         My ass!

                                     VAUGHN
                         Be reasonable, please...

                              (to Vaughn)
                         Forget it, he won't listen.

                                     BRODY
                         There is nothing to discuss.

                                     PETERSON
                              (blowing up)
                         Will you listen to this man? Will 
                         you just listen to him?
                              (to Brody)
                         You really caused a panic on a public 
                         beach, you shoot up the place, God 
                         knows who could've been injured -- 
                         what if somebody decides to sue us? 
                         That could ruin us.

                                     BRODY
                         Is that what it is? Dollars? Money? 
                         I'll pay for it. Take it out of my 
                         salary.

                                     PETERSON
                         You don't make enough.

                                     BRODY
                         Maybe I don't make as much money as 
                         some bullshit rip-off artists around 
                         here, but I don't work the same way.

                                     PETERSON
                         What's that supposed to mean?

                                     BRODY
                         It means I don't like all that grab-
                         ass and heavy breathing with my wife, 
                         it means I know who's out to screw 
                         me here, and it means that I know 
                         something none of you know because 
                         I've been there -- and I don't want 
                         to go through that horror again. 
                         Ever!

               There's a long pause.

                                     VAUGHN
                         Martin, could you wait here for a 
                         few minutes while we make up our 
                         minds about something?

                                     BRODY
                         Go ahead, whatever it's worth.

               The Selectmen file into Vaughn's office, leaving Brody alone 
               in the room. The last one in the door very carefully makes 
               sure it's tightly shut.

               Brody sits alone at the table.

                                                                    CUT TO:

                         And Hendricks is qualified, you heard 
                         that from his own mouth.

                              (official)
                         Very well then. It is moved and 
                         seconded that Martin Brody be relieved 
                         of his duties as Chief of Police, 
                         his contract with the township be 
                         terminated, and that Jeff Hendricks 
                         be appointed Acting Chief in the 
                         interim. Those in favor?

               All the hands go up.

                                     PETERSON
                         Anyone opposed, or is it unanimous?

               Vaughn's hand goes up, the sole dissent. They stare at him.

                                     VAUGHN
                         I'm sorry, but I respect his 
                         convictions. The motion is carried.

               He goes to the door, and opens it.

                                     VAUGHN
                         Martin? Could you come in please?

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. BRODY HOUSE - NIGHT

               The police jeep pulls up and stops; although the engine's 
               shut down, Brody still sits quietly inside the car. Then his 
               hand appears at the window, and he drops an empty beer can 
               onto the lawn. Clink.

               After a while, he drops another beer can, then another, until 
               the "clinks" tell us he's polished off a six-pack on the way 
               home. Not too steady on his feet, Brody climbs out of the 
               car and starts for the door to his house.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. BRODY HOUSE - NIGHT

               Ellen is working at her desk in the den. She is looking 
               towards the door, expectantly -- it's been an unusually long 
               pause between car arrival and husband arrival. Brody enters.

                                     ELLEN
                         Hi. I closed a sale today, without 
                         Len. That's $1200 commission, if the 
                         papers go through.

                                     BRODY
                         That's great.

                                     ELLEN
                         Sean's asleep.

                                     BRODY
                         That's great too. Gorgeous.

               He takes a long look at her.

                                     BRODY
                         You look about 22 years old sitting 
                         there. Like you were doing homework...

               He goes to join her, bumping into some furniture in the dimly 
               lit room. Ellen has a beer and sandwich half-finished on her 
               desk; Brody takes a healthy swallow from the beer.

                                     ELLEN
                              (sensitive)
                         What's wrong?

                                     BRODY
                         Ooohh, nothing. I just got fired, 
                         that's all.

               He tosses the photo sloppily on the desk.

                                     ELLEN
                         What?

                                     BRODY
                         What'd I say?

                                     ELLEN
                         That you were fired.

                                     BRODY
                         Then that's what I meant. Fired. 
                         Canned. Out on my fanny. The Selectmen 
                         just made Hendricks the new Chief of 
                         Police. Just like that.

                                     ELLEN
                         Because of today? The beach?

                                     BRODY
                              (expansively)
                         No sweat. A blessing in disguise. 
                         Back to the city, you can go to 
                         Bloomingdale's without waiting six 
                         hours for the ferryboat... we're 
                         surrounded by water here, you realize 
                         that? Me, surrounded by water... 
                         Ridiculous.

                                     ELLEN
                         Stop that! We're not going any place. 
                         You love it here. Tell me what the 
                         hell happened!

                                     BRODY
                         Showed them the photo, showed them 
                         the goddamn Shark, big as life. They 
                         didn't see it. Not like me. Not like 
                         the poor son-of-a-bitch who snapped 
                         this li'l picture... He's out there, 
                         somewhere... I shot off my gun, shot 
                         off my big mouth, so they fired me...

                                     ELLEN
                              (studying the photo)
                         Honey, this is nothing... I don't 
                         know what it is. What did they...

                                     BRODY
                              (going on)
                         ...Everybody wants the job. No one 
                         wants the authority. Except Hendricks. 
                         Fine. He can go out there in that 
                         precious boat, and when he looks 
                         whitey in his big mouth he can just 
                         call me. Call me in New York... tell 
                         him to kiss my ass...

                                     ELLEN
                              (seeing his pain)
                         They have no right to treat you like 
                         that. You've given them everything. 
                         For four years, you've protected 
                         this town, the people on this 
                         island...

                                     BRODY
                         Fired me!
                              (at Ellen)
                         I'm not a hysterical man. I'm 
                         responsible. I know what I saw...

                                     ELLEN
                         I know you did...

                                     BRODY
                         I try. Goddamnit, I tried... Now, 
                         I'm tired... I can't keep fighting 
                         it... I'm too tired... I'm... I'm...

               Brody's slipping under; the beers and the day have finally 
               overcome him. He slumps in Ellen's arms.

                                     ELLEN
                         You're drunk is what you are...

               She eases him onto the couch, tucking a comforter over his 
               inert shape.

                                     ELLEN
                         Take it easy... Easy...

               ANGLE ON THE STAIRWELL

               Sean comes down the stairs, sleepy, in his pajamas.

                                     SEAN
                         Is dad home? I heard something...

               He comes into the darkened den.

               ELLEN AND SEAN

                                     ELLEN
                         Shhhh. Go back upstairs. Daddy's 
                         sleeping.

               Sean finds the photo, and stares at it idly.

                                     SEAN
                         What's this?

                                     ELLEN
                         Nothing, sweetheart. Seaweed.

               She takes him by his sleepy hand and leads him out of the 
               room, leaving Brody tucked in on the couch, dead to the world.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. NEWSSTORE - NIGHT

               This is the Amity teen-ager's hangout -- a newsstand and 
               pinball arcade with a minimal refreshment counter where soft 
               drinks and submarine sandwiches are dispensed. A jukebox is 
               blaring some n.d. rock music. Present are Donnie, Doug, Timmy, 
               Bob, Larry Vaughn Jr., Brooke, Marge, Denise, Jane, Andy, 
               and Mike. The boys are passing around hot-rod van and custom 
               boat magazines; the girls are looking at Silver Screen, Tiger 
               Beat, People, and Time. Andy and Mike are at the counter, 
               splitting a sandwich.

                                     DOUG
                              (holding a book)
                         That's what I want -- a gaff rig.

                                     TIMMY
                         Gaff rigged? Why not a staysail 
                         schooner? Go anywhere. Look at this -- 
                         the Mayan, an Alden schooner.

                                     BOB
                         Hey, Mike -- I saw your dad over at 
                         the town hall.

                                     MIKE
                         I know.

                                     DOUG
                              (innocently)
                         Did he really freak out at the beach?

                                     MIKE
                         I don't know.

                                     ANDY
                         Hey, it's all bullshit. Anyone want 
                         to play pong for money?

               No one does. There's a bustle at the door, and some couples 
               enter from the movies: Patrick and Lucy, Ed and Tina, Polo 
               and Jackie. There are a lot of ad-lib greetings;

                                     LARRY
                         How was the show?

                                     ED
                         Yech.

                                     TINA
                         It was okay.

                                     PATRICK
                         I'd rather go the lighthouse.

                                     LUCY
                         Who wouldn't.

                                     POLO
                         Anyone want to go the lighthouse?

                                     BROOKE
                         Now? At night?

                                     POLO
                         Nah. Tomorrow. Early, spend the day. 
                         My folks left two cases of beer in 
                         the garage.

                                     PATRICK
                         Is it still there?

                                     POLO
                         Nope. Got it in my boat.

                                     LUCY
                         All-right.

                                     JACKIE
                         Let's go for it.

               There's a general ad-lib agreement to organize a day's sailing 
               picnic.

                                     TINA
                         Mike, you going?

                                     MIKE
                         Why shouldn't I?

                                     LARRY
                         I thought you might still be painting 
                         the restrooms at the beach.

               Laughter from the gang.

                                     BROOKE
                         Anyone want a coke or anything?

               They break up into pairs and trios, some going for the soda 
               fountain, others hanging out by the magazines.

               ANGLE ON JACKIE AND MIKE

                                     JACKIE
                         I'd like to go out to the lighthouse 
                         with you.

                                     MIKE
                         I'm not sure I can.

                                     JACKIE
                         It'll be fun, come on!

                                     MIKE
                         Maybe you and Brooke could come over 
                         to the town beach...

                         No way. Everybody's going sailing. 
                         If you don't want to take me, just 
                         say so.

                                     MIKE
                         That's not it. My dad told me not to 
                         go.

                                     JACKIE
                         You do everything your parents tell 
                         you?

                                     MIKE
                         No.

                                     JACKIE
                         Good. I'll be on the dock at eight.
                              (to the gang)
                         Eight o'clock, everybody!

               They ad lib agreement.

                                     JACKIE
                              (aside to Mike)
                         I really want to to be there.
                              (to the crowd)
                         Who's bringing the wine? And who's 
                         got a quarter for the box?

               Brooke takes Mike aside, as Jackie goes to the jukebox.

               Larry is right there with a quarter, standing next to her as 
               they select a tune.

                                     BROOKE
                         She just likes to tease. I think she 
                         really likes you.

                                     MIKE
                         Great.

               Some rock music starts, and we:

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. BRODY BEDROOM - DAY

               Ellen is asleep under the covers, Brody, still in his clothes 
               from the night before, is sprawled on top; obviously he's 
               stumbled upstairs sometime during the night. There's a noise 
               down the hall, from Mike's room. Brody stirs, but doesn't 
               wake up.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. MIKE'S ROOM - DAY

               Mike is holding a lamp that's almost fallen -- the noise we 
               just heard. He's almost dressed, but not quite satisfied 
               with his image in the mirror. He takes off his clean shirt, 
               and checks a more comfortable, worn shirt. A brief sniff to 
               make sure it's okay for another day, and he puts it on; he 
               tiptoes to the hall, where a noise stops him in his tracks.

               INT. BRODY HALLWAY - DAY

               Mike is frozen in his part-opened bedroom door. Sean's door 
               opens, and little Sean, also fully dressed, comes sneaking 
               out.

                                     SEAN
                              (whispering)
                         You're going out.

                                     MIKE
                         Yeah.

                                     SEAN
                         You're going sailing.

                                     MIKE
                         Maybe.

                                     SEAN
                         Take me.

                                     MIKE
                         No.

                                     SEAN
                              (louder)
                         I want to go with you!

                                     MIKE
                         Quiet!  Shhh!

                                     SEAN
                              (even louder)
                         Michael...

                                     MIKE
                         Okay, okay. Close your door.

               Sean does, and happily tiptoes with exaggerated stealth to 
               Mike; the two of them start downstairs.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. BRODY HOUSE

               Michael and Sean are walking away towards the road into town.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. BRODY UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - DAY

               Brody emerges from the bathroom, dressed in sweatshirt, and 
               cutoffs: no uniform today. He starts downstairs, stopping 
               only to look into Mike's room. It's empty.

                                     BRODY
                         Good morning, America...

               A grin crosses his face -- "My son, the Don Juan..." He goes 
               downstairs.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. BRODY KITCHEN - DAY

               Brody enters from upstairs. He heats coffee. Ellen enters 
               dressed for work. He pours two cups.

                                     ELLEN
                         What're you going to do today?

                                     BRODY
                         Turn in the car. Clean my desk, 
                         explain things to our sons, then 
                         maybe get shit-faced and punch your 
                         boss.

                                     ELLEN
                         I'll give notice.

                                     BRODY
                         Don't rush into it -- we may need 
                         the income.

               She pours the coffee, they drink it for a moment.

                                     BRODY
                         Mike left early. Couldn't wait to 
                         make out. Must be a morning man.

               Ellen and Brody sip their coffee quietly for a few moments.

               Mrs. Silvera arrives, carrying groceries.

                                     MRS. SILVERA
                         Morning. Anything special today?

                         ELLEN
                 Sean's not up yet. You 
                 know what he likes, 
                 just some Fruit Loops 
                 and milk. No candy.

                                                       BRODY
                                               The sink upstairs is busted. 
                                               Try some Drano, or a 
                                               plunger, maybe. Or call 
                                               your brother, the plumber, 
                                               what's his name...

                                     MRS. SILVERA
                         Frankie. He's my cousin.

                                     BRODY
                         Frankie. Okay. Ask him if he needs 
                         an apprentice.

               Brody and Ellen are at the door.

                                     MRS. SILVERA
                         Have a nice day.

               They leave.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. DOCKSIDE - DAY

               The Kids are into their boats, fitting out for a day of 
               recreational offshore sailing. Mike and Andy are readying 
               his Tornado, while Sean gets in the way. In the b.g., 
               Hendricks can be seen puttering around on the Amity police 
               boat.

                                     ANDY
                         If you're beached, why are we doing 
                         this? For practice?

                                     MIKE
                         Yeah.

                                     ANDY
                         Then why are we futzing around the 
                         dock? We can make a few bucks working 
                         at the beach.

               Sean knocks something over, Mike snaps at him.

                                     MIKE
                         Look -- if you're going to get in 
                         the way, you can just go home.

                                     SEAN
                         I'm not in the way. Andy, am I in 
                         the way?

                                     ANDY
                         You're always in the way.

               Marge joins them, scooping Sean up.

                                     MARGE
                         This guy giving you any trouble?

                                     SEAN
                         Put me down!

                                     ANDY
                         Put him down in the water.

                                     MARGE
                              (to Sean)
                         You want to go out in my boat?

                                     SEAN
                         Yeah.

                                     MIKE
                         Would you take him?

                                     MARGE
                         Sure.

                                     ANDY
                         You've just made someone very happy.

               Marge and Sean go over to her Lightening. Brooke and Jackie 
               come down the dock, dressed for sailing.

                                     BROOKE
                         Mike! Are you going out?

                                     MIKE
                         Maybe.

                                     JACKIE
                         I thought you were grounded.

                                     MIKE
                         I can go out if I want to.

                                     ANDY
                         You can?

                                     JACKIE
                         You going to the lighthouse?

                                     MIKE
                         Why not?

                                     ANDY
                         I could give you a dozen good reasons.

                                     MIKE
                              (to Andy)
                         Shut up.

                                     ANDY
                         Okay, okay, don't say I didn't remind 
                         you.

                                     JACKIE
                         Is there room on your boat for all 
                         of us?

               Mike looks: Andy, Jackie, Brooke, himself... Timmy moves in, 
               sensing the chance of a lifetime.

                                     ANDY
                         Well, we're pretty crowded, and I 
                         don't know when we're leaving...

               Timmy makes his move.

                                     TIMMY
                         I've got room.

                                     BROOKE
                         Great.
                              (to Andy)
                         That's okay -- I'll go with Timmy.

                                     TIMMY
                         You will?

                                     BROOKE
                         Sure.

               And she walks towards his boat, looking back for him to 
               follow. He's dumbstruck by his sudden good fortune.

                                     TIMMY
                         Fan-tas-tic!

               He runs to join her, untying mooring lines like crazy; they're 
               together again at last for the first time. Andy is left 
               shuffling with Mike and Jackie.

                                     JACKIE
                         I'm ready.

               And she plops down in Mike's boat, ready to be taken. 
               Anywhere.

                                     JACKIE
                         Come on, you guys.

                                     ANDY
                         Well, I don't know...

               Jackie flashes him one of her pouty little smiles. Why break 
               one heart when you can break two? Or more?

                                     JACKIE
                         Please come with us?

               Mike is glaring. The message is clear, if unspoken.

                                     JACKIE
                         For me...?

                                     ANDY
                         What the hell. For you...

               Andy joins them.  Mike casts off, while Andy helps, and Jackie 
               sits there, looking cute.

               ANGLE ON LARRY AND BOB

               watching what's going on.

                                     BOB
                         I thought you said she was going 
                         with us?

                                     LARRY
                         Let's just go sailing, okay?

                                     BOB
                              (casting off)
                         Want to talk about it?

                                     LARRY
                         Want to swim home?

               Bob gets the message and shuts up. The Sizzler fills its 
               sails, and points out of the harbor.

               WIDE ON THE HARBOR

               Lots of day-sailing Kids, a few bigger, adult boats, some 
               working fishermen and sport fishers; a typical recreational 
               boating mix. The Kids are finding the same general direction, 
               pointing out of the harbor.

               QUICK CUTS

               -- Sails being trimmed.

               --  Brooke and Timmy, staring into each other's eyes as he 
               sets a course straight for the lighthouse.

               --  Larry, lifting a hull, almost losing Bob.

               EXT. HARBOR MOUTH - DAY

               The Kids' boats, in a loose bunch, slipping out to sea.

               REVERSE - LOOKING OUT TO SEA

               The dive class boat, isolated near the channel, a group of 
               Kids in wet suits and tanks assembled with three adult 
               instructors: Tom Andrews, Crosby, and Sparky.

               EXT. DIVING BOAT - DAY

               Andrews and his assistant instructor, Sparky, are addressing 
               the class, when Mike and Andy's "Green Machine" sails by, 
               close.

                                     ANDREWS
                         Hey! Nicholas! You're supposed to be 
                         in class!

                                     ANDY
                         Today I'm staying topside. You dive 
                         for me!

                                     ANDREWS
                         I'm going for lobster.

                                     JACKIE
                         Great! Find one for me.

                                     ANDY
                         With butter, if they got any...

               Andrews dismisses them with a good-natured wave.

                                     ANDREWS
                         So long, turkies.

               He turns to his class.

                                     ANDREWS
                         Sparky will take you down today. If 
                         everyone's got a buddy, we'll drop.

               The class dutifully lines up and starts going in, while in 
               the b.g. the Kids sailboats head out to sea. Andrews' two 
               partners, Crosby and Sparky, get ready to follow the class 
               over.

                                     CROSBY
                              (to Andrews)
                         Let's get some dinner.

               He goes over, Andrews following. Sparky is with the class, 
               signaling "Down;" they submerge like clumsy seals.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               UNDERWATER

               The class, paired up, is drifting down; Sparky offering 
               encouragement as they descend. Andrews and Crosby are already 
               disappearing, swimming away with strong kicks.

               FOLLOWING ANDREWS AND CROSBY

               as they go over the edge of a shelf and drop into darker, 
               deeper waters. Crosby checks his depth, his watch, looks 
               around...

               HIS POINT OF VIEW

               far above him, the class, going about their business.

               Below him, murk, depth, and suddenly, a big lunker bass.

               Andrews sees it, too.

               ANGLE - ON ANDREWS

               Assuming Crosby is following, he takes off, following the 
               big lunker. Crosby, hung up in some minor equipment problem, 
               misses seeing him go. The two men are separated. Follow 
               Andrews as he twists and turns after the bass, going deeper, 
               losing him in the rocks, suddenly rounding a boulder, and 
               meeting, almost face-to-face, horror:

               BELOW HIM THE SHARK

               The Great White Shark, taking the striper in a single gulp, 
               it's looking up at Andrews with one glassy doll's eye; it 
               turns to face him directly, and we see the scar; ugly, red 
               and black, charred flesh from jaw back on the right side, 
               eyes and teeth gleaming like raw bone in the massive, uncaring 
               face.

               Andrews' mouth clamps violently on his mouthpiece, then goes 
               wide as he screams in fear into the water. Finning backwards, 
               he ditches his weights, gulps for air, and yanks the cord on 
               his safety vest. It balloons out, and pulls him up, surging 
               towards the surface. The mouthpiece, useless, falls away 
               from his lips.

               Eyes closed, hose dangling, Andrews hurtles upward, holding 
               his breath in a final, fatal panic, passing a startled Crosby.

               THE DIVERS

               look over at the rocketing ascent. What's wrong? Sparky 
               signals "up," and they begin to carefully follow him towards 
               the surface. Crosby's already surfacing.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               DECK OF THE DIVING BOAT - DAY

               Andrews is on his side, bloody froth on his lips. One of the 
               class is clinging to his legs, trying to arrest his 
               convulsions. Sparky is holding his shoulders, trying to 
               administer mouth-to-mouth.

                                     SPARKY
                         Get us in! For Christ's sake, get us 
                         in!

               In his arms, Andrews writhes, pain knotting his limbs.

               Behind them, in the water, the fin surfaces, and casually 
               turns towards... the ocean. The Shark is headed for the sea. 
               And for the now distant Kids in their sailboats, dotting the 
               horizon in their familiar bright colors.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. OCEAN - ED AND TINA'S SANDPIPER - DAY

               They are alone. In the middle distance, the rest of the Kids' 
               sails can be seen, headed for the lighthouse in the distance. 
               The Sandpiper's sails are luffing, they're making no headway.

                                     TINA
                         You want to tack, or just leave her 
                         pointed up like this?

                                     ED
                              (snuggling close)
                         Just like this.

                                     TINA
                         What about sailing?

                                     ED
                         The tide's running. It'll take us to 
                         the light.

                                     TINA
                         It'll take us to Budapest if you're 
                         not careful.

               Ed is lashing the rudder as they continue to drift with the 
               current.

                                     ED
                         First things first.

               He fumbles in a cooler chest, produces a bottle of wine.

                                     TINA
                         What about the others?

                                     ED
                         They'll be there when we get there. 
                         Might even have a fire started.

                                     TINA
                         What're we going to do in the mean 
                         time?

                                     ED
                         I dunno. We'll think of something.

               He pours the wine into the two paper cups.

                                     ED
                         But first, a little juice...

                                     TINA
                         And second?

                                     ED
                              (kissing her)
                         Mmmmmm.

                                     TINA
                              (resisting)
                         Wait a minute. Promise me something.

                                     ED
                         Anything. Anything.

                                     TINA
                         That you'll put down a blanket. I've 
                         got black and blue marks all over my 
                         butt, and my Mom's getting uptight 
                         about them.

                                     ED
                         You got it.

               And he fumbles for a blanket in a locker, thumping and banging 
               gear around as he rummages for it. Tina sips wine contentedly, 
               satisfied to wait.

               UNDERWATER

               The Sandpiper's hull, alone above us, as the Shark rises 
               with dreadful certainty, attracted by the erratic sounds of 
               Ed's hasty search.

               ANGLE ON TINA - WATCHING THE OCEAN

               The terrible fin breaks the surface, about 20 yards out, 
               then dips and disappears. Then, impossibly fast, the entire 
               Sandpiper is lifted from underneath by a powerful surge, as 
               the Shark lunges up against it from below, an unseen horror.

               Ed is knocked over the side, into the water.

               ANGLE ON ED

               as he breaks the surface, shaking the hair out of his eyes, 
               trying to orient himself, finding the boat. He starts to 
               swim for it, Tina extending an arm to help him climb aboard.

               ANGLE OVER THE GUNWALE, TOWARDS ED

               He has barely taken two strokes when a powerful force takes 
               him from below the surface, rushing him towards us through 
               the water. Tina screams. Before Ed can react to the pain, he 
               is slammed face first into the boat. His jaw breaks, blood 
               smears his nose and lip.

               His hands grab the wooden-cap rail with a death-grip.

               REVERSE

               Tina is staring down at the water, terror-stricken; Ed's 
               arms and head are f.g., as he locks onto the boat with 
               desperate hands.

               INSERT

               Ed's hands on the rail, knuckles white, an iron grip. With 
               awful finality, the force pulls down, and the wood shatters 
               and splits away as Ed's hands are pulled down and under by 
               the awful force.

               TINA

               her mouth working silently, unable to scream, staring down 
               at the blood and froth on the water, swirling in a grim eddy 
               under her, the Sandpiper rocking gently in the diminishing 
               swell.

               EXT. OCEAN - DAY - ESTABLISHING SHOT

               On the way to the lighthouse, but away from the harbor, the 
               Kids are sailing in fairly close order: The sloops (Polo, 
               Timmy, Marge) heeled well over in the stiff breeze, the faster 
               cats (Mike, Larry, Donny, etc.) skimming around, tacking 
               more often, faster and more maneuverable.

               CLOSE ON PATRICK AND LUCY

                                     LUCY
                         Faster! Faster!

                                     PATRICK
                         Coming about...

               She ducks under the boom, handling the jib sheets with easy 
               familiarity. They come about and scoot off on a new tack.

               CLOSE ON POLO

               Reading the wind, trimming sail expertly, competent and alone.

                                     POLO
                              (to a near-by boat)
                         Great day! I think the wind's going 
                         to change...

               CLOSE ON TIMMY AND BROOKE

               He comes about, she slides into him, he holds her to steady 
               her, she snuggles into his arms. True love, at last... He's 
               thrilled.

               CLOSE ON DOUG

               In his inflatable, poking slowly along. Marge passes him, 
               Sean hooting with glee.

                                     MARGE
                         Coming up.

                                     SEAN
                         Slowpoke! Slowpoke! Marge is faster!

                                     DOUG
                         I'm getting new sails, then watch 
                         out. Just a question of modifying 
                         the rigging!

               ANGLE ON MIKE'S "GREEN MACHINE"

               Jackie, Mike and Andy, clipping along, Larry Vaughn and Bob 
               in the Sizzler nearby. Mike lifts the hull, Jackie squeals 
               in delight.

                                     JACKIE
                         Wheee! Faster!

                                     ANDY
                         How fast is enough?

                                     JACKIE
                         I want to go faster!

                                     MIKE
                         Hang on...

               He trims his sheets, the cat heels more, one hull flying, 
               Andy and Jackie clinging to the trampoline.

               ANGLE ON THE SIZZLER

               Larry is carefully adjusting his tiller, Bob senses what 
               he's doing.

                                     BOB
                         You coming up on him?

                                     LARRY
                         You bet. Hang on...

               They gybe sharply, running up behind the green cat.

                                     LARRY
                         Coming up! Give way!

                                     ANDY
                         Like hell! We're on the starboard 
                         tack!

               THE SIZZLER AND THE "GREEN MACHINE"

               Running close to each other; very tight two-by-two.

                                     JACKIE
                         Don't let him pass. Faster!

               Mike and Larry silently fight for clean air, racing. Water 
               splashes over them.

                                     JACKIE
                         My hair's getting wet!

                                     ANDY
                         So's mine.

               CLOSE ON MIKE'S BOAT

               He veers onto a less dramatic tack, sparing Jackie's hair.

               Larry and Bob speed by, yelling.

                                     JACKIE
                         When do we get to the lighthouse?

                                     ANDY
                         Soon, dark eyes, soon.

                                     MIKE
                         The tide's turning.

               Andy reveals a knowledgeable side to his character.

                                     ANDY
                         We're going to be fighting the 
                         current.
                              (he looks up)
                         Wind's backing around a few points, 
                         too.

               Jackie snuggles against Mike.

                                     JACKIE
                         I can't wait to get there.

                                     ANDY
                         But of course.

               He goes forward to trim the jib, leaving the lovebirds 
               snuggling astern. They pull away from us, and we:

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. AMITY WATERFRONT STREET - DAY

               Ellen and Brody are in the jeep; he's driving her to work.

               There's a crowd at dockside, and the town ambulance's now 
               familiar blinking red light. Brody, out of force of habit, 
               wheels the jeep towards the action, nudging through the crowd, 
               which gives way to the official blue-and-white vehicle.

                                     ELLEN
                         Hey -- it's not your job any more. 
                         I'm going to be late for work.

                                     BRODY
                         Just one minute...

               He gets out, and pushes through the crowd, Ellen following.

               DOCKSIDE

               The dive boat is moored at a clumsy angle next to the Police 
               Boat, where Hendricks has been pulling routine maintenance.

               The Police launch is cluttered with tools and spare parts; 
               some non-essential piece of gear is stripped and laid out on 
               the deck. Hendricks is on the dive boat, kneeling next to 
               Andrews.

               ABOARD THE DIVE BOAT

               Andrews is shaking, bloody froth on his lips and chest. The 
               shaken divers are huddled together, an ambulance attendant 
               is wheeling a gurney into position. Crosby and Sparky are 
               stunned.

                                     BRODY
                         What the hell happened?

                                     SPARKY
                         Embolism. Air bubbles in his blood. 
                         Came up too damn fast. Held his 
                         goddamn breath!

               He is near collapse himself.

                                     HENDRICKS
                         Easy...

                                     CROSBY
                         He panicked! Something scared him!

               An Ambulance Attendant is putting a blanket around Sparky.

                                     ATTENDANT
                         It's okay. We're taking care of him.

               The other attendant holds something out to Brody. Brody 
               examines it; a scuba mouthpiece, bitten in two, useless.

                                     BRODY
                         How'd this happen?

                                     SPARKY
                         Bite reflex, like a spasm.

                                     BRODY
                         When?

                                     HENDRICKS
                         Right after, the Kids went out?

                                     ELLEN
                         What Kids? Who went out?

                                     HENDRICKS
                         All of them. Mike, Junior Vaughn, 
                         Brookie Peters, Pat, Lucy -- all 
                         that whole gang.

                                     ELLEN
                         Mike? Our Mike?

                                     HENDRICKS
                         Yep. Looked like they were headed to 
                         the lighthouse.

                                     BRODY
                         How long ago?

                                     HENDRICKS
                         About an hour, maybe two.
                              (thinking)
                         Let's see -- I came on about eight...

               Brody is gone, pushing through the crowd.

               THE POLICE BOAT

               Brody is casting off lines. Ellen is on the dock, watching 
               him.

                                     ELLEN
                         What're you doing?

                                     BRODY
                         Going out.

                                     HENDRICKS
                         Uh, Chief -- look. You're not Chief 
                         any more.

               Brody keeps working, making ready for sea.

                                     HENDRICKS
                         I can't let you take her out.

                                     BRODY
                         You can't stop me.

               Ellen is climbing aboard, taking off her heels.

                                     HENDRICKS
                         Mrs. Brody, look -- if he can't go, 
                         then you can't go. Neither of you 
                         can go.

                                     ELLEN
                         I'm going.

                                     BRODY
                         Mike's out there.

                                     HENDRICKS
                         But I signed for the boat. You're 
                         not authorized any more.

               Brody starts the engines with a roar, and slams it into 
               reverse. The boat starts out of the slip, then lunges to a 
               halt, shuddering on its still-fastened bow mooring line.

                                     BRODY
                         Untie that rope.

                                     HENDRICKS
                         Please. It's my job.

                                     ELLEN
                         I'll do it.

               And she moves purposefully towards the boat cleat.

                                     HENDRICKS
                         Mrs. Brody, please...

               Brody is shifting gears, the boat is crabbing sideways as he 
               puts the helm hard over. It bumps the dock, hard.

                                     HENDRICKS
                         You're too close. Back off.

                                     BRODY
                         Goddamnit, Hendricks, untie the rope 
                         there.

               Hendricks goes to the bow, jumps aboard and frees the bow 
               line. The boat slips into reverse, the water boiling as Brody 
               guns it away from the dock.

                                     HENDRICKS
                         Let me. Please.

               He takes the wheel, eases off on the rudder, and comes about, 
               pointing the launch out to sea.

                                     ELLEN
                         Hurry, please.

                                     HENDRICKS
                         What the hell, they can't fire both 
                         of us -- someone's got to be in 
                         charge, right? Which way are we going?

                                     BRODY
                         Find the Kids. The lighthouse -- you 
                         said something about the lighthouse. 
                         Get us there.

               WIDE ON THE HARBOR

               The Amity Police Boat, Brody, Ellen and Hendricks aboard, is 
               headed under full power out to sea. Hendricks is pumping the 
               horn, warning boats out of the way, ignoring the rules of 
               the road; as small boats scatter out of the way, we can see 
               the ambulance, red light flashing, pushing out slowly through 
               the crowd at dockside.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               ABOARD THE AMITY POLICE BOAT - DAY

               As they clear the harbor mouth, Brody is on the radio, Ellen 
               is crouching in the shelter of the deckhouse, Hendricks is 
               steering.

                         Affirmative. Can you get your chopper 
                         airborne?

                                     BRODY
                         Get him the hell over to Amity Point, 
                         the old lighthouse. Right now.

                                     BRODY
                         There's a bunch of Kids day-sailing 
                         that way. Turn them back to port.

                         That's it. Just do it, all right?

                         10-4, soon as I can raise him.

                         If they're not at the light, look 
                         for them. I don't want them out there. 
                         Get them back to port!

                                     PATROL VOICE
                              (exasperated)
                         Affirmative, affirmative. Turn the 
                         Kids day-sailing back to port. I 
                         heard you. Patrol out.

               As Brody's eyes sweep the horizon anxiously, Hendricks pours 
               it on, and the police boat surges forward.

                                                                    CUT TO:

                         We're going in to eat!

               She nods agreement, their boats veer off from the rest and 
               head towards the lighthouse.

                                                                    CUT TO:

                         Hey! Brody! Want to race?

                                     MIKE
                              (confident)
                         Sure.

                                     LARRY
                         How about a side bet to make it 
                         interesting?

                                     JACKIE
                         That's fun! Let's race for something!

                                     MIKE
                         Name it.

                                     LARRY
                         Loser sails home alone.

                                     ANDY
                              (aside to Mike)
                         You're betting what you already got.

                                     MIKE
                         I don't care.

                                     JACKIE
                         I love it.

                                     ANDY
                         Sure you do -- you win either way.

                                     JACKIE
                              (simply)
                         I'm supposed to.

                                     LARRY
                         It's a bet. Once around the marker 
                         buoy?

                                     MIKE
                         That's the pin -- the buoy.

               Larry is confident -- he's got the air, but Mike suddenly 
               gybes without warning, snapping onto a new fast tack, 
               downwind. Larry and Bob are caught by surprise, and lose 
               precious moments as they fumble with their sails.

                                     ANDY
                              (pulling away)
                         Turkeys! Eat wind!

                                     MIKE
                         Yee-hah!

               He pounds with glee on the canvas trampoline as their boat 
               moves ahead, a drumming sound.

               UNDERWATER

               The twin hulls of a catamaran's hull, the muffled, eerie 
               sound of drumming, as the water carries the tempting "thud-
               thud-thud" sound down to the deep.

               ANGLE ON DOUG IN HIS INFLATABLE

               falling behind as the boats change course for the marker 
               buoy, following Larry and Mike's lead.

                                     DOUG
                         Hey! Wait for the H.M.S. Invincible!

               Brooke and Timmy sail by him, laughing; Polo with them.

                                     BROOKE
                         Can't -- we're watching a race!

                                     DOUG
                         Since when? Who's racing?

                                     TIMMY
                         Larry and Mike!

               PATRICK AND LUCY

               Pat and Lucy are trimming sail, moving faster.

                                     LUCY
                         Mike and Larry are racing! Loser 
                         goes home alone!

                                     PATRICK
                         If we beat them, they can both go 
                         home stag! Single-O! Alone! Jackie 
                         can come back in this boat!

                                     LUCY
                         What about me?

                                     PATRICK
                         Uh. Well. Maybe you could give Polo 
                         a hand going in...

                                     LUCY
                              (snapping him with a 
                              rope)
                         Your ass I will. Besides, the wind's 
                         turning with the tide. Sailing back 
                         is going to be a bitch.

               QUICK CUTS - SAILBOAT RACING MONTAGE

               --  Ropes and sails rattling through blocks.

               --  Sails snapping taut, filling with wind.

               --  Catamarans heeled over, racers hanging over the water, 
               dangerously suspended in trapeze harnesses.

               --  Skippers' faces, concentrating on boat handling.

               AERIAL VIEW - SAILBOATS

               It's the chopper's point of view, as the Harbor Patrol copter 
               from the Cape flies towards the Kids, following Brody's 
               previous instructions. He sees the sailboats and fly that 
               way.

                                     PILOT
                              (filtered, into his 
                              mike)
                         Air Patrol to Base. I have visual 
                         contact on the Kids. Going down to 
                         use the loud hailer...

               LOOKING UP AT THE APPROACHING COPTER

               It approaches the sailboats, losing altitude fast, rotor 
               blades chuffing up a storm.

               The Pilot has his microphone to his lips, and his voice is 
               blaring down at them.

                                     PILOT (V.O.)
                         This is the Harbor Patrol. Return to 
                         port immediately. Return -- to -- 
                         port -- immediately.

               THE BOATS

               The Kids look at each other, some coming about awkwardly, 
               others luffing, wondering what this is all about.

                                     ANDY
                              (to Mike)
                         Your dad must be really pissed.

                                     MIKE
                         We better go back in.

                                     ANDY
                         It's not going to be easy.

                                     JACKIE
                         What's wrong?

                                     MIKE
                         We're fighting wind and current. I 
                         though we'd be out longer, catch the 
                         incoming tide.

                                     ANDY
                         Putz -- that won't be for hours.

                                     MIKE
                         I was counting on hours.

                                     CHOPPER (V.O.)
                         Return -- to -- port.

                                     MIKE
                         We're trying, we're trying.

               He waves acknowledgement, and puts about. The others take 
               their cue from him, and set a rough course back, but without 
               much success.

               PATRICK AND LUCY

                                     LUCY
                         Heading back?

                                     PATRICK
                         Might as well.

               ANGLE ON THE THREE SLOOPS

               Polo, Timmy and Brooke, Marge and Sean. They see the faster 
               catamarans come about and try to beat back.

                                     POLO
                         They're turning around.

                                     LUCY
                         Coming about, then.

                                     SEAN
                         Are we going back?

                                     MARGE
                         Going to try. Lighthouse, everybody...

               She puts about, the three of them start back towards the 
               lighthouse, not making much headway. Doug's inflatable is 
               the slowest, and he is now, by virtue of his position, at 
               the head of the line beating back towards the island.

               DOUG'S BOAT

               The others in the b.g.

                                     DOUG
                         Make way for the Carrier Enterprise!

               INSERT - A WEAK PATCH IN THE RUBBER

               It whistles and visibly leaks under the strain.

               DOUG

               looking down in dismay.

                                     DOUG
                         Make that the Titanic.

               He rigs a little foot pump, and begins thumping away, trying 
               to breath air back into the raft.

               INT. CHOPPER - LOOKING DOWN AT THE SAILBOATS

                                     PILOT
                         Patrol One to Base. Looks like they're 
                         turning back.

                                     CONTROL
                         All right, Patrol. Go back to work. 
                         You've wasted enough time.

               UNDERWATER

               Looking up at the scattered hulls of the sailboats, the 
               turbulence from the low-flying chopper making a vast circular 
               pattern of irregular vibrations.

               LOOKING UP AT THE CHOPPER

               It wheels around, and heads back towards land.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               ABOARD THE AMITY POLICE BOAT - DAY

               Rushing through the seas under full power. About three hundred 
               yards ahead, a small, seemingly empty sailboat; Ed and Tina's 
               Sandpiper. Further off, a day-sailing power cruiser, sport 
               fishing.

                                     ELLEN
                         Michael?

                                     BRODY
                         It's not his boat.

               Hendricks maneuvers closer, slowing the engine, reversing in 
               time to bring them alongside with a gentle bump. Ellen watches 
               apprehensively as Brody drops into the little boat.

                                     ELLEN
                         Be careful...

                                     HENDRICKS
                         Anything?

                                     BRODY
                              (on the Sandpiper)
                         Nope...
                              (he sees something)
                         Hold on...

               Brody moves around on the deck of the Sandpiper, until he 
               discovers Tina, cowering in shock; a sudden revealing of a 
               terrorized victim.

                                     BRODY
                         Tina!

                                     TINA
                              (a moan)
                         N-o-o-o-o-o-o...

                                     BRODY
                         It's okay, it's okay. What's the 
                         matter? Tina? Honey? Hey --

                                     TINA
                         No! It's still there!

                                     BRODY
                         What is it? What's there?

                                     TINA
                         It's still there!

                                     BRODY
                              (to Hendricks and 
                              Ellen)
                         I need a hand here...

               Hendricks has gotten a blanket, and he steps over, putting 
               it over the shivering girl's shoulders. Ellen comforts the 
               girl.

                                     ELLEN
                         Tina, baby... what is it?

                                     TINA
                         Sh... Sh... Shark...

               ANGLE ON BRODY - FOLLOWING HIM AS HE REACTS

                                     BRODY
                         I knew it. I goddamn well told them.

               He moves abruptly, stepping up onto the police launch, 
               snapping on the radio, leaving Hendricks, Ellen and Tina on 
               the sailboat moored alongside.

                                     BRODY
                         Amity Launch to Harbor Patrol.

                                     PATROL COMMANDER (V.O.)
                              (filter)
                         This is Cape Patrol -- what is it, 
                         Brody? I heard you weren't chief 
                         anymore.

                                     BRODY
                         Skip that. What about those kids out 
                         sailing?

                                     COMMANDER (V.O.)
                         It's all okay -- Colby got to them. 
                         They were turning back when he left 
                         'em.

                                     BRODY
                         He left them?

                                     COMMANDER (V.O.)
                         Sure. He's got work to do in Bay 
                         Channel.

                                     BRODY
                         Get him the hell back there! We got 
                         possible fatalities! Brody out...

               His eyes wild, Brody looks over at the Sandpiper, then scans 
               the nearby waters with sudden tension.

               BRODY'S POINT OF VIEW

               Ellen and Hendricks comforting Tina on the Sandpiper. Nearby, 
               a big cabin cruiser casually trolling by. Brody pulls the 
               police boat's air horn, the cruiser's passengers look over, 
               Hendricks and Ellen jump at the unexpected blast.

               ANGLE ON BRODY

                                     BRODY
                         I'm going out there.

                                     HENDRICKS
                         Hey -- you can't do that.

                                     ELLEN
                         What is it? What's the matter?

                                     BRODY
                         Mike's out there.

               Brody starts the launch's motor, throwing clear the mooring 
               line that ties the two boats together.

                                     BRODY
                              (to Hendricks)
                         Get her in. Get them both in.

                         ELLEN
                 Martin, please!

                                                       HENDRICKS
                                               Chief, be sensible...

                                     BRODY
                         Where are they?

                                     HENDRICKS
                         About 10 degrees off your starboard 
                         bow, take a heading leeward of Sand 
                         Island, and lay her north by 
                         northeast...

                                     BRODY
                         Never mind that shit. Just point.

               Hendricks complies.

                                     HENDRICKS
                              (pointing)
                         See where Cable Junction is? Look to 
                         the left. The lighthouse. That's it.

                                     BRODY
                         Got it.

               And he kicks the engine into gear, moving the launch away 
               and out toward the sea.

                                     ELLEN
                         Come back! Martin!

               He guns the engine as soon as he's clear. Hendricks gives 
               his jacket to a suddenly chilled Ellen, and hails the cabin 
               cruiser, already changing course to pick them up, sounding 
               its horn.

               Ellen stares after the receding boat.

                                     ELLEN
                         My purse is on that boat.

                                                                   CUT TO: 

               EXT. OCEAN - DAY - THE KID'S SAILBOATS

               They are trying to beat back towards the lighthouse, fighting 
               wind and tide. Only Doug's inflatable, with its clumsy little 
               motor, is making any headway.

               ANGLE ON DOUG

               playing at being Charles Laughton.

                                     DOUG
                         Mr. Christian! Mr. Christian! Pump 
                         up this boat! And shave that silly 
                         moustache!

               Pumping, steering, he's floundering along.

               UNDERWATER - MOVING TOWARDS THE SURFACE

               The Shark has fixated on something -- one outlying shape, 
               the easily identifiable outline of Doug's inflatable, thumping 
               and putting. It homes in on the sound.

               ANGLE ON DOUG AND THE KIDS

               The other kids exchange banter with Doug in his raft, as he 
               clowns for their benefit.

                                     DOUG
                         England expects every man to do his 
                         duty... You may fire when ready, 
                         Gridley... Damn the torpedoes, full 
                         speed ahead...

               Despite his pumping, the bulging patch bursts with a loud 
               bang.

                                     DOUG
                         Oh, shit.

                                     ANDY
                         Someone pop your balloon?

                                     DOUG
                         No problem, no problem.

                                     JACKIE
                         Want a lifesaver?

                                     MARGE
                         How about a skyhook?

                                     DOUG
                         You sail your boat, I'll sail mine.

               A fin rises partially, almost invisible to most of the kids, 
               but Mike notices it, believing it to be a porpoise.

                                     MIKE
                         Hey, Fetterman -- You got company.

                                     DOUG
                         Company? The place is a mess...

               Before anyone can react, the shape rises behind Doug, striking 
               his raft a terrible blow.

                                     DOUG
                         Whoops.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE OTHERS, WATCHING

               Not making any headway themselves, they casually watch the 
               class clown, wondering what he's up to this time.

               DOUG'S BOAT

               a distance from the rest. It shakes, then blows up as big 
               teeth grip it from below. Doug goes flying into the drink.

               The Shark has the inflatable in his teeth, and is shaking it 
               from side to side. Doug's eyes bug out as he sees what's 
               going on. He begins treading water, backing away as fast as 
               he can, waving his arm in the air frantically -- "pick me 
               up, quick..."

               MIKE'S BOAT

                                     MIKE
                         Doug's down!

               He sails to where Doug is being carried along by the current.

               The inflatable is a mess -- shredded rubber and dead engine; 
               the Shark didn't like it.

                                     ANDY
                         Doug! This way!

               Doug carefully -- oh, so carefully -- strokes over to where 
               Mike and Andy can pull him abroad. Some of the others sail 
               closer to get a look.

                                     PATRICK
                         What was that about?

                                     MARGE
                         You okay?

                                     LUCY
                         What was that?

                                     LARRY
                         So much for the rubber duck.

               THE GROUP, DRIFTING TOGETHER

               This incident hasn't yet touched them -- no one actually saw 
               what it was, except Doug, who's never been serious about 
               anything. Until now.

                                     DOUG
                         A shark ate my boat.

                                     BOB
                         Come on.

                                     DOUG
                         I'm telling you, a goddamn shark ate 
                         my goddamn boat!

                                     ANDY
                         If he liked your boat, I got some 
                         sneakers he'll love.

               There's nervous laughter from all around as they examine the 
               remains of Doug's inflatable. Some of those jagged rents 
               could be made by teeth...

                                     KIDS
                              (ad lib)
                         ...Jeez -- what did that?... A 
                         porpoise, maybe...Nah, killer whale... 
                         I think he snagged it... I hate to 
                         pop his balloon... (Etc.)

               ANGLE ON MIKE'S BOAT

               Doug's inflatable is draped over the tip of one hull, forward.

               Without warning, the Shark hits. Screams, terror, confusion.

               Mike, Andy, Jackie into the water.

               CLOSE ON MIKE

               His head bangs on a metal fitting as the boat turns over.

               ON THE GROUP

               Patrick and Lucy ram into Timmy's boat, locking into it, 
               knocking Timmy into the water as Brooke screams.

               CONFUSION

               As the following events take place:

               --  Larry's red cat rams and locks onto Mike's Tornado.

               --  Marge's boat capsizes, putting Sean and Marge into the 
               drink.

               --  Marge scrambles up on the over-turned hull, pulling Sean 
               up with her, just in time.

               --  Polo, under full sail, scoops Mike out of the water before 
               the Shark can get to him.

               --  The Shark dips out of sight.

               SURFACE, WIDE OVER THE STERN OF POLO'S BOAT

               showing the results of the turmoil:

               ANGLE ON THE SURVIVORS

               As they make ineffectual, frightened moves towards grouping 
               together, Andy is the first to gain any composure.

                                     ANDY
                         Raft up! Raft 'em up!

               He reaches towards a drifting line, and pulls Timmy's 
               Doughdish towards them, tying it off as it comes close.

                                     LARRY
                         Tie off to your strongest point.

                                     PATRICK
                         Anyone need an extra line?

               Polo has Mike and Timmy aboard his boat.  Timmy is looking 
               up from examining Mike's dazed body.

                                     TIMMY
                         Mike's bleeding!

                                     ANDY
                         Can you sail?

                                     POLO
                              (testing his rudder)
                         Yeah! We'll take him in!

               He starts to make sail back towards the lighthouse, on a 
               severe, but manageable tack. Polo, Timmy, and the injured 
               Mike sail towards safety, leaving the others behind.

               Tackle the job at hand, concentrating on survival. Jackie is 
               strangely quiet; things are out of control...

                                                                   CUT TO: 

               CLOSE ON A NAUTICAL CHART - DAY

               clearly marked: Amity Island, Amity Lighthouse, Cable 
               Junction. Brody's nervous finger traces an approximation of 
               his course. It fumbles, pauses, stops.

               ABOARD THE POLICE BOAT - DAY

               Brody, looking up from his chart, scans the ocean. Ahead is 
               the Lighthouse, his immediate destination. Out of sight to 
               the right, Cable Junction, and beyond that, 2500 miles of 
               cold Atlantic. Brody looks up from his chart, and grabs the 
               radio.

                         Shit.

               He puts the wheel over, slewing the boat around. To the left --  
               the wrong way.

               ANGLE ON THE BOAT, LIGHTHOUSE IN B.G.

               It barrels off to the left.

               HELICOPTER (AERIAL) FLY-BY

               A panorama of open ocean; a quick fly-by to orient us: First, 
               Cable Junction, then, a mile or so ahead, the raft.

               THE RAFT

               More sail, some improvised rigging, Patrick and Lucy trimming 
               what there is, trying to steer the clumsy contraption. From 
               afar, the distant sound of an approaching chopper.

                                     LARRY
                         Hey!

               The Kids react with enthusiasm to the arrival of the rescue 
               chopper.

                                     ANDY
                         Don't everyone jump around!

               But they ignore him. The copter is descending.

               INT. COPTER - DAY

               A one-man light spotter; the space next to the pilot cluttered 
               with tools and floats, lashed in place. Below, seen through 
               the plastic bubble, the raft growing larger as the chopper 
               sets down.

                                     PILOT
                         Air One to Base. I have a positive 
                         location on that sailing party. 
                         Disabled and adrift...
                              (he checks chart on 
                              his knee board)
                         ...about 3/4 miles west of Cable 
                         Junction, wind and current carrying 
                         them just about due east. I count 
                         ten juveniles.

               THE RAFT

               The helicopter is creating a lot of turbulence as it sets 
               down, a huge circular pattern of prop-wash on the surface as 
               the rotors slow to a halt. The Kids are waving and jubilant.

               ANGLE ON THE COPTER

               As the Pilot unbuckles, opens the door, and steps out on one 
               pontoon; he speaks through a bullhorn.

                                     PILOT
                         Everyone okay? Any injuries?

               The Kids ad-lib in the affirmative.

                                     ANDY
                         Can you put us on Cable Junction?

                         How about a tow? Can you rig that?

               The Pilot nods. Larry heaves a line to him, the Pilot catches 
               it and makes it fast to a convenient tie-off on the 
               undercarriage.

                                     LARRY
                         As soon as you get us on the island, 
                         you got to call in. My dad's the

                         There's a shark...

               The other Kids all chime in, adding their ad-lib shouts 
               describing what happened, calling for help, etc. It's all a 
               noisy jumble, the Pilot ignores it, trying to do his job.

               ANGLE ON THE RAFT

               The Kids all shouting at once; Jackie is screaming.

                                     JACKIE
                         You have to take us off! You have

                              (calming her)
                         It's an observation spotter, he 
                         doesn't have the room...

               ANGLE ON THE PILOT

               He finishes tying off, and yells through his bullhorn at the 
               Kids.

                                     PILOT
                         Listen. I'm going to give you an 
                         assist to get you on Cable Junction. 
                         Then I'll call in, and get the Coast 
                         Guard to send a cutter. Hang on to 
                         something.

               He climbs into his bubble, shuts the door, gives the Kids a 
               "thumbs up," and starts the engine.

               QUICK CUTS - RAFT AND CHOPPER

               Engine turning over.

               A line tied off to one of the ringbolts on an overturned 
               hull; it pulls taut out of the water.

               INT. CHOPPER, THE PILOT INTENT ON HIS JOB.

               The raft, Kids watching in fascination and anticipation.

               The whole operation, getting under way.

               UNDERWATER

               looking up at pontoons, wreckage, wind turbulence on the 
               surface, the heavy "thud-thud-thud" of chopper blades.

               WIDE ON THE RAFT AND CHOPPER

               In the f.g., the fin rises, and starts for the scene.

               Follow it.

               CLOSE ON THE CHOPPER

               as it starts to lift, inexplicably. The Pilot reacts as;

               THE SHARK

               attacks one of the pontoons, biting down on it, clamping 
               great scarred jaws onto the bulbous floats.

               THE RAFT

               Kids screaming.

               QUICK CUTS

               --  Rotor blade spinning wildly.

               --  Pilot's hands jerked on the delicate controls.

               --  Med. shot, copter shaking.

               --  Closeup engine and gas tanks, rotor head spinning.

               --  Med. closeup Pilot in buffeting cockpit.

               RAFT AND COPTER

               The Kids watch, horror-stricken, as the giant Shark hangs on 
               the roaring copter; in the b.g., Cable Junction is looming 
               closer. The copter tilts dangerously, the Shark bites deeper, 
               harder.

               ANGLE ON THE COPTER

               as it tilts. Then, the unspeakable -- the blades touch the 
               water and explode. Chunks of murderous steel break off the 
               shattered blades and whistle through the air like projectiles.

               THE KIDS

               reacting, ducking in terror. Huge chunks of disintegrating 
               rotors are flying all around. Masts and sails left standing 
               before are chopped into a deadly salad. Screams.

               LOW IN THE WATER

               as blades skip and crash, the bubble of the overturned copter, 
               Pilot trapped inside, sinks into the sea.

               THE COPTER COCKPIT - UNDERWATER

               Pilot struggling with his safety harness, trying to hit 
               switches, working on instinct. Some air in the bubble, but 
               water too, and sparks as electrical connections short out 
               and burn.

               Then, the Shark, powering out of the murk.

               ANGLE ON THE PILOT - UNDERWATER

               as grim death batters at his fragile bubble. Screaming.

               The bubble cracks. Water floods, teeth snap at the slippery 
               plastic, the Pilot fumbles for oxygen as the Shark veers off 
               into the murk.

               ON THE SURFACE - THE RAFT

               The Kids, reacting as the broken copter sinks beneath the 
               waves. Calm for a moment, then:

                                     LARRY
                         Look out!

                                     JACKIE
                              (screams)
                         No-o-o-o!

               The Shark reappears, and batters at the raft.

               SHARK ATTACK

               The raft shudders, and begins to break up under the pounding.

               The Kids cling for their lives to masts and wreckage.

               Marge's overturned hull is struck a fierce blow from beneath.

                                     SEAN
                         Help!

               He and Marge topple into the water.

                                     ANDY
                         Don't struggle!

               Sean is bobbing in his life-vest, Marge strokes to be near 
               him.

               ANGLE ON MARGE AND SEAN

               in the water, swimming for the apparent safety of the raft.

               Then, the fin, and the massive bulk of the killer, heaving 
               up through the waves.

                                     MARGE
                         Sean!

               She heaves him up out of the water, hurling him with 
               desperation towards the safety of the floating hull.

               ANGLE ON SEAN

               screaming, hands and feet scrabbling like a monkey as he 
               struggles for a grip on the slippery surface. Behind him, 
               Marge helping as much as she can from the water. Then, behind 
               her;

               THE SHARK

               rising like grey doom, then dropping out of sight. Marge is 
               gone.

               UNDERWATER

               Marge ducking under the bulk of the Shark, shoving off with 
               panicky reserves of strength, swimming away underwater, while 
               the Shark takes a massive crunching bite out of a submerged 
               hull.

               Follow Marge as she swims.

               COPTER WRECKAGE

               Huddled in the cracked plastic bubble, the Pilot is sucking 
               air from his oxygen tank. He sees Marge, and slips out of 
               his bubble, headed for her.

               MARGE

               As the Pilot overtakes her -- a moment of horror, as she 
               thinks the Shark has found her, then relief, as the Pilot 
               motions to the bubble, and indicates "Air." She follows him.

               MARGE AND THE PILOT

               Scuttling like two crabs into the shelter of the broken 
               chopper, buddy breathing as he passes her the oxygen tube.

               The chopper tilts, and moves, breaking up on the bottom as 
               currents move it. They struggle silently.

               ANGLE ON THE CHOPPER

               as it slips across the bottom, the current pulling it, broken 
               parts breaking off in slow motion, dirty swirls of oil and 
               hydraulic fluid clouding the water.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               ON THE SURFACE - THE RAFT

               A parallel struggle for survival, as the current separates 
               Sean from the other Kids; Marge is gone, the little boy is 
               clinging alone to the free-floating Lightening.

                                     PATRICK
                         Sean! Sean!

                                     ANDY
                         Don't move!

                                     SEAN
                         Andy! Please help! Help!

               ON THE SURFACE - A DISTANCE AWAY

               Copter wreckage is bubbling up from underneath, like a 
               submarine destroyed by depth charges; an oil slick, pieces 
               of broken blade, a seat cushion, then, suddenly, the Pilot, 
               and Marge, almost choked to death, their air run out. They 
               cling to a section of pontoon, panting, looking around with 
               oxygen-starved eyes.

               They are alone on the ocean; a half-mile away, the distant 
               sails of the broken raft, and the low-lying shape of Cable 
               Junction. Safe, for now...

                                                                   CUT TO: 

               BRODY - ALONE IN THE POLICE BOAT - DAY

               He throttles down, and the boat slumps in the water. He looks 
               around, sees nothing, in all directions. He hits his radio.

                                     BRODY
                         Harbor Air, this is Brody. Air One, 
                         come in.

               Static, no answer. He tries a couple of times, checking the 
               knobs and dials to make sure the unit's working.

                                     BRODY
                         Harbor Air, do you read? Over?

                         Brody? This is Patrol Base.

               The familiar voice is tinged with annoyance. He's had a long 
               shift, and nothing's going right.

                                     BRODY
                         Where the hell is Air One?

                         That's what I'd like to know. Lost 
                         transmission at Cable Junction.

                                     BRODY
                         Did he raise the Kids?

                                     PATROL VOICE
                         Last transmission said ten juveniles.

                         Yeah? Then what?

                                     PATROL VOICE
                         Then nothing. If you see him, tell 
                         him to switch to an operational 
                         frequency, or give me a status report 
                         yourself.

                                     BRODY
                         Did you say Cable Junction?

                         That's what he said.

                                     BRODY
                         When?

                         1530 hours. Might still be there. 
                         Base out.

               Brody revs up, and powers out, headed for Cable Junction.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. OCEAN - DAY - THE RAFT

               Sean is crying on his isolated perch, clinging to the upturned 
               keel. The other Kids are throwing a rope, trying to get him 
               back. Patrick heaves, and misses.

                                     LARRY
                         Sean! Catch the rope!

                                     BOB
                         The rope! The rope!

               The others shoot fearful glances at the waters.

                                     PATRICK
                         He's got to help or it won't work.

                                     LUCY
                         Sean, baby, please...

               Sean is ignoring the efforts to rescue him, paralyzed by 
               fear, he shivers alone. Jackie is near catatonia herself, 
               Brooke and Doug trying to soothe her.

                                     JACKIE
                         It killed her. It ate her.

                                     BROOKE
                         Shh. Shhh...

                                     DOUG
                         It's okay, it's okay...

                                     ANDY
                         Sean! Listen! Listen to me, Sean.

               The kid looks up dully.

                                     ANDY
                         Goddamn it, Sean, you listen to me 
                         or I will kick your ass, do you hear 
                         me?

                                     LUCY
                         Listen to Andy, Sean.

                                     ANDY
                         We're throwing a rope and you better 
                         catch it, hear?

               Sean nods. The other Kids are encouraged. The rope is thrown -- 
               it misses.

                                     ANDY
                              (to Bob)
                         Keep an eye out for that fish.

               Bob climbs to a vantage point, watching.

                                     LARRY
                         Throw it.

                                     ANDY
                         Sean! Catch it!

               Another miss. In his haste to help, Larry overreaches to 
               fish the trailing rope out of the water, and falls headlong 
               into the sea. Shrieks of fright from the others.

                                     LUCY
                         Larry!

               He scrambles out, hardly wet, that's how fast he's moving.

               Finally -- Patrick takes the crucial throw, and the rope 
               practically knocks Sean off his perch, but he clutches and 
               holds it. As Andy carefully calls instructions, Sean secures 
               the rope and the others carefully, carefully begin to pull 
               him in.

               ANGLE - ON SEAN

               as they pull. The slippery rope is undoing itself.

               THE RAFT

               With the kids reaching out hands, sticks, rope, anything to 
               pull the little one to safety. The ocean swells rise and 
               fall with hidden menace.

               QUICK CUTS

               --  Hands gripping rope.

               --  The knot, pulling apart.

               --  Anguished faces, concentrating, as Patrick, Lucy, Larry, 
               and Andy struggle to bring him in.

               ANDY AND SEAN

               Success. He's pulled to safety. They lash his little hull as 
               tight as they can to the rest of the floating wreckage.

               Bob sees something.

                                     BOB
                         Cable Junction's ahead!

                                     LUCY
                         Can we make it?

                                     BOB
                         I don't know.

               BOB'S POINT OF VIEW

               looking over the wreckage to Cable Junction, now much closer.

               Beyond it, miles of empty Atlantic. It's off to one side, 
               and unless they can slow down or alter course, they will 
               miss it.

               THE RAFT

                                     LARRY
                              (to Jackie)
                         You okay?

               She's not. Shaking, silent, eyes glazed.

                                     LUCY
                              (alone)
                         Dear Jesus, Holy Mary, Mother of

                              (her lips move 
                              inaudibly)

                              (to Doug)
                         Keep her warm. 
                              (to Jackie)
                         Jackie? Baby?

                                     PATRICK
                         Can someone help me rig a jury rudder?  
                         We might steer this...

               Andy joins him, and they try to make a sweep or a rudder out 
               of whatever wreckage they can use.

                                     DOUG
                         By 7:46, when the tide turns around, 
                         we'll be twenty miles out. More, 
                         with this wind.

                                     LARRY
                         Shut up.

                                     DOUG
                         I can't stop thinking!

               BRODY'S POLICE BOAT - DAY

               He is rounding a sand bar off the lighthouse when he looks 
               ahead and sees the bright sails of some of the survivors' 
               boats.

                                     BRODY
                         Thank Christ.

               He puts the helm over and heads for them.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. OCEAN NEAR LIGHTHOUSE - DAY

               Polo's sloop is beating back towards the harbor when the 
               police launch bears down, Brody leaning on the air horn.

               The Kids signal and wave.

                                     POLO
                         Over here! Yo!

                         I'm coming alongside!

               The launch slows clumsily. Timmy gets a line around a cleat, 
               and pulls them fast.

                                     BRODY
                         Mike? Is that you?

                         It's okay. What happened?

                                     POLO
                         A shark hit us out there.

                         Mike got knocked over.

               Brody goes for his radio, to report in, to call for help.

                                     MIKE
                         I passed out, but I'm okay.

                                     BRODY
                         At least you're safe. What about the 
                         others?

               The three boys look at each other.

                                     BRODY
                         Jesus, don't freeze on me. What about 
                         the others?

                                     MIKE
                              (tears in his eyes)
                         Sean's still out there.

                         What?

               He stops in his tracks, radio forgotten. heartsick. Mike 
               goes on,

                                     MIKE
                         He wanted to come. It was okay, wasn't 
                         it? It was okay before...

                                     POLO
                         The others are ratted together. 
                         Drifting.

                                     BRODY
                         Which way?

                                     TIMMY
                         With the current. Towards Cable 
                         Junction.

               Brody jerks the mooring line holding them together, freeing

                         Dad, I'm sorry...

                         Stay here. Don't go anywhere. Just 
                         stay here.

               He indicates the lighthouse, then guns his engine.

                                     BRODY
                         Stay at the lighthouse!

               He roars off, headed towards Cable Junction.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. OCEAN - DAY - THE RAFT

               approaching Cable Junction the rafted boats are drifting 
               towards the Cable Junction.  Larry, Patrick and Andy are 
               working on improvised tiller lines to a jury rudder made out 
               of wreckage. Lucy has another line out to a sea anchor, trying 
               to slow their drift.

                         The wind drift is lateral.

               Larry, Bob and Brooke try to alter its course by padding.

               They freeze, as the raft grinds against something.

               UNDERWATER

               The inverted mast of one of the wrecked boats is snagged on 
               the rocks on the bottom.

               The group dissolves in bitter exchanges. No one is rational.

               Lucy is the first to notice something...

                         Wait a minute! Listen! Listen!

               The group subsides, only Jackie is left, keening to herself.

               There's a distant sound of a boat's engine. Bob spots it 
               first, and waves.

               The others follow his pointing finger.

               HIS POINT OF VIEW - BRODY'S POLICE BOAT

               under full power, heading straight for them,

               THE KIDS

               go crazy, waving, yelling, screaming, "Over here!" "Help!" 
               "Hey!"

                                     SEAN

               in the boat, coming up on the Kids fast. He throttles back, 
               his bow wave almost swamping them as he slides past.

                                     ANDY
                         Easy, easy -- you'll swamp us!

                         Back down!

               Brody fumbles with the throttle, manages to hold his boat 
               steady between the raft and Cable Junction island.

                                     LARRY
                         We're hung up here. Snagged.

                         Can you get us a line?

               Brody finds a coil of line, makes one end fast, then throws 
               it to the Kids on the raft. They catch it, and tie it off to 
               a cleat.

                                     DOUG
                         We got it!

                         Be careful.

               Brody throttles forward, the police boat shudders under the 
               strain as the line goes taut.

               ANGLE ON THE RAFT

               where the rope is tied off to a cleat. The wood groans, screws 
               pop --

                         Whoa!

               Too late. The cleat rips out, Brody's boat leaps forward.

               as he repositions; he's now between the raft and the island, 
               preparing to throw his line. He heaves, the Kids grab, they 
               have it, they tie off again,

                                     ANDY
                         Hang on, hang on -- we got it. You're

                         Dad! Help!

               Brody starts to pull the raft again, when:

               THE SHARK

               surfaces, and moves purposefully towards the gap that 
               separates the police boat from the raft. It lunges at Brody 
               as it passes the launch; the fin hits the taut rescue line, 
               snapping it.

               ANGLE ON BRODY'S BOAT

               Brody recoils in horror as the beast rushes past, he spins 
               the wheel and hits the throttle, sending the launch hard to 
               port. Out of control, it runs up on the rocks of Cable 
               Junction.

               INSIDE THE BOAT

               as it tips up on the rocks. Brody falls, equipment and loose 
               material breaks loose and falls.

               INSERT - THE RADIO

               held by only a few screws, it pulls out of its mount and 
               shatters on the deck.

               ANGLE ON THE STERN

               lifting high out of the water, the screw turning in air.

               THE KIDS ON THE RAFT

               Their horrified reactions.

               BRODY IN THE BOAT

               picks himself up, and staggers to the rail, sees his 
               predicament.

                                     BRODY
                         Hang on!

                         I'm okay, baby, I'm here. It's okay...

               He climbs over the rail, onto the slippery wet rocks, trying 
               to get to where he can help. The Shark patrols the gap, 
               waiting.

                                     BRODY
                         Can you get a line to me?

               ABOARD THE RAFT

               the Kids find some line. Andy coils, and throws.

               CABLE JUNCTION - THE RAFT

               Brady catches the Kids' line. He heaves on it with all his 
               might. Nothing. Jackie is hysterical, some of the other Kids 
               are screaming. The Shark's fin catches the taut line, it 
               slides up and over, Brody and the Kids are nearly pulled 
               into the water. The raft doesn't budge.

               UNDERWATER

               the mast bends under the strain, but holds the raft stuck 
               fast.

               CABLE JUNCTION - BRODY AND THE KIDS

               He sees the winch and hooks on his launch, and makes the 
               towline fast to the steel winch cable; puts it in neutral.

               The Kids haul their line, trying to bring the steel cable to 
               them.

               The shark rams their raft, impatient now. Screams and 
               scrambling as they let go their line and try to avoid the 
               beast. Brooke huddles with Sean, Jackie cowers alone. Larry 
               is lashing his big buck knife to a pole, an improvised weapon.

               ANGLE ON THE WINCH LINE

               Unattended, it drops into the water.

               THE KIDS

                                     ANDY
                         Get the cable in! Pull!

               They do, but now the winch cable is snagged under the surface.

               It comes taut, but doesn't budge. Brody watches, helpless 
               for the moment.

                                     BRODY
                         Son of a bitch is stuck!

               BRODY

               climbs back onto the boat, starts the winch engine, trying 
               to pull the cable free.

               THE SHARK

               on the offensive now, takes an outrigger pontoon, biting it, 
               tearing it off the raft, shaking everything.

               ON THE RAFT

               the Kids react to this fresh attack.

                                     DOUG
                         It's killing us!

                         I don't want to die! Mommy!

               IN THE BOAT

               The winch smokes and stalls, the weight it's pulling almost 
               too much.

                                     BRODY
                         Come on, you bastard, come on, pull.  
                         Pull!

               THE RAFT

               bursts apart from the center as the Shark lunges up through 
               the canvas trampoline of the Sizzler. The Kids, screaming, 
               fall into the water as the attack forces the fragile structure 
               into pieces. Only Sean, Brooke, and Jackie are left on the 
               remaining segment.

               ANGLE ON BRODY

               watching the destruction, seeing Sean practically alone in 
               the water.

                                     BRODY
                         Sean! Hang on!

               He looks around the deck frantically, spots a rubber emergency 
               inflatable in its case. He wrestles it off its brackets, and 
               breaks the seals urgently. He hits the auto-inflate.

               BRODY'S POINT OF VIEW - SEAN

               Alone on the raft, Brooke and Jackie helpless nearby, the 
               other Kids flailing in the water. The huge bulk of the Shark, 
               fin cutting the water as it closes in on the confusion.

               IN THE WATER

               While Brody inflates the rubber raft and throws it in the 
               water, the Kids scramble for safety, swimming for their lives.  
               Each one is sure this moment is going to be his last.

                                     ANDY
                         Get on the rocks!

                                     DOUG
                         Swim for it!

               Andy is pulling himself towards the boat, scrambling up on 
               the exposed wooden hull.

                                     PATRICK
                         Lucy! Look out!

               ANGLE ON LUCY AND BOB

               As she looks over her shoulder and screams -- the monster is 
               sliding past her, intent on Bob. The rough hide scrapes her, 
               tearing her clothes, leaving raw bleeding lacerations on her 
               torso.

                                     LUCY
                         I'm bleeding!

               Larry and Patrick help her towards the rocks.

                                     BOB
                         Help!

               He's clinging to a piece of broken boat; the Shark lunges at 
               him.

               INSERT - WINCH

               grinding, smoking, hauling something out of the water -- 
               heavy, slimy, dripping metal cable, the main powerline from 
               the mainland!

               BRODY IN THE WATER

               paddling the raft towards Sean with desperate strokes, 
               heedless of the danger around him.

                                     BRODY
                         Hang on! Just hang on!

               He fights to see in the gathering gloom. Suddenly, a strange 
               glare snaps on, then more illumination, in a series of 
               escalating clicks.

               CABLE JUNCTION

               Silhouetted against the evening sky. Automatic timers are 
               turning on navigation and worklights, illuminating the barren 
               rocks and rusty steel with their glare -- throwing dark 
               shadows, putting the surrounding water into black limbo by 
               their contract.

               ANGLE ON BRODY

               straining to see what's going on. Looking for his son.

                                     SEAN (O.S.)
                         Dad! Help! Daddy!

                                     BRODY
                         I'm coming!

               He looks around desperately, sees Andy safe on the launch.

                                     BRODY
                         Andy! Use the lights! The lights!

               ANGLE ON ANDY

               soaked, clinging to the rail of the launch, hearing Brody, 
               fumbling in the cabin, turning on worklights, the boat 
               throwing erratic shafts of powerful light from its many lamps 
               and searchlights. Andy grabs one and sweeps the water with 
               it, trying to help.

                                     ANDY
                         Where are you? Chief!

               His light pokes and sweeps through the gloom.

               BRODY IN THE WATER

               He hears the horrendous sounds of wood and metal breaking, 
               as the raft pounds to pieces on the rocks. He is blinded by 
               the sweeping searchlight, the confusion of terror-stricken 
               teen-agers screaming. It's the middle of The Inferno.

               BRODY'S POINT OF VIEW - SEAN

               Sean, standing up, reaching out to him, the Shark hitting 
               his fragile perch, Sean tumbling backwards, towards what 
               seems to be certain death.

                                     BRODY (O.S.)
                         Sean!

               ANGLE ON BRODY

               as he hurls his paddle at the Shark, anything to get even, 
               to distract it.

                                     BRODY
                         You bastard!

               He looks around him wildly, searching for a weapon, finding 
               a steel boathook. He screams at the unfeeling Shark...

                                     BRODY
                         Come here, you son-of-a-bitch!

               The huge gray hulk obligingly turns towards this new 
               irritation. Brody bangs on the raft, yelling, creating a 
               commotion.

               THE SHARK SPEEDS TOWARDS HIM

               THE SHARK

               lunges at the raft, Brody sliding desperately away, smashing 
               at the snout with his steel, the tail fin bashing him as it 
               passes...

               ANGLE ON THE STERN OF THE POLICE BOAT

               Brody is drifting close to the cable, drawn heavy and wet 
               cut of the water. He reaches up to it.

               ANGLE ON BRODY

               dangling his feet in the water, holding onto the cable, seeing 
               it, inspired with a lunatic idea...

                                     BRODY
                         Over here! You bastard! Over here

               THE SHARK

               turns, bleeding from a superficial cut on its snout, its 
               scar glistening wet and terrible. It heads for Brody.

               BRODY

               Possessed, yelling at the top of his lungs.

                                     BRODY
                         Come and get me! Come and get me!

               THE SHARK

               Attacking. Missing Brody, who hauls himself up out of the 
               way in life-or-death spasm. The great jaws close, fastening 
               onto the thick cable. Shaking it. The cable resists for a 
               moment, then splits, layers or insulation and armor crack 
               open, the jaws clamp harder -- 20,000 tons of pressure -- 
               then the live copper core is reached. Zap!

               THE SHARK

               dying. Leaping and convulsing as hundreds of thousands of 
               volts surge through its body, grounded in the salt sea. Hot 
               white fire shimmers like a halo, the fish smokes and stinks, 
               sputters, and dies.

               BRODY

               watching, cowering on the rubber raft to which he fell when 
               the shark hit the cable. It's strangely silent. The lights 
               on Cable Junction flicker and die as circuit breakers shut 
               down the mains, protecting the line. Only the boat's 
               worklights provide light now.

                                     BRODY
                         Sean?

               No answer. Water lapping at the rocks, some Kids sobbing 
               quietly. Brody listlessly paddles towards the wreckage of 
               the raft, expecting the worst...

               ANGLE ON THE WRECKAGE

               Timmy's Doughdish, where we last saw Sean. There's a 
               scrabbling from inside, and Sean appears, soaked, from under 
               the seat where he'd fallen.

                                     SEAN
                         Dad?

               Brody moves toward him, holds out his arms, taking Sean onto 
               his raft. They paddle back towards the rocks.

               THE ISLAND

               with the Kids clinging like drowned rats to the rocks; they're 
               wet, scared, exhausted, but safe. Sean hugs his daddy as 
               they step onto land.

                                     SEAN
                         They made me go with them.

                                     BRODY
                         Sure they did...

               He kisses the damp forehead.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               EXT. AMITY HARBOR - DAY

               A crowd of worried parents and adults, Ellen and Hendricks 
               in the forefront, are staring towards the harbor mouth. It's 
               dawn and the sun is rising. They see something, a cheer goes 
               up.

               ANGLE ON THE WATER

               A big Coast Guard cutter is steaming into the harbor, a little 
               group of survivors on the foredeck.

               CLOSE ON THE CUTTER

               Brody and the surviving Kids wave to their families on land.

                                                                  FADE OUT:

                                                         OVER BLACK WE SEE:

               CHYRON

               A long time ago, in front of a convenience store far, far 
               away--

               EXT. QUICK STOP YEARS AGO--DAY

               We FADE IN on the block of stores (Quick Stop/RST), from 
               sometime ago, In fact, RST isn't RST; it's THE RECORD RACK -- 
               a 45's store with head shop paraphernalia in the window. A 
               white-trash MOTHER (maybe seventeen) wearing a baseball cap 
               comes into frame carrying a chubby BABY. The Baby wears an 
               oversized t-shirt under what looks like a little bathrobe, 
               and messily eats a CHOCOLATE BAR. There are food stamps in 
               the Mother's hands.

                                     MOTHER
                         Bobby-Boy stay here while mommy picks 
                         up the free cheese, 'kay?

               She looks up at the bright sun, shielding her eyes slightly, 
               then looks back at the baby on the ground. She takes off her 
               baseball cap and places it on the baby.

                                     MOTHER
                         This'll keep the sun out of your 
                         eyes. You be good now.

               She walks away, leaving the baby sitting against the wall. 
               With the backwards baseball cap and the chocolate around his 
               mouth forming something that resembles a beard, the kid looks 
               kind of familiar.

               Then, another MOTHER (also very young) decked out in a KISS 
               concert shirt from years gone by and huge, feathered hair 
               enters, with a black skullcap wearing BABY slung at her hip. 
               She sees the first Baby, sitting against the wall and sets 
               her Baby down beside him.

                                     MOTHER
                         Don't fucking move, you little shit-
                         machine. Mommy's gonna try to score.

               A PASSERBY enters, heading toward the convenience store. He 
               takes note of the Babies and the Mother heading into the 
               record store, and then stops and addresses her, disgusted.

                                     PASSERBY
                         Excuse me--who's watching these 
                         babies?

                                     MOTHER
                         The fat one's watching the little 
                         one.

                                     PASSERBY
                         Oh, nice parenting.
                              (walking away)
                         Leave'em out here like that and see 
                         what happens.

               The Passerby walks away. The Mother flips him the bird.

                                     MOTHER
                         FUCK YOU, YOU FUCKING SQUARE!

                                     PASSERBY
                              (waving her off)
                         Ah, keep on truckin'.

                                     MOTHER
                              (to baby)
                         D'jou hear the crazy fuck tellin' me 
                         how to fuckin' raise you? 
                         Motherfucker, man! Who's he fucking 
                         think he is? What's the worse fuckin' 
                         thing could happen to you sitting 
                         outside the fuckin' stores? Fuck!

               The door closes, and the Babies sit there quietly for a beat. 
               Then, they look at each other. The larger one says nothing. 
               The smaller one says--

                                     BABY
                         Fuck, fuck, fuck...

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               THE PRESENT

               JAY and SILENT BOB stand where the Babies sat. The Record 
               Rack is now RST VIDEO.

               Jay is mid-chant.

               A pair of TEENS approach them.

                         Man, that shit was so gay--fucking 
                         eighties style.

               Jay suddenly grabs the kid by the throat, throwing him against 
               the wall.

                                     JAY
                         Bitch, don't you NEVER say an unkind 
                         word about The Time! Me and Silent 
                         Bob modeled our whole fucking lives 
                         after Morris Day and Jerome! I'm a 
                         smooth pimp who loves the pussy, and 
                         Tubby here's my black manservant!

               Just then, RANDAL exits the video store, locking the door 
               behind him.

                                     RANDAL
                         What'd I tell you two about dealing 
                         in front of the store? Drop the kid 
                         and peddle your wares someplace else, 
                         burn-boy.

                         And for the record, The Time sucked 
                         ass.

               He exits. Jay, Silent Bob, and the Teens watch him go. After 
               a beat--

                                     JAY
                         Yo-youse guys wanna hear something 
                         fucked up about him and the Quick

               INT. QUICK STOP-DAY

               Randal joins Dante behind the counter. Dante rings up a 
               customer, a half-eaten submarine sandwich sitting on the 
               counter. Randal grabs it, takes a bite, and starts reading a 
               newspaper.

                                     RANDAL
                         Hey, can't we do something about 
                         those two stoners hanging around 
                         outside all the time?

                                     DANTE
                         Why? What'd they do now?

                                     RANDAL
                         I'm trying to watch Clash of the 
                         Titans, and all I can hear is the 
                         two them screaming about Morris Day 
                         at the top of their lungs.

                                     DANTE
                         I thought the fat one didn't really 
                         talk much.

                                     RANDAL
                         What, am I producing an A&E Biography 
                         about 'em? I'm just saying they 
                         shouldn't be loitering around the 
                         stores like they do.

                                     DANTE
                         Neither should you, but we let you 
                         stay.

                                     RANDAL
                         See, man--if you were funnier than 
                         that, ABC never would've canceled 
                         us.

                                     DANTE
                         What?

                                     RANDAL
                         Nothing.

                         Well if we were gay, that's how I'd 
                         see it.

                         We're not married to each other.

                         Yeah, I want to report a couple of 
                         drug dealers out in front of the 
                         Quick Stop.

               EXT. QUICK STOP--DAY

               Jay and Silent Bob are thrown against the wall outside by a 
               COP, who frisks them.

                                     JAY
                         What the Fuck, Serpico? What'd we 
                         do?

                                     COP
                         We got a report that two guys were 
                         hanging around outside the stores, 
                         selling pot?

                                     JAY
                         We don't smoke pot, yo.

               Teen 1 enters and hands Jay rolling papers.

                                     TEEN 1
                         Here're the rolling papers you wanted 
                         for your pot. And your change. Thanks.
                              (getting in Jay's 
                              face)
                         And The Time sucks ass!

               Teen 1 races off. Jay and Bob move to follow, but the Cop 
               stops them, grabbing the rolling papers out of Jay's hand. 
               He eyeballs the pair.

                                     COP
                         No pot, hunh? What do you need this 
                         for?

                                     JAY
                         What?  I got a wiping problem. I 
                         stick these little pieces of paper 
                         over my brown-eye, and bam--no shit 
                         stains in my undies.
                              (unbuttoning pants)
                         You don't believe me? Lemme show 
                         you.

               Jay drops his pants and leans against the wall, looking back 
               over his shoulder.

                                     JAY
                         Just spread my cheeks a little and 
                         you can see the fucking stink nuggets--

                                     COP
                         Pull up your pants up sir, Now!

               Jay bends down to pull up his pants and FARTS. Silent Bob 
               cracks up. The Cop grabs them both, leading them toward the 
               car.

                                     COP
                         Let's take a ride down to the station.

                                     JAY
                         What? It's suddenly a crime to fart, 
                         motherfucker?!

               BRODIE himself, holding a stack of comics in one hand and a 
               Dixie cup in the other, Jay and Silent Bob follow him as he 
               puts new books in the racks.

                                     BRODIE
                         Dante and Randal slapped you with a 
                         restraining order?!

                                     JAY
                         Judge said if we go within a hundred 
                         feet of the stores, we get thrown 
                         into County.

                         Fuck yeah! You know what they make 
                         you do in county? Toss the fucking

                         I guess if you really wanted to hang 
                         out in from of a convenience store, 
                         you could just buy your own now--
                         what with all that money you guys 
                         made.

                                     JAY
                         Hell yeah, bitch.

                         The money from the movie, dumb-ass.

                                     JAY

                         Here's the pulse, alright. And here's 
                         your finger--

                         --far from the pulse, jammed straight 
                         up your ass.

                              extends it to Jay)
                         Say--would you like a chocolate

               Brodie leads them back to the counter.

                         You see, kids, if you read Wizard, 
                         you'd know it's the top story this 
                         month.  Check it out.

               Brodie hands Jay and Silent Bob a copy of Wizard, opened to 
               the headline: Snootchie Bootchies! Bluntman and Chronic Get 
               Big Screen Treatment!  There are pictures of HOLDEN MCNEIL 
               AND BANKY EDWARDS, as well as drawings of Bluntman and 
               Chronic.

                                     JAY
                         When the fuck did this happen?!

                                     BRODIE
                         Well, after X-Men hit at the box 
                         office, all the studios started buying 
                         up every comic property they could 
                         get their hands on. Miramax optioned 
                         Bluntman and Chronic.

                                     JAY
                         Miramax? I thought they only made 
                         classy flicks like The Piano and The 
                         Crying Game?

                                     BRODIE
                         Yeah, well once they made She's All 
                         That, everything went to hell. So 
                         you're saying you haven't gotten a 
                         cut of the movie? Didn't Holden McNeil 
                         and Banky Edwards used to pay you 
                         likeness rights for the comic book?

                                     JAY
                         We haven't seen a fucking dime for 
                         no movie!

                                     BRODIE
                         Well boys, I'm no lawyer, but I think 
                         Holden and Banky owe you some of the 
                         proverbial phat cash. I mean they're 
                         making a movie based on characters 
                         that are based on you and Quiet 
                         Robert.

                                     JAY
                         It ain't me and Quiet Robert. It's a 
                         pair of stupid-ass superheroes that 
                         run around saying "Snitchy-Nitchies" 
                         or something.

                                     BRODIE
                         I believe it "Snootchie Boochies."  
                         Regardless--you're getting screwed. 
                         If I was you guys, I'd confront Holden 
                         McNeil and ask him for my movie check.

                                     JAY
                         Shit yeah. We gotsa get paid.

                                     BRODIE
                         And on that note, we cue the music.

               Jay lays down a House bass beat. Brodie complements it with 
               his own beat.

               EXT. POTZER'S INC--DAY

               Jay and Silent Bob mosey past the front door of the building 
               and knock.

               INT. POTZER'S INC--DAY

               Holden McNeil, opens the door and smiles.

                                     HOLDEN
                         Well! I have been waiting years to 
                         do this.
                              (smiles)
                         Look at these morose motherfuckers 
                         right here. Smells like someone shit 
                         in their cereal. Bunngg!

               Jay and Silent Bob enter. Holden closes the door, following 
               them.

                                     JAY
                         What the fuck took you so long 
                         answering your damn door? You trying 
                         to talk another girlfriend of yours 
                         into some of that gay-ass three-way 
                         action with your buddy?

                                     HOLDEN
                         No, I was just showering your mother's 
                         stink off me after I gave her a quick 
                         jump and sent her home. But now that 
                         you mention it--
                              (to Bob)
                         Thanks, you know. You could've made 
                         the moral of that story you told me 
                         a bit more clear.

               Silent Bob shrugs.

                                     HOLDEN
                         So what brings you two dirt merchants 
                         to my neck of the woods?

                                     JAY
                         Oh, I'll tell you what our necks are 
                         doing in your woods--

               Silent Bob holds up the Wizard article.

                                     JAY
                         Where's our motherfucking movie check?

                                     HOLDEN
                         You heard about that too, Hunh? Well, 
                         I've got nothing to do with it. That's 
                         Banky's deal. He owns the property 
                         now. I signed my half of the Bluntman 
                         and Chronic right over to him years 
                         ago.

                                     JAY
                         Why the fuck would you do a thing 
                         like that?

                                     HOLDEN
                         Because I'm almost thirty, for God's 
                         sake--why on earth would I want to 
                         keep writing about characters whose 
                         central preoccupations are weed and 
                         dick and fart jokes? You gotta grow, 
                         man. Don't you ever want more for 
                         yourself?
                              (off Silent Bob)
                         I know this poor, hapless sonovabitch 
                         does. I look in his doe eyes and I 
                         see a man crying out, "When, Lord? 
                         When the fuck can your servant ditch 
                         this foul-mouthed little chucklehead 
                         to whom I am a constant victim of 
                         his folly, and who bombards me and 
                         those around us with grade-A 
                         foolishness that prevents me from 
                         even getting to kiss a girl? Fuck! 
                         When?!

               Silent Bob nod like he's finally understood. Jay looks at 
               him, hurt, and Bob tried to downplay the comment's truth.

                                     JAY
                         I'm the chucklehead? Fuck you--you're 
                         the dumb-ass who gave away his comic, 
                         and now you ain't got no fat movie 
                         check neither.

                         When you're right, you're right. I 
                         wish I'd broken off a little piece 
                         for myself. Because if the buzz is 
                         any indication, the movie's gonna 
                         make some huge bank.

                         The Internet is a communication device

                         terrible, one-note jokes that only 
                         stoners laugh at.  They're fucking 
                         clown shoes. If they were real, I'd 
                         beat the shit out of them for being 
                         so stupid. I can't believe Miramax 
                         would have anything to so with this 
                         shit. I, for one, will be boycotting 
                         this movie. Who's with me?"
                              (leans back)
                         And then there are about fifty more 
                         posts from people who agree to join

                         Ah, let it go. Number one, they're a 
                         bunch of jealous little dicks who 
                         use the anonymity of the Net to insult 
                         people who're doing what they wish 
                         they were doing, and number two, 
                         they're not really talking about you 
                         guys--they talking about Bluntman 
                         and Chronic.

                                     JAY
                         But they said Jay and Silent Bob! 
                         They used our real names. It doesn't 
                         matter that there's a comic book 
                         version of us and a real version, 
                         'cause nobody knows we're real in 
                         real life.

                                     HOLDEN
                         Really.

                                     JAY
                         Yeah! And all these people who read 
                         that shit think the real Jay and 
                         Silent Bob are a couple of faggots 
                         'cause of that all these dicks are 
                         writing about the comic book Jay and 
                         Silent Bob! And maybe one night, me 
                         and Lunchbox'll be macking some bitch, 
                         and she'll be like "Oooo! I want to 
                         suck youse guys dicks off. What's 
                         your names?"  And I'll be like, "Jay 
                         and Silent Bob." And she'll be like, 
                         "Oh--I read on the Internet that 
                         youse guys were little fucking 
                         jerkoffs."  And then she goes and 
                         sucks two other guys's dicks off 
                         instead! Well fuck that!  We gotta 
                         put a stop to these hateful sonsa-
                         bitches before they ruin our good 
                         names!

                                     HOLDEN
                         First off, I don't know how good 
                         your names really are. Secondly, 
                         there's not much you can do about 
                         stopping this bile. The Internet's 
                         given everyone in America a voice, 
                         and everyone in American has chosen 
                         to use that voice to bitch about 
                         movies. As long as there's a Bluntman 
                         and Chronic movie, the Net-nerds are 
                         gonna have something negative to say 
                         about it.  Jay steams, thinking. 
                         Then, a light dawns on him.

                                     JAY
                         But wait a second--if there wasn't a 
                         Bluntman and Chronic movie, then no 
                         one would be saying shit about Jay 
                         and Silent Bob, right?

                                     HOLDEN
                         They're not saying anything about 
                         you now--they're talking about 
                         fictional characters!

                                     JAY
                              (oblivious to Holden; 
                              to Bob)
                         So all we gotta do is stop 'em from 
                         making the movie!

                                     HOLDEN
                         Yeah, and kiss-off the hundreds of 
                         thousands of dollars in royalties 
                         you're due in the process. Are you 
                         fucking retarded? Look, I'm probably 
                         not alone in the opinion that this 
                         flick is the worst idea since Greedo 
                         shooting first. I mean, a Jay and 
                         Silent Bob movie? Who would pay to 
                         see that?

               Holden, Jay and Silent Bob pause and look at the camera for 
               a beat. Then--

                                     HOLDEN
                         But since it is happening, you might 
                         as well just ignore the idiots on 
                         the Internet, go find Banky, and get 
                         your "motherfucking movie check." As 
                         you so succinctly put it. That's 
                         what's important here.

                                     JAY
                         No, Holden McNeil--what's important 
                         here is that there's a bunch of 
                         motherfuckers we don't even know 
                         calling us assholes on the Internet 
                         to a bunch of teenagers and guys who 
                         can't even get laid. Putting a stop 
                         to that is the most important thing 
                         we could ever do.
                              (off monitor)
                         When did it say they're making that 
                         movie?

                                     HOLDEN
                         They start this Friday.

                                     JAY
                         So if today's Tuesday, that gives us--
                              (counts)
                         Eight days.

                                     HOLDEN
                         It's more like three days.

                                     JAY
                         Right. Three days to stop that stupid 
                         fucking movie from getting made! 
                         C'mon, Silent Bob--

               Jay and Bob stand and look at each other, filled with purpose.

                                     JAY
                         We're going to Hollywood.

               They stride off. Holden shakes his head.

                                     HOLDEN
                         Now that's what I call the Blunt 
                         leading the Blunt.

               EXT. BUS STATION--DAY

               Jay and Silent Bob approach a bus that's labeled "Los 
               Angeles." They nod at each other and then climb aboard. After 
               a beat, they re-emerge.

                                     JAY
                         Tickets? Since when did they start 
                         charging for the bus?

               They head toward the depot.

                                     JAY
                         Didn't we used to ride that shit to 
                         school every day for free?

               EXT. HIGHWAY--DAY

               The bus roars past a sign that read: Leaving New Jersey.

               INT. BUS--SAME

               Jay makes his way up to the DRIVER.

                                     JAY
                         We in Hollywood yet?

                                     DRIVER
                         It's a three--day ride to Los Angeles, 
                         sir. We left twenty minutes ago.

                                     JAY
                         I didn't ask you about Los Angeles. 
                         I asked you about Hollywood.

                                     DRIVER
                         Hollywood's in Los Angeles, sir.

                                     JAY
                         Don't change the subject! Are we in 
                         Hollywood yet or not?

                                     DRIVER
                         Please sit down, sir.

               Jay glares at the Driver and heads back to his seat.

                                     JAY
                         Why don't you take your seat Ralph 
                         Kramden--

               Jay slumps into the seat beside Silent Bob.

                                     JAY
                         I'm fucking bored, man. There ain't 
                         shit to so on this bus.

               Silent Bob mimes jerking off.

                                     JAY
                         I already did that. Twice.

               Silent Bob shrugs, looking out the window, Jay looks across 
               the aisle and spots a CHILD IN A HELMET playing a handheld 
               video game. He leans over to him.

                                     JAY
                         Yo, Gretzky--lemme get a turn.

                                     CHILD
                         Leave me alone, little kid.

               The Child gives him the finger. Jay goes wide-eyed, turning 
               to Silent Bob.

                                     JAY
                         That fuck called me a little kid and 
                         gave me the finger! Go kick his ass!

               Silent Bob offers an incredulous look, as if to say, "He's 
               ten years old."

                                     JAY
                         You're my muscle, ain'tcha?

               Silent Bob kind of nods.

                                     JAY
                         So go open a can of whup-ass on that 
                         little fuck, and get me his game!

               Silent Bob sighs and stands. He climbs over Jay into the 
               aisle and stands in front of the child. He looks at him and 
               registers doubt. He looks back to Jay, who waves him on. 

               Silent Bob steels himself, looks back to the kid and reaches 
               for his game. The Child emits a high-pitched scream and starts 
               punching himself in the head. Silent Bob dives back into his 
               seat, trying to look nonchalant. The Child stops crying. Jay 
               looks at Silent Bob.

                                     JAY
                         You're one tough motherfucker, you 
                         know that?

               EXT. HIGHWAY--DAY

               The bus pulls over by the side of the road.

               INT. BUS--DAY

               The Bus Driver heads down the aisle toward the back of the 
               bus, followed by pissed-off PASSENGERS.

                                     PASSENGER
                         They been in there going on half an 
                         hour now! Two of them! Doing God 
                         knows what!

               The Bus Driver bangs on the bathroom door and shouts.

                                     DRIVER
                         This bus isn't moving another inch 
                         unless you clear out of there right 
                         now!

               No answer. The Bus Driver bangs on the door harder.

                                     DRIVER
                         DO YOU HEAR ME?! OPEN THIS DOOR! 
                         NOW!!

               The door handle turns, the door swings wide, and massive 
               amounts of smoke suddenly billow through the back of the 
               bus. The smoke clears to reveal Jay and Silent Bob squeezed 
               into the bathroom, holding a massive joint.

                                     JAY
                         Um--I think something's burning back 
                         here.

               EXT. ROADSIDE--LATER

               As the bus pulls away, Jay and Silent Bob are revealed, left 
               behind.

                                     JAY
                         The whole fucking world's against 
                         us, dude. I swear to God.

               Silent Bob nods. Jay sticks out his thumb and starts hitching.

               EXT. ROADSIDE--LATER

               Jay and Bob are walking backwards, hitching still.

                                     JAY
                         This sucks balls, man. How come we 
                         ain't getting no rides?

                         'Cause you're doing it all wrong.

               Jay and Bob look behind them. There's a GUY hitching as well.

                                     GUY
                         You gotta induce the drivers a little.

                                     JAY
                         Like how?

                                     GUY
                         Like this.

               The GUY holds out his sign to them. It reads: Will Give Head 
               For Ride.

                                     JAY
                         Yeah, but what happens when you get 
                         in the car, and you don't make with 
                         the head? Don't they kick your ass 
                         to the curb?

                                     GUY
                         Sure--if you don't make with the 
                         head.

               Jay and Bob look at him for a long beat. Then--

                                     JAY
                         Eww! You eat the cock?!?

                                     GUY
                         Yeah. If it'll get me a few hundred 
                         miles across country. I'll take a 
                         shot in the mouth.

                                     JAY
                         Yeah, but we ain't gay.

                                     GUY
                         Well, neither am I. But have you 
                         seen the price of bus tickets lately? 
                         Shit--I don't wanna cough up two 
                         hundred bucks just to get to Chicago.

                                     JAY
                         Well, I don't wanna cough up some 
                         dude's sperm!

                                     GUY
                         Don't be so suburban--this is the 
                         new millennium. Gay, straight--it's 
                         all the same now. There're no more 
                         lines.

               Jay draws a line on the ground with his foot.

                                     JAY
                         There's one. On this side of it, we 
                         ain't gay.

                                     GUY
                         All hitchers do this. Why do you 
                         think people pick us up? If you get 
                         a ride, it's expected--I don't care 
                         who the driver is. It's the first 
                         rule in the Book.

                                     JAY
                         What book?

                                     GUY
                         The unwritten Book of the Road.

               A TRUCK starts to pull over to the side of the road. The Guy 
               points to it, as if to say "See?" The passenger-side door 
               opens. The Guy climbs into the truck and closes the door. He 
               looks out the window at Jay and Bob.

                                     GUY
                         Follow the rules of the Book, and 
                         you'll get where you're going in no 
                         time.  Excuse me.

               Through the windshield, Jay and Silent Bob see the Guy go 
               face-first into the TRUCK DRIVER'S lap. The Truck Drivers 
               smiles, and the truck takes off, roaring down the road.

               Jay and Silent Bob watch the truck disappear. Then, a CAR 
               pulls up. The NUN driving rolls down the passenger side window 
               and leans toward them.

                                     NUN
                         You two boys need a ride?

               INT. CAR--LATER

               The NUN drives, smiling. Jay and Silent Bob sit in the back 
               seat, huddled close together, their eyes glued on the Nun.

                                     NUN
                         You both don't have to sit back there. 
                         One of you can sit up here with me.

               Silent Bob shakes his head "no" to Jay. Jay shrugs and climbs 
               up front.

                                     NUN
                         So where are you boys from?

                                     JAY
                         New Jersey.

                                     NUN
                         What brings you to Indiana?

                                     JAY
                         We're going to Hollywood.

                                     NUN
                         Hollywood, hunh? That's a long ways 
                         away.

                                     JAY
                         Yeah--we're lucky you picked us up.

                                     NUN
                         Well, do unto others. That's what 
                         the Book says.

                                     JAY
                              (misinterpreting 
                              completely)
                         Wait a minute--you follow the Book, 
                         too?

                                     NUN
                         I live my life by it.

                                     JAY
                         Really? You?

                                     NUN
                         Of course. You know how lonely it 
                         gets on the road? Thanks to the Book, 
                         I'm never alone--if you know what I 
                         mean.

                                     JAY
                         I guess. This guy back there explained 
                         it to us. But I didn't think you'd 
                         be into that.

                                     NUN
                         Are you kidding? I've dedicated my 
                         life to it. Every hour of every day.

                                     JAY
                         Shit--you nuns are alright.

                                     NUN
                         You live by the Book, too?

                                     JAY
                         You picked us up, didn't you? I gotta.

                                     NUN
                         That's good to hear. But it takes 
                         deed, not words. It's a lot easier 
                         to say you live by the Book than to 
                         actually do it.
                              (looks at him)
                         Can you do it?

                                     JAY
                         You want me to do it right now?

                                     NUN
                         No time like the present, right?

               Jay looks back at Silent Bob. Silent Bob shakes his head 
               "no." Jay shrugs them flips his hair over his shoulder, and 
               starts to bend down.

                                     JAY
                         Alright.
                              (he suddenly stops)
                         You hear that? She's not a Catholic. 
                         She's a Presbyterian.

               Jay disappears below the dash, The Nun goes wide-eyed.

               EXT. ROADSIDE--DAY

               The Nun's car screeched to the side of the road. Jay gets 
               kicked our of the front seat by the screaming Nun. Silent 
               Bob rushes out too, and the car races off. Jay's wipes his 
               mouth. He pulls a long curly hair from between his teeth.

                                     JAY
                         Dude--she had seventies bush.

               EXT. HIGHWAY--NIGHT

               Jay and Bob continue hitching.

                                     JAY
                         I can't believe this shit. Five hours 
                         and not a single ride. Every day, 
                         millions of people hitch to Hollywood 
                         and stop studios from making movies 
                         about 'em. But when you and me try 
                         it, it's like we're trapped in a 
                         fucking cartoon!

               A familiar-looking VAN pulls up in the other side of the 
               raid, The horn beeps.  Jay and Bob look at each other, shrug, 
               and race across the street, get in. The van pulls off.

               INT. VAN--NIGHT

               Jay and Bob sit in the back of the can and stare at--

               A clean-cut GUY, a Bookish woman in glasses, a red headed 
               Beauty, a stoner DUDE, and a GREAT DANE.

               Jay looks at Silent Bob.

                                     JAY
                         Zoinks, yo

                                     GUY
                         And now we can finally solve the 
                         mystery of the Hitchhiking Ghouls! 
                         Pull off their masks and let's see 
                         who they really are!

                                     BOOKISH
                         I don't think they are masks.

                                     BEAUTY
                         I don't think they're Hitchhiking 
                         Girls either.

                                     BOOKISH
                         Ghouls, you fucking moron. Not Girls.
                              (to herself)
                         Though I wish they were hitchhiking 
                         girls. Sexy, skimpily clad hitchhiking
                         girls--

                                     GUY
                         Let's kick them out. We've got a 
                         mystery to solve.

                                     DUDE
                         The only mystery here is why we take 
                         our cues from a dick in a neckerchief!

                                     GUY
                         Keep it up, Beatnik! I'll feed you 
                         to the fucking dog!

                                     BEAUTY
                              (covering her ears; 
                              shrieking)
                         I CAN'T TAKE ALL THIS FIGHTING!

                                     JAY
                         YO!

               The Gang look to Jay and Bob.

                                     JAY
                         Youse guys need to turn those frowns 
                         upside down! And we got just the 
                         thing for that.
                              (pulls out a bag of 
                              joints)
                         We call them Doobie Snax.

               INT. VAN--WEED VISION

               As Jay and Bob toke up, we go all SLO-MO and 70's freaky 
               (with the image seeming to SWIM). Through their stoned haze, 
               we see old-school witches, skeletons, and ghouls swirling 
               about their heads--the latter of which gets his mask taken 
               off to reveal a man inside a costume.

               Jay and Bob look at the gang, then take a hit off their joint 
               and look back.  Suddenly, the gang's engaged in total 
               debauchery: the Dude rides the windshield while the Guy 
               cackles insanely, blindfolded by his neckerchief. Bookish 
               and Beauty are in their underwear, making out with each other. 
               The Great Dane looks at Jay and Bob and says--

                                     GREAT DANE
                         Ri, Ray rand Rirent Rob

               The Great Dane rolls over, revealing its RED THING sticking 
               way out of its sheath. It's monstrous. Jay and Bob go wide-
               eyed.

                                     JAY
                         Look at his fuckin' lipstick!!! He's 
                         got a stoner-boner!!!

               Jay and Bob smile and pass out.

               We cut back to the gang, who now appear as they did prior to 
               Weed-Vision. They stare at the O.C. Jay and Bob.

                                     BEAUTY
                         I think they passed out.

                                     GUY
                         Great. What do we do with them now?

                                     DUDE
                         Let's cut out their kidneys to sell 
                         on the black market and leave them 
                         in a seedy motel bathtub full of 
                         ice.

                                     BOOKISH
                         Oh God, not again?

               INT. SEEDY MOTEL BATHROOM--NIGHT

               Jay lies in a bathtub full of ice, screaming. There's a scar 
               on his back.

               EXT. KANSAS CITY PARK--DAY

               Jay wakes up suddenly, screaming. He startles Bob awake as 
               well, as he clutched at this back lifting his shirt to see 
               the scar. It's not there.

                                     JAY
                         Holy shit, I had a horrible dream.
                              (looks around)
                         Yo, I'm hungry. Where can we get 
                         some breakfast?

               Bob looks around, and then locks on something O.C. He points, 
               and Jay looks, smiles widely, and nods.

               EXT. MOOBY'S FAST FOOD JOINT--DAY

               An ESTABLISHING SHOT of the fast food eatery, as Jay and Bob 
               enter.

               INT. MOOBY'S FAST FOOD JOINT--SAME

               As the pair head for the counter, Jay notices a public 
               INTERNET TERMINAL. He tugs at Silent Bob's arm.

                                     JAY
                         Yo--check that shit out: the Internet. 
                         Let's see if those fucks said 
                         something new about us and that stupid 
                         flick.

               Bob shrugs, heading for the terminal. He inserts a dollar 
               and types, following it up with a mouse click. The pair look 
               at the screen and go wide-eyed.

                                     JAY
                         "Any movie based on Jay and Silent 
                         Bob is gonna lick balls, because 
                         they both, in fact, lick balls. Namely 
                         each other's."

               Jay and Silent Bob look at each other, wide-eyed.

                                     JAY
                         Eww.
                              (reading further)
                         "Yes--they are real people. Real 
                         stupid people. Signed, Darth Randal."
                              (to Bob)
                         Motherfucker! It's time we wrote 
                         something back! Type this shit down.

               Silent Bob starts typing as Jay dictates.

                                     JAY
                         All you motherfuckers are gonna pay. 
                         You are the ones who are the ball-
                         lickers.  We're gonna fuck your 
                         mothers whole you watch and cry like 
                         little bitches. Once we get to 
                         Hollywood and find those Miramax 
                         fucks who are making the movie, we're 
                         gonna make 'em eat our shit, then 
                         shit our shit, then eat their shit 
                         which is made of our shit that we 
                         made 'em eat. Then all you 
                         motherfuckers are next.  Love, Jay 
                         and Silent Bob.

               Silent Bob finishes typing and presses "Return". He and Jay 
               nod at each other, then head over to the counter line, looking 
               up at the menu board.

                                     JAY
                         That'll fucking show 'em. Now we eat 
                         our Egga-Mooby-Muffins, then get 
                         back on the road, get to Hollywood, 
                         and stop that fucking movie from 
                         getting made. No more hairy-bush 
                         nuns, no more dogs. We keep our eye 
                         on the prize, and not let nothing--
                         and I mean NOTHING--distract me.

               As Jay finishes speaking, he looks to the O.C. doors and 
               freezes.  A gorgeous GIRL walks through the front doors, all 
               in SLO-MO to the tune of Prince's The Most Beautiful Girl in 
               the World. She's bathed in light, glowing.

               She bats her eyelashes, gliding toward us.

               Jay is mouth-agape wide eyed. Silent Bob looks at him, then 
               at the O.C.Girl. He slowly waves his hand in front of Jay's 
               eyes, getting zero response.

               JAY'S POV

               The Girl smiles at us. His POV goes from her face, down to 
               her breasts, then down to her crotch.

               Jay moves past Silent Bob and meets the Girl in the middle 
               of the floor. He embraces her and lands a long, sweet kiss 
               on her mouth. After a beat, he starts fumbling like a teenager 
               to get to second base under her shirt, totally incongruous 
               with the music. The Girl kindly tries to deter him.

               But it's just a fantasy. Jay's still standing there next to 
               Silent Bob, but he is sporting a huge BONER. Silent Bob rolls 
               his eyes. He grabs a soda cup off the counter and sticks it 
               over Jay's boner, just as the Girl joins them in line. She 
               smiles at the zombified Jay.

                                     GIRL
                              (off cup)
                         Oh my God. Do you get free refills 
                         with that?

                                     JAY
                         Oh, what--this? I just wear this for 
                         protection. You know--so no guys try 
                         to grab my shit.

                                     GIRL
                         Hi. I'm Justice.

                                     JAY
                              (dreamily)
                         And I am so fucking yours--

               Silent Bob pokes Jay, who shakes of his daze.

                                     JAY
                         I mean hi. I'm Jay. And this is my 
                         hereto life-mate, Silent Bob.

                                     JUSTICE
                         It's nice to meet you.

                                     JAY
                         Justice, hunh? That's a nice name.
                              (under his breath, to 
                              Bob)
                         Jay'n'Justice, sitting in a tree. F-
                         U-C-K-I-N-G--
                              (back to Justice)
                         So you come here often?

                                     JUSTICE
                         Oh, I'm not from around here. My 
                         friends and I are taking a road trip, 
                         and we just stopped to grab something 
                         to eat.

                                     JAY
                         Your friends, hunh? Where they at?

                                     JUSTICE
                              (pointing)
                         Out there. By that van.

               Jay and Bob look past Justice to see a VAN with three other 
               gorgeous GIRLS stretching outside of it, throwing their hair 
               around, looking incredibly sexy.

               Without looking at Silent Bob, Jay quietly says to him--

                                     JAY
                         Dude--I think I just filled the cup.

               INT. VAN--DAY

               Jay and Bob climb into the can, getting odd looks from the 
               other Girls, Justice follows them in, tossing the fast food 
               to her friends.

                                     JAY
                         Ladies, ladies, ladies! Jay and Silent 
                         Bob are in the Hizz-ouse!!!

                                     SISSY
                         Who the fuck are these guys?

                                     JUSTICE
                         This is Jay and Silent Bob.
                              (to Jay and Bob)
                         Guys, this is Sissy, Missy, and 
                         Chrissy.

                                     CHRISSY
                         Where the fuck did they come from?

                                     JUSTICE
                         I met 'em inside. They're gonna hitch 
                         a ride.

                                     SISSY
                         I don't know if that's such a great 
                         idea. Jussy.

                                     JAY
                         Sure it is, Juggs.

                                     MISSY
                         Oh my god--he just called Sissy 
                         "Juggs"!

                                     CHRISSY
                         I'm on it.

               Chrissy lunges toward Jay, pulling a knife.

                                     JUSTICE
                         Chrissy, no!

               Sissy stops Chrissy, shoving a burger into her hands.

                                     SISSY
                         We're in the middle of suburbia, 
                         Chrissy. Let's try to act like it.

                                     CHRISSY
                         And what-stupid ass little foul-
                         mouthed bitch-boys don't get their 
                         balls cut off in suburbia?

                                     JAY
                              (oblivious)
                         What's with the knife? We having 
                         cake or something?

                                     CHRISSY
                         Holy shit--he's retarded, to boot.

                                     JAY
                              (to Silent Bob)
                         Yo--she called you retarded.

                                     SISSY
                              (to Justice)
                         What's wrong with you, Justice? You 
                         do remember where we're going, don't 
                         you?

                                     MISSY
                         That we do have a job to do?

                                     JUSTICE
                         They're just gonna tag along for a 
                         few miles. They won't get in the 
                         way, I promise.
                              (cutesy)
                         Please?

                                     SISSY
                         Fine--they can ride with us. But 
                         they're so out of here before we get 
                         to Boulder.

                                     JUSTICE
                         Honest Injun.

                                     CHRISSY
                         "Honest Injun"?
                              (to Sissy)
                         I can't believe what a pushover you 
                         are.

                                     JAY
                         And I can't believe fine-ass bitches 
                         like yourselves eat that shit. Don't 
                         you know fast food makes girls fart?

               Suddenly, Jay and Bob are parted by BRENT, who's getting 
               into the van.

                                     BRENT
                         Say--what's all this talk about 
                         farting?

               Sissy, Missy, and Chrissy immediately go from disgusted to 
               sweet and airy, totally switching characters.

                                     SISSY/CHRISSY/MISSY
                         Hi Brent!

                                     SISSY
                         This is Brent. He's with us, too.

                                     CHRISSY
                         Brent, tell these sillies that girls 
                         don't fart.

                                     BRENT
                         Of course they don't! Only skeevy 
                         stoners fart.

               The very white Brent puts his hand out to be slapped by Jay 
               and Silent Bob.

                                     BRENT
                         What up, homies?
                              (off the Girls)
                         Wow, Three guys, four girls--
                              (to Jay and Bob)
                         What's the count boys?

               Jay and Bob look at each other and roll their eyes.

               EXT. HIGHWAY--DAY

               The van drives down the road. We hear singing from inside.

               INT. VAN--DAY

               Brent strums a guitar and sings, as the Girls and Jay and 
               Bob listen, rolling eyes.

                                     BRENT
                         Hey there mister science-guy. Don't 
                         spray that aerosol in my eye. For I 
                         don't really want to die. I'm a noble 
                         rabbit!

                                     JAY
                         What're you guys, like a cover band 
                         or something?

                                     SISSY
                         We're the Kansas State chapter of 
                         S.A.A.C.--Students Against Animal 
                         Cruelty.

                                     CHRISSY
                         And we're on our way to Colorado to 
                         give Provasik a piece of our minds!

               Everyone lets out a whoop, except Jay and Bob.

                                     JAY
                         What the fuck are you bitches babbling 
                         about?

                                     BRENT
                         Hey! Watch the language little boy. 
                         There are females present.

               Jay and Silent Bob eyeball Brent, until Justice distracts 
               them.

                                     JUSTICE
                         Provasik Pharmaceuticals is a medical 
                         lab where they perform gross 
                         experiments on animals.

                                     JAY
                         So, what kind of animals are we 
                         talking about here--like bears and 
                         rhinos?

                                     BRENT
                         No--more like rabbits, dogs, cats... 
                         heck, even monkeys, If we don't speak 
                         for them, who will?
                              (touches Justice's 
                              arm)
                         Right, Jussy?

               Jay sees this and his eyes flare over the competition.  After 
               a beat, he relaxes.

                                     JAY
                         Hey, uh--Brent? Can I talk to you 
                         over here for a second?

               Brent joins Jay, strumming his guitar. Jay addresses him 
               confidentially.

                                     JAY
                         Be honest, yo--you're down with this 
                         for the fine-ass pussy, right?

                                     BRENT
                         I'm down with this because I love 
                         animals, stupid.

                                     JAY
                         Even sheep?

                                     BRENT
                         Of course. Sheep are beautiful 
                         creatures.

                                     JAY
                         They are beautiful, aren't they?

                                     BRENT
                         Oh God, yes.

                                     JAY
                         So then you'd fuck a sheep?

                                     BRENT
                         What is your damage little boy? You've 
                         got a sick and twisted world 
                         perspective.

                                     JAY
                         No, you misunderstand me, Prince 
                         Valiant. I mean if you were another 
                         sheep.  Would you fuck a sheep if 
                         you were another sheep?

                                     BRENT
                         I--suppose so.

                                     JAY
                         That's what I thought.
                              (suddenly loudly, to 
                              all)
                         YO! THIS MOTHERFUCKER AIN'T ONE OF 
                         US! HE JUST SAID HE'D FUCK A SHEEP!

               EXT. HIGHWAY--DAY

               The side door of the van slides open and Brent gets hurled 
               out of the moving vehicle. Jay throws his guitar at him as 
               well, yelling and flipping the bird as the van drives off.

                                     JAY
                         YA DIRTY SHEEP FUCKER!!!

               EXT. HIGHWAY--LATER

               The van drives down the road.

               INT. VAN--SAME

               Missy drives. Sissy sits in the passenger seat. Chrissy kneels 
               between them.

                                     CHRISSY
                         What the fuck are we gonna do now?

                                     SISSY
                         Shut up, I'm thinking.

               In the back, Justice studies some blueprints. Jay joins her, 
               and she quickly folds them up.

                                     JAY
                         Is Hollywood near where we're going?

                                     JUSTICE
                         Is that where you guys are from?

                                     JAY
                         Ch'yeah, right. Jersey represent!

                                     JUSTICE
                         Oh, a Jersey Boy. What brings you 
                         all the way out here?

                                     JAY
                         Well, we couldn't hang in front of 
                         the Quick Stop no more, 'cause of 
                         the strainen-en order, which sucks 
                         ass 'cause it's been like our home 
                         since we were kids. Silent Bob even 
                         busted his cherry there.

                                     JUSTICE
                              (to Bob)
                         You did? I'll bet she was a lucky 
                         girl.

               Bob blushes, Jay doesn't like that Justice's attention has 
               strayed.

                                     JAY
                         Look, fuck that fat fuck--I'm trying 
                         to tell a story here.

                                     JUSTICE
                         Sorry.

                                     JAY
                         Anyway, we were talking to Brodie 
                         and he said there's gonna be a 
                         Bluntman and Chronic movie. So we 
                         went to see Holden McNeil, and he 
                         showed us the Internet, and that's 
                         where we found all these fucking 
                         little jerkoffs were saying shit 
                         about us. So we decided to go to 
                         Hollywood and stop the movie from 
                         getting made.  And now we're here.

                                     JUSTICE
                         Wow. I have no idea what you just 
                         said.

                                     JAY
                         Yeah, I get that a lot. So you like 
                         animals, huh?

                                     JUSTICE
                         Sure.

                                     JAY
                         That's cool. Even snakes?

                                     JUSTICE
                         You can't exclude an animal just 
                         because it's not cuddly. Of course I 
                         like snakes.

                                     JAY
                         How about trouser snakes?

                                     JUSTICE
                         What's a trouser snake?

               Just then, a little JAY DEVIL appears on Jay's left shoulder.

                                     JAY DEVIL
                              (to Jay)
                         What the fuck are you waiting for? 
                         She went for the setup! Reach in 
                         your fucking pants, and pull yer 
                         cock out, bitch! That's the kinda 
                         shit girls like!

               Suddenly another little JAY DEVIL appears in Jay's right 
               shoulder.

                                     JAY DEVIL 2
                         Right about here's where the angel's 
                         supposed to show up and tell you not 
                         to pull your dick out. But we bitch-
                         slapped that little fuck and sent 
                         him packing, so it's smooth sailing. 
                         Let 'er rip, boy!

               They disappear in little puffs of smoke and Jay shoves his 
               hand down his pants, getting ready to whip out his dick, 
               when suddenly a little JAY ANGEL appears on his shoulder, 
               rubbing a swollen jaw.

                                     JAY ANGEL
                         Sorry I'm late. So what's the deal 
                         here?
                              (looks down)
                         Oh, shit--you're not thinking of 
                         whipping your dick out at this fine 
                         piece of woman, are you?

               Jay thinks, then nods "Yes." The Jay Angel rolls his eyes, 
               and slaps him.

                                     JAY ANGEL
                         Tell you what: look at Silent Bob. 
                         See if he thinks it's a good idea to 
                         whip your dick out.

               Jay looks to Silent Bob. Silent Bob looks from Jay's hand in 
               his pants to Jay and shakes his head "no," sternly. Jay 
               withdraws his hand from his pants. The Jay Angel nods, 
               satisfied.

                                     JAY ANGEL
                         That's it, boy--put the dick down. 
                         You gotta go from the heart, yo. No 
                         little perv bullshit will do for 
                         this one. Be smooth. Be Don Juan de 
                         la Nootch. Now I gotta go beat the 
                         shit out of two suckerpunching little 
                         bitches. Remember--don't pull your 
                         dick out until she asks you to.
                              (beat)
                         Or until she sleeping. Bunnnnggg!  
                         The Jay Angel blinks away. Justice 
                         looks at Jay, a bit confused.

                                     JAY
                         Don't ask.
                              (beat)
                         So, uh--what can a pimp-daddy like 
                         me do to help the animals?

                                     JUSTICE
                         You really don't want to help us--

                                     JAY
                         What the fuck are you talking about? 
                         Sure I do. I'd do anything for you.

               Justice smiles. Jay tries to recover.

                                     JAY
                         I mean, youse guys! I'd do anything 
                         for youse guys. For the lift and 
                         shit.

                                     JUSTICE
                         You sure?

                                     JAY
                         Sure, I'm sure. I said it, didn't I. 
                         Fuck

                                     JUSTICE
                         Well--okay. Let me talk it over with 
                         the other girls and get back to you.

                                     JAY
                         You do that.

               Jay takes Justice's hand and kisses it.

                                     JAY
                         I'll be right here.

               He winks at her, smiles and moves to the other side of the 
               can, near Silent Bob.  He's still smiling at Justice and 
               winking when he looks to Silent Bob who stares at him blankly, 
               then imitates Jay's hand-kissing back at him, Jay scowls.

                                     JAY
                         Fuck you. Fatty.

               EXT. CONVENIENCE STORY--DAY

               The van pulls up and all pile out, stretching. The Girls 
               head toward the store.  Justice calls over to Jay and Silent 
               Bob.

                                     JUSTICE
                         You guys want anything from inside?

                                     JAY
                         No, we're cool, thanks hon.

               Justice smiles and heads inside. Jay and Silent Bob study 
               the front of the foreign convenience store. They look for a 
               place to lean, try a few spots out, then settle into one. 
               After a beat--

                                     JAY
                         It just ain't the same, is it? This 
                         place licks balls compared to Quick 
                         Stop.

               Silent Bob shakes his head "Yeah."

                                     JAY
                         And speaking of licking balls--how 
                         'bout that Justice chick? She is too 
                         fine.  And she smells so fucking 
                         pretty. She's got a nice voice, too. 
                         And that body?  Smoking. You know, 
                         she never once said "fuck off," when 
                         I was talking to her, or pulled out 
                         the pepper spray, or nothing. I tell 
                         ya, Lunchbox--she could be the one.

               INT. CONVENIENCE STORE--DAY

               Justice is at the microwave when she's suddenly surrounded 
               by the other girls.

                                     MISSY
                         Smooth move, Justice.

                                     CHRISSY
                              (slapping Justice 
                              upside the head)
                         Nice going, Four Eyes!

                                     JUSTICE
                         Ow!

                                     SISSY
                         Why the fuck did you let that little 
                         stoner throw Brent our of the van?!

                                     JUSTICE
                         Oh please--if I had to listen to one 
                         more of those stupid songs, I was 
                         going to throw him out myself.

                                     SISSY
                         We needed Brent, Justice! He was our 
                         patsy!

                                     JUSTICE
                         We'll find someone else. Besides, I 
                         didn't see you trying to stop Jay 
                         from throwing him out.

                                     SISSY
                         Because I didn't want to blow our 
                         cover!

                                     JUSTICE
                         Cover, shmover--you all hated his 
                         songs, too.

                                     CHRISSY
                         Not as much as I hate you.

               Justice offers Chrissy a cold glance,

                                     CHRISSY
                         Fuck, if I don't get to kill someone 
                         soon, I'm gonna--fucking kill someone!

                                     SISSY
                              (rubbing Chrissy's 
                              shoulders)
                         Don't mind Chrissy. She's just a 
                         little too wound for sound.

                                     CHRISSY
                         Then how about you help me take the 
                         edge off?

               Chrissy grabs Missy forcefully and the pair make out, hot 
               and heavy in the middle of the convenience store. Other 
               customers regard them wide-eyed.

                                     JUSTICE
                              (to Customers)
                         They're really good friends.

                                     SISSY
                              (TO CHRISSY AND MISSY)
                         Would you two knock it off? We're in 
                         the fucking heartland here! Try to 
                         blend!

                                     JUSTICE
                         They already do--she's the milkmaid, 
                         and she's the cow.

                                     CHRISSY
                         Oh, I'm a cow, am I?  I'm a mad cow, 
                         bitch. And now I'm gonna rip your 
                         head off and fuck your spine stump.

                                     SISSY
                         Enough!
                              (calm to Justice)
                         We have a very simple gang here, 
                         Justice. I'm the brains, Chrissy's 
                         the brawn, and Missy's the tech-girl. 
                         But lately, I'm having a hard time 
                         figuring out what you're doing here.

                                     JUSTICE
                         That makes two of us.

                                     CHRISSY
                         Shit--your name doesn't even fit the 
                         rhyme scheme.

                                     JUSTICE
                         That's because very few names rhyme 
                         with "douchebag."

                                     CHRISSY
                              (getting in her face)
                         You're dancing on my last nerve, 
                         Strawberry Shortcake.
                              (to Sissy)
                         You deal with the weak link. I'm 
                         gonna take Missy into the dirty 
                         convenience store bathroom and hate-
                         fuck the shit out of her.

               Chrissy drags Missy off. Justice and Sissy watch them go.

                                     JUSTICE
                         And you said letting them read all 
                         that Anais Nin wouldn't amount to 
                         anything.

                                     SISSY
                         Don't change the subject. You know 
                         what you have to do now, right? Since 
                         you let our patsy slip away, you've 
                         gotta convince the little kid and 
                         that fat guy to take his place. 
                         They've gotta break into Provasik 
                         now.

                                     JUSTICE
                         Uh-uh!

                                     SISSY
                         Uh-huh. You'll do it; or you're out 
                         of this gang. Just use the little 
                         one's crush to convince him, since 
                         he's so fucking in love with you.

                                     JUSTICE
                         Jay? No he's not.

                                     SISSY
                         What--am I blind? He wasn't kissing 
                         your hand back in the van like he 
                         was fucking Lord Byron?

                                     JUSTICE
                         Well, maybe he was just raised with 
                         manners.

               EXT. CONVENIENCE STORE--DAY

               A GIRL walks past Jay and Bob, heading out of the store.

                                     JAY
                              (to exited Girl)
                         YO, BABY! YOU EVER HAVE YOUR ASSHOLE 
                         LICKED BY A FAT MAN IN AN OVERCOAT?!
                              (to Bob)
                         Yeah.

               INT. CONVENIENCE STORE--DAY

               Sissy continues to confront Justice.

                                     SISSY
                         You're the one that brought the kid 
                         in, Jussy. So you've gotta make 
                         amends.

                                     JUSTICE
                         Jay is not taking Brent's place as 
                         the patsy.

                                     SISSY
                         That kid and his quite friend are 
                         our only options at this point. Now 
                         we got about two hours before we get 
                         to Boulder. That gives you plenty of 
                         of time to work on him.

                                     JUSTICE
                         I'm not gonna do it.

                                     SISSY
                         Why the fuck not?

                                     JUSTICE
                         Because he's just to so innocent!

               Justice looks out the window and smiles, seeing Jay dancing 
               alongside Bob.

                                     JUSTICE
                         Look at him--

               EXT. CONVENIENCE STORE--SAME

               Jay's dancing still, but now we hear what he's SINGING to 
               Silent Bob.

                                     JAY
                         I'm gonna finger-fuck her tight little 
                         asshole! Finger-bang and tea-bang my 
                         balls--in her mouth! Where? Where? 
                         In her mouth--balls-a-plenty in her 
                         mouth!  Balls, balls, sweaty balls--

               INT. CONVENIENCE STORE--SAME

               Sissy eyeballs Justice, who's still looking out at Jay.

                                     SISSY
                         Who's it going to be, Jussy--him or 
                         us?

               Justice looks at Sissy. Sissy nods at her. Justice looks 
               back out at Jay.

               INT. VAN--DAY

               Justice talks to Jay and Silent Bob.

                                     JAY
                         Steal a monkey? Shit--no problem.

                                     JUSTICE
                         It's not really stealing--it's 
                         liberating it, and--
                              (finally hears him)
                         Wait a second--did you say, "No 
                         problem"?

                                     JAY
                         Yeah, Fuck--we steal monkeys all the 
                         time.
                              (to Bob)
                         Right, Lunchbox?

               Silent Bob glares at Jay.

                                     JUSTICE
                         It's not like it's a bad thing. It's 
                         for a good cause.

                                     JAY
                         Oh, it for the best cause, mon cheri--
                              (takes her hand)
                         The cause of love.
                              (kisses her hand, 
                              then releases)
                         Snoogans--

                                     JUSTICE
                         What the heck is that?

                                     JAY
                         What's what?

                                     JUSTICE
                         "Snoogans," I believe it was.

                                     JAY
                         What the fuck do you think it means? 
                         It means "I'm kidding."

                                     JUSTICE
                         Ohhh. Well, that's too bad.

               She smiles at Jay, touches his chin and heads to the front 
               of the van. Jay plays it cool until she's out of sight, then 
               humps silent Bob's leg like a dog.

                                     JAY
                              (singing)
                         I can't believe I'm gonna get some 
                         pussy for stealing a monkey!
                              (speaking)
                         If I'd known it was that easy, I'd've 
                         been stealing monkeys since I was 
                         like seven and shit.

               Jay looks at Silent Bob, who clearly disapproves.

                                     JAY
                         Don't, motherfucker. Don't you ruin 
                         this for me. Me and Justice are gonna 
                         get married one day, so don't be 
                         giving me that "we-ain't-stealing-no-
                         monkey" look.  I'm Morris Day; you're 
                         Jerome, bitch. Don't forget that. 
                         That girl? That girl's in love with 
                         me.

               Up front, Justice talks to Sissy, while Missy drives.

                                     JUSTICE
                         They're gonna do it.

                                     SISSY
                         Good. They do their part--
                              (pats a video camera)
                         And we'll do ours.

               Justice eyes Sissy, then slumps in her seat.

               EXT. PROVASIK MEDICAL LABS--NIGHT

               The Van rolls up across the street from the Provasik Labs, 
               parking in front of another large building.

               INT. VAN--SAME

               Jay and Silent bob get out, along with Justice. They wear 
               Ninja masks. Missy and Chrissy follow.

                                     JUSTICE
                         Remember--we meet back here when 
                         you're done. You sure you're okay 
                         with this?

                                     JAY
                         As sure as I am that you're the 
                         hottest bitch I ever seen.

               Chrissy lunges at Jay, Missy holds her back, dragging Chrissy 
               away.

                                     JAY
                         What's twisting that bitch's tits?

                                     JUSTICE
                         Maybe it's because women don't like 
                         to be called "bitches," Jay.

                                     JAY
                         They don't? Well how 'bout "piece of 
                         ass"?

                                     JUSTICE
                         How about not.

                                     JAY
                         Well, what the fuck am I supposed to 
                         call you, then?

                                     JUSTICE
                         Something sweet, you big goof. 
                         Something nice.

                                     JAY
                              (thinks; then)
                         Boo-boo kitty fuck.

                                     JUSTICE
                              (laughing)
                         Okay.  That's a start.

               Sissy jumps out of the van, holding the video camera, aiming 
               it at Jay and Bob.

                                     SISSY
                         Jay, before you go, could you say 
                         something into the camera about the 
                         clitoris.

                                     JAY
                         What?

                                     JUSTICE
                              (to Sissy)
                         Man you are such a bitch--

                                     SISSY
                              (off Justice; to Jay)
                         She's just a little embarrassed. 
                         See, Jussy and I are putting together 
                         this documentary for our Human 
                         Sexuality class, and we need a male 
                         perspective on the clitoris.

                                     JAY
                         The female clitoris?

                                     SISSY
                         Uh--yeah.

                                     JUSTICE
                         Jay, you don't have to do this.

               She elbows Sissy.

                                     JAY
                         Nah, it's cool, hon. There's a few 
                         things I can say about the clit that 
                         I's like you to hear.
                              (clears throat; into 
                              camera)
                         I am the master of the clit! I make 
                         that shit work! It does what ever 
                         the fuck I tell it to do!  No one 
                         rules the clit like me!
                              (off Silent Bob)
                         Not this little fuck! None of you 
                         little fucks out there! I am the 
                         clit commander!!! Remember that--
                         commander of all clits!

               Jay proceeds to make some pussy-eating faces. Justice shakes 
               her head at Sissy, who snaps the camera closed and smiles.

                                     SISSY
                         Awesome. Knock 'em dead, Tiger.

               Sissy climbs back into the van.

                                     JAY
                              (to Justice)
                         So--can I get a little kiss for good 
                         luck?

               Justice smiles at Jay, then kisses him sweetly on the lips.

                                     JAY
                         So--can I get a little blow job for 
                         good luck?

               Justice smiles and pulls Jay's mask down. He heads off, 
               revealing Silent Bob behind him, lips puckered, handing in 
               midair. Jay reached back into the frame, pulling Bob out. 
               Justice watches them go.

                                     SISSY
                         Jussy. C'mon.

               Justice climbs back into the van.

               INT. VAN--SAME

               Justice sits, glaring at Sissy.

                                     SISSY
                         Hey, Lover-girl. You cock-block my 
                         authority again, you lose your fucking 
                         fronts, you got that?

                                     JUSTICE
                         Yes, sir.

               Sissy takes the tape out of the camera and hands it off to 
               Missy, beside whom is a bag full of high-tech equipment.

                                     SISSY
                         Phase One, down. While we're executing 
                         Phase Two, you edit that tape and 
                         grab a new car.

                                     MISSY
                         No sweat.

                                     SISSY
                         Let's suit up.

               EXT. PROVASIK MEDICAL LABS--NIGHT

               Jay and Silent bob tuck-and-roll across the front lawn, 
               stopping at the building. Silent Bob pulls a GRAPPLING GUN 
               out of his coat. He fires it into the air as Jay quickly 
               gives the "metal" sign, and the pair are lifted out-of-frame.

               INT. PROVASIK MEDICAL LABS--NIGHT

               It's dead quiet and still. Then, the pair smash through a 
               window, landing in the floor in a ball. They lift their Ninja 
               hoods. Jay glares at Silent Bob.

                                     JAY
                         You fat fuck--

               INT. VAN--NIGHT

               Missy peers through binoculars out the window.

                                     SISSY
                         They in?

                                     MISSY
                         You can say that.

                                     SISSY
                         Time to shine. Let's go.

               EXT. VAN--NIGHT

               The quartet piles out of the van, and we get our first look 
               at them: sexily geared up for action, wearing all black. 
               They head for a SEPARATE BUILDING.  Stopping at the front 
               door.

               Sissy gestures elaborately to Missy, and Missy gestures 
               elaborately back, racing away into the night. Justice offers 
               Sissy a look.

                                     JUSTICE
                         You are so gay.

               Chrissy sticks a box on the door and presses a button. On a 
               digital readout, numbers roll until they stop on four 
               different digits. The door lock CLICKS open.

                                     SISSY
                         Once we're inside, I want complete 
                         silence.
                              (holding up high-tech 
                              device)
                         Missy whipped this up. It counts our 
                         decibel level. If it goes into the 
                         red--alarm, we're dead. So not even 
                         the slightest noise, got it?

               Justice blows her off. Sissy enters the building, followed 
               closely by Chrissy.  Justice lingers at the door, taking one 
               last look back at the Provasik Building, fretting for Jay 
               and Bob.

                                     SISSY
                              (pokes her head back 
                              out)
                         Justice! Move your ass!

               Justice heads inside. We PAN up to reveal a sign that reads: 
               BOULDER DIAMOND EXCHANGE.

               INT. PROVASIK TESTING ROOM--NIGHT

               Jay and Bob stand there, looking around the room.

               It's lines with cages, all of which contain sad-looking 
               ANIMALS.  A tear forms in silent Bob's eye. Jay rolls his 
               eyes and hits him.

                                     JAY
                         Stay frosty, you big fucking softie. 
                         We've got a job to do.

               Silent Bob nods and clicks on a flashlight. The pair wade 
               through the cages. Jay stops at an EMERGENCY BOX hanging on 
               the wall. Inside it, there's a pistol.

                                     JAY
                         Check this out, Lunchbox. Animal 
                         tranquilizer. This shit fucks you up 
                         like Percocets!

               Jay elbows the glass, breaking it. He takes the gun out and 
               tosses it to Bob.

                                     JAY
                         Hold this. Later, me and Justice can 
                         shoot each other with it and fuck 
                         like stoned test bunnies. Bunnggg.

               Silent Bob rolls he eyes and sticks the gun in his coat. The 
               pair look through the cages, until HEAR the distinct SOUND 
               OF A MONKEY. Jay directs Silent Bob's flashlight to the cage 
               from where the sound emitted. He smiles.

                                     JAY
                              (reading)
                         "Suzanne." Boo-yah.

               INT. BOULDER DIAMOND EXCHANGE--NIGHT

               The three Girls stand at the end of a large hallway. At the 
               other end is a glass case, full of DIAMONDS.

               Sissy pulls and aerosol can from her utility belt and sprays 
               the air in the hallway. She watches the decibel monitor, 
               which rises only slightly at the sound of the spray. Suddenly, 
               within the mist, laser beams become apparent.

               Sissy hands the decibel monitor to Chrissy and takes a few 
               steps back, shaking her hands to limber up. She then runs 
               forward and does an impressive series of flips down the 
               hallway, not touching a single laser beam.

               Chrissy checks the decibel monitor, which rises only slightly.

               Once Sissy's flipping comes to a stop at the other end of 
               the hallway near the Diamond case, she makes a hand gesture 
               to Justice. Justice nods, and proceeds to do the same series 
               of flips down the hallway, not tripping the alarm.

               Chrissy checks the decibel monitor, which rises only slightly.

               Justice lands beside Sissy, and then Sissy gestures to 
               Chrissy.

               Chrissy tosses the decibel monitor over the laser beams, 
               Sissy catches it, and the monitor rises only slightly.

               Then, Chrissy proceeds with her series of flips, which are 
               even more impressive than the other two, including running 
               up walls and pushing into handstand flips.  When she passes 
               the last laser beam, she lands between Sissy and Justice, 
               arms in the air like a gymnast. Then, she lets out a loud, 
               manly FART.

               The decibel monitor goes red and an alarm starts RINGING 
               through the building.

                                     CHRISSY
                         Holy fuck--the little stoner was 
                         right--

               Sissy shutters the glass surrounding the Diamonds. She ours 
               them into a bag, and races back down the hallway, followed 
               by Justice and Chrissy.

               EXT. BOULDER DIAMOND EXCHANGE--NIGHT

               The Girls emerge from the Diamond Exchange, just as Missy 
               pulls up in a CONVERTIBLE.

                                     CHRISSY
                         Boom Box!

               Missy tosses a metal box to Chrissy, who catches it and races 
               toward the van, while Sissy and Justice pile into the 
               convertible.

                                     SISSY
                         I can't believe it. Months of planning 
                         and it's all blown by a fucking fart.

                                     JUSTICE
                         We can't just leave them like this! 
                         That alarm's gonna bring the cops 
                         here any minute!

                                     SISSY
                         That was always the plan, Justice! 
                         They take the heat off of is long 
                         enough until we can get out of town!

               Chrissy attaches the metal box to the side of the van.

                                     CHRISSY
                         Kaboom, you little stoner fucks.

               The girls pull up in the convertible and Chrissy jumps into 
               the car with them.

                                     CHRISSY
                         It's set. Let's roll.

               The convertible screeches away, leaving the can sitting there. 
               The metal has magnetically attached to the side is counting 
               down from two minutes.

               INT. PROVASIK TESTING LAB--NIGHT

               Jay and Bob carry a large canvas bag between them. Something 
               seems to move inside it. The head for the exit, but Silent 
               bob hesitates, offering a sad look to the animals in all the 
               cages. Jay hits him.

                                     JAY
                         What the fuck are you looking at? 
                         There ain't no snacks here, man! Now 
                         we got what we came for, so let's 
                         get the fuck out!

               Silent Bob half-gestures to the cages, forlorn. Jay shakes 
               his head frustrated.

                                     JAY
                         Yeah, it's sad! But what the fuck 
                         are we supposed to do about it?

               Silent bob offers Jay a look.

               EXT. PROVASIK MEDICAL LABS--NIGHT

               The front doors burst open, spilling out Jay, Silent Bob 
               (carrying their bag), and HUNDREDS OF ANIMALS--cats, dogs, 
               birds, rabbits. All race off into the night.

               Jay and Bob race toward the van. Jay screams at it.

                                     JUSTICE
                         JUSTICE! OPEN THE DOORS!

               Suddenly, Jay and Bob stop dead in their tracks.

                                     JAY
                         Oh shit--

               Three COP CARS screech up, the van between them and Jay and 
               Bob. The COPS leap out of their cruisers, guns drawn. Jay 
               looks to Bob, pissed

                                     COP
                         DROP THE BAG! BEFORE THIS THING TURNS 
                         EXPLOSIVE!

               The counter on the device attached to the van hits "0," and 
               the van BLOWS UP.  Jay and Bob get thrown backwards in one 
               direction, the Cops in the other.  On all fours, Jay looks 
               at the burning shell of the van, a tear forming in his eye.

                                     JAY
                         Justice--

               We crane up from him as he bellows--

                                     JAY
                         JUUUSSSTTTTIIIICCCCEEEE!!!!!!

               Silent Bob grabs Jay and drags him out of frame, still 
               carrying the bag.

               EXT. FEDERAL WILDLIFE MARSHAL'S OFFICE--DAY

               We start on a sign on the door that reads: Federal Wildlife 
               Marshal, Colorado Field Office, then pull back to see a DEPUTY 
               opening the door and heading inside.

               INT. FEDERAL WILDLIFE MARSHAL'S OFFICE--DAY

               The Deputy enters just as a FAX is coming through at an 
               operations board. He rips it off, reading it. His eyes go 
               wide.

                                     DEPUTY
                         Oh, fudge...
                              (calling off)
                         Marshal Willenholly!

               INT. BATHROOM--SAME

               MARSHAL WILLENHOLLY sits on the bowl, staring at Four Legged 
               Law-Man magazine, eyeing it lustily. Below frame, he jerks 
               off.

                                     WILLENHOLLY
                         Yeah, you chug that ass-cock baby--
                         It takes two hands to hold doesn't 
                         it--?  Uhhh--

               As he climaxes, a ganging at the door disrupts him.

                                     WILLENHOLLY
                         WHAT?! WHAT?! I'M READING!

                                     DEPUTY (O.S.)
                         Sir, we got a report of a break-in 
                         at Provasik Pharmaceuticals' testing 
                         lab.

               Willenholly emerges from the bathroom, holding the magazine. 
               There's a massive wet spot on the front of his pants.

                                     WILLENHOLLY
                         Have you read this article on the 
                         mule-suckers in Tijuana? Good God, I 
                         wish that was in our jurisdiction--
                         I'd shut down every last one of those 
                         ass-cock chuggers, personally.

               The Deputy looks at the stain on Willenholly's pants, then 
               at Willenholly.

                                     WILLENHOLLY
                         What? "Ass" means "donkey."

                                     DEPUTY
                         Yes, sir.
                              (hands him a fax)

                                     WILLENHOLLY
                              (looks at fax)
                         Boulder, hunh? Well, gas up the jet.

                                     DEPUTY
                         We don't have a jet, sir. And 
                         Boulder's only ten minutes away.

                                     WILLENHOLLY
                         Then gas up the next best thing.

               EXT. PROVASIK MEDICAL LABS--DAY

               There are FIRE TRUCKS all over the place now. The burned out 
               van is being poured over by Cops. Just then, Willenholly 
               pulls up on a MOPED. He parks it and surveys the wreckage.

                                     WILLENHOLLY
                         My, oh my, oh my. Who let the cats 
                         out?
                              (thinks)
                         Wait--is that right?

                                     COP 1 (O.S.)
                         Excuse me--who the hell are you?

               Willenholly rips down the Velcro patch on his jacket, 
               revealing a badge.

                                     WILLENHOLLY
                         Federal Wildlife Marshal. This 
                         investigation is now under my 
                         jurisdiction.

                                     COP 1
                         Oh really? And why is that?

                                     WILLENHOLLY
                         Because someone let a whole mess of 
                         animals out of their cages, sir.

                                     COP 1
                         Well, we believe that was just a 
                         diversionary tactic used to call 
                         attention away from the real heist 
                         over here at the Diamond Exchange.

                                     WILLENHOLLY
                         Yeah, right. That's a believable 
                         scenario. It sounds more like 
                         something out of a bad movie.

               Willenholly and the Cop look at the camera. Then, another 
               COP joins them.

                                     COP 2
                         Sir, the Provasik people say they've 
                         rounded all their animals up, except 
                         for one: an orangutan.

                                     WILLENHOLLY
                         Listen up, ladies and gentlemen! Our 
                         fugitive has been on the run for 6 
                         hours!  Average simian foot speed 
                         over uneven ground--barring injuries 
                         or preoccupation with tire tubes, 
                         mites or bananas--is four miles an 
                         hour. That gives us a radius of twenty 
                         miles.

                                     COP 3
                              (calling out from 
                              crowd)
                         Twenty-four, sir!

                                     WILLENHOLLY
                         What?

                                     COP 3
                         Six hours times four miles an hour 
                         is twenty-four.

                                     WILLENHOLLY
                              (doing the math in 
                              his head)
                         Yes. Yes, you're right. My bad. Twenty-
                         four miles. Now what I want out of 
                         all of you is a hard target search.

                                     COP 4
                         Excuse me, sir?

                                     WILLENHOLLY
                         Yeah?

                                     COP 4
                         What does that mean, exactly--a "hard 
                         target search"? What's a "hard 
                         target"?

                                     WILLENHOLLY
                         Well. It's--a target--that's--hard. 
                         Anyway--

                                     COP 4
                         So are you referring to the search's 
                         level of difficulty? Or is the hard 
                         target the monkey?

                                     COP 3
                         Or the people who stole the monkey?

               The COPS now chatter amongst themselves, to the effect of 
               "Yeah--It could mean that too--He's got a point--,"etc. 
               Willenholly rubs his temples.

                                     WILLENHOLLY
                         Okay, how about this? What I want 
                         out of all of you is a thorough search 
                         of every gas station, residence, 
                         warehouse, farmhouse, henhouse, 
                         outhouse, and doghouse in that area! 
                         Checkpoints go up at fifteen miles!

                                     COP 1
                         Wouldn't it make sense to put them 
                         up at every twenty-four miles--seeing 
                         as that's how far they'd have gotten 
                         in the last six hours?

               They begin chattering amongst themselves again. Willenholly 
               looks at them all, defeated. He starts to cry.

                                     WILLENHOLLY
                         This is so frustrating. It's just so 
                         hard sometimes--
                              (yelling)
                         YOUR FUGITIVE'S NAME IS SUZANNE! GO 
                         FIND HER!

               Another COP joins Willenholly, carrying a large, fat envelope.

                                     COP 5
                         Sir, this was just delivered to the 
                         station.

                                     WILLENHOLLY
                         What is it?

                                     COP 5
                         It's a tape from the terrorists who're 
                         claiming credit for the break-in.

                                     WILLENHOLLY
                         Is it VHS or Beta? You know what--
                         never mind. Do you have a VCR?

               INT. OFFICE--DAY

               Willenholly and the Cops stare at the O.C. TV, shocked, as 
               the video ends.

                                     WILLENHOLLY
                         Oh my God--
                              (without looking up)
                         Have the jet gassed up and ready to 
                         go at a moment's notice.

                                     COP
                         Sir, we don't have a jet; just a 
                         helicopter.

                                     WILLENHOLLY
                              (dialing his cell 
                              phone)
                         Doesn't anybody have a jet anymore?
                              (into cell phone)
                         Plafsky? It is Willenholly. You gotta 
                         get me on the national news, pronto. 
                         Why?!  Because we may very well be 
                         dealing with the two most dangerous 
                         men on the planet!

               EXT. UTAH ROADSIDE--DAY

               Jay and Silent Bob sit close to each other, staring at--

               SUZANNE (the ORANGUTAN)--who sits on a log across from them, 
               staring back.

                                     JAY
                         This is Jussy's monkey
                              (to Suzanne, angrily)
                         JUSTICE DIED FOR YOU, YOU MONKEY 
                         FUCK!

               Suzanne covers her eyes with her hands suddenly. Jay and 
               Silent Bob, startle, with Jay leaping behind Silent Bob and 
               pulling back as if he's going to strike.

                                     JAY
                              (to Silent Bob)
                         Do something. Tons of Fun!

               Silent Bob offers the ape a weak wave. Suzanne drops her 
               hands from her face and waves back. Jay cranes his neck to 
               see over silent Bob.

                                     JAY
                         Is that fucking thing waving at us?

               Suzanne nods. Jay steps out from behind Bob. They state at 
               the ape.

                                     JAY
                         Holy shit? That monkey understood 
                         us! Maybe it's some sort of super-
                         monkey!

               Suzanne offer them a "raspberry." Spitting as if the comment 
               was ridiculous. Jay and Silent Bob react with surprise at 
               this.

                                     JAY
                         What the fuck was that for? It's not 
                         a stupid idea! I seen it in Congo?

               Suzanne holds her nose, as if to say, "Congo stunk." Silent 
               Bob smiles in agreement and amusement. Jay looks at him, 
               stung.

                                     JAY
                         You're my bitch. You get my back. 
                         Don't go joining this chimp's side.

               Jay looks around the woods, formulating a thought. Silent 
               Bob moves toward the ape, extending his hand to shake hers.

                                     JAY
                         Yo--what if there's more super monkeys 
                         up in the lab? Maybe they're making 
                         an army of 'em up there! Holy shit! 
                         Maybe it's a conspiracy--like on the 
                         X-Files Roswell--style!

               JAY'S DELUSION: We enter into JAY'S HEAD and see--

               INT. LAB--DAY

               We PAN over from a chimp in a chemist's coat measuring liquids 
               in a pair of beakers to a chimp at a drafting table sketching 
               blueprints for an insidious war machine. An orangutan shakes 
               hands with a group of five well-dressed men, one of which 
               looks like the Cigarette Smoking Man from the X-Files.

                                     JAY (V.O.)
                         Working in secret with a crew of 
                         double-dealing, nicotine-fiending 
                         fucks that're selling out the human 
                         race, these supermonkeys will use 
                         simian science and their genius IQ's 
                         to make man and monkey alike believe 
                         that they're the superior species!

               EXT. BALCONY--DAY

               A monkey dressed like Mussolini addresses a huge crowd of 
               apes, who wave fists in the air.

                                     JAY (V.O.)
                         Then all it'll take is one little 
                         monkey in a spiffy suit to whip the 
                         dumber chimps into a frenzy, until 
                         they go all ape-shit and start 
                         demanding more bananas, better pay, 
                         and human flesh!

               EXT. FIELD--DAY

               Randal leads a pack of humans racing through a cornfield, 
               and is shot in the neck. He collapses, revealing a GORILLA 
               on horseback holding a rifle. Two other Gorillas throw a net 
               over him.

                                     JAY (V.O.)
                         You'll have to be faster than Walt 
                         Flanagan's Dog to outrun the warrior 
                         gorillas, who hunt humans for sport, 
                         profit, and the occasional inter-
                         species blow-job. And if you don't 
                         wind up with a monkey hog in your 
                         mouth, you'll be captured, killed or 
                         worse...

               INT. LAB--DAY

               Cornelius and Zera-looking chimps dissect the brain of a 
               living, screaming, Dante.

                                     JAY (V.O.)
                         Eaten alive!

               EXT. QUICK STOP--DAY

               The Quick Stop is overrun by vines in a jungle like 
               atmosphere. Monkeys exit the store carrying bunches of 
               bananas. The sign now reads: Ape Stop

                                     JAY (V.O.)
                         Then these monkey fucks'll start 
                         wearing our clothes and rebuilding 
                         the world in their image.

               EXT. BEACH--DAY

               We start on a FULL SHOT of Jay on the beach, looking up, 
               then SNAP ZOOM OUT to REVEAL Jay kneeling before the beach 
               buried Statue of Liberty, screaming, his arms raised.

                                     JAY (V.O.)
                         And only those who outwit those damn 
                         dirty apes'll ever remember that it 
                         was MAN who once ruled the earth!

                                     JAY
                              (at statue)
                         YOU MANIACS! DAMN YOUSE!!! GODDAMN 
                         YOUSE ALL TO HELL!!!

                                            WE DISSOLVE FROM THIS IMAGE TO:

               EXT. UTAH ROADSIDE--DAY

               Another close-up of Jay's painted face. Behind him, Suzanne 
               and Silent Bob are playing patty-cake. Jay eyes Suzanne 
               angrily.

                                     JAY
                         Not on my watch, motherfucker!

               Jay turns and rushes Suzanne, ferociously.

                                     JAY
                         DIE, YOU SUPER-MONKEY FUCK! DIE!!!

               Jay trips on a root poking out of the ground and hits the 
               dirt. Suzanne then goes over to Jay, pulls his face to hers, 
               and kisses him on the lips.

                                     JAY
                         Alright--you can live. For now.

               Silent Bob helps Jay to his feet.

                                     JAY
                         You see that? Bitches love me.
                              (heading off)
                         Besides--we're in the fucking clear, 
                         yo. It's not like anyone knows we 
                         stole the monkey.

               INT. TV NEWS STATION--DAY

               An ANCHORMAN addresses the camera.

                                     ANCHORMAN
                         I'm Reg Hartner and this is a News 
                         Now bulletin. A Provasik animal 
                         testing facility in boulder was the 
                         focus of an attack by a terroristic 
                         primate rescue syndicate calling 
                         themselves the Coalition for 
                         Liberation of Itinerant Tree-Dwellers. 
                         Or simply, C.L.I.T.

               A graphic of the C.L.I.T. logo appears beside him, nailing 
               home the joke.

                                     ANCHORMAN
                         In a videotape sent to authorities 
                         this morning, credit for the 
                         liberation of an orangutan from the 
                         lab last night is taken by these men--

               A VIDEO CAPTURE of JAY and SILENT BOB from pre-break--in 
               appears on screen.

                                     ANCHORMAN
                         --identified in literature that 
                         accompanies the tape as Jay and Silent 
                         Bob. In this chilling clip, they 
                         make it very clear that they are in 
                         control of the C.L.I.T.

               On screen is the C.L.I.T. Logo. A digitized voice narrates.

                                     DIGITIZED VOICE
                         We are the C.L.I.T. None of you are 
                         safe. Now tremble before the might 
                         of our merciless leader.

               The logo gives way to the video of Jay and Bob that Sissy 
               shot before the Provasik break-in. Jay's yelling into the 
               camera.

                                     JAY
                         I AM THE CLIT COMMANDER!!!

               Coming out of the video footage, the Anchorman shakes his 
               head, chilled.

                                     ANCHORMAN
                         Terrifying. Here to help us understand 
                         this footage is Federal Wildlife 
                         Marshal Willenholly.

               PULL OUT to reveal Willenholly beside the Anchorman.

                                     ANCHORMAN
                         Marshal, what can you tell us about 
                         the C.L.I.T.?

                                     WILLENHOLLY
                         From the intelligence we've been 
                         able to gather, we've discovered 
                         that the C.L.I.T. is a tiny offshoot 
                         of the L.A.B.I.A.

                                     WILLENHOLLY
                         Exactly. The men you saw in the video 
                         are believed to be the masterminds 
                         responsible for the frenzied C.L.I.T. 
                         activity last night. They go by the 
                         obvious code names "Jay" and "Silent 
                         Bob."
                              (to camera)
                         If you should come across them or 
                         any other C.L.I.T.-ies, please--
                         exercise extreme caution.

               INT. POTZEK'S INC. OFFICE--NIGHT

               On the TV screen is Willenholly and the video capture of Jay 
               and Silent Bob.  Holden looks up from his drawing table, 
               shocked.

                                     ANCHORMAN (O.S.)
                              (from TV)
                         Marshal, how do you respond to 
                         allegations that Federal Wildlife 
                         Marshal's Office allowed the C.L.I.T. 
                         to slip through their fingers?

                                     WILLENHOLLY (O.S.)
                         Nonsense. We're all over the C.L.I.T., 
                         Reg.

               INT. QUICK STOP--NIGHT

               From behind the register, Dante and Randal stare at the TV, 
               slack-jawed.

                                     ANCHORMAN (O.S.)
                              (from TV)
                         Is there also speculation that Jay 
                         and Silent bob may be responsible 
                         for the Diamond Exchange jewel heist 
                         that occurred in the same vicinity 
                         of downtown Boulder last night?

                                     WILLENHOLLY (O.S.)
                         There's nothing to suggest that, no. 
                         But these men are still to be 
                         considered very dangerous.

                                     RANDAL
                              (to Dante)
                         I told you that restraining order 
                         was a good idea.

               EXT. SEEDY MOTEL ROOMS--SAME

               On the second-floor terrace of a run-down, roadside motel, 
               Sissy, Missy and Chrissy dance in their undies and drink 
               champagne. On the first floor terrace below, Justice leans 
               against the open sliding glass door, watching the news report 
               on a TV inside the room with the volume turned way up.

                                     ANCHORMAN
                              (on TV)
                         Is that your cell phone?

                                     WILLENHOLLY
                              (on TV)
                         Yes, Excuse me.
                              (on TV, into cell 
                              phone)
                         Federal Wildlife Marshal. I'm on my 
                         way!
                              (shuts phone; to 
                              anchorman)
                         We got 'em. They're in Utah.
                              (to camera)
                         Citizens of Utah--steer clear of the 
                         C.L.I.T. Stimulation of the C.L.I.T. 
                         is not recommended.

               Justice turns the TV off and yells up to Sissy.

                                     JUSTICE
                         Your tape worked. The news is all 
                         about Jay and Silent Bob's Provasik 
                         break-in, with almost no mention of 
                         the Diamond heist.

                                     SISSY
                              (yelling down to 
                              Justice)
                         I told you those two were the perfect 
                         patsies. Now we lay low for awhile--
                         just in case--and start planning the 
                         next job.

                                     JUSTICE
                         Don't you feel any regret? Jay and 
                         Bob don't deserve this. They were 
                         really sweet.

                                     CHRISSY
                         The only thing I regret is not gutting 
                         that little trout-mouthed prick like 
                         a fish and playing Twister with his 
                         vitals.

                                     MISSY
                         You are so nasty.

                                     CHRISSY
                         I'll show you nasty, you little slut.

                                     SISSY
                         Would you two get a room?

                                     CHRISSY
                         Fine--we'll take yours.
                              (getting up in Sissy's 
                              face)
                         I am gonna stain your sheets, bi-
                         otch.

               Chrissy dances away with Missy, heading inside. Sissy rolls 
               her eyes.

                                     SISSY
                         Sarah Lawrence girls. Go figure.

                                     JUSTICE
                         They're your gang.

                                     SISSY
                         Oh and not yours? You know, I don't 
                         get you, Justice. You used to be all 
                         about the girl stuff: stealing, 
                         boning, blowing shit up. Now you're 
                         like this little priss with a 
                         conscience. It's really a fucking 
                         drag.

                                     JUSTICE
                         We all gotta grow up some time.

                                     SISSY
                         If moping around over some little 
                         boy you're crushing on is being grown-
                         up, then pass me my Wonder Woman 
                         underoos.

                                     JUSTICE
                         Don't you feel the least bit of guilt 
                         for what we did to those guys?

                                     SISSY
                         Awww. Does Jussy-wussy feel all dirty 
                         about setting up her boyfriend? Then 
                         how about taking a shower?

               Sissy dumps the bag of diamonds over the side of the terrace. 
               They rain down on Justice below. Just then a PIZZA DELIVERY 
               GUY approaches the lower terrace, carrying a stack of pizzas.

                                     PIZZA DELIVERY GUY
                         You the gals that ordered the pizzas?

                                     SISSY
                         This dopey bitch ordered the large 
                         plain, but I could go for some hot, 
                         thick, Sicilian.

                                     PIZZA DELIVERY GUY
                         No charge, lady.  He rushes into the 
                         motel, Justice sighs, looking up at 
                         the stars.

                                     JUSTICE
                              (quietly)
                         I'm sorry, Jay.

               INT. DINER--DAY

               Jay, Silent Bob, and Suzanne sit at a booth, eating. Jay 
               chews a burger while Silent Bob eats pancakes and Suzanne 
               digs into a banana split.

                                     JAY
                         You know, Justice died trying to 
                         save this monkey, so maybe we should 
                         keep her around. That way, we can 
                         honor her memory.

               Silent bob and Suzanne are oblivious, digging into their 
               food.

                                     JAY
                         Look at you Tubby Bitches. I'm waxing 
                         all sentimental, and you're all about 
                         a fucking meal and shit. Now ain't 
                         you glad we stopped to eat?  And you 
                         were all piss-scared the cops'd bust 
                         us or something. You know what I 
                         say?
                              (singing, a la NWA)

                                     VOICE (O.S.)
                              (via bullhorn)
                         THIS IS THE UTAH STATE POLICE! WE 
                         KNOW YOU'RE IN THERE COME OUT WITH 
                         YOUR HANDS IN THE AIR, AND SURRENDER 
                         THE ORANGUTAN!

               Jay and Bob freeze and go wild-eyed for a beat. Then--

                                     JAY
                         You think they're talking to us?

               EXT. DINER--DAY

               There's a few COP CARS outside, and the SHERIFF is yelling 
               at the diner through his bullhorn. Beside him are the other 
               COPS.

                                     SHERIFF
                         YOU HAVE SIXTY SECONDS TO COMPLY.
                              (to other COPS)
                         Fuck it, Let's give 'em thirty.

               Suddenly Willenholly rushes up, dramatically ducking behind 
               the car, gun drawn.

                                     SHERIFF
                         The ape.

                                     WILLENHOLLY
                         What?

                                     SHERIFF
                         An orangutan's a member of the great 
                         ape family. It's not a monkey.

                                     WILLENHOLLY
                         Look, who's the Federal Wildlife 
                         Marshal here?
                              (into bullhorn)
                         JAY AND SILENT BOB, THIS IS FEDERAL 
                         WILDLIFE MARSHAL WILLENHOLLY! YOUR 
                         C.L.I.T.  DOESN'T STAND A CHANCE. 
                         SURRENDER THE MONKEY IMMEDIATELY, 
                         AND YOU WON'T GET SHOT!

               INT. DINER--DAY

               Jay, Suzanne, and Silent Bob peer over the top of their booth, 
               like scared rats.

                                     JAY
                         What the fuck are you waiting for? 
                         Go out there and give 'em the monkey.

               Silent Bob looks to Jay, shocked.

                                     JAY
                         Oh, what, man? I said that shit before 
                         I knew they were gonna shoot us!  
                         Yes--Jussy was a hottie, but I ain't 
                         takin' no bullet for no monkey!

               Bob pulls Suzanne close to him, welling up with tears. Jay 
               rolls his eyes.

                                     JAY
                         Oh, brother--this is like something 
                         out of fucking Benji! Look man, maybe 
                         it's not that bad back at the lab! 
                         Maybe they experiment on 'em by, 
                         like making 'em fuck a bunch of 
                         different, good-looking monkeys. We 
                         don't know! Maybe they got it real 
                         sweet!

               Suzanne shakes her head "no." Bob points to her, as if she's 
               strengthening his point.

                                     JAY
                              (to Suzanne)
                         You stay out of this, you weepy little 
                         chimp!
                              (looks around thinking)
                         Fuck man, I ain't no strategist! 
                         You're the guy that makes the 
                         blueprints! I don't even have the 
                         fucking smarts of a little--

               Jay's eyes fall on a scared FAMILY in a nearby booth. There's 
               a little kid (around five or so), and he's wearing a hooded 
               sweatshirt and a baseball cap.

                                     JAY
                         --kid

               EXT. DINER--DAY

               Willenholly's on the bullhorn, yelling at the diner. The 
               Sheriff looks on.

                                     WILLENHOLLY
                         ANYONE NOT HARBORING A FUGITIVE MONKEY 
                         BETTER HIT THE DECK!  WE'RE GOING TO 
                         OPEN FIRE!
                              (to cops)
                         Everyone has bullets in their guns, 
                         right?

               Jay and Silent Bob emerge from the diner, with Suzanne between 
               them (they're holding her raised hands). She's now dressed 
               up in the sweatshirt and jeans the kid was wearing in the 
               diner, with the baseball cap pulled down over her face.  
               It's a pretty piss-poor disguise.

                                     JAY
                         Don't shoot! We're just trying to 
                         take our son out of this hostile 
                         environment!

               From behind the cop car, the Sheriff looks to Willenholly.

                                     SHERIFF
                         Their "son"?

                                     WILLENHOLLY
                         Maybe they're one of those gay 
                         couples?

               Jay seizes on the idea. Silent Bob nods fervently.

                                     JAY
                         Yeah! We're gay! And this is our 
                         adopted love child! We're not from 
                         around here!  Don't make us go back 
                         to our liberal city home with a tales 
                         of prejudice and bigotry in the heart 
                         of Utah!
                              (whispers to Bob)
                         You see the shit I gotta put up with 
                         for you! Now I got this guy thinking 
                         I'm gay!

                                     WILLENHOLLY
                         Oh God, this is the last thing I 
                         need--a bunch of uppity homosexuals 
                         shooting their mouth off in the 
                         liberal press that the Federal 
                         Wildlife Marshal's Office persecutes 
                         gays.

                                     SHERIFF
                         ARE YOU FUCKING CRAZY! THOSE TWO MAY 
                         BE GAY, BUT THAT AIN'T THEIR SON! 
                         THAT'S THE APE!

                                     WILLENHOLLY
                         You see this badge?  I think I'd 
                         recognize an ape if I saw one. And 
                         the only thing I do recognize here 
                         is a political fiasco I'm, going to 
                         avoid by letting this butt-fucking 
                         Brady Bunch go!

               Jay is whispering to Silent Bob, still vexed by--

                                     JAY
                         And I'll tell you another thing: 
                         what if that guy shows up around the 
                         stores one day and starts telling 
                         everybody you and me are poo-gilists? 
                         How are we gonna get any pussy then, 
                         hunh?

                                     WILLENHOLLY (V.O.)
                         YOU ARE FREE TO LEAVE, SIRS!

               Jay and Silent Bob look at each other, shocked. They look 
               back out at Willenholly, who's yards away. Jay points at 
               himself, as if to say, "Me?"

                                     WILLENHOLLY
                              (via bullhorn)
                         YES, YOU, SIRS.

                                     JAY
                              (calling over)
                         So we can just go?

                                     WILLENHOLLY
                              (via bullhorn)
                         Yes, sir--or ma'am. Please accept my 
                         apologies for detaining you and your 
                         unorthodox-but-constitutionally-
                         protected-family unit.

                                     SHERIFF
                              (amazed)
                         Un-fucking believable.

                                     JAY
                         I'd like to offer a big gay thank-
                         you, sir. We'll tell all our gay 
                         friends that Utah is Gay friendly 
                         country for gays who are gay.

                                     WILLENHOLLY
                         I'm sure Utah appreciates that. You 
                         might also want to make it clear 
                         that the Federal Wildlife Marshal's 
                         Office is also pro-'mo as well.
                              (winks at the sheriff)
                         And might I add, that's one fine-
                         looking boy you're raising.

                                     JAY
                         Well, that's 'cuz he's from my sperm. 
                         See, I knocked up a hot woman friend 
                         of ours who I also fuck on the side. 
                         So as not to be all-the-way-gay. But 
                         my tubby husband here is one hundred 
                         percent queer. He loves the cock.

                                     WILLENHOLLY
                         He certainly looks insatiable.

                                     JAY
                         'Bye

                                     WILLENHOLLY
                         'Bye

               Jay, silent Bob and Suzanne head off down the road. 
               Willenholly and all watch them go. The Sheriff is livid.

                                     WILLENHOLLY
                         Well, it's not my way--but damned if 
                         there doesn't go one happy family.
                              (balloon two)
                         Now, we just shoot some tear gas 
                         into that diner, and when the two 
                         guys run out with the monkey, we'll--

               Willenholly suddenly freezes, thinking. He looks to the 
               Sheriff.

                                     WILLENHOLLY
                         That was the them, wasn't it?

               EXT. ROAD--DAY

               Jay, Silent Bob and Suzanne are laughing.

                                     JAY
                         I said you "love the cock"! I gotta 
                         be the craftiest motherfucker alive!

               GUNSHOTS RING OUT, and bullets whiz by the trio, who are now 
               in full panic mode.

               Willenholly and the Cops race after them, firing.

               Jay, Bob and Suzanne race away, ducking bullets.

                                     JAY
                         FLEE, FAT-ASS, FLEE!!!

               EXT. DAM ROAD--DAY

               The trio race across what looks like a bridge (but isn't), 
               shots still ringing out. Jay spots a manhole. He points at 
               it, screaming.

                                     JAY
                         HEAD FOR THE SEWERS!

               Silent Bob pops the cover off, With bullets ricocheting all 
               around them, Jay leaps into the manhole.

               INT. SEWER TUNNEL

               Jay lands in a sewer tunnel (like in The Fugitive). Suzanne 
               lands on top of him.

                                     JAY
                         Take your stinking paws off me, you 
                         damn dirty ape!
                              (yelling up)
                         YO LUNCHBOX! HURRY UP!

               EXT. DAM ROAD--DAY

               Bullets hitting the pavement around him, Silent bob dives 
               into the sewer grate as well, but--

               INT. SEWER TUNNEL

               Silent Bob gets stuck. Jay rolls his eyes.

                                     JAY
                         You fat fuck.

               Silent Bob struggles while Jay and Suzanne try to pull him 
               through the hole.

                                     JAY
                         You just--had to--order pancakes--
                         didn't ya?

               EXT. DAM ROAD--SAME

               CLOSER on the running Willenholly and Sheriff.

                                     WILLENHOLLY
                         Fire a warning shot into that bulbous 
                         ass!

                                     SHERIFF
                         One rectal breach, coming up!

               INT. SEWER TUNNEL--SAME

               Jay and Suzanne pull with all their might. Bob strains.

                                     JAY
                         SUCK IT IN! THINK THIN! THINK THIN!!!

               EXT. DAM ROAD--SAME

               TIGHT on the Sheriff, as he squints to aim.

                                     SHERIFF
                         Open up and say "ahhhhh," you stoner 
                         sumbitch--

               INT. SEWER TUNNEL--SAME

               TIGHT on Silent Bob bellowing.

                                     SILENT BOB
                         AAAAAHHHHHHHHH!!!

               EXT. DAM ROAD--DAY

               The Sheriff's gun fires.

               INT. SEWER TUNNEL--SAME

               Jay and Suzanne fall backwards, as Silent Bob pops through.

                                     JAY
                         INCOMING!!!

                                     SILENT BOB
                         AAAIIIGGGGGHHHHHHHH!!!

                                     SUZANNE
                         OOOOOOOOO!!!

               EXT. DAM ROAD--DAY

               The bullet ricochets off the curb, as Silent Bob's feet slip 
               through.

               INT. SEWER TUNNEL--SAME

               Jay, Silent Bob, and Suzanne are in various states of 
               collapse. Jay and Bob look up at the hole.

                                     JAY
                         Just like Winnie-the-Pooh.

               EXT. DAM ROAD--DAY

               Willenholly and the Sheriff arrive at the manhole.

                                     WILLENHOLLY
                         Wow! That was an incredibly daring 
                         escape!
                              (to Sheriff)
                         You must see that a lot, hunh?

                                     SHERIFF
                         Shut up!

                                     WILLENHOLLY
                         Sire, you're very taciturn.

               Willenholly starts rolling up his sleeves as the sheriff 
               looks on.

                                     WILLENHOLLY
                         You and your men stay up here. When 
                         I corner them, I'll call you for 
                         back-up.

                                     SHERIFF
                         What're you doing? They're trapped. 
                         The only way they can get out of 
                         there is right here.

                                     WILLENHOLLY
                         A Federal Wildlife Marshal doesn't 
                         wait for his prey to come to him. He 
                         comes to it. Or goes to it. Is it 
                         "comes to it" or "goes to it"?
                              (shakes it off)
                         I'm going in there. I'm counting on 
                         you Sheriff.

               Willenholly embraces the Sheriff.

                                     WILLENHOLLY
                         You've taught me so much.

               Willenholly then climbs into the sewer, disappearing. The 
               Cops look at the Sheriff for a beat, who heads O.C. saying--

                                     SHERIFF
                         Fuck this asshole. Let's go back to 
                         the station and get some donuts.

               INT. SEWER TUNNEL--DAY

               TIGHT on Jay, Bob, and Suzanne, looking into the distance, 
               bathed by natural light. We HEAR the loud sounds of water 
               rushing.

                                     JAY
                         This reminds me of the night I fucked 
                         your mom, yo. One big-wet, smelly, 
                         gaping hole, and me wishing I had a 
                         board tied to my ass--

               PULL BACK to reveal Jay, Silent Bob and Suzanne standing at 
               the precipice of the sewer tunnel that pokes out of a DAM. 
               Water rushed below.

                                     JAY
                         --to keep from falling in.

                                     WILLENHOLLY
                         PUT THE MONKEY DOWN AND YOUR HANDS 
                         UP!

               Willenholly aims his gun at the trio's backs.

                                     WILLENHOLLY
                         MISTERS, DO YOU WANNA GET SHOT?!?

               Our heroes comply, but Jay speaks.

                                     JAY
                         LOOK MAN--SHE DOESN'T WANT TO GO 
                         BACK! THEY'RE EXPERIMENTING ON HER!
                              (beat)
                         AND FOR THE RECORD, I AIN'T REALLY 
                         GAY!

                                     WILLENHOLLY
                         I DON'T CARE!
                              (beat)
                         AND FOR THE RECORD, I KNEW THAT WASN'T 
                         REALLY A LITTLE BOY.

                                     JAY
                         SURE, FOR ONE MORE RECORD--
                              (pointing to Silent 
                              Bob)
                         HE LOVES COCK!

                                     WILLENHOLLY
                         ON YOUR KNEES!

               Jay and Silent Bob face Willenholly and kneel. But Suzanne's 
               still looking out of the dam.

                                     JAY
                         See, man?! He's lining us up like 
                         fucking circus seals! Well, I'm going 
                         first--I don't want no mouthful of 
                         monkey-spit when I gotta blow this 
                         fucking G-Man.

               TIGHT on Suzanne, who's looking down at the raging water 
               below. Her brow hardens with purpose.

               TIGHT on Suzanne's right hand grabbing Jay's right hand.

               TIGHT on Suzanne's left hand grabbing Bob's left hand.

               Suzanne leaps forward at us, pulling Jay and Silent Bob 
               backwards.

                                     JAY
                         GET OFFA ME!!! GET OFFA ME!!!

               EXT. DAM--DAY

               Suzanne leaps from the mouth of the tunnel, dragging Jay and 
               Bob with her.

                                     JAY AND BOB
                         AAAAIIIGGGGGHHHHH!!!

               INT. SEWER TUNNEL--DAY

               Willenholly goes wide-eyed, holstering his gun.

                                     WILLENHOLLY
                         Oh, no--think you can pull a Peter 
                         Pan on me?!

               He races toward the mouth of the tunnel and leaps out as 
               well.

                                     WILLENHOLLY
                         AAAIIIGGGGHHHHH!!!

               EXT. DAM--DAY

               As Willenholly plummets, he passes Suzanne hanging by her 
               feet off a pipe that pokes out from beneath the mouth of the 
               tunnel. She's hanging upside down, holding Jay and Silent 
               Bob's hands.

                                     JAY
                         HEY LAW-DOG! SEE YOU IN HELL, COCK--
                         SMOKER!!!

               EXT. DAM BOTTOM--DAY

               Willenholly plummets toward the water below and ker-splashes 
               into the drink.

               EXT. DAM--DAY

               Suzanne has pulled Jay and Silent Bob back into the mouth of 
               the tunnel.

                                     JAY
                         You see that shit? Damn--remind me 
                         not to get on the monkey's bad side.  
                         Yo--boost her up. So we can talk, so 
                         we can get the fuck out of here.

               Silent Bob lifts Suzanne over the tunnel onto the--

               EXT. DAM ROAD--DAY

               --pavement near the manhole. She sits there, looking down.

               EXT. DAM--DAY

               Silent Bob lifts Jay over the top of the tunnel toward the 
               road,

               EXT. DAM ROAD--DAY

               Suzanne sits by the side of the road. A car pulls into the 
               shot.

               Jay and Silent Bob climb over the cliff onto the highway 
               just in time to see--

               The passenger door slamming on a TRUCK with Los Angeles plates 
               and a sign that reads CRITTERS OF HOLLYWOOD. Suzanne is 
               looking out the back window waving.  Jay and Bob leap to 
               their feet, chasing after the truck.

                                     JAY
                         HEY! GET THE FUCK OFF HER, MAN! THAT'S 
                         MY EX-GIRLFRIEND'S MONKEY?!

               The truck speeds away in the distance. Jay and Silent Bob 
               stand there, panting.

                                     JAY
                         Man! Who the fuck just steals a 
                         monkey?!

               Silent Bob indicates themselves.

                                     JAY
                         Oh yeah.
                              (pissed)
                         Well this fucking blows! We got one 
                         more day to stop those fucks from 
                         making that movie, and someone goes 
                         and takes the only thing I had left 
                         from the one woman I ever loved enough 
                         NOT to try to stick my hand down her 
                         pants!

               Silent Bob mimes that they should go after Suzanne.

                                     JAY
                         Go after the monkey? How the fuck 
                         are we supposed to know where that 
                         thing's going?

               Silent Bob mimes in the direction the car went. Jay stares 
               at him.

                                     JAY
                         What? What is that supposed to mean?! 
                         Don't just fucking point like--
                              (imitates him)
                         You ain't the broad in the Children 
                         of a Lesser God. Use you fucking 
                         mouth for more than eating, ya tubby 
                         bitch!

               Bob starts an elaborate pantomime. Jay tries to guess what 
               he's saying.

                                     JAY
                         You gotta take a shit? No--you gotta 
                         take a salad? Take a salad? What the 
                         fuck are you trying to say?

               Bob's on the verge of tears, trying to mime out his message.

                                     JAY
                         JUST FUCKING SAY IT ALREADY?!?

               Silent Bob grabs Jay and screams into his face.

                                     SILENT BOB
                         THE SIGN ON THE BACK OF THE CAR SAID 
                         CRITTERS OF HOLLYWOOD, YOU DUMB 
                         FUCK!!!

               Bob releases Jay, breathing heavily and storms off in the 
               direction of the car went. Jay watched him go for a beat, 
               then follows, muttering under his breath--

                                     JAY
                         Say it, don't spray it, bitch.

               EXT. SHERIFF'S OFFICE--DAY

               AN ESTABLISHING SHOT.

                                     SHERIFF (O.S.)
                         "And might I add, that's one fine-
                         looking boy you're raising."

               INT. SHERIFF'S OFFICE--DAY

               The Sheriff and his men stand around, eating donuts, laughing. 
               The Station doors slam open, and Willenholly enters, soaking 
               wet. All the Cops stare at him.

                                     SHERIFF
                         Well, if it isn't the wildlife 
                         experts. Did you come to it or go to 
                         it?

                                     WILLENHOLLY
                         Do you have a microwave here, Sheriff?

                                     SHERIFF
                         We have a toaster oven. Why?

                                     WILLENHOLLY
                         Because I need to dry my gun out so 
                         I can SHOOT YOU WITH IT ! TWICE!

                                     SHERIFF
                         This might cheer you up.

                              (looks up)
                         They're going to Hollywood.

               EXT. HOLLYWOOD--MONTAGE

               We take a quick visual tour of the city, including the sign, 
               the line of front of Krispy Kreme, the line in front of Coffee 
               Bean and Tea Leaf, the Simpson star in the Walk- of- Fame,

               HOOKERS propositioning a potential JOHN, and finally--

               EXT. HOLLYWOOD BLVD--DAY

               We start on the street sign, and PAN DOWN to a JEEP WRANGLER 
               that pulls up. A gorgeous woman in sunglasses drives, with 
               Silent Bob sitting in the back seat.  After a beat, Jay pops 
               up from under the dash, wiping his mouth, looking around.  
               The Woman sighs, and zips up her pants. Jay and Bob hop out 
               and wave to the Woman as the car pulls away. Bob offers Jay 
               a look.

                                     JAY
                         What? It's not like it's cheating. 
                         Justice blew up.

               Two HOOKERS approach them.

                                     HOOKER 1
                         Hey, little man. You want some of 
                         this?

                                     HOOKER 2
                         How about you, Big Boy?

                                     HOOKER 1
                         If you've got fifty bucks we can get 
                         nasty.

                                     JAY
                         Oh yeah? How nasty?

                                     HOOKER 2
                         As nasty as you wanna be, poppie.

                                     JAY
                         Alright--first, I'll want to tongue 
                         your bung while you juggle my balls 
                         in one hand and play with my asshole 
                         with the other. But don't stick you 
                         finger in.  Then. I'll wanna pinky 
                         you and put it in your friend's brown, 
                         while Silent Bob spanks into a Dixie 
                         cup. After that, I'll wanna smell 
                         your titties, for a while, and you 
                         can pull my nutsack up over my dick, 
                         so it looks like a Bullfrog. Then I 
                         want you to flick at my nuts while 
                         your friend spanks me into the same 
                         Dixie cup Silent Bob jizzed in. Then 
                         we throw the Dixie cup out.

               The Hookers look at him, dumbfounded, Then--

                                     HOOKER 1
                         Oh, that's it honey. I quit.
                              (walking away)
                         This job just passed the point of no 
                         return.

                                     HOOKER 2
                              (to Jay)
                         You one fucked up puppy, poppie.

                                     JAY
                              (watching them go)
                         What?! You said 'nasty'?
                              (shakes his head; to 
                              Bob)
                         Man, chicks in Hollywood are so stuck 
                         up.

               EXT. HOLLYWOOD BLVD.--LATER

               Jay and Silent Bob walk.

                                     JAY
                         Alright, here's the plan: first, we 
                         find out where they're shooting that 
                         movie at. After we shut that shit 
                         down, we can start looking for the 
                         monkey. But before we do any of that 
                         shit, we gotta find a motherfucker 
                         in the know. Someone who's like, the 
                         mayor of Hollywood.

               They pass a DEALER leaning against a wall, trying to make a 
               sale.

                                     DEALER
                              (subtly)
                         Crack? You want some crack? Sweet-
                         ass rock. Get you high.

                                     JAY
                         No man, but you want some weed?

                                     DEALER
                              (beat)
                         You on the job?

                                     JAY
                              (pulling out a card)
                         Yeah, boy. Jersey Local 408.

               CLOSE ON THE CARD.  It reads: UNITED JERSEY BROTHERHOOD OF 
               DEALERS, LOCAL 408.

               There's a graphic of a stoner beside it.

                                     DEALER
                         I'm Los Angeles Local 305!

               They shake hands, slapping each other on the back like Union

                         It's a Miramax flick. We gotta bust 
                         it up so people stop calling us names 
                         on the Internet, even though they're 
                         not really talking about us but these 
                         characters based on us, and at the

               Jay exhales. The Dealer stares at him for a beat.

                         was pulled off an Internet movie

                         by the two domestic terrorists 
                         themselves. It's sending a shockwave

                         and Matt Damon are on the lot, 
                         shooting a super-secret project. 
                         Have you seen then roaming around?

               BACK TO JULES at Miramax Studios.

                                     JULES
                         No, Steve. But I did see Casey Affleck 
                         buying a soda at a concession stand 
                         earlier.

                         But no sign of Jay and Silent Bob?

                                     JULES
                         None whatsoever. However, to be fair, 
                         all the feds have to work with is 
                         murky videotape, so no one's even a 
                         hundred percent sure what Jay and 
                         Silent Bob look like, exactly. For 
                         all we know, they could already be 
                         on the lot.

               As Jules speaks, Jay and Bob walk into the frame behind her, 
               looking up at the studio sign. They then notice the camera 
               and start waving behind Jules.

               INT. SEEDY MOTEL ROOM--DAY

               Justice goes wide-eyed, seeing Jay and Bob on E! She hops 
               out of her seat.

                                     JUSTICE
                         Oh my God! Jay! No!

               Justice looks around, panicky. Her eyes fall on--

               The diamonds, sitting atop the satchel on the table.

               Justice looks at the diamonds, then the TV screen. She thinks 
               for a beat, then--

                                     JUSTICE
                         Fuck it.

               She pours the diamonds into the satchel, and shoves it in 
               her pocket.

               INT. SEEDY MOTEL BEDROOM--DAY

               The door slowly opens in the dark bedroom, and Justice crawls 
               to the bedside table, reaching for a set of keys. In the 
               bed, Missy and Chrissy make out under the sheets, moaning. 
               Sissy's banging the Pizza Delivery Guy against the vanity.  
               Justice grabs the keys, leaving a note in their place. As 
               she crawls back out, we PUSH IN on the note, which reads: 
               SORRY, GUYS--BUT I LOVE HIM.

               EXT. SEEDY MOTEL PARKING LOT--DAY

               The convertible skids out, taking off.

               INT. SEEDY MOTEL HALLWAY--DAY

               There's a loud scream, then Sissy, Missy, and Chrissy rush 
               down the stairs (in varied states of undress and sheet-wrap). 
               Wiping their mouths. Sissy holds Justices's note.

                                     SISSY
                         That bitch!  That fucking, fucking 
                         bitch!!!
                              (to girls)
                         Get dressed. We're going after her.

                                     CHRISSY
                         Fuck that, I didn't get to cum yet.

                                     SISSY
                         Which is more important to you: a 
                         fortune in diamonds or busting a 
                         nut?

               Sissy and Missy race back up the stairs. Chrissy stands there 
               still, shrugs, then digs her hand into her panties.

                                     SISSY (O.S.)
                         Chrissy! Now!

                                     CHRISSY
                         Fuck--

               Chrissy races back up the stairs.

               EXT. MIRAMAX STUDIOS-DAY

               The E! NEWS CREW packs up. Jay and Silent Bob study the main 
               gate. They watch the SECURITY GUARD approach a car that's 
               just pulled up. The Guard checks the driver's pass, then 
               lifts the gate to let the car through. Jay looks to Bob.

                                     JAY
                         We gotta play this right.

               Bob nods, After a beat, the pair tear-ass past the guard 
               booth. The GUARD leaps out of the booth, blowing a whistle 
               and giving chase.

               EXT. STUDIO LOT--DAY

               Jay and Bob race around the building toward what looks like 
               an open alley then smash into it, falling down. The open 
               alley is a background painting that's being moved by some 
               SCENICS. Jay and Bob get up, shaking off the impact.

                                     JAY
                         I hate how fake Hollywood is.

               The SECURITY GUARD catches up to them now, grabbing them by 
               their shoulders, spinning them around.

                                     SECURITY GUARD
                         Where do you think you're going?

                                     JAY
                         GET OFFA ME! RAAAAAPE!!!

                                     SECURITY GUARD
                         This is L.A., sir. We don't rape our 
                         suspects in custody. We just beat 
                         them.

                                     SECURITY GUARD
                         No, sir--a ten-eight-two is the code 
                         for vanishing a dead hooker from Ben 
                         Affleck's trailer.

                                     JAY
                         Hey! I make you a deal: this guy'll 
                         suck your dick off if you let us go!

                                     SECURITY GUARD
                         Contrary to what you believe, not 
                         everyone in the movie business is 
                         gay.

                                     JAY
                         Well, how about this deal: he sucks 
                         my dick while you watch and jerk 
                         off.

               The Security Guard stops, looks around, then releases them, 
               reaching into his pants.

                                     SECURITY GUARD
                         Alright. But make is fast. And sexy.

               Silent Bob looks at Jay, wide-eyed and scared.

                                     JAY
                         Dude, it's either this or jail. And 
                         you know what they make you do in 
                         jail.

               Silent Bob wells up with tears, slowly dropping to his knees, 
               reaching for Jay's pants. The Security guard bends down low 
               to watch at crotch-level. Suddenly, Jay hammers his two fists 
               into the Security Guard's neck, knocking him out.  Silent 
               Bob falls into a sitting position on the ground, relieved. 
               Jay looks at him.

                                     JAY
                         Well what are you waiting for, bitch? 
                         Start sucking. Bunnggg!
                              (looking around)
                         Alright--where they shooting this 
                         movie at?

               Silent Bob points behind Jay, at the SOUNDSTAGE they're in 
               front of. There's a LINE OF PEOPLE waiting at the door.

                                     JAY
                         Worth a shot. Like a shot in the 
                         mouth, you gay bitch. Eww, dude--you 
                         were really gonna suck my dick.

               Silent Bob shakes his head "no," wide-eyed as Jay heads off. 
               When Jay's out of frame, Silent bob shrugs like, "Yeah--I 
               guess I was."

               EXT. SOUNDSTAGE--DAY

               Jay and Bob approach the line, as an A.D. calls out to the 
               crowd.

                                     A.D.
                         Alright--bar extras. Follow me.

               The A.D. starts leading the crowd in. Jay and Bob blend in 
               and follow inside.

               EXT. HIGHWAY--DAY

               INT. AGENT ENMARTY'S OFFICE--SAME

               AGENT SID ENMARTY works at his desk.

                                     SPEAKER VOICE
                         Agent Enmarty? A Marshal Willenholly 
                         calling.

                                     AGENT SID
                              (perking up)
                         Holy shit! Yeah, put him through.
                              (calling off)
                         YO! INCOMING BITCH BOY PHONER!

               Two other AGENTS rush in, chuckling. All gather around the 
               phone as Sid presses the speaker button.

                                     AGENT SID
                         Willenholly?

               BEGIN CROSS-CUTTING WITH WILLENHOLLY.

                                     WILLENHOLLY
                         Sid? Hey, buddy. I'm calling because 
                         I could really use your help on this 
                         killer case I'm working.

                                     AGENT SID
                         I'll bet, Will. What's it this time... 
                         Beaver trouble? Some kind of 
                         unauthorized marsupial trafficking?

               The agents crack up, stifling their laughter.

                                     WILLENHOLLY
                              (taking it in stride)
                         No, no--nothing like that. Say--there 
                         aren't other people listening in, 
                         are there?

                                     AGENT SID
                         No way, man. It's just me and you 
                         talking here.

                                     WILLENHOLLY
                         Good. I'm tracking a monkey down 
                         that's on it's way to Los Angeles, 
                         and I could use some bureau backup.

                                     AGENT SID
                         Los Angeles, hunh? Maybe we should 
                         stake out Clint Eastwood's place. 
                         Didn't he used to drive around with 
                         a monkey that'd punch people and 
                         drink beer?

               The Agents crack up. Willenholly's catching on.

                                     WILLENHOLLY
                         Am, uh--Am I on speaker phone?

                                     AGENT SID
                         No way--Dunston!

                                     WILLENHOLLY
                         Alright, now that's not fair. I know 
                         I didn't make it as high up as you 
                         guys, but my job's just as important.

                                     AGENT SID
                         Calm down, Will. Don't go all... 
                         bananas on us!

               The Agents crack up even more, Willenholly's pissed.

                                     WILLENHOLLY
                         I come to you as a friend--as a fellow 
                         professional--and this is the shit I 
                         get?!

                                     AGENT SID
                         You're right, Will. Tell you what--
                         we'll get our best man on your case 
                         right away. You might've heard of 
                         him. He's a doctor.

                                     WILLENHOLLY
                              (excited)
                         Oh, a doctor?

                                     AGENT SID
                         His name's Doctor Zaius!

               The Agents laugh hysterically, pounding the desk, Willenholly 
               tears up, enraged.

                                     WILLENHOLLY
                         SCREW YOU GUYS!

               Willenholly throws his cell phone across the car, the mocking 
               laughter still emitting from it. Willenholly cries.

               EXT. MIRAMAX STUDIOS LOT--DAY

               The Red Light FLASHES outside the soundstage.

               INT. SOUNDSTAGE--SAME

               Jay and silent Bob stand amidst a line of EXTRAS. Silent Bob 
               looks O.C. goes wide-eyed, and pokes Jay, pointing O.C. Jay 
               looks and sees--

               A COLLEGE BAR set that looks like the College Bar from Good 
               Will Hunting, complete with CLARK (the stuffy college jerk).  
               MATT DAMON stands off to the side, loosening up for the scene. 
               BEN AFFLECK calls to the O.C. DIRECTOR.

                                     BEN
                         Where are we taking it from, Gus?

               Gus Van Sant sits off to the side, counting a stack of money. 
               He just shrugs.

                                     GUS
                         I'm busy.

                                     BEN
                         You're a true artist, Gus

                                     MATT
                         Just take it from "It's a good 
                         course."

                                     BEN
                         Oh, now you're the director.

                                     MATT
                         Hey, shove it. Bounce-boy. Let's 
                         remember who talked who into doing 
                         this shit in the first place. Talking 
                         me into Dogma was one thing, but 
                         this--

                                     BEN
                         I'm sorry this is taking you away 
                         from whatever-gay-killers-on-horses-
                         who-like-to-play-golf-touchy-feely-
                         flick you're supposed to be doing 
                         this week.

                                     MATT
                         Oh--I'm touchy-feely? I take it you 
                         never saw Forces of Nature?

                                     BEN
                         You're like a child. What've I been 
                         telling you? Sometimes you've gotta 
                         do the safe picture. Sometimes, you 
                         do it for art. Sometimes, it's the 
                         payback picture your friend says you 
                         owe him--

               They take a beat and look at the camera. Then--

                                     BEN
                         And sometimes, you go back to the 
                         well.

                                     MATT
                         And sometimes, you do Reindeer Games.

                                     BEN
                         Now that's just mean.

               Jay turns excitedly to Bob.

                                     JAY
                         This has gotta be the Bluntman Flick, 
                         'cause that's those two fucks from 
                         that Mork movie! Now all we gotta do 
                         is figure out a way to get close to 
                         them--

               The A.D. grabs Jay and Bob by the arms and drags them onto 
               the set, placing them near Ben and Matt in the scene.

                                     A.D.
                         Just stand there and react. Don't 
                         say anything.

               Bob goes a little wide-eyed. Jay smiles at him.

                                     JAY
                              (off A.D.'s comment)
                         That's pretty funny.

                                     A.D.
                              (calling out)
                         Alright, people. Lock it up. Let's 
                         go for picture.

               Jay and Bob eye Ben and Matt fiercely, Ben and Matt are 
               oblivious.

                                     JAY
                         On the count of three, we rush those 
                         fucks and beat the shit out of 'em. 
                         'Cause if they're all fucked up, 
                         they can't make the move, right? 
                         Alright, then.  One--two--

                                     CLAPPER/LOADER (O.S.)
                         Good Will Hunting Two: Hunting Season.

               Jay and Bob freeze and look at each other, then O.C.

               The Clapper/Loader holds a clapboard in front of Ben's face. 
               It does indeed, read: Good Will Hunting 2: Hunting Season.

                                     CLAPPER/LOADER
                         Scene sixteen, take five.

               The Clapper/Loader claps the board closed and races off. Ben 
               looks to Gus.

                                     BEN
                         Action, Gus?

               Gus looks up from counting his money.

                                     GUS
                         Jesus, Ben--I said I'm busy.

               Ben shakes his head and then starts the scene with CLARK.

                                     BEN/CHUCKIE
                         You should check it out, it's a good 
                         course. But, you know, frankly, I 
                         found the class rather elementary.

                                     CLARK
                         You know, I don't doubt that it was. 
                         I remember that class. It was just 
                         between recess and lunch.

                                     BEN/CHUCKIE
                         Are we gonna have a problem, again?

                                     CLARK
                         There's no problem. I was still just 
                         hoping you might give me some insight 
                         into the evolution of the market 
                         economy in the Southern Colonies. 
                         See, Wood says--

                                     MATT/WILL
                              (stepping in)
                         What'd I say? Didn't I say you'd be 
                         back here regurgitating Gordon Wood. 
                         But you forgot about Vickers--

                                     CLARK
                         No, I just read Vickers, so I'm up 
                         on inherited wealth, Hunting. But 
                         you're not the angry, brilliant young 
                         mind you once were, just itching to 
                         vent your frustrations.

               In the background, Jay and Silent Bob get bored and head out 
               of the shot. After a beat, they get pushed back in by the 
               A.D.

                                     CLARK
                         Once Sean told you it wasn't your 
                         fault, you lost the edge, William.  
                         You stopped hitting the books with a 
                         vengeance, and now I've read shit 
                         you haven't even heard about yet. 
                         Face facts, my friend--love made you 
                         a soft little pussy boy, unable to 
                         stand up to an academic showdown, 
                         like you used to. You're just no 
                         longer that good--Will Hunting.
                              (gets in his face)
                         Now how do you like them apples?

               Matt/Will turns away angrily, facing Ben/Chuckie, looking 
               downwards, steaming.

                                     BEN/CHUCKIE
                         I don't like the sound of them apples. 
                         Will, what're we gonna do now?

                                     MATT/WILL
                         Chuckie--
                              (snarling)
                         It's Hunting season.

               Matt/Will spins to face Clark with two huge guns in his hands. 
               He blows Clark away, Jay and Bob hit the deck. Matt/Will 
               stands there, guns smoking.

                                     BEN/CHUCKIE
                         Apple sauce, bitch.

               Suddenly the door to the soundstage swings open, and the 
               Security guard Jay knocked out rushes in, followed by other 
               SECURITY GUARDS who comb the place.

                                     SECURITY GUARD
                         Sorry to interrupt, sirs, but have a 
                         ten-oh-seven on our hands.

                                     BEN
                         Wait a second! I wasn't with any 
                         hookers today!

               The Security Guard sees Jay and Bob crouched behind Ben, He 
               points, screaming.

                                     SECURITY GUARD
                         THERE THEY ARE!

               Ben and Matt turn to Jay and Bob, Jay smiles.

                                     JAY
                         Affleck, you're the bomb in Phantoms, 
                         yo.

               Jay and Bob then race out-of-frame, closely followed by the 
               Security guards.  Matt head off, arms thrown in the air.

                                     MATT
                         If anyone's looking for me, I'll be 
                         in my trailer trying to figure out 
                         how I got here from an Academy Award.

               EXT. SOUNDSTAGE--DAY

               Jay and Bob rush out, pulling a bench in front of the door, 
               blocking it. They race ten feet to another soundstage across 
               from them and head inside a door.

               INT. SOUNDSTAGE--SAME

               Jay and Silent Bob rush in to see--

               Wes Craven getting ready to direct a scene with a familiar-
               looking GHOSTFACE KILLER and SHANNEN DOHERTY. The 
               Clapper/Loader's clapboard reads: Scream 4

                                     CLAPPER/LOADER
                         Scream four, scene thirty-seven, 
                         take one.
                              (claps it and rushes 
                              off)

                                     WES CRAVEN
                         Action!

               The Killer chases Shannen around the room, falling over stuff, 
               until she hits him with a lamp, knocking him out.

                                     SHANNEN DOHERTY
                         Alright, you bastard! Let's see who 
                         you really are!

               Shannen pulls the mask off the short performer to reveal 
               SUZANNE.

               Jay and Silent Bob go wide-eyed.

                                     SHANNEN DOHERTY
                         Fucking Miramax--
                              (getting up)
                         CUT!

               Shannen heads over to Wes, holding the mask.

                                     WES CRAVEN
                         Shannen, usually I say "cut."

                                     SHANNEN DOHERTY
                         A monkey? Jesus, you guys aren't 
                         even trying anymore, are you?

                                     WES CRAVEN
                         The market research suggest that 
                         people love monkeys.

               Jay and Silent Bob rush in, grab Suzanne.

                                     JAY
                         WE LOVE THIS MONKEY!

               They rush out. West shrugs to Shannen.

                                     WES CRAVEN
                         See?

               Security Guards race through, chasing after the exited pair.

               EXT. LOT--DAY

               Jay and Bob race through the lot, with Bob carrying Suzanne. 
               On a fake New York city street, another movie is shooting. 
               The trio, bob and weave through the shoot, until--

               At the end of the alley, a set GOLF CART pulls up, and four 
               Security Guards pile out, forming a human wall, blocking 
               their path. Jay and Bob stop dead, looking back to see the 
               other Security Guards gaining.

                                     JAY
                         What the fuck are we gonna do?

               Just then, a P.A. on a bike pulls up nearby. He ditches the 
               bike and grabs papers from the large hanging basket in front.

               Jay and Bob look at each other, race over to the bike, and 
               jump on, putting Suzanne in the basket. They start pedaling 
               away furiously, closely followed by the Security Guard posse. 
               Silent Bob peddles like mad, racing toward the Golf Cart.

                                     JAY
                         PUNCH IT!!!

               Bob pops a wheelie and the Bike races up the front of the 
               vehicle, taking flight,

               Below, the Security Guards stare in awe as--

               Jay and Silent Bob atop the bike--with Suzanne in the front 
               basket--go past a moon (on a billboard, on the side of a 
               soundstage) a la E.T.

               Jay and Bob look down, then at each other. They smile. Then 
               they look ahead and let out a scream.

               The bike crashes through a window in the side of a Soundstage 
               Building.

               INT. DRESSING ROOM--DAY

               The Bike lands, and Jay and Bob, and Suzanne go tumbling 
               onto the floor covered in glass. They look up to see.

               JAMES VAN DER BEEK AND JASON BIGGS dressed as Jay and Silent 
               Bob, looking down as them.

                                     JAMES
                         Holy shit--that looked like it hurt.

                                     JASON
                         Are you guys alright?
                              (off Suzanne)
                         Hey! They've got a monkey!

               Jay and Bob look at their twins, then at each other.

                                     JAY
                         Yo, I think that shit just kicked 
                         in.

                                     JAMES
                         Let's get you guys on your feet.

               James and Jason help Jay and Silent Bob to their feet. All 
               stare at one another, perplexed,

               Then--

                                     JAY
                              (to James)
                         See man?  Its never, "Hey--you were 
                         in Loser, or, "Dude--you rocked in 
                         Boys and Girls." It always comes 
                         back to that fucking pie! I'm haunted 
                         by it.!

                                     JAMES
                         Well, you put your dick in a pie, 
                         dude--

                                     JASON
                         Enough!
                              (to Jay)
                         Jason Biggs.

                                     JAY
                         Yo-you really get to third base with 
                         the Russsian chick like you did in 
                         the movies?

                                     JASON
                         You mean Shannon? Sadly, no.

                                     JAY
                         She's fucking hot, man. If I was 
                         you, I'd been like--

               Jay mimes a series of sexual maneuvers. Jason and James look 
               on, bewildered.

                                     JAY
                              (off James's-look)
                         What, man? You never did one of these?

               Jay starts miming again, and suddenly stops, staring at James, 
               blown away.

                                     JAY
                         Holy shit? You're the Dawson!

                                     JAMES
                         It's James, actually. James Van Der 
                         Beek.

                                     JAY
                         Yo, what's up with Pacey stealing 
                         Joey away from you? If I was you, I 
                         would've drowned his ass in your 
                         Creek and shit!

                                     JAMES
                         I know, Because what--is Josh better 
                         looking than me? Fuck, no. I mean, 
                         who on earth is better looking that 
                         me? I ask you.

                                     JAY
                         Joey, man! She's too fine! Yo--did 
                         you ever get to third base with her?

                                     JAMES
                         Well, there was this one time--
                              (catching himself)
                         Wait a second--who are you guys?!

                                     JASON
                         They're our stunt doubles, dumbass.
                              (to Jay)
                         Right?

                                     JAY
                         Stunt doubles for what?

                                     JAMES
                         The movie we start shooting in a few 
                         minutes--Bluntman and Chronic Strike 
                         Back.

                                     JASON
                              (to Bob)
                         You're doubling me. I'm playing 
                         Bluntman, AKA Silent Bill.

                                     JAMES
                         Bob

                                     JASON
                         Right. And he's playing Chronic. AKA 
                         Ray.

                                     JAMES
                         Jay! Shit, did you even read the 
                         script?

                                     JASON
                         There's a script?

               Jay and Bob stare at them, blankly. Then Jay puts up his 
               finger, indicating they should wait a minute. He gets into a 
               huddle with Silent Bob and Suzanne.

                                     JAY
                         These are the guys who are playing 
                         us, yo. We take them out, and bickety-
                         bam! No movie.

               Silent Bob nods at Jay, then Suzanne. Suzanne heads off, 
               leaving Jay and Bob to huddle.

                                     JASON
                              (off Jay and Bob, to 
                              James)
                         What's with the weird, gay huddle 
                         going on over there?

                                     JAMES
                         What's gay about it? It's two guys 
                         talking in a corner. Man--why are 
                         you such a homophobe.

                                     JASON
                         I'm not a homophobe.

                                     JAMES
                         You are. You're always calling things 
                         gay. "Ooo--look at the gay huddle, 
                         dude!"

               Suzanne approaches them.

                                     JASON
                         Hey--look at the monkey.

                                     JAMES
                         Next you're going to tell me the 
                         monkey's gay.

                                     JASON
                         He's so cute--
                              (to Suzanne)
                         C'mere. Monkey. C'mere--

               Suzanne pulls Jason and James out of the frame.

               While Jay and Silent Bob continue to huddle, the sounds of a 
               beating are heard, O.C.

                                     JAY
                         Alright, here's what we do: start 
                         swinging, and don't stop until those 
                         young Hollywood fucks are out of 
                         commission. Ready? Break!

               Jay and Bob spin to face Jason and James--only to go wide-
               eyed. Suzanne stands atop the fallen actors, who are bloodied 
               and beaten and knocked out cold. She holds her hands skyward, 
               clasped like a champion.

                                     JAY
                         That's one funky monkey.

               Suddenly there's a banging at the door of the dressing room.

                                     VOICE (O.S.)
                         Mister Biggs?  Mister Van... Der--
                         Beek? This is Security. We've got a 
                         pair of intruders at large, and they 
                         crashed through a window we thought 
                         might be yours.

                                     JAY
                              (to door; deepening 
                              voice)
                         Uh--yeah. They're in here.

                                     SECURITY GUARD
                         Do they have you hostage? Should we 
                         call your publicists?

                                     JAY
                         NO! I mean, we kicked those guys' 
                         asses bad. They're--knocked out.

               EXT. DRESSING ROOM--SAME

               The Security Guards stand outside a door marked James.

                                     SECURITY GUARD
                         Great work, sirs! If you let us in, 
                         we'll take over--

                                     JAY (O.S.)
                              (through door)
                         NO! Me and Jason Biggs are naked in 
                         here! Together!

               The Security guard look at one another.

                                     SECURITY GUARD
                         Uh--okay. We'll just be--outside the 
                         door, sirs.

               The Security Guards stifle a laugh, as one makes a blow job 
               face to the rest.

               INT. DRESSING ROOM--DAY

               Bob opens an AIR VENT in the wall. He puts Suzanne into it 
               and hands her the tranquilizer gun, miming to her. She nods, 
               and starts crawling through the ductwork, Bob closes the 
               vent again, and starts rifling through a nearby closet.

                                     JAY
                         What the fuck are we gonna do?! How 
                         are we gonna get out of here without 
                         them seeing us?

               Silent Bob pulls a pair of hangered COSTUMES from the closet, 
               smiling.

               EXT. LOT--DAY

               The Security Guards push a cuffed Jason and James into a 
               waiting Cop Car. The pair are still dressed like Jay and 
               Silent Bob.

                                     JAMES
                         YOU'VE GOT THE WRONG GUYS!

                                     JASON
                         HEY! DON'T YOU RECOGNIZE ME?! I'M 
                         THE PIE-FUCKER.

                                     SECURITY GUARD
                              (to Cops)
                         He'll be the pie--in prison.

               INT. SOUNDSTAGE HALLWAY--DAY

               Jay and Bob creep toward a door (we don't see the outfits).

                                     JAY
                         This was a good idea, Lunchbox. In 
                         these outfits we're totally incognito.

               Suddenly, and A.D. appears, grabbing them by the shoulders.

                                     A.D.
                         Mister Biggs? Mister Van Der Beek? 
                         Great--you've changed costumes 
                         already. Let's get you to set.
                              (pulling them off)
                         The director doesn't like to be kept 
                         waiting.

               INT. SOUNDSTAGE--BLUNTCAVE SET

               It looks like the Batcave, but it's not. Off to the side, 
               near the monitor and chair setup, a black DIRECTOR eyeballs 
               the hustling, white crew.

                                     DIRECTOR
                         Look at all these crackers, Seventy 
                         million dollars and I can't even get 
                         a black grip?

               A white P.A. brings a cup of latte to the Director.

                                     P.A.
                         Here's your coffee, sir.

                                     DIRECTOR
                              (eyes the coffee)
                         You spit in this?  Because I know 
                         all you white folks are pissed off 
                         that the studio'd entrust a multi-
                         million dollar to a brother.

                                     P.A.
                         I didn't spit in it, sir.

                                     DIRECTOR
                         Then taste it! Go on!

               The P.A. takes the cup and sips from it. He tries to hand it 
               back to the Director.

                                     P.A.
                         It's all good, sir.

                                     DIRECTOR
                         No it ain't all good. Oh, you think 
                         I want it now, after your lips touched 
                         the cup? Get the fuck off my set!

                                     P.A.
                         You the man, sir.

                                     DIRECTOR
                         No you the Man! And that's the 
                         problem!

               The Director glares at the scared P.A., as he cautiously 
               skulks off. BANKY EDWARDS approaches.

                                     BANKY
                         Uh, Chaka? Yeah, hi--I'm Banky 
                         Edwards, the creator of Bluntman and 
                         Chronic. We met a few weeks back. 
                         I'm the executive producer.

                                     DIRECTOR/CHAKA
                         Oh--you're the executive producer, 
                         hunh? Well go "produce" me a latte 
                         no white folks spit in--okay Fucky?

                                     BANKY
                         Banky. I just wanted you to know 
                         that I respect your work as an artist. 
                         I'm something of an artist myself. I 
                         was the inker on the comic book.

                                     CHAKA
                         An inker? What, like you trace?

               Banky's face drops as the A.D. joins them.

                                     A.D.
                         Biggs and Van Der Beek are on the 
                         set, Chaka.

                                     CHAKA
                         I don't see 'em. Where are they?
                              (into bullhorn)
                         WHERE THE FUCK ARE THE STARS OF THIS 
                         PIECE OF SHIT?!

               On the Bluntcave set, two massive doors open in the fake 
               rock. Smoke pours in, and Jay and Silent Bob--now dressed as 
               BLUNTMAN AND CHRONIC--step from the darkness. Jay and Bob 
               survey the set, amazed.

                                     JAY
                         This must've set 'em back a couple 
                         hundred bucks.

                                     CHAKA
                         Look at this shit.
                              (off their outfits)
                         A gay hood ornament, and the color 
                         Purple.

                                     JAY
                         Who the fuck are you?

                                     CHAKA
                         Who the fuck am I? I'm the fucking 
                         director, is who I am. Chaka Luther 
                         King. The creator of all of this.

                                     JAY
                         Wait a sec--I thought Holden and 
                         Banky created this shit.

                                     CHAKA
                         And I'm stealing it. I'm taking it 
                         back for all the shit you people 
                         have stolen from us! Did you know, I 
                         came up with the idea for Sesame 
                         Street before PBS? I was going to 
                         call it N.W.P.--Niggaz with Puppets.
                              (beat)
                         Alright--enough small talk. Let's 
                         shoot it.

               Chaka heads back toward his monitor. Jay and Bob are confused.

                                     JAY
                         Wait, wait, wait!! Aren't you gonna 
                         direct us?

                                     CHAKA
                         I'll be directing you to the food 
                         stamps line after I fire your ass, 
                         if you talk back like that to me 
                         again!

                                     JAY
                         But we don't know what we're supposed 
                         to do here. We didn't even read the 
                         script.

                                     CHAKA
                         So? Neither did I. Shit, neither did 
                         the studio.
                              (pointing O.C.)
                         Look man, it's not hard. In this 
                         scene, the bad guy breaks into the 
                         Bluntcave.  You make up some shit, 
                         fight him for a while, I film it, I 
                         yell "cut," and then head back to my 
                         trailer, where I got more white women 
                         waiting for me there than the first 
                         lifeboat off the Titanic!
                              (confidentially)
                         They all want a part of the movie, 
                         and I got just the part for 'em.

               Jay and Silent Bob go wide-eyed, as Chaka heads off.

                                     CHAKA
                         LET'S ROLL WITH THE NEW!

                                     A.D. (O.S.)
                         QUIET ON THE SET! THIS IS A TAKE!

               Chaka climbs behind his monitor. The P.A. is waiting for him 
               with another cup of coffee.

                                     P.A.
                         I got you another cup of coffee, 
                         sir. Spit free.

               Chaka smacks the coffee out of his hand and sits down.

               The Clapper/Loader jumps in front of the startled Jay and 
               Bob, getting ready.  After a beat, he turns to Silent Bob.

                                     CLAPPER/LOADER
                         I just wanna say that I loved when 
                         you fucked that pie.
                              (calling off)
                         BLUNTMAN AND CHRONIC STRIKE BACK, 
                         SCENE THIRTY-SEVEN, TAKE ONE!

               The clapper/Loader shuts the clapboard and races off. From 
               behind the monitor,

               Chaka calls out--

                                     CHAKA
                         ACTION!

               Jay and Bob (as Bluntman and Chronic) look at each other for 
               a beat. Then--

                                     JAY/CHRONIC
                         Uh--Snootchie Bootchies.

               Suddenly, the wall to their left explodes. Jay and Bob hit 
               the deck. Through the smoking rubble steps COCK-KNOCKER--the 
               arch--nemesis of Bluntman and Chronic.  He's a normal-looking 
               man with huge, overgrown FISTS.

                                     JAY/CHRONIC
                         What the fuck?

                                     COCK-KNOCKER
                         You thought I'd never find your 
                         precious Bluntcave, did you, Hemp 
                         Knight? But now you and your sidekick 
                         are finally in the grasp of Cock-
                         Knocker!

                                     JAY/CHRONIC
                         Why do they call you "Cock-Knocker"?

               Cock-Knocker slams one of his huge fists into Jay's balls. 
               Jay drops to his knees, wailing. Cock-Knocker then pulls a 
               vibrator-looking device from his cape.  He presses a button 
               on it and a laser beam rises out of the vibrator, like a 
               light saber.

                                     COCK-KNOCKER
                         Any last words before I bust your 
                         balls, Bluntman?

               Silent Bob quickly looks right, then left. His eyes fall on--

               A wall of armaments, on which hands a SILVER BONG, under the 
               placard: BONG SABER--EXTREMELY EXPERIMENTAL. DO NOT USE. 
               It's out of his reach.

               Silent Bob closes his eyes, concentrating. He reached his 
               hand out to the Bong Saber, attempting the Jedi Mind Trick.

               Suddenly, the Bong snaps from the armory into Bob's grip. 
               The Bong Saber blasts to life and Bob strikes a defensive 
               pose. Bob rushes the astonished Cock-Knocker and the pair 
               start light saber dueling.

                                     CHAKA
                              (from behind monitor)
                         Damn! Now that was one special effect! 
                         This picture's gonna make House Party 
                         look like House Party Two!

                                     A.D.
                         Or House Party Three?

                                     CHAKA
                         Shut the fuck up!

               Cock-Knocker battles Bob back. He vogues some impressive 
               blade handling, prompting Bob to make a run for it--up the 
               ladder of the Bong Reactor and over Cock-Knocker's head. He 
               lands behind Cock-Knocker, striking another pose.  Cock-
               Knocker then high- kicks Bob in the face, knocking him on 
               his ass across the floor. Cock-Knocker rushers over to deliver 
               a saber kill-shot, when we hear--

                                     JAY (O.S.)
                         YO-BITCH-FISTS!

               Cock-Knocker turns to see--

               Jay, standing on the rotating monitor station, holding a 
               double-sided saber. He clicks it and TWO beams emit (a la 
               the Darth Maul light saber in Episode One).

                                     JAY
                         Call me Darth Balls. Bunngg.

               Jay leaps at Cock-Knocker, wielding the double-beamed Bong 
               Saber.

                                     CHAKA
                              (from behind the 
                              monitor)
                         I think George Lucas is going to sue 
                         somebody--

               EXT. SOUNDSTAGE--DAY

               Willenholly's car screeches up, and Willenholly jumps with a 
               shotgun. He slides across the hood of the car and lands beside 
               the flashing red light.

                                     WILLENHOLLY
                              (looking around)
                         So, this is Hollywood?
                              (suddenly full of 
                              purpose)
                         Lights, camera, action, Jay and Silent 
                         Bob.

               Willenholly cocks his shotgun and heads for the door.

               INT. SOUNDSTAGE--DAY

               The door bursts open, and Willenholly charges in, firing two 
               shots, O.C.

                                     WILLENHOLLY
                         FREEZE YOU TERRORIST SONSABITCHES!!!

               Willenholly goes wide-eyed.

               It's not Bluntcave. We're on a different soundstage, where a 
               kid's movie's being shot: Mooby's Grand Adventure. There's a 
               Barney-sized MOOBY surrounded by little KIDS. The Kids stare 
               back at Willenholly terrified. The Mooby suit has smoking 
               bullet holes in it. Mooby collapses.

                                     WILLENHOLLY
                         Oh my God--
                              (to kids)
                         Um--sorry. That was supposed to be a 
                         warning shot. Uh--it looks like I'm 
                         on the wrong, uh--wrong set.

               The Kids look at the fallen Mooby. On looks angrily at the 
               O.C. Willenholly.

                                     KID
                         You killed Mooby--
                              (to Kids)
                         LET'S GET HIM!!!

               The Kids charge Willenholly, who screams like a woman as 
               he's attacked.

               INT. SOUNDSTAGE--SAME

               Jay attacks Cock-Knocker with his Bong Saber, full throttle.

                                     COCK-KNOCKER
                              (breaking character)
                         You are not upstaging me, Van Der 
                         Beek!

               Jay whacks away happily at the actor playing Cock-Knocker, 
               hacking him up onto the ladder of the Bluntcave's nuclear 
               reactor. Cock-Knocker climbs the ladder slightly to evade 
               the attack, dueling Jay back with the saber in his other 
               hand.

                                     COCK-KNOCKER
                              (to O.C. Chaka)
                         CHAKA--CALL OFF DAWSON! GIVE ME A 
                         "CUT"!

               On cue, Jay delivers a kill-shot to one of Cock-Knocker's 
               huge fists, cutting it off (a la Empire).

               Silent Bob joins Jay, as Jay turns off this double-Bong Saber, 
               Jay grins at Cock-Knocker.

                                     JAY
                         Now whose balls have been busted, 
                         bitch?

               Suddenly, a gun shot rings out.

               All turn to see a roughed-up Willenholly, training his gun 
               first on Jay, then Bob.

                                     WILLENHOLLY
                         The C.L.I.T. stops here, Jay and 
                         Silent Bob!
                              (revealing badge: 
                              calling out)
                         Everyone stay calm. I'm a Federal 
                         Wildlife Marshal. These men are the 
                         leaders of a terrorist organization 
                         wanted for the abduction of a monkey.

                                     VOICE (O.S.)
                         They didn't really steal that monkey.

               All turn to see Justice approaching from the shadows. 
               Willenholly trains his gun on her. Jay's mouth drops.

                                     JUSTICE
                         It was just a diversion so we could 
                         steal these.

               Justice pulls the bag of diamonds from her jacket, revealing 
               them.

                                     JUSTICE
                         And they're not the leaders of 
                         C.L.I.T. The C.L.I.T. is not real.

                                     WILLENHOLLY
                         No--the clit's real. The female orgasm 
                         is a myth.

                                     JUSTICE
                              (to Jay)
                         Are you guys alright?

                                     JAY
                         I thought you blew up, Boo Boo Kitty 
                         Fuck.

                                     JUSTICE
                              (smiling)
                         You remembered.
                              (back to business)
                         It was a frame-up, Jay. Sissy. Missy, 
                         Chrissy, and I are international 
                         jewel thieves. We were setting you 
                         up as a patsy, but I couldn't go 
                         through with it, because I... because 
                         I love you.

                                     JAY
                         Yeah? So that means you'll fuck me, 
                         right?

                                     VOICE (O.S.)
                         If she does, it'll be considered 
                         necrophilia.

               All turn to see Sissy, Missy, and Chrissy slinking from the 
               shadows, guns drawn.

                                     SISSY
                         Because she's gonna be one dead bitch.
                              (to Justice)
                         Hi, Jussy. We catch you at a bad 
                         time?

                                     MISSY
                         You should've just let these guys go 
                         down, Jussy.

                                     JAY
                         Hey, I wanted to go down, but I was 
                         waiting until I got to know her a 
                         little better. See, there was this 
                         little angel on my shoulder, and he 
                         said--

                                     CHRISSY
                         Shut the fuck up before I shoot you 
                         where you stand in your pansy red 
                         booties.

                                     JAY
                              (looking down)
                         Holy shit, I am wearing pansy red 
                         booties!
                              (to Bob)
                         Man--why the fuck didn't you tell 
                         me?

                                     SISSY
                         Let's have those diamonds, Jussy.

                                     JUSTICE
                         I can't do that, Sissy

                                     SISSY
                              (points her gun at 
                              Jay)
                         Then lover--boy gets one in the brain.

                                     CHAKA
                         YO!

               All turn to look at Chaka.

                                     CHAKA
                         Would any of you lovely ladies like 
                         a private audition to be in my movie?

               Justice high-kicks the gun out of Sissy's hand. It lands on 
               the ground discharging. Then everyone starts shooting and 
               running for cover.

               Jay and Silent Bob hurl themselves over the Bluntmobile.

               Missy and Chrissy flip over a lavish, exquisitely-packed 
               craft service table labeled. CAST. They pop back up and start 
               firing at Willenholly. Willenholly leaps behind a barren 
               craft service table that holds a bag of Smarties and a dented 
               can of RC Cola. He pops up and returns fire. When both are 
               out of bullets, they drop back down behind the table and 
               reload. From behind his table,

               Willenholly yells--

                                     WILLENHOLLY
                         WHY ARE YOU SHOOTING AT ME?!?! I'M 
                         JUST A FEDERAL WILDLIFE MARSHAL!!!

                                     CHRISSY
                         TWO REASONS: ONE--WE'RE WALKING, 
                         TALKING BAD GIRLS, CLICHES!

                                     MISSY
                         AND TWO: BECAUSE YOU'RE A MAN.

                                     WILLENHOLLY
                         ONLY ON THE OUTSIDE!

               The Girls and Willenholly both pop back up and open fire 
               again.

               Chaka ducks behind the monitor.

                                     CHAKA
                         A shitload of white people with guns? 
                         Time to get my black ass out of here!

               He races off, passing Justice and Sissy, who circle each 
               other defensively, striking kung fu poses.

                                     SISSY
                         You really let me down, Justice. 
                         Throwing it all away for a little 
                         stoner with bad pronunciation.

                                     JAY (O.S.)
                         HEY!

                                     JUSTICE
                              (ignoring him)
                         What's it gonna be, Sissy? Which 
                         fighting style do you want me to 
                         kick your ass in?

                                     SISSY
                         Are you kidding me? I taught you all 
                         all your moves myself. There's not a 
                         style you can bust that I can't defend 
                         against.

                                     JUSTICE
                         You're no match for my "Shaolin Monk."

                                     SISSY
                         Yeah, but I can bury you with my 
                         "Crouching Tiger."

                                     JUSTICE
                         A little "Venus's--flytrap"?

                                     SISSY
                         I'll counter with "Dragon Crane."

                                     JUSTICE
                         How about a little "Bitch, My Man 
                         Ain't Yo Baby's Daddy"?

                                     SISSY
                              (beat; smiles)
                         Bring it on.

               Justice rushes Sissy and instead of sleek kung fu, they launch 
               into a down-and-dirty, girl's cat-fight; hair pulling and 
               screaming.

               Behind the Bluntmobile, Jay and Bob watch all the action.

                                     JAY
                         Yo--I hope one of 'em rips the other 
                         one's shirt off and we see some tit.

               Both Bob and Jay smile at each other, nodding. Banky joins 
               them, crawling in on his belly, covering his head.

                                     BANKY
                         Mister Biggs? Mister Van Der Beek? I 
                         just wanted to say hi. I'm--

                                     JAY
                         Banky fucking Edwards! Just the 
                         motherfucker we came to see!

                                     BANKY
                              (shocked)
                         Holy shit! What the fuck are you 
                         guys doing here?!

               Sissy has Justice on her belly, banging her face into the 
               floor, screeching.  Jay, Bob, and Banky continue.

                                     BANKY
                         Stop the movie?! Are you crazy?!

                                     JAY
                         All these assholes are calling us 
                         names on the Internet, 'cause of 
                         this stupid movie!

                                     BANKY
                         I feel for you boys--I really do. 
                         Those Net snipers can be really cruel. 
                         But Miramax paid me a shitload of 
                         money for Bluntman and Chronic, so 
                         it occurs to me that people bad-
                         mouthing you on some web-site is 
                         none of my FUCKING CONCERN!

                                     SILENT BOB
                         Oh--but I think it is.

               Banky stares at Silent Bob, agog, Jay rolls his eyes.

                                     JAY
                         Here we go again--

                                     SILENT BOB
                         Shut the fuck up.
                              (to Banky)
                         We had a deal with you on the comics 
                         for likeness rights. And as we're 
                         not only the artistic basis but also 
                         the character basis for your 
                         intellectual property, Bluntman and 
                         Chronic, when we said property was 
                         optioned by Miramax Films you were 
                         legally obliged to secure our 
                         permission to transfer the concept 
                         to another medium. As you failed to 
                         do that, you're in breach of the 
                         original contract--ergo, you find 
                         yourself in a very actionable 
                         position.

               Banky stares at Bob, even more agog, joined by Jay. After a 
               beat, Jay adds--

                                     JAY
                         Yeah.

               Justice now has the advantage over Sissy, holding her head 
               and kicking her in the face, repeatedly, screaming.

                                     BANKY
                         So, what do you guys want, to go 
                         away and take your lady friends with 
                         you?

                                     JAY
                         Shitcan this movie so we don't get 
                         called names on the Internet anymore.

                                     BANKY
                         Even if there's no movie, people are 
                         still free to talk shit about you on 
                         the Internet. That's what the 
                         Internet's for: slandering others 
                         anonymously.  Stopping the flick 
                         isn't going to stop that!

               In the background, we see Justice high-kick Sissy into the 
               air.

                                     JAY
                         Well this isn't fair!  We went to 
                         Hollywood, I fell in love, we stole 
                         a monkey, we got shot at, and got 
                         punched in the motherfucking nuts! 
                         We ain't leaving empty-handed!

               On cue, Sissy drops from above, landing in Jay's lap.

                                     JAY
                         What's up baby? You look good!

                                     BANKY
                         Isn't that your girlfriend's enemy?

                                     JAY
                         Oh yeah.
                              (pushing Sissy off 
                              him)
                         Get the fuck offa me, pig!

               Sissy races at Justice, leaping atop her, pulling her hair.

               Jay, Bob, and Banky continue.

                                     BANKY
                         You guys are gonna ruin my movie 
                         career.

                                     JAY
                         Well, we want something for our mental 
                         anguish.

                                     BANKY
                         Tell you what: we'll settle this 
                         monetarily. I'll give you half of 
                         what I made.

                                     JAY
                         Half?!?

                                     BANKY
                         Half's not good enough?  Fine--I'll 
                         give you two-thirds of what I made!

                                     JAY
                         Fuck-you--you already said half? You 
                         can't take it back!

               Silent Bob rolls his eyes, Banky shakes Jay's hand.

                                     BANKY
                         Done

               Justice throws Sissy off, onto the floor. Both get up, facing 
               each other.

                                     SISSY
                         Your shit is so tired, Justice!

                                     JUSTICE
                         Call me Boo-Boo Kitty Fuck--BITCH!

               Justice high-kicks Sissy and she goes flying across the stage.

               Sissy sails toward the craft service table, landing atop 
               Missy and Chrissy, knocking them out.

               Willenholly stands to see why the girls stopped shooting.

                                     WILLENHOLLY
                         Hello? Truce?
                              (beat)
                         I think I killed both of them.

               Suddenly, he lets out a shriek and falls forward, revealing 
               a tranquilizer dart in his ass, and SUZANNE standing behind 
               him, holding the gun up in the air.  Justice surveys her 
               handiwork for a beat, then calls off toward the Bluntmobile.

                                     JUSTICE
                         C'mon guys. It's over.

               Jay, Bob, and Banky pop up from behind the car and join her.

                                     JAY
                         Yo, I was just about to jump in there 
                         and get your back.

               Then, the SOUND of SIRENS rings out in the distance.

                                     JAY
                         Holy shit, the cops! We gotta get 
                         out of here!

                                     JUSTICE
                         No. I'm tired of running.

               Justice lifts Willenholly into a sitting position and taps 
               his face.

                                     JUSTICE
                         You awake, Marshal? Marshal?

                                     WILLENHOLLY
                              (tries to move but 
                              can't)
                         Oh my God, I'm paralyzed. The monkey 
                         shot me in the ass and paralyzed me! 
                         Oh the irony!

                                     JUSTICE
                              (off Suzanne's gun)
                         You're not paralyzed. It was just a 
                         tranquilizer.

                                     WILLENHOLLY
                         Jesus! Tranqued by a little monkey! 
                         My friends in the Bureau are never 
                         gonna let me live this down!

                                     JUSTICE
                         You have friends in the F.B.I.?

                                     WILLENHOLLY
                              (crying)
                         They all made it in, but I failed 
                         the exam. Why the hell else do you 
                         think I became a Federal Wildlife 
                         Marshal? 'Cause I'm a joke!

               Justice looks toward the direction of the sirens, thinking. 
               Then--

                                     JUSTICE
                         Maybe not. I can make you a deal 
                         that'll get you into the F.B.I., 
                         regardless of test scores.

                                     WILLENHOLLY
                         What kind of deal?

                                     JUSTICE
                         You drop the charges against Jay and 
                         Silent Bob and say you never found 
                         the ape.  Make sure the world knows 
                         they're not in control of any C.L.I.T.

                                     JAY
                         Now wait a second--

                                     JUSTICE
                         I'll explain later, Jay
                              (to Willenholly)
                         In exchange, I'll give you the 
                         diamonds I stole, and turn in Sissy, 
                         Missy, Chrissy, and myself. But I 
                         want a reduced sentence.

                                     WILLENHOLLY
                         You'd be willing to do that?

                                     JUSTICE
                              (off Jay)
                         For him? I'd be willing to do 
                         anything.

               Justice stands and takes Jay by the hands.

                                     JUSTICE
                         I'm an international jewel thief 
                         who's facing a jail sentence.

                                     JAY
                         That's alright. I'm a junkie with a 
                         monkey.

                                     JUSTICE
                         If I go to prison, will you wait for 
                         me?

                                     JAY
                         I don't know. Will we fuck when you 
                         get out?

               Justice smiles and kisses Jay Passionately. The kiss should 
               say it all, but--

                                     JAY
                         Don't change the subject. Will we 
                         fuck when you get out?

                                     JUSTICE
                         Snoogans.

               Justice and Jay kiss again.

               Suzanne reached up to Silent Bob, who picks her up. She grabs 
               his face and kisses him.

               Willenholly looks to Banky.

                                     WILLENHOLLY
                         Wow. There's a lot of love in the 
                         room.

                                     BANKY
                         Regardless of what you may have heard. 
                         I do not kiss guys.

               EXT. SOUNDSTAGE--LATER

               Justice and Jay are still kissing, until Willenholly pulls 
               her away and loads her into the waiting Cop Car.

                                     WILLENHOLLY
                         Sorry, Justice. We've gotta go.
                              (to Jay: friendly)
                         Hey--stop stealing monkeys.

                                     JAY
                         Fuck you.

                                     WILLENHOLLY
                         Fair enough.

               Willenholly closes the door behind Justice and gets in the 
               car.

                                     JUSTICE
                              (to Jay)
                         Wait for me.

                                     JAY
                         What--here?

               Jay looks at Justice, confused, as the Cruiser pulls away, 
               leaving Jay, Bob, Suzanne, and Banky. They start walking 
               down the lot.

                                     BANKY
                         Well, boys--you're rich in love--
                              (indicating Jay)
                         Well, you're in love. And to top 
                         that off, you've got your own monkey. 
                         What more could two guys from Jersey 
                         possibly want?

                                     JAY
                         All those fucks to stop talking shit 
                         about us on the Internet, for 
                         starters.

                                     BANKY
                         What do I keep telling you? There's 
                         not much you can do to stop that. 
                         Well, short of showing up at all 
                         their houses and beating the shit 
                         out of them, I guess.

               Jay and Bob suddenly freeze. They look at each other and 
               smile.

                                     JAY
                              (to Bob)
                         You know--with all that money we're 
                         gonna make we can buy a lotta plane 
                         tickets.

               START THE JAY AND BOB KICKASS MONTAGE

               EXT. SKY--DAY

               A passenger JET flies through the sky.

               EXT. SUBURBAN STREET--DAY

               Jay and Bob stand across the street from a house. They check 
               the address on the big ream of paper they're carrying, nod 
               at each other, and cross the street.

               INT. HOUSE--DAY

               The doorbell rings. A MOTHER answers it to see Jay and Silent 
               Bob standing in the doorway.

                                     MOTHER
                         Can I help you?

                                     JAY
                         Yes. Ma'am, Does--
                              (reading of paper)
                         William Dusky live here?

                                     MOTHER
                         Yes. He's my son.

                                     JAY
                         May we talk to him, please.

                                     MOTHER
                         One moment.

               She walks away. After a beat, a fifteen-year-old KID comes 
               to the door.

                                     KID
                         Yeah?

                                     JAY
                         Yo--do you post as--
                              (reading off paper)
                         Magnolia-Fan on Movie Poop Shoot.com?

                                     KID
                         Yeah.

                                     JAY
                         And did you write "Fuck Jay and Silent 
                         Bob. Fuck them up their stupid asses?

                                     KID
                         Yeah, a while ago. So?

               Jay and Bob nod at each other, then grab the KID, pull him 
               outside, and start beating the shit out of him on his front 
               lawn.

               EXT. SKY--DAY

               The passenger jet flies again, this time in the opposite 
               direction.

               EXT. SUBURBAN HOUSE--DAY

               Jay and Bob knocking at another door. Another MOTHER answers. 
               They speak, she heads inside, and another KID comes to the 
               door.

                                     JAY
                         On Movie Poop Shoot.com. did you say 
                         Jay and Silent Bob--
                              (reading off paper)
                         "--are fucking clown shoes. If they 
                         were real, I'd beat the shit out of 
                         them for being so stupid."

                                     KID
                              (chuckling)
                         Yeah.

                                     JAY
                         Really--

               Again, Jay and Bob pull the Kid outside and beat the shit 
               out of him.

               INT. CONVENIENCE STORE--DAY

               Jay and Bob beat the shit out of a CLERK.

               EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING HALLWAY--DAY

               Jay and Bob beat the shit out of a WOMAN.

               EXT. RECTORY--DAY

               Jay and Bob beat the shit out of a PRIEST.

               INT. OFFICE--DAY

               Jay and Bob beat the shit out of a BUSINESSMAN.

               EXT. MOVIE THEATRE--NIGHT

               The marquee reads: JASON BIGGS AND JAMES VAN DER BEEK ARE 
               BLUNTMAN AND CHRONIC!

               WORLD PREMIERE!

               The front doors open and the CROWD lets out. First we see 
               DANTE and RANDAL.

                                     RANDAL
                         Now that was worse then Clash of the 
                         Titans.

                                     DANTE
                         I still can't believe Judy Dench 
                         played me.

                                     RANDAL
                         Hey--remind me to renew that 
                         restraining order.

                                     DANTE
                         Why?

                                     RANDAL
                         Because I'm gonna blast the flick on 
                         the Internet tonight.

               STEVE-DAVE and WALT exit.

                                     STEVE-DAVE
                         Why can't Hollywood ever make a decent 
                         comic book movie?

                                     WALT
                         Tell'em Steve-Dave!

                                     STEVE-DAVE
                         Would you stop saying that?

               ALYSSA and TRISH come out.

                                     TRISH
                         Well, that was just another paean to 
                         male adolescence and its refusal to 
                         grow up.

                                     ALYSSA
                         Yeah, sis--but it was better than 
                         Mallrats. At least Holden had the 
                         good sense to keep his name off of 
                         it.

                                     TRISH
                         Why wouldn't Miramax option his other 
                         comic instead? You know--the one he 
                         drew about you and him and your 
                         relationship?

                                     ALYSSA
                         You mean Chasing Amy? That would 
                         never work as a movie.

               BANKY and HOOPER exit.

                                     BANKY
                         I'm so fucking embarrassed--

                                     HOOPER
                         Honey, you should be. They took your 
                         characters and reduced them to one 
                         ninety-minute-long-gay joke. It was 
                         like watching Batman and Robin again.

                                     BANKY
                         Thanks. That means a lot coming from 
                         the guy who pretends to be Shaft as 
                         opposed to the guy who takes shaft.

                                     HOOPER
                         I don't hear you complaining nightly. 
                         In fact, the only thing I do hear 
                         you say is "Yes, Hooper! Cradle the 
                         balls and work the shaft!"

                                     BANKY
                              (looking around)
                         Hey! Hey! What'd we say? Not in 
                         public!

               A guy behind them calls out to Banks.

                                     GUY
                         Nice movie, you fucking Tracer!

                                     BANKY
                              (recognizing him)
                         You--!

                                     GUY
                         That's right, you sonovabitch! I'm 
                         back for round two!

               Banky grabs the guy by the throat and starts choking him, 
               while Hooper tries to break them up.

               WILLENHOLLY exits with Justice in hand-and leg cuffs and a 
               prison uniform.  They're flanked by two ARMED PRISON GUARDS.

                                     WILLENHOLLY
                         You know, I don't get out to the 
                         movies much. But I'd have to say 
                         Bluntman and Chronic was Blunt-tastic!

                                     JUSTICE
                         Are these leg cuffs really necessary?

                                     WILLENHOLLY
                         Don't make me shoot you, Justice.

               And finally, Jay and Silent Bob come out.

                                     JAY
                         YO! THE PARTY'S ACROSS THE STREET, 
                         FEATURING THE GREATEST BAND IN THE 
                         WORLD: MORRIS DAY AND THE TIME!!!

               WHIP PAN to Morris day and The Time on stage, performing 
               "The Bird." During the song, Morris points to--

               Jay and Bob, who are dancing with Suzanne and Justice (who's 
               still in cuffs, flanked by the Guards). Jay looks to Bob, 
               they nod at each other and--

               Jay and Silent Bob, join Morris Day and the TIME onstage, 
               and dance us out to the coda, which reads--

               CODA

               Bluntman and Chronic Strike Back went on to make a mere 2.3 
               million at the box office. It was the biggest commercial 
               failure in the history of Miramax films.  The film was roundly 
               drubbed as a bad idea by the denizens of the Internet chat 
               boards, and over the course of the next year, while they 
               waited for the Quick Stop restraining order to expire, Jay 
               and Silent Bob tracked them all down and beat the shit out 
               of them.

               CREDITS. THEN--

               INT. NOWHERE

               A familiar WOMAN closes a book that's marked: THE VIEW 
               ASKEWNIVERSE. She puts the book down, smiles at us and skips 
               off.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

EXTREME CLOSEUP of glowing honey-colored stones.  Their shapes ABSTRACT
as THE CAMERA EXAMINES air bubbles and crystalline patterns.

MOVING UP AND OVER this amber abstraction, the CAMERA FINDS unusual
shapes and imperfections caught in the glassy stone:  flecks of dirt,
hairs, cracks.  STILL MOVING.  STARBURSTS OF LIGHT ricochet off the
different surfaces of the stones.

CAMERA TURNS along a creamy stretch of amber.  IT TURNS IN DEEPER,
abstracting the picture further only to find A TINY BLUR that suddenly
RACKS INTO FOCUS - a bug, a mosquito lodged within an amber tomb.  It is
folded on its back.

SLOW MOTION
 as the tip of a fine-pointed drill bores into the amber
toward the trapped bug.  Orange flecks fly.  The mosquito trembles.  The
drill continues, stopping just before it touches the tiny body.

A SHINY PAIR of thin needle-nose pliers reach in the borehole and
extricate the mosquito remains.  These are dropped on a brightly lit
glass slide.  A conveyor belt starts, and the slide moves along.
arriving under a long-lensed microscope.

IN MICROSCOPIC PERSPECTIVE, a thin needle pierces the bug and delicately
removes a fragment of tissue.

PINCERS snare the fragment, dropping it into a narrow tube.  The tube
SPINS, faster and faster until it is a BLUR on the screen.

THE SCREEN FLOODS with an INFRA-RED LIGHT.  Gray, oval shapes rock in a
neutral mist.

                                                     WASH OUT TO:

HOT SUN overhead in a BIG SKY -


EXT  BADLANDS - AFTERNOON

Lodged in the cracked earth are the partially-exposed fossilized remains
of A VELOCIRAPTER, a carnivorous dinosaur.  WIDEN OUT to a SWEEPI
NG
PANORAMA of a dinosaur dig, a major excavation filled with workers
shoveling earth and stone, making measurements, taking photographs,
scribbling notes, and conferring with each other.

The center of all this activity is one man.  In a roped-off area that
circumscribes the exposed bones of the raptor, is DR. ALAN GRANT, head
paleontologist.  Good-looking, late 30's, with a think beard.

Grant lies on his belly, completely absorbed in a small piece of bone.
A GROUP OF TWELVE STUDENTS, notebooks in hand, await his next sentence.

CLOSE ON - the tiny bone.  Grant's nose touches it.

Grant brushes the bone with a toothbrush.  Then he decides on a quicker
way to clean it.  He licks it.  Excited by his discovery, he gets to his
feet and addresses his students, who listen raptly.

                            GRANT
          Right calcaneus of an adult female
          raptor.  Mild stress fractures.  What's
          this tell me?

Students look at each other.  A tentative hand.  Grant continues.

               
             GRANT
          It tells me that this bone connects to
          the navicula which we already found
          articulating to the cuboid.

OFFSCREEN, a woman SHOUTS to him.

                            ELLIE (off)
          Dr. Grant!  Dr. Grant!

Grant looks up.

DR. ELLIE SATTLER, late 20's, sharp-eyed, tough if she wants to be, runs
like a gazelle across the arid land.  Exuberant, she leaves a trail of
dust behind her.

She zips by A STUDENT guarding the cordoned area.  He tries to stop her.

                            STUDENT
          Dr. Sattler!  Dr. Grant is thinking!

Dr. Grant waves her over enthusiastically with his bone and continues.

                            GRANT
          So, what can we stay for sure?  Stress
          fractures in the heel ...

Uncertain students.  Ellie arrives and immediately gets into it.

                            ELLIE
          She jumps.

Grant turns around to her and smiles.  She's got it.  Other students to
- they knew is all along.

            
                GRANT
          Right as rain, Ellie.  Now, why did she
          jump?

No answer.  Ellie gives it a try.

                            ELLIE
          A defensive posture against a vicious,
          blood-thirsty T-Rex?

                            GRANT
              (nodding)
          Perhaps.  Or maybe to select the smaller,
          more tender leaves in the higher branches
          with which to suckle her young?

Ellie jumps up.

                            ELLIE
          I bet is was a mating ritual.

Students laugh.  One student eyes Grant's self-conscious smile at Ellie.

                            GRANT
          The science of paleontology can't answer
          these questions.  Novelists and artists
          who dream a vision of the Jurassic period
          can attempt these questions with their
          imaginations.  What we scientists can say
          is considering the mass and kinetic
          articulation of these bones, this animal
          had a vertical leap
 of about twelve feet.
          Not as entertaining as fiction, but
          absolutely fact without prejudice.

Ellie intrudes again.

                            ELLIE
          Excuse me, Dr. Grant.  But ... fact is,
          we're late.  There's the car.

She points.  On the horizon, a limousine speeds toward them, leaving a
dusty wake.

Grant sets the rules for his departure, giving instructions individually
as Ellie pulls him away, carrying their bags.

                            GRANT
          Jim, you keep making up the plaster
          batches.  Whatever ratio you're using,
          it's perfect.  Nora, no digging after
          five - when the temperature drops, those
          bones are just too brittle.  Bill, I
          don't want any tourists walking over my
          raptor - I don't care if the Governor of
          Montana is with them, just you guys.

Grant and Ellie continue walking.  She interrupts his continued barrage.

                            ELLIE
          You know, if ev
ery scientist stuck to his
          method like you, there would be no body
          of theory - no quasars, no big bang -

Grant stops at the sight of the stopped limo and freezes.

                            GRANT
          Jesus, a limousine.  We're re-entering
          Hammond's world, that's for sure.  (beat)
          Remind me why we're doing this, Ellie.

Ellie is gentle.  She's telling him something they've discussed before.

                            ELLIE
          We're leaving the raptor dig -

                            GRANT
          - at a critical time -

                            ELLIE
          - because Gennaro is paying us sixty
          thousand dollars to observe some resort
          of Hammond's in Costa Rica. And that's -

                            GRANT
          - enough money to keep us free of
          commercial affiliations for two summers.
          All right, all right.  Good.

Then, half-kidding with Ellie:

                            GRANT
          Financial
 independence for fraternizing
          with the enemy?  (beat)  I'll do it.

She laughs.  But he can't quite leave.  He grabs a computer printout

                            GRANT
          This is all could come up with, Skip?

Skip turns the printout right-side up in Grant's hand.  Grant smiles.

                            GRANT
          Wise guy.  Let's go, Ellie.

Grant and Ellie board the limo amidst many goodbyes from the students.
The limo pulls away.


EXT  HIGH TECH BUILDING - BIOGENETIC CORPORATION HQ - SUNSET

A purple sunset irradiates the exterior glass walls of the building.


INT  BIOGEN HQ

A peanut flies in the air.  Then falls into a big open mouth.  THOMP.

                            MOUTH
          Five hundred thousand is peanuts!

He tosses another peanut and misses his open mouth.  This is DENNIS
NEDRY, a 40 year old computer programmer.  He's fat, with greasy hair
and a permanently wrinkled suit.  His slovenly looks are wildly out of
place on the rich leather sofa where he reclin
es.

Across a gleaming granite coffee table is BILL BAKER, businessman.  A
smooth meticulous dresser, Baker is disgusted by Nedry's sloppy
appearance and voracious consumption of food and drink.

Nedry finishes a coke.  Over his shoulder is an impressive skyline view.

                            NEDRY
          I'm not reneging.  I'm re-evaluating.

Nedry holds the can of coke upside-down, drains the last drops.

                            NEDRY
          You think I'm a scumbag, I know.

Nedry chuckles, lines up three peanuts on the table.  One after the
other, he throws them in the air.  He gulps down two, misses one. It
skids across the glossy floor.

Baker's head involuntarily cocks as he looks disgustedly at Nedry.

                            NEDRY
          Look pal, you make a career in biogenetic
          industrial espionage, and you're bound to
          run across a scumbag or two.  Guaranteed!
          Part of the job description.  Look, who's
          to say, who is the real scumbag?  After
          all, I know what you guys need so bad.
          I've heard of reverse engineering.

As Nedry continues he shovels nuts into his mouth and CHOMPS and SPEAKS.

                            NEDRY
          Let the other guy put in all the work,
          all the R and D.  You take the finished
          product, work backwards, breaking it down
          to reveal its genetic code.  Presto!  In
          a few measly months you have know-how
          that took researchers ten years to
          determine.  You know how much Hammond has
          invested of his own personal wealth?
          Over five billion dollars!  And if you
          guys get the jump on his - in no time,
          the market's wide-open.

Nedry starts the LAUGH as he EATS and TALKS.

                            NEDRY
          But, boy, he's really got his product!
          Oh yes siree, massive, gargantuan, money-
          making, never-heard-of-profit-like-that
          product.  It is a sight!  Yes, indeedy!

Nedry LAUGH
S explosively.  He begins to choke, COUGHING and GASPING.

Baker is repulsed.  He stares out the window as the sun sets.

Nedry, in true distress, clutches his own throat.  He clumsily runs
toward Baker, toppling chairs as he goes.  Nedry grabs Baker's hand and
squeezes it tightly, imploring Baker for help.  Baker coolly shakes his
hand loose and shoves Nedry to the floor.  Baker looks down at the prone
and desperate Nedry.

                            BAKER
          Scumbag.  We have a deal.  That deal is
          not open to renegotiation.  Or even re-
          evaluation.

Bakers kneels down next to Nedry, who is beginning to turn blue.

                            BAKER
          The deal stands.  Take it or leave it.

Baker glances at his watch.

                            BAKER
          I'll give you a few minutes to decide.

Nedry makes a superhuman effort just to nod his head.  Baker nods back
and SLAMS his fist into Nedry's solar plexus.  It works.

Nedry sucks in a huge gulp of air.  He sits up
, rubbing his belly.  As
Baker leaves the room:

                            BAKER
          Make sure the eggs are on that supply
          ship.  Just make sure!

CAMERA LEAVES NEDRY and exits the window.    IT SWISHPANS the concrete
canyons of Wall Street and enters another office.


INT  CONSERVATIVE LAW OFFICE - DAY

DONALD GENNARO, handsome,  meticulously dressed, paces the highly
polished, glassy corner suite.  His boss, ROSS, is seated.  He's a
powerful black man who waves a prosthetic arm.

                            ROSS
          We can't trust Hammond anymore.  He's
          under too much pressure.  There's the
          EPA, he's behind schedule, and the in-
          vestors are getting nervous.  There have
          been too many rumors, too many accidents.
          We can't screw around with this.

                            GENNARO
          I've asked Hammond to arrange independent
          site inspections every week for the next
          three weeks.

                            ROS
S
          What does he say?

                            GENNARO
          Insists nothing's wrong on the island.

                            ROSS
          You know him.  Do you believe him?

                             GENNARO
          No, I don't.  I spent a lot of time with
          him five years ago when we raised the
          capital.  And it was a wild ride.  He's
          unpredictable, a dreamer.

                            ROSS
          Potentially dangerous.  We should never
          have gotten involved.  What's our position?

                            GENNARO
          The firm owns five percent.

                            ROSS
          General or limited?

                            GENNARO
          General.

                            ROSS
          We should have never done that.

                            GENNARO
          It seemed wise at the time.  We all
          wanted the park to happen.  It was in
          lieu of fees.

                            ROSS
        
  In any case, I agree an inspection is
          overdue.  Who are your site experts?

Gennaro tosses a list on Ross' desk.  He check it out.

                            ROSS
          Will they tell the truth?

                            GENNARO
          I think so.  That guy Grant's a hotshot
          in his field, always goes his own way -

                            ROSS
          - Good.  You're making all the arrangements?

                            GENNARO
          Hammond asked to place the calls himself.
          I think he wants to pretend the park is
          not in trouble.  That it's just a social
          invitation, showing off the island.

                            ROSS
          All right ... Good.  But let's be very
          clear about one thing.  I don't know how
          bad this situation actually is, Donald.
          But if there's a problem on that island -
          don't be afraid to screw Hammond and burn
          Jurassic Park to the ground.

Gennaro shakes hands 
awkwardly with Ross and leaves.  Ross paces.  Fed-
up, he whispers to himself.

                            ROSS
          Costa Rica, my ass.

He whacks his desk globe, sends its spinning.

CAMERA MOVES IN on spinning globe as we HEAR the ROTOR BLADES of a
helicopter and DISSOLVE TO:


INT/EXT  HELICOPTER IN SKY - DAWN

On the helicopter tail is a little blue logo that reads: Isla Nublar.

INSIDE, Grant, Ellie and Gennaro are in the right back row.  Ellie
dozes, her head occasionally dropping onto Grant's shoulder, to his
discomfort.  Gennaro looks at papers, trying not to look through the
clear plexi-bubble at their feet.  Next to THE PILOT, Nedry chews a
candy bar.  He offers candy to the back row.

Grant loses himself, looking out the window.

GRANT'S POV - the aquamarine blue of the ocean.  Below the waters there
are the shadows of ample marine life.  Dolphins leap in the air.
Suddenly the clear scene becomes obscured by clouds.

There is turbulence.  Ellie wakes, glances at Grant, then out the
window.  
There is mist and she absently traces her finger in it, shaping
a dinosaur figure.  Now land comes into view and for a moment, the
island below them eerily fits right into her doodling.

                            PILOT
          That's Isla Nublar.  Buckle up, the
          descent is a little hairy.

Gennaro cinches his belt tightly and half-shuts his eyes.  Nedry takes
out a sandwich and cockily loosens his belt.  Ellie looks every way.

                            ELLIE
          This is exciting!

                            GRANT
          What is, Ellie?  Where are we going?

Grant looks out his window. The helicopter rushes forward, low to the
water.  Ahead, Grant sees the island, rugged and craggy, rising sharply

                            GRANT
          Looks like Alcatraz.

The pilot coughs and rubs his goggles with the back of his hand.

                            PILOT
          There's bad wind shear on this peak.

Grant nods.  Gennaro sweats, watching the pilot tighten his own belt.

Ellie
 smiles excitedly as the helicopter starts down.  Now, A BLANKET
FOG.  Grant can't see a thing out his window.  Ellie's startled.

                            ELLIE
          How the hell is he landing this thing?

No answer.  Grant dimly discerns green branches of pine trees through
the mist.  Some are very close.  Ellie's hands grasps her seat cushion.

                            ELLIE
          This is not fun.

Grant looks through the plexi-bubble at his feet.  He sees the giant
glowing fluorescent cross below.  Lights FLASH at corners of the cross.

                            GRANT
          Relax, Ellie.  I'm sure they wouldn't
          land if it weren't safe.

The copter suddenly SHAKES violently.  Ellie grabs Grant's hand.
Gennaro sits straight up, eyes squeezed shut.

                            GRANT
          Gennaro?  This guy knows what he's doing,
          Right?  Hey, Gennaro?  I'm talking to you!

Another violent shake.  Grant squeezes Ellie's hand back.

CLOSEUP - Nedry's hand crushes a 
packet of crackers.

Gennaro is soaked.  He opens one eye and looks about, very frightened.
He speaks a mantra.

                            GENNARO
          No problem.  Relax, relax.

The pilot whispers to himself and corrects slightly.  The copter sails
sharply the other way.

                            GRANT AND ELLIE
          Whoa!!!!

CLOSE ON - the pilot jerks back the stick.

THE COPTER zooms upward.  Grant's beverage flips to the ground, pours
across the floor.

Nedry's lunch does flying.  Sandwich, candy, and cracker crumbs hang
suspended in the air.  Now it all FREE-FALLS onto Nedry's lap.

Grant and Ellie lean tightly into each other,

                            ELLIE
          I don't like this feeling ...

The pilot swings his gaze, left then right, looking at the pine forest.
Trees are close, then far, then close.  The helicopter drops rapidly.
Ellie and Grant shut their eyes.  They brace themselves for the worst.

IN AND OUT OF THE MIST, the copter descends.  Tail raised high, nose
low, fo
r a moment it looks like a strange bug-eyes prehistoric animal
bucking in its pen.  In a flash, it corrects itself.  The copter touches
down on a heli-pad.  The SOUND of the rotors fades and dies.

For a second, no one moves.  Grant lets out a great sigh of relief.
Gennaro mouths a silent prayer.  The pilot stretches his fingers.

Grant and Ellie self-consciously shake their hands free of each other.
Nedry unbuckles and laughs as he brushes off his lap.  He turns:

                            NEDRY
          Just think, Gennaro -
              (laughs harder)
          - you gotta agree it's funny!  These two,
          they dig up dinosaurs!  It's wonderful,
          isn't it?

Nedry pats Grant on his shoulder.

                            NEDRY
          Dr. Bones, you're going to love this place.

Nedry bursts out laughing again as he heads out the helicopter door.

A smile comes across Gennaro's face.  As he smiles he motions with his
hands he doesn't mean any harm.  Grant and Ellie stare at him.

      
                      PILOT
          Come on folks.  Gotta get back, there's a
          storm alert.

ROTORS TURN.  OUTSIDE, a man reaches the copter.  He wears a baseball
cap over short red hair and he's dressed in phony safari garb.  He
shakes Gennaro's hand.  This is ED REGIS, 35, head of Public Relations.
He throws open the copter door next to Grant.  Big, cheerful smile.

                            REGIS
          Hi!  Ed Regis.  Real big welcome to Isla
          Nublar, Dr. Grant, Dr. Sattler.  Little
          tough landing here, I know.  But you did
          it!  Come on down, we're so happy to have
          you.  Now, watch your step.

Ellie and Grant jump into the world of Jurassic Park.


EXT  LUSH TROPICAL FOREST - MORNING

Grant takes in the beautiful tropical terrain.  This place is the
opposite of the Badlands.  There is elaborate planting everywhere:
huge, hairy ferns; exotic, spiked flowers; berries of every color;
rushing vines.  Peeking through the thick greenery are beautiful birds
a
nd flying squirrels.  The strange, prehistoric world impresses Grant
and Ellie.  Even Nedry and Gennaro take in the vegetal wonder.

Then, the SOUND of men working, grunting from exertion.  Ahead, Muldoon
directs A GROUP OF WORKMEN.  Flame-throwers roar and machetes fight back
the abundant foliage.  As they attack a new area, Regis waves Muldoon
over.  Muldoon has a pronounced limp as he walks over to join them.

                            ED REGIS
          This is Robert Muldoon, great African big
          game hunter.  And he's working for us now.
          Doing a bang-up job, too.

Muldoon rests his rifle by a tree stump and shakes with Grant and Ellie.

                            MULDOON
          Ed's a little more BS than PR.  Mr.
          Gennaro, nice to have you back.

Gennaro nods warmly as Muldoon limps back to work.

Regis leads on, taking Gennaro's arm and talking to him like and old
friend.  Nedry lumbers in the middle, alone.  At the rear, Grant and
Ellie study everything they see.  Grant
 calls to Regis but is ignored.

                            GRANT
          Mr. Regis, what is the nature of this park?

Ellie looks behind and sees cramped ferns spring out to capture the path
they just walked on.  She nudges Grant, who has seen the same.

                            ELLIE
          Aggressive growth, huh?

                            GRANT
          Hammond's trademark.

A distinct HOOTING in the distance.  Then a loud TRUMPETING.  Grant and
Ellie stop.  Nedry doesn't look up.  Regis flashes his salesman's smile.

                            REGIS
          Out animals are greeting you!

They pass a crude sign nailed to a tree:  Welcome to Jurassic Park.
Grant cringes at the sign.  Ellie nudges him to loosen up.

                            GRANT
          I hope this isn't one of those animatronic
          exhibits in a Jurassic botanical setting.

                            NEDRY
          Nope.

Gennaro wipes his brow.  They enter a green tunnel of over-arching palm
that leads to the 
VISITOR'S CENTER, a modern complex in the distance.

Ellie notices a large fence hidden in the brush.  She nudges Grant.

THEIR POV - CAMERA SLOWLY CLIMBS a fifteen foot high chain-link fence.
The needle-spiked top of this fence cuts deep into the brush.

This fence is only the prelude.

Sprawling massively above and behind it is a thirty foot high fence.
Woven throughout the fence's mesh is an intricate system of electrical
wire.  There is a prominent warning:  DANGER!  ELECTRIC FENCE: TEN
THOUSAND VOLTS - KEEP OFF!

CAMERA KEEPS CLIMBING to the top:  ominous barbed wire, curled into the
highest growth with coiled razors glistening in the sun.

Grant strains to understand.  The quickens his steps to catch the others.

They reach a clearing with an unfinished brick sidewalk and potted shade
trees waiting for planting.  A crosshatching of tiny lizards scamper off
the walk.  An empty swimming pool is being filled by A MAN with a pumper
truck.  Next to him, WORKERS water the large ferns.

                       
     REGIS
          I hope you brought your bathing suits!
          Doesn't this mist and these plants really
          create a bonafide prehistoric feeling?

Regis points to a low building with glass pyramids on the roof.

                            REGIS
          There's the Visitor's Center.

A CRANE lowers an iron grating on top of one pyramid.  An animal TRUMPETS.


INT  VISITOR'S CENTER - DAY

CLOSE ON - the iron security grating as it fits over a glass skylight.
Above, MASKED WORKERS weld it on.  Sparks fly.

Grant stares up at it, thinking.  Footsteps echo behind him as Regis,
Ellie, Gennaro, and Nedry look around the unfinished building.

The Visitor's Center is two stories high, a lot of glass with exposed
girders and supports.  It's incomplete:  vines swing in the breeze where
the back wall will go and undressed cables litter the floor.  Even so,
exhibit areas are in varying stages of completion.  Behind, SEVERAL
SPANISH WORKERS unpack masonry supplies.

                            GRANT
     
     Where's Hammond?

                            REGIS
          Mr. Hammond is dying to see you guys.

Grant strides over to an exhibit as Gennaro paces impatiently.

                            GENNARO
          Hot, hot, hot.  Ten billion bucks and the
          air conditioning sucks.

Regis smiles apologetically and pushes open a large window on one of the
finished walls.  Giant leaves and vines burst inside.

Grant studies an exhibit in progress entitled When Dinosaurs Rules the
World.  This is a large clock that presents millions of years as hours
in a single day.  Many brightly colored hours are allocated to the
dinosaurs.  Man receives the last second of the day.  Ellie joins Grant.

                            ELLIE
          The audicity of man to get here at the
          last second and think he runs the show.

Grant smiles at her inexhaustible enthusiasm.  He looks at a painted
mural of a Raptor on one of the walls in the half-completed gift shop.

Nedry is at a coke machine, feeding in change
.  It doesn't work.  He
SLAMS his hand against it, and finally, a cup drops down the chute.
Upside-down.  It pours.  Coke splashes Nedry.  He curses and exits.

THE ROTUNDA - Ellie pulls Grant over to a raised, round display with a
catwalk.  In this unfinished display, a skeletal T-Rex and a Raptor are
locked in combat.  Scaffolding is up around it, and painting supplies
are scattered all around.

Regis glances at his watch, looks up, and smiles.

At that moment, doors adjacent to the rotunda swing open automatically.
A soothing female voice comes out of the public address system.

                            VOICE (ON P.A.)
          Please come to the theater.  In a moment,
          our film will begin.

The voice goes on to give this information in a number of languages.
Regis waves everyone into the theater.   Nedry doesn't join them.  He
climbs the stairs to the second floor.


INT  SCREENING ROOM - DAY

Small and plush.  Regis sits in the front, full of enthusiasm.  Grant and
Ellie sit further behind. 
 Gennaro stands in the back and smokes.

CELESTIAL MUSIC fills the room.  Mist covers and curls on the stage
floor.  Colored spotlights illuminate the mist in an eerie fashion.
overall effect is the touristy Where's NY? high-gloss production.

years young, with a glint in his eye and very comfortable with his own
effect.  He wears a white linen suit with a red rose in the breast
pocket.  Like an elder Carl Sagan, he addresses the group.

                            HAMMOND
          Welcome, ladies and gentlemen.  Welcome
          to an ancient and mysterious world, a
          world long before humankind inhabited it
          with all out remarkable dreams and
          questions.  Enter a world that existed
          one hundred million years ago.  When our
          changing earth was the abode of
          magnificent creations.

          Today, the late twentieth century has
          witnessed a scientific gold rush of
          astonishing proportions:  the headlong
          and furious haste to un
ravel the mystery
          of genetic engineering has become more
          than just a subject for science fiction
          writers.

ON GRANT - he whispers to Ellie.

                            GRANT
          - the furious haste to commercialize
          genetic engineering.

BACK ON HAMMOND - he warms to his subject.

                            HAMMOND
          Biotechnology promises the greatest
          revolution in human history.  It will
          outdistance atomic power and computers in
          its effects on our everyday lives.  We'll
          see square trees for easy lumbering and
          white trout for super visibility to
          fisherman.  Why it will transform every
          aspect of human life: out medical care,
          our food, our health, even our very
          entertainment.

ON GRANT - confirmed in his thinking, he whispers again.

                            GRANT
          Here we go.

BACK ON HAMMOND - he concludes.

                            HAMMOND
          
Nothing will ever be the same again.
          It's literally going to change the face
          of our planet as we know it.


MUSIC SOARS.  Hammond smiles appreciatively, removes his rose.  A screen
descends behind him.

                            HAMMOND
          ... Jurassic Park.  What we do here is
          made possible through the miracle of DNA
          replication, commonly known as cloning.
          To explain what cloning means, I'm going
          to need my own clone - John Hammond.

Another Hammond appears, projected on the screen beside the real one.

                            2ND HAMMOND
          Hi, John!

                            HAMMOND
          Hi, John.

IN THE AUDIENCE - Ellie laughs aloud.  Grant, shaking his head, smiles.

BACK ON HAMMOND - The original speaks to the clone.

                            HAMMOND
          Okay John, hold out your finger.

                            2ND HAMMOND
          Why?

                            HAMMOND
          I need some of your
 genetic material.

                            2ND HAMMOND
          Now just a minute here, John.

                            HAMMOND
          Your genetic material is the same in
          every cell of your body.  You have a
          hundred billion cells.  You won't miss a
          couple.

Hammond holds his rose to the screen the pricks his clone's finger with
a thorn.

                            2ND HAMMOND
          OW!!!  That hurt!  Hey, what's -

The clone dissolves into a cascade of blood as WE SEE a magnified view
of the bloodstream.  ANIMATION begins which illuminates the parts of the
blood and its actions.  Hammond provides voiceover for the visuals.

                            HAMMOND
          John, let's look into your blood, the
          river of life.  There's your white cells,
          exquisitely evolved to clean up bodily
          wastes.  And there's a mighty nucleus,
          the heart and brain of a cell.  This
          nucleus has an amazing property.  It can
          sp
lit in half and reproduce itself.
          That's how it grows.  And then those two
          can do it again.  And again.  Making copy
          after copy of itself.

Back to the two Hammond's.  Joined by a third, then a fourth, and so on
until the screen is crammed with Hammond's, elbowing each other for room.

                            NEW HAMMOND'S
          Hi, I'm John Hammond.  Hey, I'm John
          Hammond.  No, I am.  I am.

                            HAMMOND
          Come on, that's enough of this!  And I
          thought to reproduce myself I had to do it
          the old-fashioned way.

New mist fades out this show.  The lights go up.  Regis applauds.  Grant
joins in the laughter with Ellie and Gennaro.

Hammond jumps down from the stage and greets Gennaro and Regis.

                            HAMMOND
          That's all we've got so far.  A lot of
          fun, isn't it, Mr. Gennaro?

                            REGIS
          You bet!

Hammond greets Grant and Ellie warmly.  Then 
Hammond baits Grant.

                            HAMMOND
          It's been a long time, Alan.  I know the
          preceding was not your sort of enter-
          tainment.  Popular science -

                            GRANT
          No, I don't mind popular science.  I dislike
          the commercialization of science.  It breeds
          a sloppiness, a disregard for method.

                            HAMMOND
          Well, I don't disregard method.  But think
          of mutation - which is nothing more than
          sloppy communication on the cellular
          level.  Think how triumphant mutations
          have been in natural selection.

          Oh, but I know what you're saying.  It's
          true that I have never been afraid to make
          money with science.  I've always
          considered profit to be a measure of
          success, a barometer of public reaction.

                            GRANT
          Mr. Hammond, the essential truth of a
          scientific law ha
s nothing to do with
          public reaction.  Water freezes at
          thirty-two degrees, whether you pay for
          it or not.

Hammond turns to Gennaro.  Gennaro smiles nervously at their clash.

                            HAMMOND
          Donald, in bringing my old friend, Alan
          Grant, you've brought an excellent critic
          to observe the viability of my island and
          out venture.  I look forward to winning
          you over, Dr. Grant.

                            ELLIE
          Just what is it you're trying to clone?


EXT  A SPRAWLING LAWN - DAY

Outside, Hammond leads Gennaro, Grant and Ellie.  He points out the
staff living quarters, a group of graceful teepees.  Next to their
homes, WORKERS hang laundry and cook on grills.

They pass a large Mechanical Building.  The generator housed within is
very LOUD.  The wind increases, rippling clothes.

Suddenly, the SOUND of a speeding jeep.  Grant turns.

Racing across the rolling green landscape is A RED JEEP.  Muldoon is 
at
the steering wheel.  Two kids bounce happily around in the open jeep.
They are TIMMY, 9, and LEX, 6, brother and sister.  The jeep stops.

                            LEX
          Grandpa!

Hammond looks up, delighted.  Arms open.  Gennaro pulls him close.

                            GENNARO
              (incredulous)
          Mr. Hammond, this is a serious investiga-
          tion of the island, not a weekend
          excursion or a social outing.  We're
          talking about the safety of this place!

Hammond waves to the children.

                            HAMMOND
          I'm aware of that.  But I built this
          place for children.  You can't
          investigate it without their reactions.
          They're what this place is all about.

Hammond beams to Grant and Ellie and indicates the running kids.

                            HAMMOND
          My grandchildren.  Genetics were kind.
          They're more like my ex-wife than me.

Lex jumps right into her Grandpa's arms.  Timmy s
hyly walks up and
embraces him.  Hammond shines.  Gennaro holds in his fury.


INT  HAMMOND'S QUARTERS - DAY

Hammond ushers his guests into his own richly appointed baronial suite.
Ellie looks out a small window at the tee-pees and the contrasting
lifestyle below.  She then focuses on the high fence, circling the
perimeter of Hammond's quarters.  Above is a skylight, with metal bars.

Grant whispers to her, indicating the obviously modified window frame.

                            GRANT
          Who makes a windows ... smaller?

Timmy smacks him forehead, points to Grant.

                            TIMMY
          I know you.  You wrote my book.  Lost
          World of The Dinosaurs.  It's awesome.

                            LEX
          Timmy's got dinosaurs on the brain.

                            GRANT
          Don't worry - he'll grow out of it.

                            ELLIE
          Dr. Grant's embarrassed that his book was
          so widely successful.  He wrote if for
          gra
duate students.

Hammond smiles intensely.  But he's patient.  He stands be a huge table
covered with a sumptuous velvet drape.

                            HAMMOND
          Although Dr. Grant suspects otherwise,
          this is not an ill-conceived, half-baked,
          poorly funded plan that I've headed.
          This is a plan to which I committed all
          of my personal resources, literally
          billions of dollars.  And Donald Gennaro
          here has kindly helped me raise that sum
          again from wealthy Japanese.  They love
          theme parks.  I have recruited pre-
          eminent scientific minds from hallowed
          universities and we've taken the time to
          do things right.

Lex peeks under the cloth.  Hammond smiles at her and recovers the table.

                            HAMMOND
          Jurassic Park is the most advanced
          amusement park in the world.  We work
          with genetics - life's essential building
          blocks - to create new 
worlds.  I set out
          to make biological attractions.  Living
          attractions.  Attractions so astonishing
          that they'd capture the imagination of
          the entire world.

                            GRANT
          What exactly do you mean ... biological
          attractions?

                            HAMMOND
          As you well know, long ago, creatures ten
          times larger than whales roamed our
          adolescent Earth.  And then mass,
          mysterious extinction created a time
          barrier unscalable until ... now.

BEAT.

                            GRANT
          Yes?

                            HAMMOND
          Dinosaurs.
              (superbly proud)
          I've been cloning dinosaurs!

CAMERA PUSHES IN on Grant's incredulous face.

Hammond whips off the drape, revealing a complex and detailed scale
model of the entire resort.

                            HAMMOND
          Ladies and Gentlemen, Jurassic Park.  Not
          a resort, not a scien
tific conservatory,
          just a little piece of pre-history that
          every child in the whole wide world will
          insist on visiting.

Hammond grins with delight.

                            GENNARO
          At least every rich child.

Grant and Ellie come forward to examine the model.  The kids crowd in.

CAMERA SNORKELS through the model - revealing different enclosures with
miniature dinosaurs, moats, fences, roads, a river.

                            HAMMOND
          Apatosaurs in the lowland.  Gallimimus in
          the grassy plain.  Dilophosaurus above
          the river.  The mighty Tyrannosaurus Rex!
          238 fabulous creatures so far!

                            TIMMY
          Real dinosaurs, Grandpa?  Don't they want
          to just kill each other?

Hammond excitedly punches a button - colored display grids light up.

                            HAMMOND
          Timmy, there's electric fences and moats
          and video surveillance at all times.
          There
 are monitors every hundred feet
          whatever we could plant them on the
          island.  A computer to tabulate it all.

                            ELLIE
          You created dinosaurs?  Who gave you the
          right to do that?

                            HAMMOND
          I didn't create them.  I found a way to
          wake them up, to stir them out of their
          prehistoric slumber.

                            GRANT
          We don't have the science.  There's no
          source of dinosaur DNA.

Hammond's proud, excited face shifts to one that divulges modestly.

                            HAMMOND
          Yes ... there is.


INT  HALLWAY, UPPER FLOOR, VISITOR'S CENTER - DAY

Hammond leads Grant, Ellie, Gennaro, Timmy, and Lex out of an elevator
and down an endless corridor.  A WORKMAN ON CRUTCHES passes them.

They go through a series of security doors.  To get them open, Hammond
places his palm on a screen before each door.  Each time, it lights up
with an x-ray-like image of 
his hand and each door HISSES open.

CLOSEUP - Security x-ray. of Hammond's hand.  BEEP.  A red line writes
through the screen.  Can't get in.  Complaining, under his breath:

                            HAMMOND
          Glitches.

Hammond tries again.


INT  CONTROL ROOM - DAY

The door HISSES open, revealing an elaborate technology-crammed room.
In dim light, clusters of computer consoles and video monitors glow.

Nedry sits in a corner at a keyboard with a pile of papers next to him,
typing away.  JOHN ARNOLD, 45, park supervisor, sits directing the
activities of the park and chain-smoking.  There are large windows
looking out to the park, one of which is cracked and being replaced from
the outside by a TEAM OF WORKMEN.

Hammond wears a big smile as he leads in his entourage.  He's the
ringmaster.

                            HAMMOND
          And this is the right side of my brain.
          The entire park is safely controlled from
          here.  John Arnold, that genius over
          there, is the m
aster control operator.
              (with genuine concern)
          John, don't smoke so much, you're far too
          valuable a man to me.

                            ARNOLD
          Oh, you'd survive just fine without me.

Arnold exhales smoke and waves good-naturedly.  Nedry stares darkly at
Hammond, who ignores him.

                            HAMMOND
          Everything's controlled from here.
          Remote everything. Cars, feeding
          programs, medicine dispensers, fecal
          clean up - and that can be tons in a park
          like this.  We run this place with twenty
          workers.  This computer does it all.  And
          it polices each and every single animal
          out there.

                            ELLIE
              (whispers to Grant)
          Who polices the computer?

Hammond points up.  Overlooking the control room and the park is a
raised platform with a huge chair, like a throne in a court.  A large
video screen faces this chair.

                     
       HAMMOND
          That's where I will watch the astonished
          watchers.  Okay, let's go.

They practically race as a group to keep up with Hammond.  The security
door seals shit, leaving Nedry and Arnold alone again.

                            NEDRY
          Thanks for the kind word, Mr. Hammond.

                            ARNOLD
          Come on, Dennis, he knows your technical
          contributions have made it all possible.

                            NEDRY
          Right.


BACK ON HALLWAY -

Hammond and his group turn off the corridor and reach a door marked:
CAUTION: Teratogenic Substances.  Timmy backs off, grabs Lex's arm.

                            TIMMY
          That stuff turns you into a mutant!

He contorts his face into strange shapes.  As Hammond leads them all in
Lex pulls on his pocket.

                            HAMMOND
          Don't mind the signs.  They're only legal
          precautions.

Gennaro frowns.  The door opens and Lex peeks in.

                  
          HAMMOND
          My laboratory, Lex.  It will be yours and
          Timmy's someday.


INT  AMBER ROOM, LABORATORY - CONTINUING ACTION

Grant and Ellie share a baffled look.  Grant stares.

Grant's POV - PAN ACROSS a room filled with honey-colored glowing stones
arranged on glass shelves in large pull-out trays.  Each stone is tagged
and numbered.

Grant leans down, studying the stones.  He bumps right into Gennaro.
Lex jumps excitedly.

                            LEX
          It's ... gold!

                            TIMMY
          It's amber.  Fossilized tree sap.

                            LEX
          Grandpa found gold.

Grant shushes the kids and looks to Hammond.

                            HAMMOND
          You're both right.  Amber is our gold.
          The alpha or our alchemic alphabet.  The
          precious course of our genetic material.
          You already know amber is the fossilized
          resin of prehistoric tree sap, of course.

Grant and Ellie nod impatiently. 
 Hammond sets the scene.

                            HAMMOND
          Imagine - millions of years ago, tree sap
          flowing over insects, as it does now as I
          speak, in thousands of forests and backyard
          trees everywhere.  Imagine that ancient sap
          trapping a little struggling insect and
          consuming it in a syrupy death.  Millions
          and millions of years pass and we come
          along and discover this prehistoric insect.
          If we're lucky, he's perfectly preserved in
          a fossil form inside the hardened sap which
          is now amber.  And as we examine more and
          more amber, we find many perished insects,
          including among them, biting insects -

                            GRANT
          Like mosquitos -

                            HAMMOND
          Like mosquitos, precisely, Dr. Grant.

                            GRANT
          Mosquitos that sucked the blood of
          dinosaurs.  That's your source of DNA
        
  material?  My God!  It just might work.


INT  EXTRACTION ROOM, LABORATORY

A TECHNICIAN carefully positions a piece of amber under a fine-pointed
drill.  With a nod, the technician's goggles drop from his forehead onto
his eyes and he starts up the drill.  Hammond yells over the loud WHIRR.

                            HAMMOND
          The extraction room speaks for itself.

CLOSE ON - drillbit boring into the amber.  Orange fleck fly.

                            GRANT
          It does?

The technician shuts the drill.  Placing his hands into a mounted pair
of gloves, he operates an automated pair of needle-nose pliers to
carefully lift out the remains of a mosquito.  He drops this bug on a
slide and places this slide on a tray full of such slides.

                            LEX
          That's a million year old mosquito?

A conveyor belt starts, carrying this tray on to the NEXT TECHNICIAN.
The group follows.  This technician puts the first slide under a
microscope.  Grant watches on a video monito
r as the tech inserts a long
needle into the prehistoric bug.

                            ELLIE
          Put in a piece of amber, find a mosquito,
          drill it out.  Right?

                            HAMMOND
          Right.  You are witnessing the extraction
          of tissue from the thorax of this humble
          insect.  If this mosquito has ingested any
          foreign red blood cells - say it bit a
          hadrosaur or a stegosaurus or a T-Rex -  we
          will extract those blood cells and obtain
          paleo-DNA, the how-to-build instruction
          book of an extinct creature.
          So you see, Ellie, I'm not creating dino-
          saurs. Fossils left behind the information,
          the map of how to bring them back.  I'm
          helping them escape from the confined of
          time.

                            GRANT
          But even thousands of mosquitos wouldn't
          give you enough tissue to determine a
          complete DNA strand.

                 
           HAMMOND
          Right you are, Dr. Grant!  More like
          hundreds of thousands of mosquitos are
          necessary to provide even a partial
          strand of DNA.  And without a complete
          strand, we don't have a dinosaur.


INT  GENETICS ROOM

A LOUD HUMMING SOUND.  Along the walls are rows of waist-high stainless
steel boxes.  In the room's center are two six-foot-high round towers.
At a single console, a man studies a monitor.

DR. WU, 35, looks up from his study and beams at his guests.  He jumps
up and knocks over his cup of coffee.  ASSISTANTS clean the area as Wu
comes forward and actually hugs Grant, much to Grant's embarrassment.

                            HAMMOND
          Ah, I knew you two would hit it off!  Dr.
          Grant, this is Dr. Wu, my chief geneticist.

                            WU
          Finally, you are here!  I've been working
          without the encouragement of my peers for
          too long.  Welcome, welcome!

He kisses Ellie, who takes 
it in stride.  Gennaro, We already knows.

                            WU
          Mr. Hammond never lets me publish and
          he's interested only in results, not in
          science.

                            HAMMOND
          Don't forget to thank me when you pick up
          your Nobel prize.

Hammond and Wu resume the tour.

                            HAMMOND
          You are standing in the middle of the
          most powerful genetics factory created
          since the expulsion from Eden.

                            WU
          These are Hamachi-Hood automated gene
          sequencers, those are Cray XMP's,
          supercomputers that take DNA information
          and organize it.  In this room, we take
          fragmented or incomplete DNA strands and
          compare them to other incomplete strands.

                            HAMMOND
          It's like finding the missing pieces of a
          jigsaw puzzle.

                            WU
          The computers make sever
al trillion
          calculations to provide us with a
          complete DNA strand - the genetic code of
          an extinct animal.


INT  INCUBATION ROOM, LABORATORY

A vast room bathed in infrared light, filled with long tables.  The
first tables have rows and rows of centrifuges, each bearing dozens of
test tubes.  Wu leads the group.

                            GRANT
          Okay, you have your "complete" DNA
          strand.  How do you grow it?

                            WU
          We use unfertilized crocodile ova as our
          breeding medium.

                            HAMMOND
          Our primordial soup.

                            GRANT
          And how do you know what it is you're
          growing?

Wu shrugs.

                            WU
          Well, we have computer techniques to try
          and map out finds on an evolutionary
          basis.  But mostly, we just grow it and
          find out what it is.  If it's something
          we're interested in, and it 
survives, we
          keep it.

Grant and Ellie share a concerned look.

                            GENNARO
          And if you're not interested?

Wu indicates a cabinet of chemicals with skull-and-crossbone warnings.
Timmy regards the poison with excitement.

Lex calls from deeper in the room.

                            LEX
          Come look!

Here, plastic eggs lay on the long tables, their pale outlines obscured
by a grey mist that covers the tables.  The eggs are all gently rocking
as TECHNICIANS roam up and down the aisles.

Hammond walks ahead of the group.  As Wu speaks, Hammond listens and
enjoys it as though he's hearing it for the first time.

                            WU
          This is the incubation room.  We keep the
          temperature at ninetynine degrees and a
          relative humidity of one hundred percent.

                            GRANT AND TIMMY
          Jurassic atmosphere.

Timmy smiles at Grant.  Hammond winks at Timmy.

                            WU
          We
 also run a high oxygen concentration,
          up to thirty-three percent, so if you
          feel faint, please tell me right away.

Lex feigns a faint, Timmy cracks a small smile. They move forward,
waist-deep in the mist.  A strange green light emanates from the
incubators.  Lex is half-consumed by the mist. She mimics the witch.

                            LEX
          I'm ... melting!

Ellie laughs and pulls Lex close.

                            WU
          Reptile eggs contain large amounts of
          yolk but no water at all.  The embryos
          must extract water from the surrounding
          environment.

                            GRANT
          That's why you create the mist.

Wu nods.  Hammond just enjoys the scene as Grant and Ellie watch a
thermal sensor moving from one egg to the next, touching each with a
flexible wand, beeping.  Lex and Timmy let their hands glide over the
sides of the green glowing incubators fully awed by the strange, big
eggs they hold.

                   
         WU
          Children, please do not touch!  The eggs
          are permeable to skin oils.

Grant that very close to an egg.  He sniffs it.

                            GRANT
          What kind of eggs are these?  Are these
          shells plastic?

                            WU
          Yes, they are,  The embryos are
          mechanically inserted and then hatched in
          this room.  But we've managed to
          sufficiently mimic the actual biological
          process - these creatures rupture the
          plastic membrane that they're contained
          in when they're born.  Like real births.

They reach an endless row of incubators, lined up along the wall,
beneath a viewing area like those found in an OB-GYN ward.

                            WU
          Eggs that are determined viable spend
          their last couple days in our specially-
          designed incubators, which help
          accelerate the pre-natal developmental
          stages.  Which is interesting becaus
e
          we're having a problem with the adult
          animals -

Hammond claps a hand over Wu's mouth and laughs.

                            HAMMOND
          There's no problem Dr. Wu can't handle.
          Now who wants to see the real thing?

As they exit the CAMERA PANS the misty aisles, studying the eggs.


EXT  VISITOR'S CENTER - DAY

Blue shadows of clouds sweep across an expansive green hill in front of
the Visitor's Center.

Grant and Hammond make their way down below to the loading area for the
park tour.  A little ahead is Gennaro and Ellie.  Gennaro chatters on
while Ellie energetically explores the area, looking at the plants.

                            GENNARO
          ... so naturally, Hammond's going to
          present everything in the best light.  I
          need to know that this park is safe.

                            ELLIE
          I'll tell you something that troubles me
          from the start.  The carnivores are all
          well-fed and kept separated from their

          natural prey.  That'll keep 'em alive,
          but it won't keep 'em happy.

                            GENNARO
          How do you mean?

                            ELLIE
          The carnivores will want to hunt.  It's
          an instinct.  And that instinct will have
          to be satisfied or suppressed.

FURTHER UP THE HILL, moving slowly, Hammond eyes the pair suspiciously.

                            HAMMOND
          Gennaro is putting negative ideas into
          Ellie's head.  He's a naysayer.  I have
          no affection for that type of thinking.

                            GRANT
          Don't worry.  Ellie makes her own
          judgments.

At the base of the hill Timmy and Lex toss a baseball.


EXT  TOUR START - DAY

The group gathers.  TWO ELECTRIC CARS glide to a stop behind them.
Regis leans out of the first one.

                            REGIS
          Hey!  Great day for a tour!

                            GENNARO
          Looks like rain to me.

         
                   REGIS
          No!  I told the rain-god to hold it off
          till we got back.

The kids pile in next to Regis and explore the high-tech cars.  Timmy
finds a a pair of very think, strange-looking goggles with dials on top.

Grant, Ellie, and Gennaro climb in the second car.

                            HAMMOND
          Kids, mind Mr. Regis.  He's in charge now.

The cars begin to move and pass Hammond.  He waves.

Gennaro looks back as the cars turn into the brush.  Hammond waves.

                            HAMMOND
          Gennaro, for once in your life, let
          something really move you.

In the cruiser, Gennaro rubs his neck.  He turns to Grant.

                            GENNARO
          Ever get the feeling we're just Hammond's
          damn guinea pigs?

                            GRANT
          I like to wait and see.

Ellie motions ahead, with excitement and apprehension, to a huge gate.
Regis and the kids wave behind to Grant, Ellie and Gennaro.

The gate's doo
rs swing open and the cruisers move forward.  The kids
squeal out a YA-HOO that floats through the air to Grant.  But Grant
wears a cautious face, his skeptical eyes scan the landscape.

A FANFARE of trumpets and then a pre-recorded voice speaks from a
console in each cruiser.  Video screens display a welcome message.

                            PRE-RECORDED VOICE
          Welcome to Jurassic Park.  You are now
          entering the lost world of the
          prehistoric past, a world of mighty
          creatures long gone from the face of the
          earth, which you are privileged to see
          for the first time ...

Regis uses his walkie-talkie to contact Grant's cruiser.

                            REGIS (ON WALKIE)
          That's Richard Kiley.  We spared no
          expense.

                            PRE-RECORDED VOICE
          We'll begin our tour today with the
          herbivores ...


INT/EXT  CRUISERS, FIRST TOUR STOP - DAY

Between massive tree trunks, a spectacular view:  stor
m clouds touch
mountaintops.  Below, the lagoon ripples in pink crescents.

                            PRE-RECORDED VOICE
          ... and the grasses are a species of
          juniper, and samples can be purchased at
          the gift shop.  Now, if everyone will
          take a look to the right ...

All eyes swing that way.  Grant doesn't see a thing.  Nor do the others.

AHEAD, Timmy pulls the binoculars out of the equipment pouch and studies
the location.  Lex grabs the night goggles.  Timmy pulls them from her.

                            REGIS
          Look ...

                            LEX AND TIMMY
          I don't see anything.  Do you see
          anything?  There's nothing there.

                            REGIS
          Something's out there ...

IN THE SECOND CAR, a fly buzzes on Grant's windshield.  Grant hangs out
his window almost sniffing the air for some movement.  Nothing.

SUDDENLY the trees in front of them move!  A deep trumpeting SOUND and
TWO BRACHIOSAURS rumble away fr
om the side of the road.  The ground
SHAKES as they walk, their BELLOWING fills the air.  Led by Grant, the
passengers rise through the open top of their Land Cruisers, to look up
at the dinosaurs far above.

DROOPING FROM ABOVE, leaves and little branches shower on Grant.  Utter
amazement fills Grant's face, then his mouth breaks into a giant smile
then a laugh.  He simply can't believe his eyes. His laugh becomes
raucous and euphoric.

                            GRANT
          Ellie!  Can you imagine the excavation
          team seeing this!

Behind him, Ellie's whole person is awestruck, immobile.  Gennaro
squints, straining to make sense of this unbelievable reality.

IN THE CAR AHEAD, Lex and Timmy stare open-mouthed.  Regis looks at the
animal and then at the group's reverie.  He smiles knowingly: he's been
there, too.  He bends and whispers:

                            REGIS
          Congratulations. You're the first kids in
          the whole wide world ever to see real
          dinosaurs.

The
 kids look up at Regis with wonder in their eyes.

GRANT CAN'T stop laughing.  Still chewing, a brachiosaur cranes down to
peer at this laughing man.  The brachiosaur's huge head stops inches
away from Grant.  Grant, awestruck, stares and them -

CLOSE ON - Grant as his eyes slowly roll back and ... he faints.

The dinosaur casually moves away as Ellie comes to Grant's aid.

                            ELLIE
          Alan?  Alan?
              (sort of delighted)
          He fainted!

Gennaro waves to Regis that all is okay.  Grant slowly revives.  He
looks back at the brachiosaur, groggily, smiling away.  He looks at
Ellie and their eyes linger on each other longer than usual, sharing a
look of serene delight.

Gennaro plops back in his seat and ponders the scene before him.  A
glazed look fills his face.

                            GENNARO
          My God, we're going to make a fortune
          here!

CAMERA PUSHES IN on the majestic, gentle beauty of the Brachiosaurs.
JUNGLE SOUNDS DOMINATE, growing l
ouder and louder.


INT CONTROL ROOM - DAY

Hammond sits at his throne, happily watching the huge video screen which
displays the tour group.  He laughs raucously and calls to Arnold.

                            HAMMOND
          He fainted.  I've waited fifteen years to
          impress that young man.

                            ARNOLD
          Oh Mr. Hammond, I'm sorry to interrupt
          you, but Muldoon needs you by the pit.

                            HAMMOND
          Oh, balls.


INT/EXT  CRUISERS, SECOND TOUR STOP - DAY

The cruisers come to a stop.  In the distance, A HERD OF GALLIMIMUS
graze.  They stand on their hind legs to get at high palm trees, then
drop gracefully down on all fours to chew.  BABY GALLIMIMUS scamper
around the adults, eating leaves that drop from the larger animals.

                             PRE-RECORDED VOICE
          ... Gallimimus, known as the ostrich
          dinosaur for the shape of its shoulders,
          have a very strong nesting instinct ...

Grant do
esn't listen.  He is simply intoxicated with the pastoral beauty
of the gentle, grazing dinosaurs.  Suddenly, he looks away with a deep
concern.  Ellie looks at him questioningly.

                            GRANT
          Ellie?  What the hell are we going to do
          with the rest of our lives?

Ellie smiles at him, puzzled.

                            ELLIE
          What to you mean?

                            GRANT
          Can't you see it, Ellie?  We're the ones
          that are extinct now.


INT/EXT  CRUISERS, THIRD TOUR STOP - DAY

                            PRE-RECORDED VOICE
          ... lots more to see in the herbivore
          section of our park.  But as we come
          alongside out Jurassic jungle river to the
          left, let's try and catch a glimpse of a
          very unusual and dangerous carnivore.
          Look across the river and above ...

A lovely mossy clearing.  And to the side, bounded just by a thicket of
bushes, a precipitous drop to a tropical river, lus
h and clear.  The
river runs fast but it is narrow.  On the other side is a sharp rise.

                            PRE-RECORDED VOICE
          And there they are!

Standing on that natural pedestal and watching our tour come to a stop
are TWO DILOPHOSAURUS, man-sized dinosaurs with gills that hang around
their necks.  Grant and Ellie chime in with the pre-recorded voice.

                            ALL THREE
          Dilophosaurus!

Timmy and Lex point enthusiastically.  Regis holds them down with a
gentle but restraining arm.

                            PRE-RECORDED VOICE
          Dilophosaurus is one of the earliest
          carnivores.  Scientists once thought
          their jaw muscles were too weak to kill,
          but now, through the miracle of their
          cloning, we know Dilophosaurs spit venom,
          a poison which causes blindness and then
          unconsciousness.

Their distinctive HOOT drifts across the afternoon air.

                            GENNARO
          Poisonous d
inosaurs, there's a liability
          issue without a lot of precedent.

CLOSEUP of the nearly motionless Dilophosaurus.  One yawns wide.

                            GRANT
              (assessing)
          It's like a Gila monster of a cobra.  It's
          a poison ...

                            ELLIE
          Spitter!

The Spitters bound off as Grant watches, transfixed.  A flock of birds
burst from a tree and cross the sky.  Trees filter the light.

                            ELLIE
          Are we dreaming all this?


EXT  RAPTOR PIT - DAY

A big hole in the ground, covered with a think wire mesh.  Suddenly, a
dark claw pushes against the wire web. A SHOWER OF SPARKS.  A SCREECH
animals GROWL and SNARL.  An animal slams its face into the mesh.  SPARKS
illuminate a set of RAZOR-SHARP TEETH.

Muldoon stands next to the pit, carefully loading an assault rifle.
Hammond comes in a hurry.  Muldoon sees Hammond and puts down the rifle.
He walks to Hammond, talking before he gets there.

               
             MULDOON
          These raptors are too damn dangerous. One
          of them tunneled out this morning.  He
          ripped a boy's arm off before I could get
          a bullet in him.

                            HAMMOND
          A bullet?  Muldoon - no!  Now what?  I
          have five left?

                            MULDOON
          John, they're mean as scorpions and smart
          as chimps.  Their little fingers make
          them natural cage-breakers.  We should
          terminate the raptor program.  They're
          just too smart.  Too damn smart.

                            HAMMOND
          Oh balls.  I will not terminate the raptors
          just because they're behaving normally.
          They're hunters.  Why can't we contain them
          properly?

Hammond starts to walk away.  Muldoon follows, he's not finished at all.

                            MULDOON
          John, remember back in '88, when we
          started to build the containment devices?
         
 We ordered cattle prods, tasers, guns
          that blow out electric nets.  They're all
          too slow for these guys. If we're going
          to keep the raptors, I want TOW missiles
          and laser-guided devices.

Hammond laughs warmly.  He pats Muldoon on the back.

                            HAMMOND
          It's just a zoo, Muldoon.  A zoo.  Figure
          out a way to contain them.  And we'll sit
          down and have a nice long discussion about
          raptors - after my guests leave, okay?

Hammond walks away.  Muldoon stares after him, jingling keys in his
hand.  Muldoon lumps over to A WORKER.

                            MULDOON
          Okay!  Get a 'dozer, start digging round
          the pit.  We're gonna bury some fence.
          And wear your rifle when you're working!


INT  CONTROL ROOM - AFTERNOON

Hammond enters and crosses to his throne.  Hammond swivels to Arnold who
exhales smoke.  Nedry looks over, keeps typing.

                            HAMMOND
          Wh
ere are they?  Punch 'em up.

                            ARNOLD
          They'll be by the trike's in a moment.
          Trike's sick again.

                            HAMMOND
          How can you say it so matter-of-factly?
          The trike's.  You casually accept it, but
          I never can.  You know what it means when
          you say "by the trikes"?  "By the
          trike's" means that they're out there by
          the species:  triceratops horridus.  It
          astounds me every time what I've done
          here.  What magic, what alchemy.  We
          turned a piece of a rock into a dinosaur.
          I will never be complacent about that.

Arnold smiles and punches a button.  WE HEAR the pre-recorded tour voice
and some chatter of the kids.

EAVESDROPPING on the tour IS INTERRUPTED by a radio transmission to the
control room.  Arnold slides over and shuts off the tour monitoring.
The picture on the video screen is now of a cargo boat at a dock.

                            RADIO
 
         Hello, John.  This is the Anne B at the
          dock.  I'm looking at the storm patterns
          just south of us.  Requesting permission
          to leave before unloading the last three
          food containers.

Nedry looks up quickly, listening carefully.

                            RADIO
          Don't want to be stuck here if this chop
          gets much worse.

Hammond reacts with quiet dismay.  Nedry quietly gets up.

                            NEDRY
          Coffee anyone?

He's ignored.  Arnold defers to Hammond who leans to the microphone.

                            HAMMOND
          Hello skipper, John Hammond, how are you
          tonight?  I certainly don't want to
          imperil anyone.  But can you give us one
          more container of food?  Then we'll feel
          comfortable is the storm delays your
          return.  Could you help us out here?  Of
          course, if it looks too choppy just go,
          but you'd be doing us a big favor.

                 
           RADIO
          Well ... we'll do our best, sir.  We'll
          get one more container off. How's that?

Hammond thanks him and signs off.  Arnold looks at the darkening clouds.


INT/EXT  CRUISERS, FOURTH TOUR STOP - LATE AFTERNOON

The cars twist through dense vegetation with a GRINDING of gears.  The
first car comes to a jerky stop.

There is a huge TRICERATOPS lying on its side, moving very slowly,
breathing laboriously.  HARDING, the tall, balding park vet, kneels on
the ground.  He peers into the animal's mouth with a large flashlight.

Before the second car can stop completely, Grant leaps out, races to the
trike.  Regis tries to restrain the kids but they chase Grant and Ellie.

Grant joins Harding on the ground.  The trike lets out a low MOAN.
She's too sick to move.  Ellie and Lex squat by the animal.

                            LEX
          I feel so sorry for her.  She's so sick.

                            VET
          We don't know what's wrong with Freda.
          Every six we
eks she gets like this.

                            REGIS
          Oh, she'll be up and around in no time.
          After a big night, I feel the same way.

Grant very gently opens the Trike's mouth.

                            GRANT
          Poor girl.  What's the matter?  Ellie,
          look at this.

A dark purple tongue droops limply from her mouth.  Ellie shines the
light on it, illuminating silvery blisters.  Gennaro turns away.

                            ELLIE
          Microvesicles.  Interesting.

Grant scratches one of the blisters with his ball-point pen.  It oozes.
The kids share a grossed-out look.

                            LEX
          Doesn't she have a mommy and a daddy?

                            HARDING
          We make these dinosaurs in the lab,
          sweetheart.  But they do form attachments.
          Freda has a little one that follows her
          around, thinks Freda's his mom.

Grant starts to look around.

                            ELLIE
          What does sh
e eat?  Where does she feed?

                            HARDING
          Animal this size takes in a minimum of
          six hundred pounds of plants a day.  We
          truck in hay and meadow grasses seven
          times a day.  That's all she touches.

Grant studies the nearby grass and bushes.  Timmy quietly follows Grant.

Ellie lifts a huge eyelid on the triceratops.  A runny eye just stares.

Grant comes up triumphantly with a bouquet of weeds clutched in his
hand.  These weeds have little purple berries.  Ellie looks over.

                            ELLIE
          West Indian Lilacs!

                            GRANT
          These'd give anybody a stomachache.

                            HARDING
          I'm telling you, the animals don't eat
          don't eat that stuff.

Regis keeps a babysitter's eye on the kids.  Timmy comes up with a
handful of smooth stones.  He approaches Grant shyly.

                            TIMMY
          Dr. Grant, sir?  How 'bout these?
          There'
s lots of little piles of these?

Grant fingers one distractedly, then suddenly comes to attention.

                            GRANT
          Hey, Ellie take a look at his.  Good
          work, Timmy.

Ellie gets up, brushes herself off, comes over and examines the stone.

                            ELLIE
          Extremely smooth.  Purple stains, could
          be those lilac berries.

She and Grant smile and each other and nod.  Gennaro is curious.

                            HARDING
          I don't get it.

                            GRANT
          Looks like your trike swallows stones to
          help her digest her food.  Walking
          around, she crushes berries against the
          stones.  And even just a little crushed
          berry is eventually enough,

                            ELLIE
          So, she poisons herself periodically.

                            HARDING
          Bet we tested her saliva for any trace of -

                            GRANT
          But with th
e stones, she swallows them
          and probably bypasses any mucosal
          contact.  Straight to the stomach.  I
          would test her excrement.

                            LEX
          Yo, yuk!

A light RAIN begins.  Automatically, with a soft hiss, the glass roofs
of the cruisers slide shit.  Gennaro taps Regis and indicates the cars.

                            GENNARO
          Hey Regis, where are your rain gods?
          It's gonna pour.  Let's finish our tour.

Grant agrees, heads for the cruisers.  He turns and looks for Ellie.
Ellie stands by the Trike.  She gives Grant a meaningful look.

                            ELLIE
          I'm staying.

Grant smiles at her decision.

                            GRANT
          Soil samples?

                            ELLIE
          You read my mind.
              (confidentially)
          I think she's sicker then they're saying.
          Her skin is dry and flaky.  And her gums
          are pale.  I'm going to talk to Dr. Wu.

        
                    GRANT
          Good idea.  I'll keep my eyes open.

Gennaro climbs in with Grant.  The two cruisers start off and Timmy
turns backward to stare wistfully at Grant.  Regis and Lex wave to the
Trike.  Grant looks back to Ellie who has already begun to work.

ON TRIKE - a mosquito lands on its back.  The trike's tail slaps it dead.


INT  MACHINE ROOM - LATE AFTERNOON

With difficulty, Nedry shoves his large body down the crawl space behind
a large rack of electronic equipment.  He stops and uses a suction cup
device to lift a section of the tiled floor.  He gropes among cables and
pulls out a small wireless radio.  He transmits:

                            NEDRY (INTO RADIO)
          Jim, what the hell's with you  ... I know
          a storm's coming, I can't ... it's all so
          tightly planned ... that's not enough ...
          ok, twenty minutes, I'll be there.  Damn!

Nedry returns the radio to its hiding place.  He sucks in his gut to
make the crawl out of  the narrow space.


INT/EXT  CRUISERS, T-REX FEEDING AREA - DUSK

The cruisers stop on the rise of a hill.  They over look a forested area,
sloping down to the edge of the lagoon.

                            TOUR
          The mighty T-Rex arose late in dinosaur
          history.  Dinosaurs ruled the earth for a
          hundred and twenty million years, but
          there were tyrannosaurs for only the last
          fifteen million years of that period ...

Farther south, they see the graceful necks of the brachiosaurs standing
at the water's edge.  Their bodies, mirrored in the moving surface,
break apart with the continuing drops of rain.  Hear lightning rhythmic-
ally pulses the sky.  All is quiet except for the soft drone of cicadas
and the tapping of light rain.

Regis calls Grant on the walkie-talkie.

                            REGIS (TO WALKIE)
          You know, Dr. Grant, Hammond likes to
          come here in the evening and just sit.

                            GRANT (OVER WALKIE)
          Where is the T-
Rex?

                            REGIS (TO WALKIE)
          Good question.

ON GRANT - as he takes that in, nodding to himself. Studies the land.

                            GRANT
          Maybe she's down hunting apatosaurs.

OVER WALKIE - Regis laughs, his voice tinny over the radio.

                            REGIS (OVER WALKIE)
          Would if she could, believe me.  Some-
          times she stands by the lagoon and stares
          at those animals, and wiggles those
          little forearms of hers in frustration.
          But the T-Rex territory is completely
          enclosed with trenches and fences.
          Believe me, she can't go anywhere.

                            GRANT
          Then where is she?

They hear A SOFT BLEATING.  In the center of the field, a small cage
rises into view, lifted on hydraulics from underground.  The cage bars
slide down.  A GOAT remains tethered in the field, BLEATING plaintively.

The tour group stares out their windows, expectantly.


BACK ON CONTRO
L ROOM -

Hammond, pleased, watches the giant screen that displays the tour group.
Muldoon limps into the control room.  Arnold looks over.

                            MULDOON
          Just checking in.  Everything ok?

                            HAMMOND
          Look at them.  Leaning out the windows,
          so eager.  They can't wait to see it.
          They have come for the danger.

                            MULDOON
          That's what I'm afraid of.

Muldoon twirls the keys on his fingers and watches the land cruisers.


BACK ON CRUISERS, T-REX FEEDING AREA -

Grant watches quietly.

The BLEATING becomes louder, more insistent.  The goat tugs frantically
at its tether, racing back and forth, kicking.

                            LEX
          What's going to happen to the goat?  Is
          the T-Rex gonna come eat the goat?

Grant senses something.  He sits straight up.  Looks out intently.

                            GRANT
          He's here.

The goat is tethered in the middle of the fi
eld, thirty yards from the
nearest tree.  Grant scans the tree for the T-Rex.

The goat senses something too.  It struggles and strains, bleating
frantically.  Suddenly the mechanical SOUND of the cage coming up.  Its
bars surround the goat with safety once again.

                            REGIS
          Looks like the Rex will have its snack a
          little later today.

                            RECORDED VOICE
          The sensors don't see the Rex around.
          She usually comes within five minutes of
          hearing dinner. If she doesn't, that
          means she's sleeping - we might have
          access to her at the picnic area.

Lex and Timmy let out a sigh of relief.  The tension is gone.

                            LEX
          I didn't want to see him get eaten.  I
          liked the goat.


BACK IN THE CONTROL ROOM -

Hammond studies the large video monitor.  He watches Grant and Gennaro.
Their voices are heard in the control room.

                            GENNARO (MONITOR
ED)
          What is a carnivore got out?

                            GRANT (MONITORED)
          There'd be no stopping it.  Huge, with no
          natural enemies, and a suppressed hunting
          instinct.

Hammond glares.  Arnold, aware, shuts off the screen.

                            HAMMOND
          Damn those people.  They are so negative.

                            ARNOLD
          It's natural.  They can't fully
          appreciate that we've engineered the
          animals and the park for total safety.

                            HAMMOND
          They comb this island like a bunch of
          accountants.  They don't experience the
          wonder, the awe of it all.

                            ARNOLD
          You can't make people experience wonder.

Hammond gets up and stands before the big windows overlooking the park.
The quartz FLOODLIGHTS outside their area COME ON with a rosy glow and
the dark jungle is opened again to their inspection.

At his console, Nedry looks at Hamm
ond.  Hammond stares out the window.
The RAIN PICKS UP and bounces off the window.  Hammond speaks to Arnold
without turning.

                            HAMMOND
          It's like the Garden of Eden out there.
          This is the most beautiful time of day.

                            ARNOLD
          Better rout the tour back.  They can
          start again sun-up tomorrow morning.

                            HAMMOND
          Yup.  Call the kitchen.  Those kids'll be
          hungry when they get in.

Arnold picks up the phone.  STATIC.  He glances over at Nedry.

                            NEDRY
          Sorry 'bout that.  I've taken all the
          lines to upload some data.

Hammond's annoyed, but contains it.  Arnold looks at Nedry, who smiles.

                            NEDRY
          I'll clear a couple of lines for you at
          the end of the next transmission, sir.
          Here you go now, this will make it all
          better, Mr. Hammond.

Nedry punches in a code.

CLOSE ON 
- Nedry's fat finger punching a last key.

CLOSE ON - amber video display terminal as a countdown begins.

As the screen counts down from ten to zero, Nedry peers at Hammond with
a steely glint in his eyes.

BACK ON SCREEN - three, two, one, the countdown hits zero.

Nedry's data-filled screen blinks off.  Nedry looks up to the rack of
monitors.  Unnoticed by Hammond or Arnold two more monitors go blank.
Then a third one.


BACK  ON CRUISERS, REST AREA - NIGHT

The electric cars turn up into a scenic area high above the rest of the
park.  HUGE QUARTZ LIGHTS REVEAL a dramatic view down to the ocean.
There the supply ship, the ANNE B, unloads its last crates.

RAIN INCREASES.  On the other side of the road are picnic tables, an
unfinished snack bar and rest rooms.  To the side of this rest area is a
view of the interior of the island.  A guard-rail separates visitors

To the other side of the rest area is a concrete moat and in the back of
this is a tall, electrified fence.  Surrounding the electric fence is a

smaller protective fence.

                            PRE-RECORDED VOICE
          ... enjoy a healthy snack.  This is also
          a good time to ...

                            LEX
          Hey, is that bathroom working?

                            REGIS
          Sure.
              (he uses his walkie)
          Rest stop.

The kids take off towards the bathroom, running through the rain.  Grant
gets out of his cruiser, strides to Regis.  He indicates the fence.

                            GRANT
          Is that still the T-Rex paddock?

                            REGIS
          Yes.  But she never comes here.  I don't
          know why not.  Probably too much
          construction.

GENNARO, jacket over his head against the rain, looks down to the ocean.

GENNARO'S POV - THE ANNE B UNLOADS he last cargo crate.

GRANT LOOKS at the concrete moat.  Studies its deep curve.  He looks up
at the tell electrical fence with its 10,000 volt warning.  He sees
conventional power lines on the opposite sid
e of the road.

CAMERA EXAMINES the empty cruisers.  Inside, the pre-recorded voice is
chatting on.  It slows eerily and stops.  Video SCREENS BLINK OUT.


BACK ON CONTROL ROOM -

Nedry yawns loudly.

                            NEDRY
          Yup!  Looks like a never-ending weekend
          for me.  I'm gonna get a Diet Coke.
          Don't touch my console, ok?  Line will
          be clear in five minutes.

Nedry leaves.  Hammond swings around and growls under his breath.

                            HAMMOND
          Slob!

                            ARNOLD
          Well, at least he knows what he's doing.


INT  UPPER FLOOR, VISITOR'S CENTER - NIGHT

Nedry races through the series of security doors.  He ignores the
security x-ray device and just SHOVES each door open with his hand.


BACK ON CRUISERS, REST AREA -

THE QUARTZ LIGHTS GO OUT, leaving the group in shadowy darkness and now
STEADY RAIN.  There's a ripple of surprise from the group.  Regis rounds
them all up and directs them back into the 
cruisers.

                            REGIS
          Everything's just fine.  It's a temporary
          glitch due to the rain.  No doubt,
          they're going to re-rout some circuits
          back at the mainframe.  We'll have the
          power back on in moments.  Let's get back
          in the cruisers, they may start up, and
          I'd like us all to be seated in them.

The cruisers are STILL.  IN THE REAR CRUISER, Gennaro turns to Grant.

                            GENNARO
          I knew we shouldn't have kids here.

A vivid FLASH of LIGHTNING.  IN THE FIRST CAR:  Lex covers her eyes.
Then she looks up at Regis with a frightful face.

                            LEX
          Mr. Regis, are dinosaurs ... nocturnal?

                            REGIS
          No, darling, of course not.

                            LEX
          Mr. Regis?  What's ... nocturnal?

Another LIGHTNING FLASH.  Lex cries.  Regis comforts her.

                            REGIS
          Don't you worry about d
inosaurs.  They're
          all very safe in their paddocks just like
          animals in a big, strong zoo.  They're not
          going anywhere we don't tell them to go.

Timmy looks out the window excitedly.


INT  INCUBATION ROOM, LABORATORY - NIGHT

All those eggs on tables.  No moving sensors.  Nedry pulls a portable
incubator away from the dozens lined up against the wall.  Its
electrical cord goes flying.  Furiously, Nedry fills the incubator with
eggs, one after the other.

                            NEDRY
          Okay, little ones!  Here we go!

Nedry grabs the handles of the incubator and runs with it.  The
incubator careens on one wheel as he turns the corner and exits.


BACK ON CONTROL ROOM -

Hammond looks out the large window as the LIGHTS EXTINGUISH.  He twirls.

                            HAMMOND
          What's going on, Arnold?  I want those
          lights on.  I don't want my grandchildren
          scared.

                            ARNOLD
          Jesus, the computer's gone
 down.

                            HAMMOND
          Well, I want the computer up.  This is
          the wrong weekend for glitches.

Arnold still examines his console.  He looks out with worry.

                            ARNOLD
          That's not the worst of it.

                            HAMMOND
          Oh yeah?  Please tell me what's worse
          than the lights going out?

Wu smashes through the door.

                            WU
          All the security doors are open.  Someone
          has been in my laboratory and the eggs
          have been disturbed.

The camera pushes in on Hammond's face.

                            HAMMOND
          Where the hell is Nedry?  Where is he?
          Did anybody check the damn john?

Hammond storms out.


INT  CORRIDOR, VISITOR'S CENTER - CONTINUING ACTION

Hammond enters the hall.  Muldoon, racing from the other direction, yells:

                            MULDOON
          John, the generator's shut down.  Who cut
          the power?

     
                       HAMMOND
          Arnold's on it.  You go out and bring
          back the tour right away.  I don't need
          any of this!

Muldoon is already running back the way he came.


INT  GARAGE - NIGHT

Several electric land cruisers are stored in this shadowy room.  There
is a glassed-in area where Muldoon's weapons are stored:  assault
rifles, tasers, tear gas canisters.

To the side of the garage s Muldoon's red jeep.  In the passenger side
of the front seat is a rocket launcher.

Nedry storms in, wheeling his incubator.  He stop suddenly and listens.
Approaching FOOTSTEPS.

                            NEDRY
          Oh, shit!


INT  BASEMENT STAIRS, VISITOR'S CENTER -

Muldoon runs down a long corridor, stop with a skid and yanks open the
door to the garage.  He runs out.  His boots RESOUND on the concrete.

BACK ON - NEDRY'S PANICKED FACE as he listens to the footsteps.
Wheezing, with great difficulty, Nedry bends his knees and strains.  With
everything he's got, he lifts the incub
ator waist-height.  And holds it.

BACK ON MULDOON - Muldoon's footsteps ECHO as they come closer and closer
to the garage.  Muldoon whips down the curve in the stairs.  His jacket
catches on an incomplete section of banister. Yanks him to a stop.

CLOSE ON - Muldoon's jacket as it RIPS, stays caught.

BACK ON - NEDRY as he tries to heave higher, can't.  Beads a sweat roll
down his brow.

MULDOON FREES HIS caught jacket and then keep going.

Nedry's face drips with sweat.  The incubator slips out of his sweaty
palms.  Catches it with his knee.  Nedry curses and with one forceful
boost, he lifts the incubator shoulder height.

CLOSE ON - Muldoon's feet on long stairwell. BOOM. BOOM. BOOM.

NERVOUS, NEDRY BREATHES in a labored fashion.  He looks this way and
that.  He closes his eyes and with one superhuman effort, he heaves the
incubator into the back seat of the red jeep.  Nedry exhales.

At that moment, MULDOON ENTERS the vestibule between stairs and garage.

NEDRY EYES the shadowy figure in the vestibule.  
Nedry's frightened face.

MULDOON STOPS and reaches in his belt.  He pulls out his pistol.  He
takes out long, shiny cartridges.  He loads the pistol.

NEDRY LEAPS in the front of the jeep, pushing aside the rocket launcher,
and zooms into the night.

A moment later, Muldoon enters the garage.  He sniffs at the exhaust
that still hangs in the air.  He looks over and is surprised to see his
jeep gone.  He bends and inspects fresh tread marks. He looks up, his
face straining to understand.


EXT  PARK ROAD - NIGHT

Nedry's red jeep flies down the park road.

CLOSE ON - Nedry's wheel as he turns it.

His tires skid sideways, then regain traction.  The jeep bolts up a
smaller access road.  He skids to a stop at the top of the hill.

Nedry jumps out and looks up.  His high beams illuminate a huge electric
fence prominently labeled:  DANGER!  10,000 Volts!

Two safety fences separate Nedry from the electric fence.  He races to
the first one, pulls out a key chain.  He tries one key, then another,
and another.  It f
its.  Nedry unlocks the gate, swings open the door.

Nedry runs to the second gate.  He slips in the mud.  He slides to the
ground, dropping keys in a muddy pool.

CLOSE ON - Nedry's hand frantically fishing for the key chain in the
muddy water.  Got them!   Unlocks the second gate.

He races to the electric fence.  RAIN PELTS him now.  Water beads on his
face.  Lightning flashes on the 10,000 volts warning.

He grabs the gate with his bare hand and swings it open.

Nedry heads back to his jeep, his fat body strobed by its high beams.
He jumps in the jeep and drives through.  Behind him, the open gates
move recklessly in the stormy night.


BACK ON GARAGE

Ellie and Harding pull in, in their own gas-powered jeep.  Muldoon is
waiting for them.  Now there's a rifle slung over his shoulder.  Harding
jumps out of the jeep.

                            MULDOON
          Get out, get out!  I need this jeep.
          There's a problem with the tour.  Ellie,
          Hammond'll fill you in.

Ellie is concerned, the
n decisive.

                            ELLIE
          No!  I'm going with you, Muldoon.

They race out.


EXT  DOCK - NIGHT

Headlights blazing in the darkness, Nedry's jeep skids to a stop by the
dock where the ANNE B is preparing to leave.  The water is very choppy.

Nedry jumps out and pulls his incubator to the ground.  He begins to
drag it through the mud, toward the ship.  CAPTAIN FARRELL comes to meet
him, along with A COUPLE MEN, who hoist the incubator easily and carry
it toward the ship.

                            CAPTAIN FARRELL
          Good.  Glad to see you.  Were you seen?

                            NEDRY
          Nah.  I'm back in five minutes, they'll
          never know I was gone.
              (yells after the men with the incubator)
          Careful with that thing!  It's worth more
          than the ship.
              (to the Captain)
          When's the copter meeting you?

                            CAPTAIN FARRELL
          It's not.  The storm's coast-to-coast,
       
   nobody could land on the water.

                            NEDRY
              (totally panicked)
          Shit!  What's the backup?  I don't like
          this.  Maybe we should do it another time,
          I don't like it.  I just don't like -

                            CAPTAIN FARRELL
          Shhh!  I wired Baker, he'll have a man at
          the dock in Puntaremas.  We should be
          able to make that in time.

                            NEDRY
              (somewhat relieved)
          Ten hours?

                            CAPTAIN FARRELL
          Yeah, now relax.  I got a lot riding on
          this too, you know.  No one's going to
          mess up now.  Baker's not going to mess
          up.  His people won't let him.

                            NEDRY
          Ok.  Ok.  Here.

Nedry pulls an aerosol can out of the baggy crotch of his pants.

                            NEDRY
          Look, this is insulating spray.

CLOSE ON - Nedry sprays a big mound of white foam into his
 hand,

                            NEDRY
          In about eight hours, spray down all the
          eggs with this stuff.  It'll keep 'em
          warm but not too warm.  I hope Baker has
          it together with the dock.


BACK ON CRUISERS, REST AREA -

Rain drums down on the cruiser.  Timmy stares out at the dark.  Lex
stares nervously out the side window.  Timmy picks up the night goggles
and snaps them on.

                            TIMMY
          Hey, these thing work great.  I can see
          in the dark and I can see far.

He swivels away from the T-Rex paddock and looks out toward the ocean.
He reaches up and adjusts the knob.

                            TIMMY
          Hey!  I wonder if that boat's still
          there?  It is. I think they're getting
          ready to go.

TIM'S POV - the fluorescent green image of men untying casting lines on
the boat.

Another LIGHTNING FLASH and Lex SCREAMS and covers her face.  She cries.

                            REGIS
          Timmy, can you
 give her the goggles?

Lex clamps her hands over her eyes.  Timmy gently nudges her.

                            TIMMY
          Want to look at the boat, Lex?

Timmy hands her the night goggles. Lex dries her eyes and takes a peek
with the goggles toward the ocean.

                            LEX
          Hey, that fat guy's down there. Is he
          gonna come get us and take us to Grandpa?

LEX'S POV - the picture streaks but clearly reveals Nedry shouting at
the Captain.  Men heave the incubator onto the ship.

                            LEX
          They have one of those things from the
          room with all the eggs - you know, where
          they help the baby eggs grow up.

                            TIMMY
          You mean an incubator?

                            GRANT (ON WALKIE)
          What's the commotion?

                            REGIS
          Let me see.  Give them to men, sweetheart.

                            TIMMY (TO WALKIE)
          Uh, Dr. Grant?

REGIS GRABS th
e walkie talkie and tries to silence Timmy.  He knows he
gets there too late and reluctantly lets Timmy have it back.

                            TIMMY
          We saw that computer guy helping 'em load
          an incubator onto the ship.

                            LEX (TO WALKIE)
          Yeah, he's stealing them, Dr. Grant!
          He's stealing my Grandpa's eggs!

                            GRANT (ON WALKIE)
          Nedry?  With an incubator?  Regis??

                            REGIS (TO WALKIE)
              (finally acknowledges)
          That's what they saw.

ON GRANT - He looks sharply at Gennaro.

                            GRANT (TO WALKIE)
          We gotta tell Hammond and Arnold right
          away.  How far is it to the mainland?

ON TIMMY - He looks at Regis.

                            REGIS (TO WALKIE)
          Uh, it's a hundred miles to Puntaremas.
          About a sixteen hour voyage in this
          weather.

ON GRANT - He fiddles with the radio in his cruiser.  No r
esponse still.

                            GRANT
          I wouldn't like to see dinosaurs running
          around Costa Rica.

                            GENNARO
          When's the damn power coming on?


INT/EXT MULDOON'S JEEP, OTHER BACK ROADS

Muldoon and Ellie drive into the storm.  Suddenly, he slams on his
brakes.  In front of him, a tree has fallen, completely blocking the
road.  Muldoon curses, swerves around, and skids to a stop.

As Muldoon gets out and assesses the situation, Ellie lodges herself
between the tree and the jeep.  She pushes the tree with her strong legs
and moves it a good five feet. Quickly, Muldoon and Ellie drag the tree.
As they struggle.

                            MULDOON
          Strong legs.

                            ELLIE
          Lot of track in college.


BACK ON CRUISERS, REST AREA -

IN THE FIRST CAR, Regis drums his fingers on the dashboard.  Timmy wears
his goggles and stares into the rain.  Lex shifts her body around,
trying to get comfortable to rest.

 
                           LEX
          I'm hungry.  When can we get going?

                            REGIS
          When the electricity comes back on,
          honey.  These cars run on electric cables
          buried in the road.

IN THE SECOND CAR, Grant tries the radio to no avail.  Gennaro smokes.
Grant looks forward toward the first cruiser.  He can barely make out
the car in the dark and rain.  Occasionally, LIGHTNING reveals all.

TIMMY PULLS GUM out of his pocket.  Feels a tiny shake, looks around.
He puts it in his mouth, chewing quietly.  SUDDENLY, the whole car
VIBRATES.  Regis' sunglasses jump off the dashboard and fall to the
floor.  The kids look at him.

                            REGIS
          Must be turning on the electricity.

Lex sits up, looks around groggily.

                            LEX
          Feels like a vibration.


INT  T-REX PADDOCK - NIGHT

The T-Rex's huge hind feet crash down, one large foot following after
the other in long, powerful strides.


BACK ON CRUISE
RS, REST AREA - FIRST CRUISER

There is a thud, and then a THUD, and then a THUD.   Tim and Lex share a
frightened look.  Now the thud grows LOUDER.  There is a CRASHING SOUND,
the whole cruiser SHAKES.  Then silence.  Then another SHAKE.

CAMERA PUSHES IN TILL CLOSE - Timmy stares out with his night goggles.

TIM'S NIGHTSCOPE POV IN CLOSE - T-Rex paws rest on the electric fence.

Tim takes off his goggles, stares, transfixed.  Regis picks them up.

EXTREME CLOSEUP - of muscular forepaws with pebbled, grainy skin and
thick, curved nails comfortably gripping a thick wire strand.

The T-Rex moves his body forward of the brush, pushes against the fence.


IN THE SECOND CRUISER -

Grant and Gennaro stare out, unseeing in the rain and darkness.


CLOSE ON LEX -

Tears roll down her cheek.  She cries silently with an unknown fear.
Regis pulls the goggles from his eyes, starts to gag, checks it.

                            REGIS
          Jesus Christ.

                            LEX
          Bad language.

     
                       REGIS
          Jesus Christ.  The fence isn't
          electrified.

                            LEX
          Is that bad?

Regis turns, looks out the side window, away from the T-Rex.

Regis is shaking uncontrollably.  Suddenly he throws open his door and
bolts off into the rain, leaving the door open.  No move from the Rex.

Regis races by the second cruiser.  Grant stares out at him.

                            TIM
          Mr. Regis!  Mr. Regis, where are you
          going?

                            LEX
          He just left us.  He just left us all
          alone.  Timmy, Timmy how could he do
          that?  We're all alone!  We're all alone!

FLASH OF LIGHTNING.  FLASH.  The Rex butts his head.

TIM'S POV - The fence bangs down on top of his cruiser.

Timmy and Lex recoil from the scrape  of the wire mesh against the car.


IN THE SECOND CRUISER -

GRANT AND GENNARO'S POV - through the almost obscuring rain they see the
fallen fence.  An unseen weight pulls on it fur
ther, causing its
electric wire to pop like over-tuned guitar strings.


TIMMY REACHES -

out into the rain for the open door handle.

Another LIGHTNING FLASH and the creature is revealed standing between
the two cruisers, atop the crushed fence.  His head turns back and
forth, he's deciding on his prey.  Grant and Gennaro or Tim and Lex?

Timmy slams the door shut.  He looks directly at the Rex, just a few
feet away.  The Rex turns to him, stares back.

Lex SCREAMS and Timmy claps a hand over her mouth.

There is a whisper over Tim's walkie-talkie.

                            GRANT (ON WALKIE)
          Timmy, be quiet. Don't move.


BACK ON GRANT -

He snaps off the walkie-talkie.

HIS POV - The rain runs in rivulets down the pebbled skin of the
muscular hind legs.  The animal's head is out-of-view, above the
rooftops of the cars.  The Rex lifts its huge hind leg.

                            GENNARO
          Holy shit!  Any suggestions what we do
          now?

                            GRANT
        
  Can't think of a thing.

The T-Rex slowly circles Grant's cruiser.


BACK ON TIM -

He watches the beast move.


BACK ON GRANT AND GENNARO -

As they twist and turn, trying to find a circling Rex in dark and rain.
The Rex pauses right next to Gennaro's window.  He lowers his head,
looking for movement inside.

CLOSE ON - the beady, expressionless reptilian eye moving in the socket.

Grant whispers, hardly moving his lips.

                            GRANT
          Don't move.

Gennaro's leg trembles uncontrollably.


IN THE FIRST CRUISER -

Very frightened, Lex discovers a flashlight.  She flicks it on and off,
distracting herself.  The beam shows her eyes full of a quiet panic.

                            LEX
          It's too, too dark out there.

Tim waves his hands in caution.


BACK ON GRANT, GENNARO, AND THE REX -

The Rex bends down, bumps the windshield with his nose.  Just stays
there, breathing heavily.  In the distance, the flashlight goes on
again.  The Rex raises his head suddenly.  Grant g
rabs his walkie.

                            GRANT (TO THE WALKIE)
          Shut that flashlight, Tim!

As the Rex heads off, a casual swipe of his tail SMASHES the side of the
cruiser, throwing Grant and Gennaro across the inside of the car.


ON TIM -

He lunges for the flashlight.  Lex dodges him, keeps it lit.

                            LEX
          No, it's mine.  Please, I need it.

Tim looks up through the sun roof.  The massive head of the
Tyrannosaurus Rex appears.  Tim watches, transfixed.  Lex looks up.
Irrational with terror, she aims her flashlight like a gun.  Blasts him.
Her flashlight beam cuts through the dark and rain - she sees the beast
plainly for the first time and SCREAMS!

The POOL OF LIGHT bathes the Rex's face.  He smashes his head down onto
the Plexiglass bubble.  It crunches, and falls into the car, crushing
the children.  Tim uses his feet to push it to the side.

Above, the Rex displays is gaping maw, drooling toward the opening.


GRANT -

watches the Rex raise his mighty h
ead again, above the kids' cruiser.


TIMMY AND LEX -

have a half-instant of relief.  Then SLAM.  The Rex butts his head
against the cruiser.  The Rex comes back down, tries to discover his
prey inside the cruiser.  Pushes his head close to the glass, looking.

The dinosaur stands in front of the cruiser, his whole chest heaving,
his forelimbs pawing the air.

Timmy whispers to Lex.

                            TIMMY
          Are you ok?  Be quiet and don't move.

Lex barely nods and grabs Timmy's hand.

The Tyrannosaur places his head next to the car.  He begins to shove the
cruiser with his head.  The cruiser ROCKS.  The back window bursts,
shards go flying.

Inside, the kids are THROWN back and forth, SHOVED against each other,
and finally FLUNG against the top of the car as the cruiser FLIPS.

The whole world TILTS CRAZILY - trunks of palm trees slide by, the
ground above, the blazing eye of the rex, the tops of palm trees.

The cruiser SLAMS DOWN on its side, the windows splat in the mud.  Lex
falls he
lplessly against the side window and lies motionless.  Timmy
falls beside her, banging his head.  He reaches for Lex.

                            TIMMY
              (softly)
          Lex?  Lex?

SILENCE.  No movement from Lex.

THE ANIMAL toys with the cruiser.  Like a dog with its bone, the
dinosaur pushes the cruiser along with his head.  He pushes it past the
picnic tables toward the ripped fence and the embankment.  Each shove
sends the children flying again.

The cruiser is pushes closer and closer to the unprotected embankment.
The cruiser slams to a stop completely upside-down.  The T-Rex steps
right on the cruiser, crushing the roof against the ground.

INSIDE - the children crawl for their lives as the car crushes further
down from above and a tidal wave of mud oozes in from the sides.

THE REX - gnaws at the car, grabs a tire with his teeth,  It ruptures
with a pitiful pop.  The Rex grabs at the axle with his teeth, begins to
drag the car back.  THe kids, half-outside, are pulled with the car.



GRANT DANCES -

with a flare!  The Rex is distracted.

CLOSE ON - the Rex as he ROARS.  The flare gleams in his eyes.

The Rex starts toward Grant.  He tosses the flare over the half-standing
part of the fence.  The Rex lunges after the flare.

GENNARO has reached his limit.  Terrorized, he leaps out and SCREAMS:

                            GENNARO
          Extinct animals should stay extinct!

He bolts.  The Rex sees him and starts after him, THUNDERING by Grant,
who stays frozen in place.

Gennaro sprints for his life.  He's not even a distant match for the T-
Rex jogging behind him.

Gennaro dives into the LADIES ROOM.

INSIDE - he slams the door and shoves the trashcan against the door.
POUNDING FOOTSTEPS APPROACH!  Gennaro backs up into one of the stalls.
LOUDER POUNDING, THE WALLS BEGIN TO VIBRATE!  Gennaro assumes a 'tuck'
position.

ON THE INTERIOR DOOR - The Rex smashes right through the steel-clad
door.  Pieces go flying.

Gennaro hides amidst the wreckage as the Rex sniffs around.


GRANT RUNS BA
CK -

to check on the kids.  He reaches a hand underneath the flipped car,
sitting in the mud.  Lex's soft voice can be heard.

                            LEX (OFF)
          Dr. Grant!

Grant fishes under, finds Lex's hand, drags her out.  He quickly checks
her for broken bones.

                            GRANT
          Lex, are you okay?

                            LEX
          Timmy's unconscious, he won't move.

Lex SCREAMS.  Grant turns to see the Rex return.  He squeezes Lex tight.
The animal goes right past them, back to his toy - Tim's land cruiser!

The Rex BELLOWS a huge cry.  Timmy awakens and sees the Rex above him.
He SCREAMS.

Lex, squeezed in Grant's arms, sees her imperiled brother.

                            LEX
          Timmy!

The Tyrannosaur looks up, GROWLS across the upside-down cruiser, opens
its huge jaws menacingly, all the time staring at Grant and Lex.

INSIDE THE CAR - Timmy tries to unwedge himself.  A thin trickle of
blood runs down his forehead.  He's jammed between the
 crushed roof and
the bent bench seat.  He can't free himself.

The Rex begins to SHOVE the cruiser toward Grant and Lex.  They back up
but they have very few feet left - they're almost at the embankment.
But if they don't move, they'll by crushed by the oncoming car.

Grant slings Lex onto his back.  She grabs her hands around his neck and
digs her feet into his sides.  Grant begins to climb over the downed
fence and into the embankment - it's a huge drop!

Grant grabs a broken cable and lowers himself and Lex over the side of
the embankment.

Just in time as the Rex SHOVES the cruiser further.  Now, the cruiser
TEETERS right on the edge, turning again on its side.  Tim hangs halfway
out of the car, unable to get out further.

Grant, with Lex on his back, slides down the cable, rappelling down the
embankment.  ABOVE, the car looms over them, rocking on the edge.  Lex
looks up and grabs Grant so tightly, she chokes him, unknowingly.

Grant, eyes bulging, sees the danger from above.  He pushes off the wall
and
 swings them toward the next hanging cable.  He reaches out and -

- GRABS THE NEXT CABLE just as -

- the T-Rex BELLOWS and lowers her head, and gives a final shove.  Timmy
and the cruiser SAIL INTO SPACE.  Timmy SCREAMS!

Grant and Lex swing out of the way as the cruiser sails past them.  Lex
SCREAMS, squeezing Grant's neck even tighter!   They watch helplessly as
the cruiser BOUNCES off the wall and CRASH-LANDS into the top of a tree
at the base of the wall.

Grant and Lex stare down at the wreck in the tree.  Timmy can't be seen.
Grant, choking from Lex's grip, grabs her fingers.

                            GRANT
          Let ... go ... please.

The Rex ROARS above.  They look up.

THE REX paws the air, GRUNTS in frustration and STALKS off, LIGHTNING
FLASHES.


EXT  NEDRY'S JEEP, BACK ROADS -

Nedry speeds along the rain-slick road, fish-tailing as he goes.

CLOSE ON - Nedry at the wheel.

NEDRY'S POV - the dark, wet road running alongside a ten-foot chain-link
fence.  Suddenly, a beast-like visage blur
s across the road.

Nedry swerves.  The jeep skids.  Nedry tries to over-steer, can't bring
the careening jeep under control.

The jeep crashes though the fence, bounces down a cement culvert, and
dives into a raging gully.

Nedry curses.  He spins the wheel.  The tires spin and spray.  The
jeep's hopelessly stuck in the gully.  From Nedry's seat in the jeep, he
cranes his head around, examining his situation.

NEDRY'S POV - On the opposite side of the gully, there is an equipment
graveyard.  By the titled jeep headlights, steely monsters all around
can be seen - discarded earth movers, graders, and tractors.

Nedry gets out of the jeep, grabs the winch from the jeep's back end.
and wades over to an abandoned tractor.

                            NEDRY
          Shit. I'm going to have to change clothes.

He loops the winch around the tractor's base.  Suddenly, he stops and
looks around as he hears a gentle HOOTING.  He squints, looking at the
strange steel graveyard lit by the bright beams of the jeep headli
ghts.

HOOT!  HOOT!  A distinctive HOOTING.  Nedry looks up in fear.  SILENCE.

Nedry starts moving toward his jeep.  Again, the HOOT!  Nedry stops,
looks right, looks left.  A RUSTLE in the trees.  Nedry's head cocks.

Looking through trees, lit by the strong beams, Nedry sees a SPITTER in
the eerie mist.  Now it's gone.  Now it's back.  It circles Nedry
warily, hunting him.  Nedry stares.

                            NEDRY
          I hope this is one of them herbivores.

Nedry scrambles the other way, full-tilt.  Hop, hop, and the Spitter
drops in front of Nedry from the other side.  HOOT!

Nedry jumps back, lands on his butt.  The Spitter zips in from the side
- HOOT!

Nedry doubles back, racing through the abandoned equipment, ducking and
rolling under a cement mixer, spinning past a tree.  He splashes down
the embankment, trying to get to his jeep.  He uses the winch line to
steady himself again the raging current.  He finally reaches the jeep,
swings open the door - and, surging out of the water like a
 demonic
apparition, is the SPITTER!  Nedry backs away, directly into the glare
of the headlights!

CLOSE ON - the Spitter.  It's plume opens, bright orange gills swell out
like an umbrella around its neck.  Something squirts beneath its jaws.

A big glob SMACKS Nedry on the arm.  He brushes it off.

                            NEDRY
          Gross.

EXTREME CLOSEUP - the Spitter's head.  The jaws puff, the hood flares
out, the neck snaps forward.  And - it spits.

This glob misses Nedry, splashes off the steaming headlight.

VERY EXTREME CLOSEUP - The Spitter's swollen poison sacs are inflated.
They fire!

This glob hits Nedry in the eyes.  He SCREAMS.

                            NEDRY
          I'm blind, I'm blind.

He falls against the jeep, rubbing his eyes.  The Spitter calmly hops to
the embankment and watches the blinded Nedry weave drunkenly in the
water.  Nedry grabs onto the jeep and pulls himself along toward the
driver's door.  The Spitter stalks, watching him.

Nedry pulls open the jeep door, 
thrusts his head in, slams it against
the door frame.  Now Nedry heaves his whole body into the jeep.  The
Spitter's long ostrich-like legs stretch and bend in an easy gait as it
closes it on Nedry.

Nedry sits behind the wheel, unseeing as the Spitter watches patiently
turns his blind eyes that way.

A long beat.  The Spitter leaps forward, the CAMERA PULLS BACK WIDER AND
WIDER.  Nedry lets out an ear-splitting SCREAM and the car horn BLARES.


INT  TIMMY'S CRUISER

Timmy lies against a spidered side window, his head pressed against the
door handle.  He pushes himself up on one elbow, opens his eyes, and
tries to focus.  Rain has nearly stopped but a light drizzle hits him

Timmy tries to straighten up, but he's too dizzy.  He stops and hears A
CREAKING and feels the whole car gently swaying back and forth.  With a
further effort, he raises his body so that he's standing with his feet
on the window frame and looks out the broken roof.

TIM'S POV - Dense foliage, moving in the wind, hard to see through.  An
o
pen space and - THE GROUND, FORTY FEET AWAY!


INT/EXT  CRUISER - CONTINUING ACTION

Tim's cruiser is lying on its side, stuck in the higher branches of a
tree on the hillside.

                            TIMMY
          Oh shit!

Timmy pulls his body up carefully, trying to get a better view.  He
grabs the steering wheel for support and it spins free in his hand.

CRACK!  The cruiser slips a few inches down the tree.  Timmy grabs the
window frame and freezes.  The car sways in the wind.

CRACK!  The car slips a quick and rocky two feet.

                            TIMMY
          Oh shit, oh shit, oh shit, oh shit!

Timmy hears something.  He raises his head very carefully.  Climbing up
the tree, pulling himself on a nearby branch, is Dr. Grant.

                            GRANT
          Timmy.  Are you ok?

                            TIMMY
          Thank God you're here.  Where's Lex?

                            GRANT
          Below.  She's fine.  Let's get you down.

Timmy nods.

Grant peers throug
h the broken roof of the cruiser, analyzing Timmy's
predicament.  He cranes his head back to examine how the cruiser is
supported in the tree.  Grant turns back to Timmy.

                            GRANT
          Try the door you're leaning against.
          Nice and slow.

Timmy places his weight on the two sides of the door frame and reaches
between his legs, trying to open the door handle.  Stuck.  CRACK!  The
cruiser drops another foot.

Grant scrambles down a couple branches until he is even with the cruiser
again.  He motions for Timmy to hold still.

Grant reaches across to the other car door and tries the outer door
handle.  This one opens and very slowly, he pushes open the door.  Grant
gingerly holds it half-open in mid-air.

                            GRANT
          Crawl this way.  Slowly.

Carefully testing his weight with each step, Timmy lowers his body down.
He pushes his legs out the door.  They kick in the air and slowly come
to rest on a lower branch.  He lets himself down.  Now he si
ts on a
branch, a few feet below the cruiser.

CRACK!  The cruiser drops.  Grant still hangs onto the door but now his
footing on the branch is gone.  His legs hang in space.  The cruiser
hangs precariously above Timmy.  They're all twenty feet in the air.

                            GRANT
          We're going to have to make a jump for
          it, Timmy.  Okay?

Timmy agrees.

                            GRANT
          One, two, three, jump.

Timmy lets go and DROPS.  Grant follows.  So does the cruiser.  It's
hurtling right at them.

Timmy BANGS against the wet tree-trunk and slides down.  Branches WHIP
against his face, his hands SCRAPE against the trunk.  Grant BOUNCES
them.  They scramble down as quick as they can.

Timmy pulls his hands along the sap-sticky surface of the tree.  CRACK!
Grant is stopped for a terrible instant - doubled over a branch, he
flips himself over, dropping further.  The cruiser jolts along, just a
half-step behind them.

Timmy dives the last six feet and HITS the wet earth 
with a THUD!  Grant
CRASHES next to him.  Before they can roll out of the way, the cruiser
keeps coming.  Grant and Timmy look up at it.

GRANT'S POV - The cruiser dropping, dropping toward them.  And finally
stops, just inches away, its dented grill grinning at them, its cracked
headlight glaring.

Oil drips down on Grant.  He grabs Timmy, who grabs the night goggles.
The two roll away.  That second the cruiser SMASHES to the ground.

Grant brushes himself off painfully, extends a hand to Timmy.  Timmy
slowly reaches up and pulls himself standing.

                            TIMMY
          Thanks, Dr. Grant.

                            GRANT
          You owe me one.

Grant turns around in a slow, fluid circle, checking out the forest.

                            GRANT
          Where'd Lex go?

They hear a faint WHIMPERING.

                            TIMMY
          There's Lex.

He runs.  Grant follows.


INT  DRAINPIPE -

Lex is curled up inside the drainpipe.  Her baseball glove is in her
mouth and
 she is rocking back and forth, rhythmically banging her head
against the back of the pipe.  She WHIMPERS.

ON THE HILLSIDE -

Grant and Timmy arrive at the drainpipe and stare in at Lex.

                            GRANT
          Come on out now, Lex.

Lex continues to band her head.  Timmy tries again.

                            TIMMY
          It's your turn to wear the goggles, Lex.

She shakes her head.  He holds up her baseball but she doesn't look.

                            TIMMY
          I found your baseball.

                            LEX
          You did?

But she doesn't move.  Grant speaks encouragingly.

                            GRANT
          Cone on, Lex, it must be cold in there.
          And tight.  Why don't you come out?

                            LEX
          I'm afraid of the "animals".

                            TIMMY
          The "animals" are gone.

                            LEX
          Where did it go?

                            TIMMY
          I don't kno
w but it's not here now.

                            LEX
          Are there any grownups out there?

                            GRANT
          I'm a grownup, Lex.  Come on out.  Gimmie
          you hand, come on, here you go.

                            LEX
          I'm hungry.

                            GRANT
          Me, too.  We've got to get ourselves back
          to civilization.


EXT  ROADSIDE

Regis slowly crawls out from between a couple large boulders.  He looks
around carefully.  He peels mud off his face and rubs his neck.

He touches his cheek.

CLOSE ON Regis' swollen cheek.  He rubs it with his finger.  Suddenly,
he swats at his own mouth.  He reaches in and pulls out a leech fat with
blood.  He hurls it to the ground, spitting.  He grabs another off his
arm and rips if off, leaving a bloody streak.  He digs in his pants and
pulls out another.  He SCREAMS.

As soon as he has done so, he knows he's made a mistake.  He looks
around frantically.  Sees the Rex trot down the road toward 
him.

                            REGIS
          Noooooo!


BACK ON HILLSIDE -

Grant and the kids crest the hill.  Grant puts on the night goggles and
adjusts the dial and looks toward Regis.  The kids can't see that far.

                            TIMMY
          What's going on?

Grant's green POV - Regis and the Rex bounding after him.  Regis hugs a
tree, unmoving.

Grant whispers to the kids.

                            GRANT
          It's Regis and the Rex is after him.  But
          it's okay.  Regis knows the Rex can't see
          him.  Evidently, he can only see move-
          ment.  Regis'll be ok if he stays still.

AFTER A LONG MOMENT, the tyrannosaur walks away, disappears into the
shadows.  Regis waits another long moment and releases his tree.

GRANT'S POV - The tyrannosaur leaps out of the shadows and knocks Regis
to the ground.  Regis jumps up and backs off.  The animal knocks him
right back down.  Regis jumps up again and screams at the beast.

                            REGIS
    
      You don't want to hurt Mr. Regis.  Go
          away.  Ed's your friend.  Back off!

THE REX watches him dance around.  It goes toward him.  This time its
jaws are open.  Regis SCREAMS and in the middle, the scream cuts off.

Grant lets the goggles fall off his face.  They hit the ground with a
METALLIC CLINK.  The Rex turns toward Grant and the kids.

                            GRANT
          Let's go!

Grant grabs both the kids' hands and they begin to run.


BACK ON  TOUR REST AREA -

Drops of water splat on a big fern.  Light swims in the little puddle.
In the sky above, clouds hurry by, intermittently revealing a half-
obscured moon.

The torn fence lies in a crumpled, twisted mess.  The wheel of a Land
Cruiser spins.  A little lizard runs in place on it.

The SOUND of the jeep's engine.  It's Muldoon and Ellie.

THEIR POV - a single cruiser lies on its side in the middle of the road.

                            ELLIE
          Oh, My God!  Where's the other one?

Before the cruiser stops, she j
umps out.   Muldoon shouts a whisper.

                            MULDOON
          Ellie!

Ellie turns in the headlight beams.  Muldoon tosses her a flashlight.

                            MULDOON
          Wait up.

Muldoon skids to a stop, leaps out of the car.  He catches up to Ellie.

They share a frightened, apprehensive look.  Muldoon gets on his knees
and and touches a muddies area.

                            MULDOON
          T-Rex tracks.

Ellie looks out into the forest.

                            ELLIE
          Then they must be out there.  They must
          be out there.  I know it.

                            MULDOON
          Perhaps.

                            ELLIE
          No!  They're out there.

                            MULDOON
          I've seen a lot of animal attacks in the
          bush.  It's not as gory and horrifying to
          see as you'd think.  No pools of blood or
          exposed bones.  There is usually little or
          no evidence left behind.  And if
 victims
          are small, a predator can kill by just
          shaking the little thing to death, eating
          it, and leave not so much as a button.

A definite RUSTLING in the brush.

Ellie jumps and SCREAMS.  Muldoon puts his hand over her mouth and
pushes her down.  They both squat by the cruiser.  SILENCE.  Ellie
swallows.  Muldoon slowly gets up.  Ellie follows.

Their flashlights swing back and forth in the night.  Twigs crack under
their feet.

Ellie hears the RUSTLE at the edge of the forest.  She shines her light
into the brush.  She catches her breath.  Her hand shakes.

Ellie flashes her beam right, left, up, down.  Jumps.  Something is
coming at her, rolling at her.  She gasps, steps back.  It's too late.
It's Gennaro.  His limp body stops at her feet.  She covers her mouth.
Muldoon runs to her.

Gennaro is face-down.  Muldoon takes his pulse.

                            MULDOON
          Thank God.  (beat)  We have to carry him.
          First I have to ...

He stands and removes his 
jacket.

CLOSE ON - Muldoon tears the jacket into long strips.

He wraps Gennaro's wounds.

                            MULDOON
          He's losing a lot of blood.  Help me.

Muldoon and Ellie carry Gennaro to the jeep.  They lay him on the back
seat.  Muldoon jumps in back with him.  He keeps wrapping the wounds.
Ellie starts the engine, looks back at him.

                            ELLIE
          Looks like you've been through this
          before.

Muldoon looks up.

                            MULDOON
          I told you I've seen big game attacks in
          Africa.

She starts the engine.

                            ELLIE
          Right.

Ellie skids out of there.


INT  CONTROL ROOM - NIGHT

The dark room is lit with two outdoor torches.  Light flickering on
their faces, Arnold and Wu stare at the console screen.

                            WU
          Why?

                            ARNOLD
          Because Nedry messed with the code.
          That's why I'm checking it.

              
              WU
          But that could take weeks.  What would be
          faster?  Try keychecks.

Arnold snaps his fingers, grabs Wu,

                            ARNOLD
          That's true.  Keychecks will give me a
          record of every button Nedry pushed.

With a rapid series of keys, Arnold initiates "keystrokes".  The
computer displays a short series of commands.  Arnold runs his finger
down the screen.

                            ARNOLD
          Jesus, that's all he did all afternoon?
          He was just dicking around, maybe waiting
          to get his nerve up.

Wu points to a line.  It reads:  WHTE-RBT.OBJ

                            WU
          What's that?

                            ARNOLD
          Some sort of object.  Let's see if we can
          trace it.

Arnold types FIND WHTE-RBT.OBJ.  Nothing.  He tries DEFINE WHTE-RBT.OBJ.
Still nothing.  LIST WHTE-RBT.OBJ.  The screen fills with data.  Each
line defines another security system that has been shut off:  SECURITY
PERIM
ETER FENCES OFF/   SECURITY - INTERIOR FENCES OFF/  SECURITY -
LABORATORY DOORS OFF/, etc.

                            WU
          What's it mean?

                            ARNOLD
          It wasn't a bug.  It was a trap door that
          fat bastard left for himself.  When he
          hit WHTE-RBT. OBJ, it initiates a set of
          commands that turned the whole goddamn
          park off.  Hammond was right about him.

                            WU
          If I did that I'd leave a way to turn it
          back on.  In case I had to.  I'm sure
          Nedry did.  You're find it.

Arnold nods grimly.


INT  CAFETERIA - NIGHT

Hammond sits quietly in the deserted cafeteria, calmly spooning ice
cream into his mouth.  This room is lit by dozens of candles.

Muldoon walks in, stares at Hammond in the semi-darkness.

                            MULDOON
          We found Gennaro.  He'd badly injured.
          Harding's tending to him in your
          quarters.  He'll be all right if we can
    
      radio for help.  Your grandchildren and
          Grant are somewhere in the park.  I
          believe they're alive but I don't know
          where they are.

                            HAMMOND
          I'm sure you'll find them.

                            MULDOON
          I certainly hope so.

                            HAMMOND
          I'm sure we will.  After all, I keep
          telling everyone, this park is made for
          children.

                            MULDOON
          Just so you understand that they're
          missing, sir.

                            HAMMOND
          Missing?  Of course I know they're
          missing.  You just said that.  Look, Bob,
          let's not get carried away.  We've had a
          little breakdown from the storm or
          whatever, and as a result we've had a
          regrettable, unfortunate accident.  And
          that's all that happened.  We're dealing
          with it.  Arnold will get the computers
          cleaned up, and
 the radio and phone lines
          open.  You'll find those kids and my good
          friend, Dr. Grant.  I'm sure they'll want
          some of this ice cream.  It's very good.


INT  HAMMOND'S QUARTERS - NIGHT

Dark.  Ellie helps Harding get Gennaro comfortable on Hammond's couch.
Blood from Gennaro's injuries stain the rich leather.  Gennaro babbles.

                            GENNARO
          That Rex didn't even give me his full
          attention.  That's what hurts.  I was
          just an afterthought.  I gave him my full
          attention.

                            HARDING
          He's had a lot of morphine.

                            GENNARO
              (sings)
          Not enough.

                            ELLIE
          I need to find Wu.  I have to run a few
          tests in his lab.

                            HARDING
          He's probably in the control room, get-
          ting in the way while Arnold tries to put
          things together.

As Ellie leaves, Genna
ro is singing a shanty in his morphine stupor.

                            GENNARO
          Yo ho, I'll close this place down ...


EXT  THE ANNE B AT SEA - NIGHT

The ship is tossed around on a stormy sea.

                                                     MATCH CUT TO:


INT  STATEROOM -

The eggs are tossed around in the womb of the incubator.  The swell
settles but the rocking of one egg doesn't stop.  The egg cracks, a
silvery line runs down its side.


EXT  PARK - NIGHT

Somewhere in the dark park, laced by low fog, Grant, Timmy and Lex walk.

                            LEX
          I'm tired.

                            TIMMY
          You're too big to be carried.

                            LEX
          But I'm tired-tired.

                            GRANT
          Okay, Lex.

Grant picks her up.

                            GRANT
          Oof!  You're heavy.

The full moon is blurred by drifting clouds.  Their blunted shadows lead
the three across an open field toward dark woods beyond
.  Grant is lost
is thought, trying to decide where to go.

                            GRANT
          I think we're still in his paddock.

Lex's heavy eyes open.  Her eyes grow big.  She taps Grant's shoulder.

                            GRANT
          What?

                            LEX
          Don't you see?  Don't you see?

                            GRANT
          What?

                            LEX
          The fence.

                            GRANT
              (squinting)
          No.

                            TIMMY
          Oh I do, right there!

Lex lets herself slide off Grant and runs into the woods.  Timmy
follows.  Grant follows, squinting.  Finally, he sees.  A big smile.

The kids look up at a twelve foot high electric fence.  Timmy gulps.

                            LEX
          Timmy's scared of heights.

Timmy spins in fury.

                            TIMMY
          Shut up.

Lex and Timmy stare at each other.  No fighting - now.  They relax.

                   
         GRANT
          Okay with the fence, Timmy?

Timmy eyes it.  Nods hesitantly.  They start to climb.  Lex climbs easily.

                            LEX
              (mumbles quietly)
          'Fraid of heights.

Timmy climbs tentatively.  A dinosaur ROARS in the distance.

CLOSE ON - Timmy's foot loses its grip.

Timmy hangs for a moment, held only by his straining hands.

All three stop.  Wait.  Timmy regains his balance.  Slowly, they proceed
up and over.

On the other side, Grant looks around.  More high trees.  Beyond a field.

                            GRANT
          A herbivore grazing area.  Excellent.

Grant starts to walk toward it.  Timmy stops.  Lets sits on a tree root.

                             TIM
          We gonna walk all night?

Grant looks at his watch.

                            GRANT
          Twelve hours before that ship reaches the
          mainland.

                            TIM
          We need sleep.

True, and Grant's thinking the same thing.  He looks aro
und, surveying
the misty forest.  He looks straight up into the beautiful, tall trees
that ring the wide-open grassy meadow.

                            GRANT
          Up there.

                            TIM
          Climb?  Again?  I can't climb again?

Grant smiles.

                            GRANT
          Sure you can.

Grant checks out and rejects tree after tree.  Near the meadow he finds
it.  A good, basic climbing tree.


EXT  UPPER BRANCHES OF THE TREE

Grant helps Lex get comfortable on his lap.  Timmy tucks himself in
between Grant's outstretched legs.  Grant looks out.  Back to kids.

Timmy and Lex are already snoring.  Lex turns and hugs Grant close to
her.  She murmurs in her sleep.  Grant starts to pat her shoulder when
Timmy, without waking, reaches to her and strokes her hair.

                            TIMMY
              (mumbles)
          It's ok, Lex.  Everything's gonna be okay.

                                                       CUT TO:

CLOSE ON - amoeba-like creatures 
swimming in a pool.


INT  INCUBATION ROOM, LABORATORY - NIGHT

Ellie lifts her head away from the powerful microscope.

The dark room is lit by flashlight.  Battery packs power the microscope.
Wu paces the room, regarding his eggs with dismay.  Sitting on their
long tables with no moving wands above them - no thermal sensors.

                            WU
          What is taking Arnold so long?  This room
          is too cold.  My eggs will be damaged.

Ellie swings the lens to Wu.  Not so interested but peers in politely.

                            ELLIE
          No sign of those berries.  Really
          interesting.  There are indications of a
          similar virus in every tissue sample.
          But it's not in the ground.  Could I look
          at some of the discarded embryos?

Wu reluctantly agrees.  He opens a cabinet and brings her samples.

                            WU
          I'm sure you'll find your virus ... or a
          similar one.  All animals carry many
          viruses 
in a dormant condition.  It's
          almost impossible to say with certainty
          which are the same strains.

Ellie begins a test on a sample.  She adds a reagent and marks up a
slide.  As she works:

                            ELLIE
          And yet from what Harding tells me, many
          of you animals have similar symptoms -
          besides the microvesicles, a lack of
          hunger, loss of reproductive urges, sores
          in the mouth and gums.

Wu waves his arms.

                            WU
          What the hell does Harding know?  He's a
          veterinarian, not a pathologist.


BACK ON  CONTROL ROOM -

Arnold pushes his chair away from his console and claps his hands as
Muldoon walks in.  Muldoon asks hopefully.

                            MULDOON
          What is it?

Arnold points to the screen.

                            ARNOLD
          That's it.

Muldoon comes closer.

                            MULDOON
          That's what?

                            ARNOL
D
          I found the command to restore the
          original code.  It resets the linked
          parameters.

                            MULDOON
          The fences and the power?

                            ARNOLD
          Right.  And it does something else. It
          erases the code lines that refer to it.  It
          destroys all evidence it was ever there.

                            MULDOON
          Nedry could steal the eggs, get back and
          reset the whole show.  No one would ever
          miss him.

                            ARNOLD
          Watch this.

Arnold types in a command.  The screen flickers and changes.  Arnold and
Muldoon look out the window as lights come on through out the park.

                            ARNOLD
          Hot damn!

                            MULDOON
          Are the fences back on?

                            ARNOLD
          You bet they are.  It will take a few
          seconds to get up to full power, because
          we've got fift
y miles of fence out there,
          and the generator has to feed the
          capacitors along the way.  But in a half
          a minute we'll be back in business.

Arnold points to the transparent map of the park.  On it, bright red
lines snake out, moving throughout the park, as electricity surges
through the fences.

                            MULDOON
          Motion sensors?

                            ARNOLD
          Got them too.   It will be a few minutes
          while the computer counts.  Then I'll
          tell you where Grant and the kids are and
          you can go and get them.  But every-
          thing's working.  Half past ten and we've
          got the whole thing back up and running.

Muldoon picks up a phone, shakes his head.

                            MULDOON
          Just hiss.


BACK ON  GRANT AND KIDS IN TREE -

Grant snores.  A mosquito buzzes around him.  He waves him away and
continues to sleep.

In the distance, a tiny BEEPING. Below the towering tree, across the
f
ield, a sensor beeps, it's green light blinks, and the beeping stops.

IN THE HIGH TREE, the branches sway.  Grant and the kids sleep on.


BACK ON  CONTROL ROOM -

The glowing, glass map.  Arnold and Muldoon stare at it.

                            MULDOON
          What is taking so damn long?  Where are they?

                            ARNOLD
          There's a lot of extraneous movement out
          there.  Branches blowing, birds, back-
          ground movement.  It may take, ah, okay,
          count's finished.

Muldoon looks at Arnold anxiously.  Arnold looks down.

                            ARNOLD
          Hmmmm.  I don't see them.  Maybe they're
          out of range of a sensor.

                            MULDOON
          Shit.  I don't know where they are.  I
          wish I could go out there   But I haven't
          got anything to use on the Rex.  My
          rocket launcher's in the jeep Nedry
          stole.  And going out with a big gun in
          the dark would be suicide
.


INT  INCUBATION ROOM, LABORATORY - NIGHT

Brightly lit again.  Ellie performs tests with a centrifuge.  She looks
at Wu, who sits across from her in a high stool, stifling a yawn.

                            ELLIE
          Why don't you get some sleep, Dr. Wu?
          I'm just going to run a couple more tests
          and then I'm going to turn in myself.

Wu doesn't need to be told twice.  He climbs off his stool.

                            WU
          No point in everyone being exhausted.

He starts to leave.  He comes back and speaks consolingly at Ellie.

                            WU
          I'm sure Muldoon will find Dr. Grant as
          soon as there is light.

Ellie appreciates his effort, nods seriously, goes back to work.

                                                      DISSOLVE TO:


EXT  OCEAN - JUST BEFORE DAWN

Beautiful dark ocean.  The sky is a rich blue.  A morning star fades as
the sky lightens.  The Anne B is a small dot on the massive ocean.


INT  STATEROOM, ANNE B 
-

Eggs sit in the incubator.  A hand sprays them with foam.  Leaves.
CAMERA EXAMINES the eggs as the foam disperses.  More cracks.  One egg
jumps with a bolt from within.  It settles.  Jumps again.

                                                      CUT TO:

ESTABLISHING AERIAL - the primordial beauty of Isla Nublar at dawn.


EXT  VISITOR'S CENTER - DAWN

Muldoon drives out into the park in Harding's jeep.  THREE WORKERS
travel with him.  Each carries a rifle.


EXT  GRANT'S TREE - DAWN

CAMERA LOOK DOWN on Grant, Lex and Timmy still sleeping in the tree.  A
large shadow falls on their quiet faces.  Lex opens an eye. She SCREAMS.

Grant and Timmy wake up with a start.

THEIR POV - AS THE CAMERA LOOKS THROUGH THEIR LEGS AND TILTS UP right
into the huge face of A DUCK-BILLED HADROSAUR, a gigantic dinosaur with
cow eyes.  Its head moves up through the canopy of the trees.  Then the
head swoops way down below.  And returns to Grant's level and stares at
his shoe.

The hadrosaur tastes Grant's shoe.  The kids
 press tightly into Grant.

                            LEX
          He gonna eat us?

                            GRANT
          I don't think so.  She's a ...

                            GRANT AND TIMMY
          ... herbivore.

The hadrosaur HONKS.  Lex covers her ears.  Grant smiles and motions to
Lex.  He picks a big fruit off the tree and tosses it into the
hadrosaur's mouth.  CHOMP.  He feeds it again.  Lex and Timmy toss a few.

CHOMP!  CHOMP!  HONK!  HONK!

The hadrosaur's big head swoops way down, momentarily gone.

When she returns, all three quickly gather fruits and throw them into
her mouth.  The hadrosaur pulls back with her giant mouthful of fruit.
She pulls further and further back and then her huge head turns and
moves down.

Grant, Lex and Timmy strain to see through the branches.

THEIR POV - The hadrosaur is feeding four scampering, baby hadrosaurs.
Letting the fruit tumble from her mouth into theirs.  Lex YELLS:

                            LEX
          Come here, babies!  Get your b
reakfast!

The babies run to the base of the tree.  The kids toss fruits right down
to them.  Lex and Timmy climb lower to feed them right from their hands.

Grant and the mother hadrosaur stare at each other.  She sniffs his
foot.  He moves closer, straddling a branch.  He lifts up her lip and
examines her gums.

CLOSE ON - a ripped piece of fence stuck in her teeth.

Grant yanks it out.  He lets it drop to the ground.  He take a large
leaf and rubs her teeth with it.

CLOSE ON - her mouth as Grant's hand touches the side of her tongue.  He
sees little tiny bumps.

The hadrosaur lets out a low groan.   Grant is puzzled, rubs harder.

                            GRANT
          Like the trike.  Maybe it's not the stones.

HONK!   She pulls her mouth away.  The baby hadrosaurs turn to the
honking adult.  She is leaving quickly.  They follow quickly behind her.
The small herd leaves, casually trampling trees as they go.


EXT  BACK ROADS, PARK - MORNING

Muldoon and workers drive rapidly in the jeep.  Suddenly,
 Muldoon slams
on the brakes.

MULDOON'S POV - ABOUT TWENTY PROCOMPSOGNATHIDS (COMPYS), small chicken-
sized scavenging dinosaurs, scramble across the road.

                            MULDOON
          Where the hell are they going?

Muldoon watches them cross.  He thinks it over.  Spins the wheel and
follows them off the road.

                            MULDOON
          Let's see what's up.


EXT  BELOW THE TREE, PARK - MORNING

Timmy bravely jumps from a very low branch.  He smiles and looks at
Grant, who's already on the ground.  Grant looks off in the distance.

                            GRANT
          Tim, I think there's a motion sensor
          across the field and down there.

                            TIM
          Where's Lex?

ALONE IN THE BUSHES -  Lex kneels.  She holds a big fruit and calls:

                            LEX
          C'mere boy, c'mere.

She tosses the fruit.

CLOSE ON - the fruit rolling away.

Lex gets up and follows the rolling fruit.  She picks it up.

           
                 LEX
          It's very, very good.

She tosses it again.

                            LEX
          C'mere boy, c'mere.

Lex's eyes scan the bushes, then stop.  She smiles.

LEX'S POV - hidden in the brush, a baby triceratops' eye peeks at Lex.

Lex pushes the fruit closer.  The BABY TRICERATOPS comes out of the
brush, squeaking as it goes.  It nibbles the fruit.  Lex rolls another.

BACK ON GRANT AND TIM - They look around.  Timmy stops, mouth open, YELLS:

                            TIM
          Dr. Grant, Dr. Grant, look.

Grant turns, looks OFFSCREEN.  He's astonished by when he sees.

HIS POV - a row of shrubs, which Lex seems to soar above.  As a break in
the shrubs, it's clear that she's riding the baby triceratops.  Loving it.

                            LEX
          Whoa!

With a whoop, Grant and Timmy chase after Lex on her triceratops.

Lex rides through low brush, ducking down as she goes.  Then beneath the
tall trees as she enters the forest.  She crosses a stream on a log
b
ridge.  Light showers down through the branches.  The water shimmers.
Lex in is paradise.

Behind her, Grant and Timmy shout for her to stop.  She waves, kicks the
triceratops like it's a horse and YELLS:

                            LEX
          Giddyup!

The trike takes off, in a rush.  It trips over a fallen tree, downed by
the storm.  The trike takes a spill and Lex goes flying.

                            LEX
          Whoa!!  Take is easy!

She passes over the trike's head, in the air, and SCREAMS as she flies:

                            LEX
          I can't swim!

She SPLASHES into the stream.

Timmy, first to arrive on the scene, dives in heroically.  He comes up
sheepish and muddy - and sees Lex standing in a foot of water.

The baby dinosaur rolls to a stop, mowing down a patch of saplings as
she goes.  It stands up, dizzy and out of breath.

Timmy wipes mud off himself.  Grant helps the kids out of the water.
The baby triceratops follows them.  Grant yells to the baby trike.

                 
           GRANT
          Go home now.  Home to Freda!

                            LEX
          Oh, let him stay.  He likes me to ride
          him.  He could carry me instead of you,
          Dr. Grant.  Please, let him stay,

Grant shakes his head,

                            GRANT
          Go!  Go away.  Go!  Get out of here!

The trike whimpers and watches the three of them walk on.  Lex is
heartbroken.

                            LEX
          Will I ever play with him again?

Grant looks across the field, abundantly beautiful in the early morning.
He has to keep them going.   He points across the field.

                            GRANT
          We gotta get to that motion detector.
          It's still a ways.

Lex looks behind her.  In the distance, more hadrosaurs join the herd
eating from the tall trees.  Some cool off in a shallow lagoon.  They
drink, lowering their flat heads, meeting their own reflections in the
still water.  When they look up again, their heads swivel.  At the
water's 
edge, a baby hadrosaur ventures out, squeaks, and scrambles back
while the adults watch indulgently.


EXT  OFF ROAD, PARK - MORNING

Muldoon and his workers now follow the compys on foot.  The compys trail
off in different directions.  Muldoon and his workers break apart to
track the different groups.

A BEARDED WORKER follows his party of compys.  He looks ahead and sees a
small group stopped ahead.  Their heads are bent to the ground.

A BALD WORKER has reached another cluster of compys.  Kicking, he
scatters them.

Muldoon's tracking leads him to the equipment graveyard where Nedry was
lost.  He sees his stolen red jeep.  He rushes to it.  On the passenger
side still sits the rocket launcher.  He opens the door to retrieve it.
When he leans in, his eye catches the tilted side-view mirror.  The
image is of many compys bent over the ground.  He comes around, YELLING.

                            MULDOON
          I found Nedry!

In the distance, the call is ECHOED.

                            BEARDED WORKE
R (OFF)
          I found him!

                            BALD WORKER (OFF)
          Found him!


INT  HAMMOND'S QUARTERS - DAY

Hammond peeks in the door and sees Gennaro, heavily bandaged, dozing on
the couch.  Gennaro's eyes flutter and Hammond enters and smiles.

                            HAMMOND
          He, Donald.  Glad you're awake.  I hope
          you're not going to take this little
          mishap you had and hold it against my
          park.  It would be terrible if the
          finishing funds were in any way held up.

Gennaro just grins and shakes his head.  He's very high on morphine.  He
wants to speak but Hammond keeps talking.  After each sentence, Gennaro
enthusiastically agrees with a nod.

                            HAMMOND
          You really shouldn't have gotten out of
          the vehicle.  The park is actually quite
          safe.  A disenchanted worker sabotaged
          some equipment.  Arnold, Muldoon, and Wu,
          all loyal employees, are righting damage
    
      as we speak.

                            GENNARO
          Oh good, 'cause I love the park!  It's
          more than we ever dreamed!  Those
          brachiosaurs are so big!  And those
          Spitters -
              (he spits)
          - incredible!  I only have one problem.
          Aren't we going to have pterodactyls?
              (he frowns, smacks his forehead)
          Oh, they'd fly away!

Gennaro looks off, watching the imaginary pterodactyls fly away.
Hammond takes out a bag.

                            HAMMOND
          Take a look at these, Donald.  Have you
          seen these?  These are great.

Hammond dumps things out of the bag.  They are souvenirs of the park.

                            HAMMOND
          Wind-up toys.  Spitter umbrellas.

Gennaro is thrilled.

                            HAMMOND
          I got some great t-shirts.  Dinosaur
          bingo, hey ...

Hammond leans closer.

                            HAMMOND
          Wu says he can make a foot high
    
      triceratops.  We'll sell pets as living
          souvenirs.  Bio-engineered to eat only
          food we sell, of course.

Gennaro can't take it.  Great idea!  He high-fives Hammond repeatedly.

Harding enters and gently taps Hammond on the shoulder.

                            HARDING
          You'll have to bear with him, Mr. Hammond.
          He's doped to infinity and back.


INT  INCUBATION ROOM, LABORATORY - DAY

Sunlight pours through the windows.  Ellie sits with her head in hands.
She looks around and wanders the lab.  Notices a drawer, slides it open.

X-rays.  She shuffles through, finds some marked: FREDA.

Ellie snaps on a viewing light at her lab station.  She studies the X-
ray.  She looks up in surprise.   Studies it again.

The viewing light is snapped off.  Ellie looks again.  Wu stands there.

                            WU
          Who gave you permission -

Ellie attacks back.

                            ELLIE
          I'm here to investigate this park. And
          there's
 plenty you haven't told me.

                            WU
          That's absurd.

                            ELLIE
          These bones aren't fully formed.

                            WU
          You're qualified to interpret x-rays of
          living dinosaurs?  I doubt it.  It took
          me many months to learn.

                            Y
          I'll tell you something else, Freda isn't
          an adult, just a huge juvenile.

                            WU
          You're making a lot of assumptions here.

                            ELLIE
          Right.  What the hell is going on, Wu?

They stare at each other in the bright sunlight.

                            HAMMOND (OFF)
          Growth hormones.

The two swing around.  Hammond stands in the sharp shadows of the room.

                            WU
          She didn't have a right to explore my lab.

                            HAMMOND
          Let's not argue, Wu, we have a serious
          problem.
              (to 
Ellie)
          These animals don't last.  There is a
          regularity, a predictability about when
          they die.  It's always ... very young.
          We don't know why.  Given time, I'm sure
          Wu will figure it out.  It's just ...

                            WU
          Just some adjustment in the code is
          required.

                            HAMMOND
          But there are deadlines.  The park opens
          next summer. And it requires full-grown
          specimens.  So Wu uses growth hormones to
          achieve the desired size in a short
          amount of time.  But they all keep dying
          and we don't know how to stop it.

Ellie and Wu stare at Hammond.  He steps forward.  The light is so hot
behind him that his appearance is like an apparition.

                            HAMMOND
          I was going to tell you all this myself,
          Dr. Sattler, after Gennaro stopped
          breathing down my neck.  That's why I
          wanted you and Dr. Grant 
here on my
          island - you have to help me keep the
          dinosaurs alive.  Won't you please help
          me?

                                                      CUT TO:

IN THE SKY, the sun momentarily burns through the clouds -


INT  HAMMOND'S QUARTERS - DAY


Ellie enters.  On the couch, Gennaro snores lightly.  In a chair nearby
Harding sleeps, a roll of gauze grasped in his hands.

Ellie walks over to the large model of the park that Hammond revealed.
She looks at the miniature dinosaurs that sit in different sectors of
the park.  She picks up the plastic Rex, examines it, drops it back in.

She brushes by Harding and studies Gennaro's pasty, sleeping face.  Air
blows in and out of his dry lips.  She examines the gauze wrapped around
his wounded leg.  It seeps with blood.


INT CONTROL - DAY

Arnold works at his console.  Hammond and Wu lean over his shoulder.
Ellie bursts in, very agitated.  Hammond looks up.

                            ELLIE
          Gennaro's losing a lot of blood. 
 He
          needs transfusions.  We gotta get a
          rescue helicopter.  Arnold, what's with
          the phones?

                            ARNOLD
          Ah hell. I just can't find it.

He sips his coffee and stares bleary-eyed at the screen.

                            ELLIE
          Find what?

                            ARNOLD
          Nedry jammed all the communication lines.
          He inserted some command, a lockout into
          the program code.  I can't find it,
          because I gave that restore command and
          it erased part of the program listings.

                            WU
          So?  Just reset - shut the system down
          and you'll clear the memory.  Everything
          will be in the normal wakeup mode.

                            ARNOLD
          Shut the system down?

                            WU
          And reset.

                            ARNOLD
          I've never done that before.  And I'm
          reluctant to do it.  Maybe it's tr
ue, all
          systems will come on, but maybe they won't.

                            ELLIE
          Look, there is a sick man here who needs
          medical attention or he'll die.  Four
          people are out there, missing in your
          park.  We need search teams.  We have to
          have a phone or radio.

Arnold still hesitates.

                            ELLIE
          Well?

                            ARNOLD
          Well, it's just that the safety systems
          don't function with the computer shut
          down and -

Ellie boils over.

                            ELLIE
          - turn the goddamn safety systems off!
          Can't you get it through your head that
          we have no choice?

Arnold looks at Hammond, who now stares out into the park.  Without
turning, Hammond nods his consent.

                            ARNOLD
          Okay.

Arnold gets up and goes to the main panel.  He opens the doors and
uncovers the metal swing-latches over the safety switches. 
 He pops them
off, one after another.

                            ARNOLD
          You asked for it.  And you got it.

He throws the master switch.

The control room goes black.  All monitors go black.  Arnold, Wu and
Ellie stand in the dark.

                            ELLIE
          How long do we have to wait?

                            ARNOLD
          Thirty seconds.


EXT  FIELD IN THE PARK -

Grant and kids walk through a clearing.  Lex stops.

                            GRANT
          What is it?

                            LEX
          I hear something.

                            GRANT
          Come on.

Timmy looks around. The morning is still and peaceful. Branches are
motionless.  Only a little bird jumps from one branch to another.

                            LEX
          Hear it now?

                            TIMMY
          You're hearing things.  Come on, we gotta
          get back and warn them about the boat.

Lex hesitates but doesn't want to be left behind.  She runs betw
een
Grant and Timmy.  Then they all hear it.

HONKING.  It comes from the herd of duck bills behind them.  First the
honking of a single animal, then another animal joins in, then another
and another, until the whole herd has taken up the honking cry.

                            TIMMY
          What's going on?

                            GRANT
          They're agitated.

The duckbills twist and turn.  They hurry out of the water, circling the
young ones to protect them.

With a ROAR, the T-Rex bursts from the trees, just a hundred yards away
straight toward the hadrosaurs.

                            LEX
          I told you I heard something!

The earth SHAKES.  A low rumble is heard and felt as the hadrosaurs begin
to run  in a parallel direction to the course of Grant and the kids.

                            GRANT
          Outta the way, kids! Run!

Grant grabs Lex, lifting her bodily off the ground, and carries her like
a football.  Timmy runs beside them.

Hadrosaurs run alongside of them.  Grant
 hears the crashing of trees.
He takes a glance over his shoulder.

GRANT'S POV - a flurry of flamingos takes flight and spooks the herd
into changing direction.  The hadrosaurs swerve and charge right into
the path of Grant, Lex and Timmy.  They all SCREAM.


BACK ON  CONTROL ROOM -

The quiet black room.  Hammond stands by the big window.  His pensive
presence affects all in the room.

Arnold looks at his illuminated watch.

                            ARNOLD
          Memory should be cleared by now.

He pushes the main switch back on.  Nothing on.

                            ARNOLD
          Damn.

Arnold pushes the switch off and then on again.  Still nothing.  He
glances at Hammond's back.  Sweat forms on his brow.

                            ELLIE
          What's wrong?

                            ARNOLD
          Oh hell!  I have to turn the safety switches
          back on before I restart the power.

Arnold flips on three safeties, and covers them again with latch covers.
Holding his breath, he
 turns on the main power switch.

First, there is the computer beep.  Ellie jumps.  Then relaxes.  The
lights come on.  The screens hum.  Hammond's shoulder twitches slightly.

                            ARNOLD
          Thank God!

The room is jubilant.  Hugs and cheers.  Ellie picks up a phone.

                            ELLIE
          Arnold!  They're still not working.

                            ARNOLD
          No, it sounds dead but after a reset, all
          system modules have to be brought on line
          manually.

Arnold quickly goes back to work at his console.  Hammond turns.

                            WU
              (to Hammond)
          Arnold's about to get the phones up.

Arnold pushes the chair back.

                            ARNOLD
          Okay, we're up again!

Ellie grabs the phone back up.

                            ELLIE
          No we're not.  Phones still dead.

Arnold swings her way.

                            ARNOLD
          Can't be -

                    
        HAMMOND
          My God, look at this, Arnold.

Hammond points to the transparent map.  A tight cluster of dots by the
lagoon move in a coordinated way.  Moving fast, in a kind of swirl.

                            ELLIE
          What's happening?

                            ARNOLD
              (tonelessly)
          The duckbills.

                            WU
          My good God.

                            ELLIE
          What?

                            ARNOLD
          It's the Rex ...

                            HAMMOND
          They've stampeded ...


BACK ON  THE HADROSAURS - LOW ANGLE ON THE STAMPEDE -

Grant and kids run for their lives.  Behind them the duckbills charge
with surprising speed.  Their enormous bodies charge in a tight group,
kicking up dirt, rocks, whole trees as they thunder along.

CLOSE ON - a charging duckbill as he HONKS, eyes wild with fear.

A horrible ROAR of the T-Rex sends a duckbill infant squealing and
struggling to stay out from underfoot.

CLOSE ON
 - A huge adult foot almost tramples the infant.

Frightened and confused the infant scampers even deeper into the
maelstrom.  The frenzied herd raises a great cloud of yellow dust.

GRANT AND LEX AND TIMMY run wildly.  The stampede is very close behind
Grant and the kid's faces are covered with sweat and dust.

Another deafening ROAR of the T-Rex.

Grant leads them toward a rocky outcrop with a stand of big conifers.
The animals continue to close.

CLOSE ON - the running feet of the stampeding animals.  The ground
VIBRATES every time it is struck by the huge feet.

GRANT AND THE KIDS scramble onto the rocks.  They frantically tuck in
between big boulders as the the herd reaches them.  Lex shields her
dusty face with her hands as she wedges deeper between the rocks.  Grant
pushes her down deeper and looks up from between the rocks.

GRANT'S POV - the immense legs of the first hadrosaur to pass.  Another
slams its big tail against the rocks, leaving a splash of hot blood.

Stampeding legs send clods of dirt fl
ying in the air.  Above, even the
birds are running.  Disoriented, they fly frantically along.

GRANT AND THE KIDS are enveloped in dust.  Just shadows of huge bodies
with giant limbs.  BELLOWS of pain as animals wheel and circle.

A boulder is dislodged and it rolls toward Timmy.  He dives out of his
rocky hiding place.  The boulder continues on toward Grant and Lex.
They dive after Timmy.  The group buries itself anew in a group of thick
roots tangled amidst smaller rocks.  The boulder continues on, SMASHING
the rocky enclave they have just left.

Grant and the kids huddle and watch the last under-bellies oscillate
above them.  The stampede goes past.  They lie there, unable to move.
They watch the herd trample on.


CLOSE ON - The Rex's foot as it crushes a motion sensor.

Lex SCREAMS.  Grant and Timmy cover her mouth.

The T-Rex hunts down the herd.  He targets his prey.  A young hadrosaur.

As the hadrosaur gallops into the shadowy treeline, the Rex lunges
fiercely.  The Rex and its victim are enveloped 
in dust.

Grant holds Lex close.  She watches the terrible cloud with a quiet
horror.  Timmy makes the first move to leave.

                            TIMMY
          Let's go.  Now!

The herd's remainder gallops off into the safety of the deep jungle.

Grant, Lex and Timmy run in the opposite direction.


BACK ON  CONTROL ROOM -

Hammond, Arnold, Wu, and Ellie watch the monitor as the dust slowly
clears.  Hadrosaurs scatter.

Now the Rex is calm and quiet.  BACK TO CAMERA, he gnaws on something.

                            HAMMOND
          No!  Oh no!  He make a kill.  He killed
          one of my animals!  Where's Muldoon?

                            ARNOLD
          I'm sorry, Mr. Hammond.

                            HAMMOND
          My animals!  My animals!

Muldoon enters, limping in.  Hammond is very upset.

                            HAMMOND
          Where have you been?  My Rex killed a
          hadrosaur.  You should be out there,
          doing something.

                            MUL
DOON
          I just came to tell you - you're minus
          one computer expert.


EXT  BY THE RIVER, PARK - DAY

The water rushes a few hundred yards away.  Grant and the kids have
finally rested enough.  Grant nods to Timmy.

                            GRANT
          We'll walk by the river.  That leads back
          to the Visitor's center.

                            LEX
          Not me.  I'm not walking anymore.

                            TIMMY
          Come on Lex, I'll carry you.

                            LEX
          Nope.  Too scared.

Timmy looks up at Grant.  Grant kneels down by Lex.  Lex embraces Grant.

                            GRANT
          You ready?

She wipes her tears.

                            LEX
          Can we go on the raft?  Then we don't
          have to walk so close to the animals!

                            GRANT
          What raft?

Lex points to a low concrete maintenance building with bars.  It is
twenty yards away.

                            LEX

          Where I found Freda's baby.

Grant start to stand.  He's thinking.

                            GRANT
          It's still mid-morning.  I bet we have at
          least ten miles to go.  If we take the
          raft along the river, we can make much
          faster progress.

                            TIMMY
          Let's do it.


INT  MAINTENANCE BUILDING -

Grant stumbles deep in the gloomy recesses of the building.  He pushes
past drums of herbicide, tree-pruning equipment, spare tires, coils of
cyclone fencing, huge fertilizer bags, stacks of ceramic insulators,
empty motor-oil cans, work-lights and cables.

                            GRANT
          Lex, I don't see any raft.

Timmy looks at Lex.  Where is it?  Lex doesn't know.

                            TIMMY
          Keep going.

Grant keeps pushing through bags of cement, lengths of copper pipe,
piles of green mesh.  Two plastic oars hang on the concrete wall.

                            GRANT
          Bullseye!

Timmy is reliev
ed.  Lex smiles.

                            LEX
          Told you!

Grant grabs them.  Looks around, still -

                            GRANT
          No raft. Where did you see it, Lex?

                            LEX
          Actually, I never really saw one. Just
          assumed.

                            GRANT
          Assumed?

She nods.  Grant and Timmy resume looking.

IN THE REAR OF THE BUILDING - Lex walks below a barred window.  Slats of
light fall on her back.  She sees a dark closet door ajar.  She brushes
the handle.  It swings opens and two bright orange life preservers fall
on her, knocking her to the ground.

LEX SCREAMS, frantically pushing the life preservers off.

Grant's head pops up.  Timmy runs to her side.  She is wrestling
irrationally with the life preservers.  Timmy drops to the ground.

                            TIMMY
          Lex!  Lex!  You're okay, you're okay!

Lex is overcome with fear.  Timmy grabs a preservers and puts it on.

                            TIMM
Y
          Look, Lex!  Look!

She looks at him, realizes, and bursts out laughing.  Timmy laughs with
her.  Grant joins them.  He sits on a box and laughs.

                            GRANT
          I'm afraid there's no raft.

Grant gets up.  He reaches for the hands of the kids.  Timmy sees it -
the box Grant sat on is labeled: RAFT STORAGE.  Timmy smiles..


AT THE RIVER'S EDGE -

Grant pulls a cord.

With a LOUD HISS, the rubber begins to expand uncontrollably, jerking
and jumping like a wild marionette.  Then, with a whopping HISS-WHAP! it
pops fully open on the deck: a large bright yellow rubber raft.

Timmy and Lex climb in, wearing the life preservers.  Grant gets in and
pushes off with his oars.

The small disturbance causes the cicadas to ROAR.  The raft drifts out
into the lagoon.  Grant fixes his oars into the oarlocks.

Grant surveys the river.

                            GRANT
          Looks pretty calm.

THUMP.  The raft stops moving.  They are aground.  Lex looks overboard.
She reaches in
 about elbow deep.

Grant stands and puts the oars in the water.  He pushes with all his
might.  There is a long scraping sound of the raft against the mud
floor.  But it moves.  And the raft goes into deep enough water.

A general sigh of relief as they gently float downstream.


A WIDE AREA OF THE RIVER -

Grant energetically works the oars.

CLOSE ON - Lex lets her hand trail in the water.

                            LEX
          I'll row, Dr. Grant.

                            GRANT
          No.

But he's sweating and takes a moment to rest.  Lex looks down at her
hand in the water.  It still trails.

                            LEX
          Hey, we're still moving.

Grant looks into the water.  She's right.

                            GRANT
          There's a current.

Grant lays back against the rubber gunwales, closes his eyes.  The two
kids look at him.

                            LEX
          You can't sleep.

                            GRANT
              (eyes closed)
          I'm not sl
eeping... yet.

                            LEX
          I'll do it!

Lex picks up the oars and begins.

                            TIMMY
          We gotta warn them about the boat.

Grant opens one eye and looks up at the sun in the sky.  He sighs and
takes up the oars again.  He rows powerfully with the current.


A BEND IN THE RIVER -

Current picks up speed.  The water begins to rush and ROAR.

                            TIMMY
          Cool!

White foam crashes on the raft and sprays the kids.  They burst out
laughing.  Grant smiles at them, but there is concern in his eyes.


ANOTHER BEND -

Now the raft is really racing.  The kids hold on tightly as the raft is
rocked.  White water crashed over, drenching the kids.  When Grant takes
a moment to look, he is soaked by a huge wave.

The raft tosses right and left.  Timmy holds the rubber grips.  He's
yanked to one side.  He's knocked to the raft floor.  Quickly gets his
grip again.  SHOUTS to Grant.

                            TIMMY
          Thought
 is looked calm?

                            GRANT
          Guess I was wrong.

Grant looks ahead.  The river widens.  The raft really starts to fly.

Lex, gripping very tightly, looks out.  Water sprays her again and
again.  Her face is serious.

                            LEX
          I can't swim!

Grant grabs the raft's tie line and pulls it out of its rubber rings.
He lashes it around Lex and Timmy.  Then he ties it around one of the
rubber grips.

                            GRANT
          Hold on real tight.

They go flying down the river.  The ROAR deafens.

The raft lifts out of the water.  And crashes down, rocking every way.

Jagged rocks appear.  Grant uses his paddle as a club to push off the
rocks and the rushing shoreline.  The kids duck from sudden overhanging
trees.

Grant looks ahead.  He blanches.

HIS POV - the surging edge of a tumultuous waterfall.

They're almost there.  At the huge waterfall, water rushes violently,
heaving over the magnificent precipice.

Timmy tries to tighten L
ex's vest but is thrown back down .  He YELLS:

                            TIMMY
          Hold my hand.  Hold my hand when we go.

The raft spins in the rushing water.  Everyone is thrown around.

The rope holding the kids to the raft tautens. The oars are wrestled out
of Grant's hands and go flying through the air, spilling over the edge.

At the last moment, Grant spots a tree branch arching over the cascade.
With all his might, he stands and holds his balance long enough. to let
his hands smash into the overhanging branch.

They stop right at the waterfall's edge.

Grant struggles mightily to hold onto the branch.  But the water keeps
rushing.  His strength ebbs.

                            TIMMY
          Don't let go!

Grant's veins pop out in his arms.  His hands start to slip off the wet
tree bark.  Lex watches his hands slowly lose their grip.

The rubber raft jumps and leaps below him.  Water pours into the raft.
Lex tries fruitlessly to let it out.  Timmy holds down Grant's feet.

               
             TIMMY
          You can do it!

                            GRANT
          I'm trying.  I'm trying ... Ooooo!!! ....

His hands slipping, slipping ...

                            GRANT
          No!!!!!

                                                      CUT TO:

CLOSE ON - The T-Rex, face down in the mud.


INT  CONTROL ROOM - AFTERNOON

Arnold, Wu, Muldoon, and Ellie stare raptly at the monitor.

                            MULDOON
          Son-of-a-bitch.  He's taking a nap.
          Hasn't been this well fed ... ever.

Hammond is above, in his throne.  He calls down:

                            HAMMOND
          Could he drown in that position?  That's
          a very valuable animal.

                            MULDOON
          I know it's a valuable animal.

Muldoon takes a step up toward Hammond's throne and the two argue
quietly back and forth.  In the foreground, Wu calls Arnold over.

                            WU
          What's that, John?

Wu points to the screen behind 
Arnold's head.  In the upper right-hand
corner, it blinks a yellow warning:  AUX PWR LOW!  Ellie regards it.

                            ELLIE
          You running on auxiliary power?

                            ARNOLD
          I'm not.

                            WU
          Looks like you are.

                            ARNOLD
          Can't be.

                            WU
          Print the system status log.

Arnold nods and rapidly strikes keys.  In the corner, a printer whirs to
life.  Moments later, it spins out a single page.  Arnold tears it off.

Ellie continues to stare at the screen.  It now flashes red:  AUX PWR
FAIL!  An alarm klaxon BLARES.

Hammond holds his ears against the noise.  He stands up.

The room lights begin to FLASH.  They're reflected in Hammond's eyes.
Hammond ROARS above the chaos.

                            HAMMOND
          What the hell is going on?

Onscreen, numbers begin to count backward from ten.  Hammond lurches.
At zero, the lights go off, the monitors,
 even the computer.  Just the
alarms keep screaming.

                            HAMMOND
          You're ruining my ordered, precise park!

Arnold ignores him, keeps pressing buttons.  Hammond rushes toward
Arnold.  Arnold looks over his shoulder in surprise.  Hammond SCREAMS.

                            HAMMOND
          Fix my park, Arnold!  Fix it!

Arnold crosses his hands in front of his face, blocking Hammond's
attack.  Hammond grabs Arnold's wrists and the two twirl to the ground.
Breathing heavily, Hammond clutches his hand to his own chest.

Arnold stands up, brushes off.  He puts himself together, looks at
Hammond.  He SHOUTS over the siren:

                            ARNOLD
          I know it's hard, I know it's hard, but
          I'm going to put it all back together for
          you - I promise.  I will


BACK ON RAFT AT WATERFALL -

Grant still clings to the overhanging branch, holding the raft from
toppling over the crashing waterfall.  Lex and Timmy hold onto his legs.

The ROAR of the
 water diminishes.  And the flow subsides from a raging
current to a rolling river.  And then to a gentle stream.  A trickle.
Nothing.

Grant slowly relaxes, lets go.  So do the children.  Around the raft,
the water level begins to drain.  Gradually, Grant and the kids are left
in the raft sitting in just a few puddles of water.  Around them,
various pumps and other equipment is exposed where it was once covered
by rushing white water.

                            LEX
          The waterfall stopped.

                            TIMMY
          Waterfalls aren't supposed to stop.

                            GRANT
          I think they cut the power.  Hey -

He points and the three of them look over the edge where the waterfall
once poured.  There's a shimmering rainbow and beyond that, in the mist
is the visitor's center.

                            GRANT
          Well, there's our pot of gold.  Let's go,
          kids.

They grab his hands and clamber out of the raft, running toward shore.


BACK ON CON
TROL ROOM -

Muldoon pulls open the blinds and the hot sun filters in, so the room is
alternate patches of bright and dark.

In a hot corner, Ellie squats over a prostate Hammond, mopping his brow
with a cool cloth.  He murmurs, only barely intelligible.

                            HAMMOND
          Told him, fix my park, fix my park.

Wu brings the printout to Arnold.  The printout is a chronological
rendering of control room events since the restart.  It is clear they
have been running on auxiliary power.  Wu yells above the alarm:

                            WU
          You shut down as six thirty-four this
          morning, and when you started back up, it
          was with auxiliary power.

                            ARNOLD
          Jesus.  The auxiliary generator fires up
          first and then that's used to start the
          main generator because it needs a heavy
          charge.  The main generator has to be
          manually reset.

                            WU
          Outside?  In
 the generator building?

Arnold nods.  Muldoon points to a line in the printout:

06:35:22   WARNING: FENCE STATUS (NB)  OPERATIVE - AUX POWER

                            MULDOON
          This doesn't mean the fences have been
          off since six-thirty, does it?

Arnold grabs the paper, looks at it, slams it down.

                            ARNOLD
          Backup power doesn't generate enough
          amperage to power the electrified fences,
          so they were automatically kept off.
          That's also why we had no phones or
          radio.

                            MULDOON
          All of the fences?

                            ARNOLD
          Yes.

                            MULDOON
          Including the velociraptor mesh?

                            ARNOLD
              (disgusted, exhausted)
          Yes, yes, yes.

In the corner, Hammond lifts his head and Ellie gently helps him to a
sitting position.

                            HAMMOND
          Do you mean those raptor
s could be loose?

                            ARNOLD
          I'm afraid so.

                            MULDOON
          No, no way.  Last time, it took 'em two
          days to chew through that mesh.  But give
          'em enough time, they'll get out.  We
          better get that power on now.

                            HAMMOND
          Regardless, check the pit.  Make sure
          there' five of them there.


EXT  VISITOR'S CENTER - AFTERNOON

Muldoon and Arnold run across the lawn.  Muldoon carries his rocket
launcher at a ready position.  In the distance, the alarm still SOUNDS,
lights FLASH a continued warning.

They reach the maintenance building where the generator is housed.  Its
familiar him has been replaced by its own alarms.  The closer they
approach, the louder and brighter these alarms are.  Grey steam pours
out of the vents of the building, obscuring everything.

                            ARNOLD
          What's that steam coming out of my
          generator room?

           
                 MULDOON
          Relax, it's just refrigerated air.
          There's a leaky cooling pipe.  I fixed it
          a couple times before but the original
          installation was at too sharp an angle.

Arnold accepts this.  He is about to enter when Muldoon instructs him.

                            MULDOON
          Just go and turn on your generator, then
          get right back to the control room.

Arnold lights a cigarette and disappears into the steam-shrouded door.


EXT  RAPTOR PIT - AFTERNOON

Muldoon inspects an extremely discouraging sight.  The thick mesh that
covered the pit has been chewed through and ripped open.  With heavy gun
in one hand, Muldoon shines his flashlight into the pit.  It's empty.

Muldoon looks up.

MULDOON'S POV - the dense forest surrounding the Visitor's Center.

Muldoon examines the ground.  He locates the raptor prints leading away

Muldoon breaks into a run.


INT/EXT  GENERATOR ROOM - AFTERNOON

Muldoon comes back to the generator room still runnin
g full-tilt.  He
kicks open the door.  Steam pours out.  Standing in the thick steam,
Muldoon yells for Arnold.  No answer.  He steps in the doorway and
shines his flashlight around.

MULDOON'S POV - Only the dark abstract shapes of rakes and coiled ropes
and small machinery can be seen in the steam.

Muldoon yells again.  No answer at all.  Muldoon curses and leaves.

As soon as Muldoon is gone, there is movement.  Even above the sirens,
an animalistic breathing, grunting can be heard.  Obscured by steam and
flashing lights, a reptilian claw clutches a shadow.  A pack of
cigarettes falls to the ground, spilling out on the floor.


INT  CONTROL ROOM - AFTERNOON

Muldoon enters and confronts Hammond, Ellie, and Wu,

                            MULDOON
          Raptors chewed their way out.  All five
          are out there.

                            ELLIE
          Arnold's not with you?

Muldoon looks around grimly.  He shakes his head.

                            MULDOON
          I was hoping he was ba
ck here already.

Hammond takes charge.

                            HAMMOND
          This is why my quarters were specially
          fortified.  To assist in an emergency just
          like this one.  Let's go.  Muldoon, round
          up the workers.  They'll go with us too.

Muldoon stares at Hammond, then drops it.  They prepare to go.

                            ELLIE
          Wait.  What about Arnold?


EXT  HILLSIDE, PARK -

Grant and the kids come over the hill.  Timmy sees the big fence and the
Visitor's Center close behind.

                            TIMMY
          We're home!

Lex and Grant happily run down the hill.


EXT  ELECTRIFIED FENCE IN PARK - AFTERNOON

Grant and the kids stand in the long shadows of the electric fence.
This huge fence is much higher than what Timmy has had to climb.  Grant
turns to him apologetically.

                            GRANT
          Sorry, Tim.  We gotta climb up.

                            TIM
          That's all right, Dr. Grant.  You owe me
   
       one.


EXT  HAMMOND'S QUARTERS - AFTERNOON

Wu stands at the open sliding gate of the perimeter fence surrounding
Hammond's quarters..  Next to him is Ellie.  Behind both of them,
launcher at the ready, is Muldoon.  Watching from the window above,
Hammond waves.  Ellie and Wu wear radio headsets.

                            MULDOON
          Okay Wu, I'll have you covered at every
          moment.  But this shell carries quite a
          punch, so if you're too close, it'll take
          a piece of you.  Ellie's on the headset
          with you.  If another ones come at you,
          let her know.  Then Ellie - you start
          jumping and yelling.  The buggers are
          easily distracted.  They'll come running
          and let Wu get that power on.  Then both
          of you, get behind this fence as quick as
          possible.

Wu and Ellie nod seriously and test radio contact.  We starts his way
across the lawn, Muldoon limps behind with his launcher.  Ellie stands
ready at the open 
gate.

Wu takes slow steps.  Muldoon follows.  Wu is just five feet away from
the door to the generator building.

CLOSE ON - Wu's tense face.

THE ATTACK is sudden and fierce.  It comes from the brush.  The raptor
leaps onto Wu in an instant.  Wu and the raptor roll on the ground.  Wu
struggles for his life.  Muldoon can't get a safe shot.  He SCREAM:

                            MULDOON
          Wu, get away.  Give me room to shoot.

Ellie comes running away from the safety of the gate.  She jumps up and
down, waving her hands, and SCREAMS:

                            ELLIE
          Hey you cretaceous dromaeosaur, you can't
          catch me.  Hey, come and get me, you
          flat-snouted Mongolian beast.  Hey!

The Raptor is distracted by this.  He lets Wu go for a moment, shaking
him loose from his bloody jaws.  Instantly, Wu rolls away.  Muldoon
fires the rocket launcher.  With a SIZZLE, the missile fires.  BOOM!
Direct hit!  The raptor is blown to tiny pieces.

Muldoon grabs Wu and pulls the inju
red man to safety.

                            MULDOON
          You ok?

In reply Wu gets to his feet, looks where the Raptor was.

                            WU
          Now, there's four.

Muldoon helps Wu back inside the fence.  He waves for Ellie to come in
and join them.

Ellie takes off toward the generator building.  She YELLS:

                            ELLIE
          I'm going in.  Muldoon, cover the door
          after I go in.  Wu, guide me!

Muldoon yells for her to wait but stops when he realizes that this may
be their best plan.

Ellie races like a gazelle across the open lawn.  She's very fast and
graceful.  She ducks into the generator building.

Above it all, Hammond watches at the small viewing window.


BACK ON - GRANT AND KIDS AT FENCE

The three are at the top of the fence now.  Grant carefully lifts Lex
above the barbed wire and she grabs onto the other side of the fence to
begin the climb down.  Grant grabs Tim and lifts him next.  Tim's tense
face is a river of sweat.


INT  GE
NERATOR BUILDING -

Ellie finishes the stairs and feels her way along the basement wall.
Her face is lit by a flashing yellow light.  She bangs her head on a
pipe.  She rubs her head.

                            ELLIE
          Damn, I banged my head.

                            WU (OVER RADIO)
          Oh that's good, that must be the water
          pipe.  You're really close now, there's a
          cabinet just above your head.  Reach up
          and open it.  The handle turns to the
          left.

Ellie turns the handle.  The cabinet opens.

                            WU (OVER RADIO)
          It's a large throw-switch.  Pull it down,
          count to three, and push it back up.
          That's all there is to it.

Ellie throws it down.  She counts:

                            ELLIE
          One -


BACK ON GRANT AND KIDS -

Just a few feet from the bottom of the fence.


BACK ON ELLIE -

                            ELLIE
          Two -


BACK ON GRANT AND KIDS -

Grant and Timmy jump down. 
 Lex is just behind.  Her sneaker catches in
the fence pattern.  She pulls on it.


BACK ON ELLIE -

                            ELLIE
          Three!

She throws the large switch back.


BACK ON LEX -

She jumps off the fence.  Her sneaker comes off, falls to the ground.

CAMERA PUSHES IN ON LEX - it celebrates her narrow escape.

Grant casually leans against the fence to help Lex with her shoe.
NOTHING!  STILL NO ELECTRIC FENCES!

The Visitor's Center is in sight.  They all turn to each other.  Elated.

                            LEX
          We did it!

                            TIM
          We made it!

Lex jumps up and down.  Grant smiles, high-fives Timmy.


BACK ON ELLIE -

The siren and the flashing lights stop.  The room lights go on.  Ellie
turns to go back upstairs.  Her foot slips, she falls to the ground.
She has slipped on a pool of blood.  She jumps up, recoils.

It's Arnold.  She squelches a SCREAM, covering her own mouth.

SMASH!  Ellie SCREAMS as a raptor lunges at her.   He jumps down
 from
above the water pipe Ellie banged her head on.

Ellie turns and races toward a ventilation shaft.  She dives into it.
The raptor gets there a second late and smashes against the shaft wall.

Ellie pushes herself against the shaft wall and, using her legs to push
against the wall, begins to climb up.

The raptor smashes against the shaft again and gets inside.  Ellie
scrambles up.  The raptor snarls and spits but it is momentarily pinned.

Ellie continues her scramble up the shaft.  At ground level, she slams
her feet hard against a vent, popping it open.  Scraping the wall and
banging against pipes, she races toward the door.


EXT  GENERATOR BUILDING - CONTINUING ACTION

Ellie runs full-tilt toward the fence surrounding Hammond's quarters.
Wu, injured, lies within the safety of the fenced area.  Muldoon stands
with his rocket launcher just outside the fence waiting for Ellie.
Ellie screams to him as she speeds across the lawn.

                            ELLIE
          Raptor!

The raptor EXPLODES th
rough the door of the generator building after
Ellie.

Muldoon fires at the raptor. Misses.  No time to reload.

The raptor gains on Ellie.  Muldoon ducks inside the fence's heavy gate.
He slides the gate half-shut, waving Ellie on.

Ellie dives inside the safety of the fence, losing her headset as she
goes.  The gate is almost closed.  The raptor lunges.

Muldoon slides shut the heavy gate, bashing the raptor's head with all
his might.  The raptor shudders, caught in the gate.  Stunned, for a
second, it doesn't move.

Ellie and Muldoon run to the building.  They push open the steel-clad
security door and dive inside.  Wu limping, chases after them.  With a
curse, Muldoon pushes the door back open, waves for Wu.

ELLIE AND MULDOON'S POV - Wu runs frantically.  The raptor jerks out of
the gate, inside of the fence.  He races after Wu.

                            WU
          Keep it open!  I'm coming!

Wu runs faster.  The raptor gains on him.  Wu screams, runs spastically.
Wu and the raptor are neck-and-neck
, equally close to the open door.

                            ELLIE
          Come on, Wu!  Come on!  Run!

The raptor is inches from Wu.  Both are closer and closer to the door.

                            ELLIE
          They're coming inside!

                            WU
          Help!

Wu and the raptor are at the door.

                            MULDOON
          No they're not, Ellie.

Muldoon slams the door shut on Wu and the raptor.  Wu's screams are
horrific.


INT  HAMMOND'S QUARTERS - CONTINUING ACTION

Ellie drops to her knees, her chest heaving, pulls her headset off with
a bleeding hand.  Muldoon, affected, turns to her.

                            MULDOON
          I couldn't compromise everyone's safety.

Ellie nods, catches her breath.

                            ELLIE
          Why didn't the power go on?

                            MULDOON
          You just reset the power.  Now the
          computer has to be booted.

Muldoon looks out the tiny barred window of the security do
or.

MULDOON'S POV - There is already almost no sign of Wu.  The gate to the
perimeter fence slides shut.  The raptor looks up.  He is trapped within
the perimeter fence of Hammond's quarters.

CAMERA SLOWLY TILTS to the viewing window above.  Hammond stares down.


INT  VISITOR'S CENTER -

Grant and kids walk through the open security doors.  All is empty and
quiet.  They call out but there are no answers.

                            LEX
          Where did everybody go?

Grant thinks.

                            GRANT
          Probably your grandfather's quarters.
          Let's go.

A DISTANT BELLOW.  Grant reconsiders.

                            GRANT
          Actually, stay here.

He corrals the kids into the half completed enclosure of the Gift Shop.

                            LEX
          No, I want to stay with you.

Grant looks around tensely.

                            GRANT
          No, keep an eye on things round here for
          me.  I'll be back with the others.

                 
           TIMMY
          What about -

Grant looks at Timmy.

                            GRANT
          I'll radio the ship as soon as I find
          somebody.  (beat)  You're in charge now.
          Don't move from here ... unless you have
          to, ok?

Timmy nods.  Lex is happy, sinks to the floor.

                            LEX
          Goody!  I'm gonna rest.

She finds a box of wind-up dinosaur toys. She winds one. Sends it
walking to Timmy.

                            TIMMY
          Tired!  He carried you the whole way.

Grant slips off into the concealing shadows of the skeletal display of
the T-rex and raptor in combat.  He looks back above his own shoulder
into the menacing jaws of the skeletal raptor.  He shouts back.

                            GRANT
          Be right back.


INT  HAMMOND'S QUARTERS -

It's a madhouse in the crowded baronial quarters of Hammond.  Gennaro is
singing at the top of his-lungs while Harding tries to restrain him.
Scared Workers huddle together, many a
re injured.  Hammond sits on the
floor, in a meditative trance.

Ellie and Muldoon stare out the window.

THEIR POV - The raptor is jumping in the air.  With every jump he comes
closer to leaping onto the roof of their small building.

Muldoon regards his rocket launcher ruefully.

                            ELLIE
          Why don't you just nail that bastard?

                            MULDOON
          No more ammo.  I requisitioned six
          charges but the bean-counter -
              (he thrusts a finger at Hammond)
          - cut it down to two.

Ellie looks up to the ceiling.  There is a large glass skylight with
crisscrossing iron bars casting an ominous shadow in the sun.


EXT  THE ANNE B AT SEA - DAY

The ship continues along smooth sunlit sea.  Land is in distant sight.


INT  STATEROOM -

The cracked egg is nudged open.  The cute scaly head of a six-inch baby
raptor nuzzles its way out of the shell.  It shakes off a few pieces of
clinging shell and immediately begins to devour one of the
 remaining eggs.

                                                      CUT TO:

CLOSE ON - The wind-up dinosaur skitters across the polished floor.  It
bands against the  the wall again and again.

Timmy looks down at it and smiles at Lex.

                            LEX
          Any candy behind the counter?

                            TIMMY
          Hungry?

                            LEX
          Starved.

Timmy looks behind the counter.  He sees boxes of goods.  He moves a
stack of umbrellas out of his way.  Lex gets up and pulls one out.

                            TIMMY
          Nothing.

                            LEX
          Let's go to the kitchen.

She smiles and pops to her feet.  Timmy's not sure.

                            TIMMY
          Dr. Grant said -

                            LEX
          - let's go.  We'll come right back.

CLOSE ON - Timmy's torn face.  He's hungry, too.

He makes the right decision.

                            TIMMY
          Nope.  We're waiting here t
ill Dr. Grant
          gets back.  He'll help us get some -

Interrupted by A SOUND.  A rhythmic, horrible BREATHING.   Now some
light and rapid STEPS.  And a SNIFFING.  It's definitely an animal.

Lex backs off in a hurry. She knocks the umbrella over.  It skirts
across the floor.  It spins and opens by itself.  Printed on it is the
ferocious face of the Spitter, the sides of its bright poisonous gills
spinning to a stop.

The breathing gets closer and closer.  The children huddle together in a
corner of the gift shop.  They SCREAM.

It's A RAPTOR, lean and ferocious.  More like a cyborg than a hunter, it
studies the kids from just outside the gift shop entrance.  His eyes
flick back and forth between the two pieces of meat.

Timmy grabs the box of toy dinosaurs.  He winds one up and sends it off
across the hall.  The raptor glances over at the moving toy.  Timmy
grabs another, whispers as he winds it.

                            TIMMY
          Start winding now!

Lex and Timmy wind toy after toy, send th
em across the hall.  The raptor
leaps, crushing one in its jaws.  Others waddle by.  The raptor dodges
and darts, grabbing this one, smashing that one.

The kids go running out into the hall.  They race down the Visitor
Center corridor.  Timmy pulls Lex behind him toward the restaurant.

                            LEX
          Where are we going?

                            TIM
          The kitchen!


INT/EXT  HAMMOND'S QUARTERS -

With a huge leap, the raptor finally makes it to the roof of Hammond's
quarters.  He jumps lightly onto the skylight.  Glass shatters over the
assembled guests and workers below.  Total commotion and SCREAMS.

The raptor immediately begins to gnaw at the iron bars that block the
skylight.  Below, they shake off shards of glass and huddle in the
corners.  Ellie turns to Muldoon.

                            ELLIE
          How long?

                            MULDOON
          Well, they seem to be getting faster all
          the time. I would say - fifteen minutes.

Ellie no
tices something out the window.  It's Grant approaching the
gate.  She hammers on the glass.

Grant's hand reaches for the knob.

The raptor stops gnawing, its ears perked up.

Ellie screams and screams.

Grant notices some of Wu's remains inside the gate.  He stops and looks
up.  At the window, Ellie waves her arms, warning him not to enter.
Grant stops.  He sees Wu's headset on the grass, reaches through the
fence, grabs it, puts it on.

Ellie jumps up and gets her headset.  She barks into it.

                            ELLIE
          There's a raptor on the roof of this
          building.  Open that gate and you're a
          dead man.

Grant stares up at Ellie in the window.  He waves.  She presses her hand
to the glass.

                            GRANT
          Ellie, I'm go glad -

                            ELLIE
          Shut up and listen.  We have about
          fifteen minutes here.  The computer has
          to be rebooted.  That'll turn on the
          electric fences.  Besides the r
aptor
          stuck in here with us, there are four
          more ...

Grant races back to the Visitor's Center as she continues to fill him in.


INT  KITCHEN, VISITOR'S CENTER - CONTINUING ACTION

The kids hurtle through this huge, industrial kitchen.  The kitchen is a
maze of turns, from the hot lamp pickup area to the rows of stainless
steel burners to the chopping blocks to the potwashing area.  The kids
dart and duck from one area to the next, taking shortcuts under tables,
crawling behind counters, scattering pots and pans behind.

Relentlessly, with a casual speed, the raptor stalks them.  It avoids
their obstacles with a casual grace and when it cannot fit through their
shortcuts, it just continues around.

Timmy pulls open the large silvered door of the freezer.  Lex starts to
hurry inside.  Timmy grabs her.

                            TIMMY
          We'll freeze to death in there.

                            LEX
          He's going to eat us!

Timmy reaches into the freezer and grabs a pile 
of steaks.  He tosses one
toward the raptor.  The raptor gobbles it in one bite.  Timmy shoves Lex
out of the way and begins to toss the steaks on the floor.  One after the
other, he tosses them, in a row, closer and closer to the open freezer.

The raptor mechanically gobbles the steaks, following their path.  He
continues right into the freezer to grab the last of Tim's bait.

Tim leaps and slams the heavy freezer door shut.  Lex comes running and
throws her small weight alongside of Timmy's.

                            TIMMY
          PUSH!

The heave and the lock catches on the door.  From inside, there is a
strangled CRY and the door is slammed repeatedly.  The metal panels of
the door buckle but they do not break.  The door hinges bend and curve
but they do not give.

The kids collapse in relief on the kitchen floor.  In just a moment,
Timmy is back on his feet.

                            LEX
          What is it, Timmy?

                            TIMMY
          I just remembered something.  Rapto
rs are
          born in large litters.  There's probably
          more coming.  We gotta hide.

He grabs her hand and they run out of the back entrance of the kitchen.
There's a stairway and they race up.


INT  GIFT SHOP -

Grant, wearing his headset, calls for the kids and looks around the gift
shop with concern.  He sniffs the air and examines the crushed windup
toys.  He sees some animal scales on the floor.  He hears a NOISE above
and begins to run.


INT  UPPER FLOOR HALLWAY, VISITOR'S CENTER -

The kids hear this NOISE too and it's closer to them.  They bust into -


INT  AMBER ROOM, LABORATORY -

The kids knock over trays of stones as they rush through this room.


INT  EXTRACTION ROOM, LABORATORY -

Automated drills whir as Tim and Lex crash through, knocking equipment
to the ground.  The drills still whir on the ground.


INT  GENETICS ROOM -

The Hamachi-Hood sequencers explode in a heap of punch cards and
magnetic tape as the kids race by.


INT  INCUBATION ROOM, LABORATORY -

The kids slide int
o this room.  They race to its far corner, past
incubators and display cases of chemicals.  They look back and see -

KID'S POV - A raptor happily gorging itself on a table of eggs.  He's
been in this room, their place of refuge, the whole time.

CLOSE ON - The raptor's glistening eyes register the children.

He begins to stalk.  The kids SCREAM.  This time there is nowhere to go.

The raptor closes in on the kids.  Timmy feebly stands in front of his
younger sister.

CLOSE ON - The raptor licks its lips, lizard-like.

At the other end of the room, GRANT ENTERS quickly.  He surveys the
situation.  Quickly, he grabs an egg off a table.  He reaches into one
of the chemical cabinets with POISON WARNINGS prominently displayed.  He
comes out with a syringe and a vial.

The raptor is almost on the kids.  Grant coughs conspicuously.  The
raptor whirls, studies Grant.  He looks back at the children.

Grant speaks into the headset.

                            GRANT (TO RADIO)
          Talk, Ellie, just keep talking.

He tosses the headset on the ground.  Ellie's voice crackles out.  The
raptor studies it, transfixed.

Grant injects the egg, then gently rolls it on the ground.  The raptor
forgets the headset.  He comes forward and sniffs the egg, then sucks it
up, swallowing it whole.

The raptor turns back to the kids.  He takes two steps toward them,
tenses to pounce - and keels over.  DEAD.

The kids race around the dead raptor to Grant.  Grant grabs his headset
as the three run out of the room.  Grant addresses Timmy as they run.

                            GRANT
          Timmy, you know anything about computers?

                            TIMMY
          Well, I just got an XT at home.  I told
          my Dad I wanted a 386.

                            GRANT
          Ok good, you're elected.


INT  CONTROL ROOM -

Grant and Tim and Lex study the quiet room.  Grant speaks calmly into
his headset.

                            GRANT (TO RADIO)
          Okay, we've reached the computer room.
          Who can te
ll Timmy how to reboot?

                            ELLIE (OVER RADIO)
          Ah, Alan, nobody here knows how to boot
          the computer.  Please hurry, we've only
          got a couple minutes left.

                            GRANT
          Tim, you got to book the system.  They
          reset the power and there are no phones.
          We gotta turn on the fences and we gotta
          stop that ship.

                            LEX
          Are they going to be ok?

                            GRANT
          If we can get help very soon.

                            TIMMY
          Sshh, you guys, I'm thinking.

He studies a grid on a large console.  He reaches out and touches a part
of the screen.  There is a beep and a warning sign - INVALID ARGUMENT.
PLEASE TRY AGAIN.


BACK ON  HAMMOND'S QUARTERS -

The raptor has chewed almost all the way through the bars.  Panic below.
In the middle of it all, Ellie is focused, listening on her headset.


BACK ON  CONTROL ROOM -

Timmy tries somethin
g else.  BEEP.  Lex raises a hand.  Grant stops her.

                            GRANT (TO RADIO)
          Ellie, we're working as fast as we can
          here.

Timmy tries a screen section.  BEEP.  Again. BEEP.  Again.  BEEP.  BEEP.

Timmy shakes his head.  In desperation he stabs at the keyboard below
the touch screen.  He punches the ESCAPE button.

The screen lights up a new message - SYSTEM RESET COMPLETED.  ALL
SYSTEMS NORMAL.


BACK ON  HAMMOND'S QUARTERS -

The raptor has just chewed through.  He squeezes his body into the space
as the bars ELECTRIFY.  Spastically, the raptor jerks back and forth as
the current flows through him.  He can't get out.

Finally, with a WHIMPER, he stops struggling and slides through the
space he created.  With a THUMP, he drops to the floor below.

Ellie, Muldoon, Hammond and the workers look on in shock.


BACK ON  CONTROL ROOM -

Grant cheers and hugs Timmy.  Lex whoops.

                            ELLIE (ON RADIO)
          Ok, we're all right here for now.
      
    Thanks.

                            GRANT (TO RADIO)
          Don't mention it.  It was Timmy.

                            ELLIE (ON RADIO)
          But there's still one more raptor.  So be
          careful.

Timmy is pushing menus and submenus on the touchscreen now.
COMMUNICATIONS - RADIO - VEHICULAR ...  He gets the one he wants.

He indicates the radio-mike to Grant.

                            TIM
          I think this is the boat.  They called it
          the Queen Anne or something.

Grant grabs the mike.

                            GRANT
          Queen Anne, do you read me?  Queen Anne?

The radio crackles to life.

                            RADIO
          This is the Queen Anne B?  I copy.
          What's up?

                            GRANT
          Report your position!

                            RADIO
          Ah, we're just about to dock here in
          Puntaremas.  Who wants to know?  Please
          identify yourself.

Tim punches the screen which displays FARRELL, F
REDERICK D. (CAPT.)
Grant reads it and nods.  His voice is tough as nails.

                            GRANT
          Try this for identification, Captain
          Farrell.  You are in possession of stolen
          biological materials.  If you don't turn
          that boat around and return to Isla
          Nublar immediately with your contraband
          cargo, you will be found in violation of
          Section 509 of the Uniform Maritime Act,
          you will be subject to revocation of
          license, penalties in excess of fifty
          thousand dollars, and five years in jail.
          Do you copy?

SILENCE.

                            GRANT
          Do you copy, Captain Farrell?

                            RADIO
          I copy.  All ahead stern.

A blinking light on a map indicates that the ship is pulling away from
the harbor.  Grant nods to Timmy who terminates the radio contact.

                            TIMMY
          What's the Uniform Maritime Code?

                     
       GRANT
          Who the hell knows?

Grant and Timmy start to celebrate again when Lex interrupts.

                            LEX
          What good does that do?  To have the ship
          turn around?

Grant turns to her seriously.

                            GRANT
          Well it gives us ten more hours.
              (to Timmy)
          Let's see if we can raise the Costa Rican
          Coast Guard on that thing.

The last raptor smashes into the control room through Hammond's viewing
window.  Glass goes flying.  Grant and kids go running into the hallway.


INT ROTUNDA -

With the raptor in hot pursuit, the kids and Grant come flying.  Tim and
Lex jump over the railing, leaping onto the skeletal display.  Grant
goes for the stairs, jumping down them three at a time.

The raptor goes after the kids, scrambling over the balcony onto the
display.  The kids scamper down the display, knocking paint cans and
tools off the scaffolding as they go.  The raptor is just one beat
behind, and his snar
ling face is splashed with red paint as he chases.

The kids burrow into the rib cage of the Rex.  They break off floating
rubs and hurl them back at the raptor.  The raptor is undeterred,
closing the gap on the kids.

The kids are stuck at the end of the rib cage - it's closed off by the
skeleton and they can't break through.  They're imprisoned.  The raptor
is pushing through the rib cage, bones crackling as it goes.

Grant leaps up the scaffolding, grabs a beam, swings his weight onto it,
and slams it into the T-Rex's neck.  The neck shatters and the massive
head of the T-Rex drops free.

It falls directly onto the last raptor, squashing him flat.  Dead.

                            GRANT
              (grimly)
          And then there were none.


EXT  HELICOPTER PAD - DUSK

Muldoon leads his workers onto an army helicopter.  Two workers carry
Gennaro on a stretcher.  Ellie boards with the kids on each side of her,
holding her hands.

Grant and Hammond walk together, toward the helicopter.

              
              HAMMOND
          Dr. Grant, don't abandon this beautiful
          place.  I need a man just like you to
          help me get my park back on its feet
          again.  And it will be on its feet again.

                            GRANT
          We have to leave now.

Hammond stops.

                            HAMMOND
          Oh you don't know.  There are wonderful
          plans in the works, sites already
          purchased for Euro-Jurassic and Jurassic
          Japan.

Grant is unimpressed.  He holds a hand out to Hammond.  Hammond tries a
new approach.

                            HAMMOND
          Don't you see I've exalted human
          potential here?  You must see it.  You
          must feel it.  I called back a life form.
          Listen, Dr. Grant, don't go.  Be a part
          of this.  I'm inviting you to do just
          that - let the others go, if they want.

                            GRANT
          You interrupted natural law.  There are
          regulations,
 rules that nature follows
          that make her knowable.

                            HAMMOND
          You mean there are rules that nature
          follows that create barriers to our
          knowledge.

                            GRANT
          Barriers?  Like the seasons?  The earth
          spinning, orbiting the sun?  The entire
          solar system in interlocking motion.  Our
          own beings in biological step with it
          all.  Mr. Hammond, you've disrupted the
          pattern and look what it's done!

                            HAMMOND
          I know what it's done.  I've made
          triceratops and gallimimus and a T-Rex.
          I've got a batch of iguanadons being born
          on Tuesday.  What do you say to that?

                            GRANT
          Don't count on it.  Now get in.

Grant jumps in the copter, holds out a hand to Hammond.

                            GRANT
          You created mutant forms that you further
          mutated to create amus
ement attractions.
          You made biological puppets with
          heartbeats and an early death sentence.

                            HAMMOND
          I created genetic miracles!

                            GRANT
          You created a park to generate a profit-
          making merchandising operation.

                            HAMMOND
          The merchandise is just a by-product.
          Souvenirs for people to reflect on the
          wonder.  You fainted when you saw the
          brachiosaur.  Alan, look, let's not
          argue.  The problem is that my employees
          were not up to par with my dream.  They
          failed me.  The park, I promise you, is
          safe.  It really is.

Grant grabs Hammond's arm, starts to tug.

                            GRANT
          You park is doomed.  Now come with me.
          
                            HAMMOND
          It is not!  It's blooming!  In the throes
          of labor!  You are one more more negative
          voice in a 
universe of negativity.
          You'll amount to nothing.  You'll be a
          bone-brusher all your life.  I pity you.

Hammond pulls his arm away and strides away from the helicopter just as
the ROTORS START UP.  Hammond's suit whips in the wind.  Grant calls to
him, reaching out his arm.

                            GRANT
          Come back, Mr. Hammond!  It's over!

Hammond keeps walking.  He disappears over a grassy knoll.

Grant's outstretched hand drops to his side when THE ATTACK comes.

With a huge bellow, the T-Rex comes charging at the helicopter.  THE
PILOT screams for all to board as he starts to lift off.

The Rex bites onto the copter skid as the copter tries to escape.  The
copter angles dangerously as the Rex holds on.

Ellie fires a fire-extinguisher into the furious face of the Rex and its
jaws relax.  The copter escapes and starts to climb high into the sky.
The Rex paws after it, then drops down to four legs and gives the copter
a final swipe with its tail.

The tail SWISHES through 
the air and CRACKS against the plexiglass
windshield which fissures and pops.  The pilot struggles to maintain
altitude and manages to keep the craft in the air.

With a ROAR of its own, the copter breaks into the blue sky and soars.
away, leaving an angry T-Rex alone.  Unnoticed by the frustrated Rex,
Hammond slips away and walks into the jungle.


IN THE COPTER -

SLOWLY PAN the exhausted faces of Muldoon and his workers, Lex and Timmy
holding onto each other, and Grant huddles next to Ellie.  He reaches
out and puts an arm around her shoulder.  She reaches up and pulls his
arm close.

                            ELLIE
          They're so beautiful.  They're condemned,
          aren't they?  Even those embryo fragments
          had the same viral contamination.

                            GRANT
          I have a theory.

Ellie looks up in surprise.  She give him a big smile.

                            ELLIE
          You have a theory?

Grant smiles back at her.

                            GRANT
   
       I think that they could never completely          
          isolate the dinosaur DNA.  There was
          always some microscopic mosquito
          contamination.  But at the molecular
          level, that was enough.  Every dinosaur
          received the same genetic massage, the
          encoding that every mosquito gets to
          terminate life after a season.

                            ELLIE
          So the very process itself was flawed.

She's sad.  Grant hugs her.  Over her shoulder he gives a parting glance
to the island.  A green jewel in a blue sea.  Suddenly it is obliterated
by clouds.

CAMERA PANS AWAY AND SWOOPS DOWN from the copter.  IT CROSSES the sky.
THE CAMERA DESCENDS to Isla Nublar, slowly reveling in its natural
beauty and finally coming to earth in the midst of the verdant jungle.


IN THE JUNGLE - MAGIC HOUR

Hammond slowly climbs a steep hill covered with creeping growth.  He
almost reaches the top when he slips.  He falls to the soft ground and
rolls. He tumbles he
lplessly, rolling and spinning down the sharp drop,
finally coming to a complete stop in a shallow pool of water.  Face
down, his head splashes into the puddle.  No movement. Just the sound of
labored breath.

CAMERA PANS to Hammond's hand, half-submerged in water.  CAMERA MOVES
INTO EXTREME CLOSEUP as a mosquito lands on his hand.

                                         RACK OUT AND DISSOLVE TO:


EXT  OCEAN - NIGHT

The army copter circles lower and lower as it finds the Queen Anne B,
slowly drifting across the moonlit water.

                                                      FADE OUT.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

EXTREME CLOSEUP of glowing honey-colored stones.  Their shapes ABSTRACT
as THE CAMERA EXAMINES air bubbles and crystalline patterns.

MOVING UP AND OVER this amber abstraction, the CAMERA FINDS unusual
shapes and imperfections caught in the glassy stone:  flecks of dirt,
hairs, cracks.  STILL MOVING.  STARBURSTS OF LIGHT ricochet off the
different surfaces of the stones.

CAMERA TURNS along a creamy stretch of amber.  IT TURNS IN DEEPER,
abstracting the picture further only to find A TINY BLUR that suddenly
RACKS INTO FOCUS - a bug, a mosquito lodged within an amber tomb.  It is
folded on its back.

SLOW MOTION
 as the tip of a fine-pointed drill bores into the amber
toward the trapped bug.  Orange flecks fly.  The mosquito trembles.  The
drill continues, stopping just before it touches the tiny body.

A SHINY PAIR of thin needle-nose pliers reach in the borehole and
extricate the mosquito remains.  These are dropped on a brightly lit
glass slide.  A conveyor belt starts, and the slide moves along.
arriving under a long-lensed microscope.

IN MICROSCOPIC PERSPECTIVE, a thin needle pierces the bug and delicately
removes a fragment of tissue.

PINCERS snare the fragment, dropping it into a narrow tube.  The tube
SPINS, faster and faster until it is a BLUR on the screen.

THE SCREEN FLOODS with an INFRA-RED LIGHT.  Gray, oval shapes rock in a
neutral mist.

                                                     WASH OUT TO:

HOT SUN overhead in a BIG SKY -


EXT  BADLANDS - AFTERNOON

Lodged in the cracked earth are the partially-exposed fossilized remains
of A VELOCIRAPTER, a carnivorous dinosaur.  WIDEN OUT to a SWEEPI
NG
PANORAMA of a dinosaur dig, a major excavation filled with workers
shoveling earth and stone, making measurements, taking photographs,
scribbling notes, and conferring with each other.

The center of all this activity is one man.  In a roped-off area that
circumscribes the exposed bones of the raptor, is DR. ALAN GRANT, head
paleontologist.  Good-looking, late 30's, with a think beard.

Grant lies on his belly, completely absorbed in a small piece of bone.
A GROUP OF TWELVE STUDENTS, notebooks in hand, await his next sentence.

CLOSE ON - the tiny bone.  Grant's nose touches it.

Grant brushes the bone with a toothbrush.  Then he decides on a quicker
way to clean it.  He licks it.  Excited by his discovery, he gets to his
feet and addresses his students, who listen raptly.

                            GRANT
          Right calcaneus of an adult female
          raptor.  Mild stress fractures.  What's
          this tell me?

Students look at each other.  A tentative hand.  Grant continues.

               
             GRANT
          It tells me that this bone connects to
          the navicula which we already found
          articulating to the cuboid.

OFFSCREEN, a woman SHOUTS to him.

                            ELLIE (off)
          Dr. Grant!  Dr. Grant!

Grant looks up.

DR. ELLIE SATTLER, late 20's, sharp-eyed, tough if she wants to be, runs
like a gazelle across the arid land.  Exuberant, she leaves a trail of
dust behind her.

She zips by A STUDENT guarding the cordoned area.  He tries to stop her.

                            STUDENT
          Dr. Sattler!  Dr. Grant is thinking!

Dr. Grant waves her over enthusiastically with his bone and continues.

                            GRANT
          So, what can we stay for sure?  Stress
          fractures in the heel ...

Uncertain students.  Ellie arrives and immediately gets into it.

                            ELLIE
          She jumps.

Grant turns around to her and smiles.  She's got it.  Other students to
- they knew is all along.

            
                GRANT
          Right as rain, Ellie.  Now, why did she
          jump?

No answer.  Ellie gives it a try.

                            ELLIE
          A defensive posture against a vicious,
          blood-thirsty T-Rex?

                            GRANT
              (nodding)
          Perhaps.  Or maybe to select the smaller,
          more tender leaves in the higher branches
          with which to suckle her young?

Ellie jumps up.

                            ELLIE
          I bet is was a mating ritual.

Students laugh.  One student eyes Grant's self-conscious smile at Ellie.

                            GRANT
          The science of paleontology can't answer
          these questions.  Novelists and artists
          who dream a vision of the Jurassic period
          can attempt these questions with their
          imaginations.  What we scientists can say
          is considering the mass and kinetic
          articulation of these bones, this animal
          had a vertical leap
 of about twelve feet.
          Not as entertaining as fiction, but
          absolutely fact without prejudice.

Ellie intrudes again.

                            ELLIE
          Excuse me, Dr. Grant.  But ... fact is,
          we're late.  There's the car.

She points.  On the horizon, a limousine speeds toward them, leaving a
dusty wake.

Grant sets the rules for his departure, giving instructions individually
as Ellie pulls him away, carrying their bags.

                            GRANT
          Jim, you keep making up the plaster
          batches.  Whatever ratio you're using,
          it's perfect.  Nora, no digging after
          five - when the temperature drops, those
          bones are just too brittle.  Bill, I
          don't want any tourists walking over my
          raptor - I don't care if the Governor of
          Montana is with them, just you guys.

Grant and Ellie continue walking.  She interrupts his continued barrage.

                            ELLIE
          You know, if ev
ery scientist stuck to his
          method like you, there would be no body
          of theory - no quasars, no big bang -

Grant stops at the sight of the stopped limo and freezes.

                            GRANT
          Jesus, a limousine.  We're re-entering
          Hammond's world, that's for sure.  (beat)
          Remind me why we're doing this, Ellie.

Ellie is gentle.  She's telling him something they've discussed before.

                            ELLIE
          We're leaving the raptor dig -

                            GRANT
          - at a critical time -

                            ELLIE
          - because Gennaro is paying us sixty
          thousand dollars to observe some resort
          of Hammond's in Costa Rica. And that's -

                            GRANT
          - enough money to keep us free of
          commercial affiliations for two summers.
          All right, all right.  Good.

Then, half-kidding with Ellie:

                            GRANT
          Financial
 independence for fraternizing
          with the enemy?  (beat)  I'll do it.

She laughs.  But he can't quite leave.  He grabs a computer printout

                            GRANT
          This is all could come up with, Skip?

Skip turns the printout right-side up in Grant's hand.  Grant smiles.

                            GRANT
          Wise guy.  Let's go, Ellie.

Grant and Ellie board the limo amidst many goodbyes from the students.
The limo pulls away.


EXT  HIGH TECH BUILDING - BIOGENETIC CORPORATION HQ - SUNSET

A purple sunset irradiates the exterior glass walls of the building.


INT  BIOGEN HQ

A peanut flies in the air.  Then falls into a big open mouth.  THOMP.

                            MOUTH
          Five hundred thousand is peanuts!

He tosses another peanut and misses his open mouth.  This is DENNIS
NEDRY, a 40 year old computer programmer.  He's fat, with greasy hair
and a permanently wrinkled suit.  His slovenly looks are wildly out of
place on the rich leather sofa where he reclin
es.

Across a gleaming granite coffee table is BILL BAKER, businessman.  A
smooth meticulous dresser, Baker is disgusted by Nedry's sloppy
appearance and voracious consumption of food and drink.

Nedry finishes a coke.  Over his shoulder is an impressive skyline view.

                            NEDRY
          I'm not reneging.  I'm re-evaluating.

Nedry holds the can of coke upside-down, drains the last drops.

                            NEDRY
          You think I'm a scumbag, I know.

Nedry chuckles, lines up three peanuts on the table.  One after the
other, he throws them in the air.  He gulps down two, misses one. It
skids across the glossy floor.

Baker's head involuntarily cocks as he looks disgustedly at Nedry.

                            NEDRY
          Look pal, you make a career in biogenetic
          industrial espionage, and you're bound to
          run across a scumbag or two.  Guaranteed!
          Part of the job description.  Look, who's
          to say, who is the real scumbag?  After
          all, I know what you guys need so bad.
          I've heard of reverse engineering.

As Nedry continues he shovels nuts into his mouth and CHOMPS and SPEAKS.

                            NEDRY
          Let the other guy put in all the work,
          all the R and D.  You take the finished
          product, work backwards, breaking it down
          to reveal its genetic code.  Presto!  In
          a few measly months you have know-how
          that took researchers ten years to
          determine.  You know how much Hammond has
          invested of his own personal wealth?
          Over five billion dollars!  And if you
          guys get the jump on his - in no time,
          the market's wide-open.

Nedry starts the LAUGH as he EATS and TALKS.

                            NEDRY
          But, boy, he's really got his product!
          Oh yes siree, massive, gargantuan, money-
          making, never-heard-of-profit-like-that
          product.  It is a sight!  Yes, indeedy!

Nedry LAUGH
S explosively.  He begins to choke, COUGHING and GASPING.

Baker is repulsed.  He stares out the window as the sun sets.

Nedry, in true distress, clutches his own throat.  He clumsily runs
toward Baker, toppling chairs as he goes.  Nedry grabs Baker's hand and
squeezes it tightly, imploring Baker for help.  Baker coolly shakes his
hand loose and shoves Nedry to the floor.  Baker looks down at the prone
and desperate Nedry.

                            BAKER
          Scumbag.  We have a deal.  That deal is
          not open to renegotiation.  Or even re-
          evaluation.

Bakers kneels down next to Nedry, who is beginning to turn blue.

                            BAKER
          The deal stands.  Take it or leave it.

Baker glances at his watch.

                            BAKER
          I'll give you a few minutes to decide.

Nedry makes a superhuman effort just to nod his head.  Baker nods back
and SLAMS his fist into Nedry's solar plexus.  It works.

Nedry sucks in a huge gulp of air.  He sits up
, rubbing his belly.  As
Baker leaves the room:

                            BAKER
          Make sure the eggs are on that supply
          ship.  Just make sure!

CAMERA LEAVES NEDRY and exits the window.    IT SWISHPANS the concrete
canyons of Wall Street and enters another office.


INT  CONSERVATIVE LAW OFFICE - DAY

DONALD GENNARO, handsome,  meticulously dressed, paces the highly
polished, glassy corner suite.  His boss, ROSS, is seated.  He's a
powerful black man who waves a prosthetic arm.

                            ROSS
          We can't trust Hammond anymore.  He's
          under too much pressure.  There's the
          EPA, he's behind schedule, and the in-
          vestors are getting nervous.  There have
          been too many rumors, too many accidents.
          We can't screw around with this.

                            GENNARO
          I've asked Hammond to arrange independent
          site inspections every week for the next
          three weeks.

                            ROS
S
          What does he say?

                            GENNARO
          Insists nothing's wrong on the island.

                            ROSS
          You know him.  Do you believe him?

                             GENNARO
          No, I don't.  I spent a lot of time with
          him five years ago when we raised the
          capital.  And it was a wild ride.  He's
          unpredictable, a dreamer.

                            ROSS
          Potentially dangerous.  We should never
          have gotten involved.  What's our position?

                            GENNARO
          The firm owns five percent.

                            ROSS
          General or limited?

                            GENNARO
          General.

                            ROSS
          We should have never done that.

                            GENNARO
          It seemed wise at the time.  We all
          wanted the park to happen.  It was in
          lieu of fees.

                            ROSS
        
  In any case, I agree an inspection is
          overdue.  Who are your site experts?

Gennaro tosses a list on Ross' desk.  He check it out.

                            ROSS
          Will they tell the truth?

                            GENNARO
          I think so.  That guy Grant's a hotshot
          in his field, always goes his own way -

                            ROSS
          - Good.  You're making all the arrangements?

                            GENNARO
          Hammond asked to place the calls himself.
          I think he wants to pretend the park is
          not in trouble.  That it's just a social
          invitation, showing off the island.

                            ROSS
          All right ... Good.  But let's be very
          clear about one thing.  I don't know how
          bad this situation actually is, Donald.
          But if there's a problem on that island -
          don't be afraid to screw Hammond and burn
          Jurassic Park to the ground.

Gennaro shakes hands 
awkwardly with Ross and leaves.  Ross paces.  Fed-
up, he whispers to himself.

                            ROSS
          Costa Rica, my ass.

He whacks his desk globe, sends its spinning.

CAMERA MOVES IN on spinning globe as we HEAR the ROTOR BLADES of a
helicopter and DISSOLVE TO:


INT/EXT  HELICOPTER IN SKY - DAWN

On the helicopter tail is a little blue logo that reads: Isla Nublar.

INSIDE, Grant, Ellie and Gennaro are in the right back row.  Ellie
dozes, her head occasionally dropping onto Grant's shoulder, to his
discomfort.  Gennaro looks at papers, trying not to look through the
clear plexi-bubble at their feet.  Next to THE PILOT, Nedry chews a
candy bar.  He offers candy to the back row.

Grant loses himself, looking out the window.

GRANT'S POV - the aquamarine blue of the ocean.  Below the waters there
are the shadows of ample marine life.  Dolphins leap in the air.
Suddenly the clear scene becomes obscured by clouds.

There is turbulence.  Ellie wakes, glances at Grant, then out the
window.  
There is mist and she absently traces her finger in it, shaping
a dinosaur figure.  Now land comes into view and for a moment, the
island below them eerily fits right into her doodling.

                            PILOT
          That's Isla Nublar.  Buckle up, the
          descent is a little hairy.

Gennaro cinches his belt tightly and half-shuts his eyes.  Nedry takes
out a sandwich and cockily loosens his belt.  Ellie looks every way.

                            ELLIE
          This is exciting!

                            GRANT
          What is, Ellie?  Where are we going?

Grant looks out his window. The helicopter rushes forward, low to the
water.  Ahead, Grant sees the island, rugged and craggy, rising sharply

                            GRANT
          Looks like Alcatraz.

The pilot coughs and rubs his goggles with the back of his hand.

                            PILOT
          There's bad wind shear on this peak.

Grant nods.  Gennaro sweats, watching the pilot tighten his own belt.

Ellie
 smiles excitedly as the helicopter starts down.  Now, A BLANKET
FOG.  Grant can't see a thing out his window.  Ellie's startled.

                            ELLIE
          How the hell is he landing this thing?

No answer.  Grant dimly discerns green branches of pine trees through
the mist.  Some are very close.  Ellie's hands grasps her seat cushion.

                            ELLIE
          This is not fun.

Grant looks through the plexi-bubble at his feet.  He sees the giant
glowing fluorescent cross below.  Lights FLASH at corners of the cross.

                            GRANT
          Relax, Ellie.  I'm sure they wouldn't
          land if it weren't safe.

The copter suddenly SHAKES violently.  Ellie grabs Grant's hand.
Gennaro sits straight up, eyes squeezed shut.

                            GRANT
          Gennaro?  This guy knows what he's doing,
          Right?  Hey, Gennaro?  I'm talking to you!

Another violent shake.  Grant squeezes Ellie's hand back.

CLOSEUP - Nedry's hand crushes a 
packet of crackers.

Gennaro is soaked.  He opens one eye and looks about, very frightened.
He speaks a mantra.

                            GENNARO
          No problem.  Relax, relax.

The pilot whispers to himself and corrects slightly.  The copter sails
sharply the other way.

                            GRANT AND ELLIE
          Whoa!!!!

CLOSE ON - the pilot jerks back the stick.

THE COPTER zooms upward.  Grant's beverage flips to the ground, pours
across the floor.

Nedry's lunch does flying.  Sandwich, candy, and cracker crumbs hang
suspended in the air.  Now it all FREE-FALLS onto Nedry's lap.

Grant and Ellie lean tightly into each other,

                            ELLIE
          I don't like this feeling ...

The pilot swings his gaze, left then right, looking at the pine forest.
Trees are close, then far, then close.  The helicopter drops rapidly.
Ellie and Grant shut their eyes.  They brace themselves for the worst.

IN AND OUT OF THE MIST, the copter descends.  Tail raised high, nose
low, fo
r a moment it looks like a strange bug-eyes prehistoric animal
bucking in its pen.  In a flash, it corrects itself.  The copter touches
down on a heli-pad.  The SOUND of the rotors fades and dies.

For a second, no one moves.  Grant lets out a great sigh of relief.
Gennaro mouths a silent prayer.  The pilot stretches his fingers.

Grant and Ellie self-consciously shake their hands free of each other.
Nedry unbuckles and laughs as he brushes off his lap.  He turns:

                            NEDRY
          Just think, Gennaro -
              (laughs harder)
          - you gotta agree it's funny!  These two,
          they dig up dinosaurs!  It's wonderful,
          isn't it?

Nedry pats Grant on his shoulder.

                            NEDRY
          Dr. Bones, you're going to love this place.

Nedry bursts out laughing again as he heads out the helicopter door.

A smile comes across Gennaro's face.  As he smiles he motions with his
hands he doesn't mean any harm.  Grant and Ellie stare at him.

      
                      PILOT
          Come on folks.  Gotta get back, there's a
          storm alert.

ROTORS TURN.  OUTSIDE, a man reaches the copter.  He wears a baseball
cap over short red hair and he's dressed in phony safari garb.  He
shakes Gennaro's hand.  This is ED REGIS, 35, head of Public Relations.
He throws open the copter door next to Grant.  Big, cheerful smile.

                            REGIS
          Hi!  Ed Regis.  Real big welcome to Isla
          Nublar, Dr. Grant, Dr. Sattler.  Little
          tough landing here, I know.  But you did
          it!  Come on down, we're so happy to have
          you.  Now, watch your step.

Ellie and Grant jump into the world of Jurassic Park.


EXT  LUSH TROPICAL FOREST - MORNING

Grant takes in the beautiful tropical terrain.  This place is the
opposite of the Badlands.  There is elaborate planting everywhere:
huge, hairy ferns; exotic, spiked flowers; berries of every color;
rushing vines.  Peeking through the thick greenery are beautiful birds
a
nd flying squirrels.  The strange, prehistoric world impresses Grant
and Ellie.  Even Nedry and Gennaro take in the vegetal wonder.

Then, the SOUND of men working, grunting from exertion.  Ahead, Muldoon
directs A GROUP OF WORKMEN.  Flame-throwers roar and machetes fight back
the abundant foliage.  As they attack a new area, Regis waves Muldoon
over.  Muldoon has a pronounced limp as he walks over to join them.

                            ED REGIS
          This is Robert Muldoon, great African big
          game hunter.  And he's working for us now.
          Doing a bang-up job, too.

Muldoon rests his rifle by a tree stump and shakes with Grant and Ellie.

                            MULDOON
          Ed's a little more BS than PR.  Mr.
          Gennaro, nice to have you back.

Gennaro nods warmly as Muldoon limps back to work.

Regis leads on, taking Gennaro's arm and talking to him like and old
friend.  Nedry lumbers in the middle, alone.  At the rear, Grant and
Ellie study everything they see.  Grant
 calls to Regis but is ignored.

                            GRANT
          Mr. Regis, what is the nature of this park?

Ellie looks behind and sees cramped ferns spring out to capture the path
they just walked on.  She nudges Grant, who has seen the same.

                            ELLIE
          Aggressive growth, huh?

                            GRANT
          Hammond's trademark.

A distinct HOOTING in the distance.  Then a loud TRUMPETING.  Grant and
Ellie stop.  Nedry doesn't look up.  Regis flashes his salesman's smile.

                            REGIS
          Out animals are greeting you!

They pass a crude sign nailed to a tree:  Welcome to Jurassic Park.
Grant cringes at the sign.  Ellie nudges him to loosen up.

                            GRANT
          I hope this isn't one of those animatronic
          exhibits in a Jurassic botanical setting.

                            NEDRY
          Nope.

Gennaro wipes his brow.  They enter a green tunnel of over-arching palm
that leads to the 
VISITOR'S CENTER, a modern complex in the distance.

Ellie notices a large fence hidden in the brush.  She nudges Grant.

THEIR POV - CAMERA SLOWLY CLIMBS a fifteen foot high chain-link fence.
The needle-spiked top of this fence cuts deep into the brush.

This fence is only the prelude.

Sprawling massively above and behind it is a thirty foot high fence.
Woven throughout the fence's mesh is an intricate system of electrical
wire.  There is a prominent warning:  DANGER!  ELECTRIC FENCE: TEN
THOUSAND VOLTS - KEEP OFF!

CAMERA KEEPS CLIMBING to the top:  ominous barbed wire, curled into the
highest growth with coiled razors glistening in the sun.

Grant strains to understand.  The quickens his steps to catch the others.

They reach a clearing with an unfinished brick sidewalk and potted shade
trees waiting for planting.  A crosshatching of tiny lizards scamper off
the walk.  An empty swimming pool is being filled by A MAN with a pumper
truck.  Next to him, WORKERS water the large ferns.

                       
     REGIS
          I hope you brought your bathing suits!
          Doesn't this mist and these plants really
          create a bonafide prehistoric feeling?

Regis points to a low building with glass pyramids on the roof.

                            REGIS
          There's the Visitor's Center.

A CRANE lowers an iron grating on top of one pyramid.  An animal TRUMPETS.


INT  VISITOR'S CENTER - DAY

CLOSE ON - the iron security grating as it fits over a glass skylight.
Above, MASKED WORKERS weld it on.  Sparks fly.

Grant stares up at it, thinking.  Footsteps echo behind him as Regis,
Ellie, Gennaro, and Nedry look around the unfinished building.

The Visitor's Center is two stories high, a lot of glass with exposed
girders and supports.  It's incomplete:  vines swing in the breeze where
the back wall will go and undressed cables litter the floor.  Even so,
exhibit areas are in varying stages of completion.  Behind, SEVERAL
SPANISH WORKERS unpack masonry supplies.

                            GRANT
     
     Where's Hammond?

                            REGIS
          Mr. Hammond is dying to see you guys.

Grant strides over to an exhibit as Gennaro paces impatiently.

                            GENNARO
          Hot, hot, hot.  Ten billion bucks and the
          air conditioning sucks.

Regis smiles apologetically and pushes open a large window on one of the
finished walls.  Giant leaves and vines burst inside.

Grant studies an exhibit in progress entitled When Dinosaurs Rules the
World.  This is a large clock that presents millions of years as hours
in a single day.  Many brightly colored hours are allocated to the
dinosaurs.  Man receives the last second of the day.  Ellie joins Grant.

                            ELLIE
          The audicity of man to get here at the
          last second and think he runs the show.

Grant smiles at her inexhaustible enthusiasm.  He looks at a painted
mural of a Raptor on one of the walls in the half-completed gift shop.

Nedry is at a coke machine, feeding in change
.  It doesn't work.  He
SLAMS his hand against it, and finally, a cup drops down the chute.
Upside-down.  It pours.  Coke splashes Nedry.  He curses and exits.

THE ROTUNDA - Ellie pulls Grant over to a raised, round display with a
catwalk.  In this unfinished display, a skeletal T-Rex and a Raptor are
locked in combat.  Scaffolding is up around it, and painting supplies
are scattered all around.

Regis glances at his watch, looks up, and smiles.

At that moment, doors adjacent to the rotunda swing open automatically.
A soothing female voice comes out of the public address system.

                            VOICE (ON P.A.)
          Please come to the theater.  In a moment,
          our film will begin.

The voice goes on to give this information in a number of languages.
Regis waves everyone into the theater.   Nedry doesn't join them.  He
climbs the stairs to the second floor.


INT  SCREENING ROOM - DAY

Small and plush.  Regis sits in the front, full of enthusiasm.  Grant and
Ellie sit further behind. 
 Gennaro stands in the back and smokes.

CELESTIAL MUSIC fills the room.  Mist covers and curls on the stage
floor.  Colored spotlights illuminate the mist in an eerie fashion.
overall effect is the touristy Where's NY? high-gloss production.

years young, with a glint in his eye and very comfortable with his own
effect.  He wears a white linen suit with a red rose in the breast
pocket.  Like an elder Carl Sagan, he addresses the group.

                            HAMMOND
          Welcome, ladies and gentlemen.  Welcome
          to an ancient and mysterious world, a
          world long before humankind inhabited it
          with all out remarkable dreams and
          questions.  Enter a world that existed
          one hundred million years ago.  When our
          changing earth was the abode of
          magnificent creations.

          Today, the late twentieth century has
          witnessed a scientific gold rush of
          astonishing proportions:  the headlong
          and furious haste to un
ravel the mystery
          of genetic engineering has become more
          than just a subject for science fiction
          writers.

ON GRANT - he whispers to Ellie.

                            GRANT
          - the furious haste to commercialize
          genetic engineering.

BACK ON HAMMOND - he warms to his subject.

                            HAMMOND
          Biotechnology promises the greatest
          revolution in human history.  It will
          outdistance atomic power and computers in
          its effects on our everyday lives.  We'll
          see square trees for easy lumbering and
          white trout for super visibility to
          fisherman.  Why it will transform every
          aspect of human life: out medical care,
          our food, our health, even our very
          entertainment.

ON GRANT - confirmed in his thinking, he whispers again.

                            GRANT
          Here we go.

BACK ON HAMMOND - he concludes.

                            HAMMOND
          
Nothing will ever be the same again.
          It's literally going to change the face
          of our planet as we know it.


MUSIC SOARS.  Hammond smiles appreciatively, removes his rose.  A screen
descends behind him.

                            HAMMOND
          ... Jurassic Park.  What we do here is
          made possible through the miracle of DNA
          replication, commonly known as cloning.
          To explain what cloning means, I'm going
          to need my own clone - John Hammond.

Another Hammond appears, projected on the screen beside the real one.

                            2ND HAMMOND
          Hi, John!

                            HAMMOND
          Hi, John.

IN THE AUDIENCE - Ellie laughs aloud.  Grant, shaking his head, smiles.

BACK ON HAMMOND - The original speaks to the clone.

                            HAMMOND
          Okay John, hold out your finger.

                            2ND HAMMOND
          Why?

                            HAMMOND
          I need some of your
 genetic material.

                            2ND HAMMOND
          Now just a minute here, John.

                            HAMMOND
          Your genetic material is the same in
          every cell of your body.  You have a
          hundred billion cells.  You won't miss a
          couple.

Hammond holds his rose to the screen the pricks his clone's finger with
a thorn.

                            2ND HAMMOND
          OW!!!  That hurt!  Hey, what's -

The clone dissolves into a cascade of blood as WE SEE a magnified view
of the bloodstream.  ANIMATION begins which illuminates the parts of the
blood and its actions.  Hammond provides voiceover for the visuals.

                            HAMMOND
          John, let's look into your blood, the
          river of life.  There's your white cells,
          exquisitely evolved to clean up bodily
          wastes.  And there's a mighty nucleus,
          the heart and brain of a cell.  This
          nucleus has an amazing property.  It can
          sp
lit in half and reproduce itself.
          That's how it grows.  And then those two
          can do it again.  And again.  Making copy
          after copy of itself.

Back to the two Hammond's.  Joined by a third, then a fourth, and so on
until the screen is crammed with Hammond's, elbowing each other for room.

                            NEW HAMMOND'S
          Hi, I'm John Hammond.  Hey, I'm John
          Hammond.  No, I am.  I am.

                            HAMMOND
          Come on, that's enough of this!  And I
          thought to reproduce myself I had to do it
          the old-fashioned way.

New mist fades out this show.  The lights go up.  Regis applauds.  Grant
joins in the laughter with Ellie and Gennaro.

Hammond jumps down from the stage and greets Gennaro and Regis.

                            HAMMOND
          That's all we've got so far.  A lot of
          fun, isn't it, Mr. Gennaro?

                            REGIS
          You bet!

Hammond greets Grant and Ellie warmly.  Then 
Hammond baits Grant.

                            HAMMOND
          It's been a long time, Alan.  I know the
          preceding was not your sort of enter-
          tainment.  Popular science -

                            GRANT
          No, I don't mind popular science.  I dislike
          the commercialization of science.  It breeds
          a sloppiness, a disregard for method.

                            HAMMOND
          Well, I don't disregard method.  But think
          of mutation - which is nothing more than
          sloppy communication on the cellular
          level.  Think how triumphant mutations
          have been in natural selection.

          Oh, but I know what you're saying.  It's
          true that I have never been afraid to make
          money with science.  I've always
          considered profit to be a measure of
          success, a barometer of public reaction.

                            GRANT
          Mr. Hammond, the essential truth of a
          scientific law ha
s nothing to do with
          public reaction.  Water freezes at
          thirty-two degrees, whether you pay for
          it or not.

Hammond turns to Gennaro.  Gennaro smiles nervously at their clash.

                            HAMMOND
          Donald, in bringing my old friend, Alan
          Grant, you've brought an excellent critic
          to observe the viability of my island and
          out venture.  I look forward to winning
          you over, Dr. Grant.

                            ELLIE
          Just what is it you're trying to clone?


EXT  A SPRAWLING LAWN - DAY

Outside, Hammond leads Gennaro, Grant and Ellie.  He points out the
staff living quarters, a group of graceful teepees.  Next to their
homes, WORKERS hang laundry and cook on grills.

They pass a large Mechanical Building.  The generator housed within is
very LOUD.  The wind increases, rippling clothes.

Suddenly, the SOUND of a speeding jeep.  Grant turns.

Racing across the rolling green landscape is A RED JEEP.  Muldoon is 
at
the steering wheel.  Two kids bounce happily around in the open jeep.
They are TIMMY, 9, and LEX, 6, brother and sister.  The jeep stops.

                            LEX
          Grandpa!

Hammond looks up, delighted.  Arms open.  Gennaro pulls him close.

                            GENNARO
              (incredulous)
          Mr. Hammond, this is a serious investiga-
          tion of the island, not a weekend
          excursion or a social outing.  We're
          talking about the safety of this place!

Hammond waves to the children.

                            HAMMOND
          I'm aware of that.  But I built this
          place for children.  You can't
          investigate it without their reactions.
          They're what this place is all about.

Hammond beams to Grant and Ellie and indicates the running kids.

                            HAMMOND
          My grandchildren.  Genetics were kind.
          They're more like my ex-wife than me.

Lex jumps right into her Grandpa's arms.  Timmy s
hyly walks up and
embraces him.  Hammond shines.  Gennaro holds in his fury.


INT  HAMMOND'S QUARTERS - DAY

Hammond ushers his guests into his own richly appointed baronial suite.
Ellie looks out a small window at the tee-pees and the contrasting
lifestyle below.  She then focuses on the high fence, circling the
perimeter of Hammond's quarters.  Above is a skylight, with metal bars.

Grant whispers to her, indicating the obviously modified window frame.

                            GRANT
          Who makes a windows ... smaller?

Timmy smacks him forehead, points to Grant.

                            TIMMY
          I know you.  You wrote my book.  Lost
          World of The Dinosaurs.  It's awesome.

                            LEX
          Timmy's got dinosaurs on the brain.

                            GRANT
          Don't worry - he'll grow out of it.

                            ELLIE
          Dr. Grant's embarrassed that his book was
          so widely successful.  He wrote if for
          gra
duate students.

Hammond smiles intensely.  But he's patient.  He stands be a huge table
covered with a sumptuous velvet drape.

                            HAMMOND
          Although Dr. Grant suspects otherwise,
          this is not an ill-conceived, half-baked,
          poorly funded plan that I've headed.
          This is a plan to which I committed all
          of my personal resources, literally
          billions of dollars.  And Donald Gennaro
          here has kindly helped me raise that sum
          again from wealthy Japanese.  They love
          theme parks.  I have recruited pre-
          eminent scientific minds from hallowed
          universities and we've taken the time to
          do things right.

Lex peeks under the cloth.  Hammond smiles at her and recovers the table.

                            HAMMOND
          Jurassic Park is the most advanced
          amusement park in the world.  We work
          with genetics - life's essential building
          blocks - to create new 
worlds.  I set out
          to make biological attractions.  Living
          attractions.  Attractions so astonishing
          that they'd capture the imagination of
          the entire world.

                            GRANT
          What exactly do you mean ... biological
          attractions?

                            HAMMOND
          As you well know, long ago, creatures ten
          times larger than whales roamed our
          adolescent Earth.  And then mass,
          mysterious extinction created a time
          barrier unscalable until ... now.

BEAT.

                            GRANT
          Yes?

                            HAMMOND
          Dinosaurs.
              (superbly proud)
          I've been cloning dinosaurs!

CAMERA PUSHES IN on Grant's incredulous face.

Hammond whips off the drape, revealing a complex and detailed scale
model of the entire resort.

                            HAMMOND
          Ladies and Gentlemen, Jurassic Park.  Not
          a resort, not a scien
tific conservatory,
          just a little piece of pre-history that
          every child in the whole wide world will
          insist on visiting.

Hammond grins with delight.

                            GENNARO
          At least every rich child.

Grant and Ellie come forward to examine the model.  The kids crowd in.

CAMERA SNORKELS through the model - revealing different enclosures with
miniature dinosaurs, moats, fences, roads, a river.

                            HAMMOND
          Apatosaurs in the lowland.  Gallimimus in
          the grassy plain.  Dilophosaurus above
          the river.  The mighty Tyrannosaurus Rex!
          238 fabulous creatures so far!

                            TIMMY
          Real dinosaurs, Grandpa?  Don't they want
          to just kill each other?

Hammond excitedly punches a button - colored display grids light up.

                            HAMMOND
          Timmy, there's electric fences and moats
          and video surveillance at all times.
          There
 are monitors every hundred feet
          whatever we could plant them on the
          island.  A computer to tabulate it all.

                            ELLIE
          You created dinosaurs?  Who gave you the
          right to do that?

                            HAMMOND
          I didn't create them.  I found a way to
          wake them up, to stir them out of their
          prehistoric slumber.

                            GRANT
          We don't have the science.  There's no
          source of dinosaur DNA.

Hammond's proud, excited face shifts to one that divulges modestly.

                            HAMMOND
          Yes ... there is.


INT  HALLWAY, UPPER FLOOR, VISITOR'S CENTER - DAY

Hammond leads Grant, Ellie, Gennaro, Timmy, and Lex out of an elevator
and down an endless corridor.  A WORKMAN ON CRUTCHES passes them.

They go through a series of security doors.  To get them open, Hammond
places his palm on a screen before each door.  Each time, it lights up
with an x-ray-like image of 
his hand and each door HISSES open.

CLOSEUP - Security x-ray. of Hammond's hand.  BEEP.  A red line writes
through the screen.  Can't get in.  Complaining, under his breath:

                            HAMMOND
          Glitches.

Hammond tries again.


INT  CONTROL ROOM - DAY

The door HISSES open, revealing an elaborate technology-crammed room.
In dim light, clusters of computer consoles and video monitors glow.

Nedry sits in a corner at a keyboard with a pile of papers next to him,
typing away.  JOHN ARNOLD, 45, park supervisor, sits directing the
activities of the park and chain-smoking.  There are large windows
looking out to the park, one of which is cracked and being replaced from
the outside by a TEAM OF WORKMEN.

Hammond wears a big smile as he leads in his entourage.  He's the
ringmaster.

                            HAMMOND
          And this is the right side of my brain.
          The entire park is safely controlled from
          here.  John Arnold, that genius over
          there, is the m
aster control operator.
              (with genuine concern)
          John, don't smoke so much, you're far too
          valuable a man to me.

                            ARNOLD
          Oh, you'd survive just fine without me.

Arnold exhales smoke and waves good-naturedly.  Nedry stares darkly at
Hammond, who ignores him.

                            HAMMOND
          Everything's controlled from here.
          Remote everything. Cars, feeding
          programs, medicine dispensers, fecal
          clean up - and that can be tons in a park
          like this.  We run this place with twenty
          workers.  This computer does it all.  And
          it polices each and every single animal
          out there.

                            ELLIE
              (whispers to Grant)
          Who polices the computer?

Hammond points up.  Overlooking the control room and the park is a
raised platform with a huge chair, like a throne in a court.  A large
video screen faces this chair.

                     
       HAMMOND
          That's where I will watch the astonished
          watchers.  Okay, let's go.

They practically race as a group to keep up with Hammond.  The security
door seals shit, leaving Nedry and Arnold alone again.

                            NEDRY
          Thanks for the kind word, Mr. Hammond.

                            ARNOLD
          Come on, Dennis, he knows your technical
          contributions have made it all possible.

                            NEDRY
          Right.


BACK ON HALLWAY -

Hammond and his group turn off the corridor and reach a door marked:
CAUTION: Teratogenic Substances.  Timmy backs off, grabs Lex's arm.

                            TIMMY
          That stuff turns you into a mutant!

He contorts his face into strange shapes.  As Hammond leads them all in
Lex pulls on his pocket.

                            HAMMOND
          Don't mind the signs.  They're only legal
          precautions.

Gennaro frowns.  The door opens and Lex peeks in.

                  
          HAMMOND
          My laboratory, Lex.  It will be yours and
          Timmy's someday.


INT  AMBER ROOM, LABORATORY - CONTINUING ACTION

Grant and Ellie share a baffled look.  Grant stares.

Grant's POV - PAN ACROSS a room filled with honey-colored glowing stones
arranged on glass shelves in large pull-out trays.  Each stone is tagged
and numbered.

Grant leans down, studying the stones.  He bumps right into Gennaro.
Lex jumps excitedly.

                            LEX
          It's ... gold!

                            TIMMY
          It's amber.  Fossilized tree sap.

                            LEX
          Grandpa found gold.

Grant shushes the kids and looks to Hammond.

                            HAMMOND
          You're both right.  Amber is our gold.
          The alpha or our alchemic alphabet.  The
          precious course of our genetic material.
          You already know amber is the fossilized
          resin of prehistoric tree sap, of course.

Grant and Ellie nod impatiently. 
 Hammond sets the scene.

                            HAMMOND
          Imagine - millions of years ago, tree sap
          flowing over insects, as it does now as I
          speak, in thousands of forests and backyard
          trees everywhere.  Imagine that ancient sap
          trapping a little struggling insect and
          consuming it in a syrupy death.  Millions
          and millions of years pass and we come
          along and discover this prehistoric insect.
          If we're lucky, he's perfectly preserved in
          a fossil form inside the hardened sap which
          is now amber.  And as we examine more and
          more amber, we find many perished insects,
          including among them, biting insects -

                            GRANT
          Like mosquitos -

                            HAMMOND
          Like mosquitos, precisely, Dr. Grant.

                            GRANT
          Mosquitos that sucked the blood of
          dinosaurs.  That's your source of DNA
        
  material?  My God!  It just might work.


INT  EXTRACTION ROOM, LABORATORY

A TECHNICIAN carefully positions a piece of amber under a fine-pointed
drill.  With a nod, the technician's goggles drop from his forehead onto
his eyes and he starts up the drill.  Hammond yells over the loud WHIRR.

                            HAMMOND
          The extraction room speaks for itself.

CLOSE ON - drillbit boring into the amber.  Orange fleck fly.

                            GRANT
          It does?

The technician shuts the drill.  Placing his hands into a mounted pair
of gloves, he operates an automated pair of needle-nose pliers to
carefully lift out the remains of a mosquito.  He drops this bug on a
slide and places this slide on a tray full of such slides.

                            LEX
          That's a million year old mosquito?

A conveyor belt starts, carrying this tray on to the NEXT TECHNICIAN.
The group follows.  This technician puts the first slide under a
microscope.  Grant watches on a video monito
r as the tech inserts a long
needle into the prehistoric bug.

                            ELLIE
          Put in a piece of amber, find a mosquito,
          drill it out.  Right?

                            HAMMOND
          Right.  You are witnessing the extraction
          of tissue from the thorax of this humble
          insect.  If this mosquito has ingested any
          foreign red blood cells - say it bit a
          hadrosaur or a stegosaurus or a T-Rex -  we
          will extract those blood cells and obtain
          paleo-DNA, the how-to-build instruction
          book of an extinct creature.
          So you see, Ellie, I'm not creating dino-
          saurs. Fossils left behind the information,
          the map of how to bring them back.  I'm
          helping them escape from the confined of
          time.

                            GRANT
          But even thousands of mosquitos wouldn't
          give you enough tissue to determine a
          complete DNA strand.

                 
           HAMMOND
          Right you are, Dr. Grant!  More like
          hundreds of thousands of mosquitos are
          necessary to provide even a partial
          strand of DNA.  And without a complete
          strand, we don't have a dinosaur.


INT  GENETICS ROOM

A LOUD HUMMING SOUND.  Along the walls are rows of waist-high stainless
steel boxes.  In the room's center are two six-foot-high round towers.
At a single console, a man studies a monitor.

DR. WU, 35, looks up from his study and beams at his guests.  He jumps
up and knocks over his cup of coffee.  ASSISTANTS clean the area as Wu
comes forward and actually hugs Grant, much to Grant's embarrassment.

                            HAMMOND
          Ah, I knew you two would hit it off!  Dr.
          Grant, this is Dr. Wu, my chief geneticist.

                            WU
          Finally, you are here!  I've been working
          without the encouragement of my peers for
          too long.  Welcome, welcome!

He kisses Ellie, who takes 
it in stride.  Gennaro, We already knows.

                            WU
          Mr. Hammond never lets me publish and
          he's interested only in results, not in
          science.

                            HAMMOND
          Don't forget to thank me when you pick up
          your Nobel prize.

Hammond and Wu resume the tour.

                            HAMMOND
          You are standing in the middle of the
          most powerful genetics factory created
          since the expulsion from Eden.

                            WU
          These are Hamachi-Hood automated gene
          sequencers, those are Cray XMP's,
          supercomputers that take DNA information
          and organize it.  In this room, we take
          fragmented or incomplete DNA strands and
          compare them to other incomplete strands.

                            HAMMOND
          It's like finding the missing pieces of a
          jigsaw puzzle.

                            WU
          The computers make sever
al trillion
          calculations to provide us with a
          complete DNA strand - the genetic code of
          an extinct animal.


INT  INCUBATION ROOM, LABORATORY

A vast room bathed in infrared light, filled with long tables.  The
first tables have rows and rows of centrifuges, each bearing dozens of
test tubes.  Wu leads the group.

                            GRANT
          Okay, you have your "complete" DNA
          strand.  How do you grow it?

                            WU
          We use unfertilized crocodile ova as our
          breeding medium.

                            HAMMOND
          Our primordial soup.

                            GRANT
          And how do you know what it is you're
          growing?

Wu shrugs.

                            WU
          Well, we have computer techniques to try
          and map out finds on an evolutionary
          basis.  But mostly, we just grow it and
          find out what it is.  If it's something
          we're interested in, and it 
survives, we
          keep it.

Grant and Ellie share a concerned look.

                            GENNARO
          And if you're not interested?

Wu indicates a cabinet of chemicals with skull-and-crossbone warnings.
Timmy regards the poison with excitement.

Lex calls from deeper in the room.

                            LEX
          Come look!

Here, plastic eggs lay on the long tables, their pale outlines obscured
by a grey mist that covers the tables.  The eggs are all gently rocking
as TECHNICIANS roam up and down the aisles.

Hammond walks ahead of the group.  As Wu speaks, Hammond listens and
enjoys it as though he's hearing it for the first time.

                            WU
          This is the incubation room.  We keep the
          temperature at ninetynine degrees and a
          relative humidity of one hundred percent.

                            GRANT AND TIMMY
          Jurassic atmosphere.

Timmy smiles at Grant.  Hammond winks at Timmy.

                            WU
          We
 also run a high oxygen concentration,
          up to thirty-three percent, so if you
          feel faint, please tell me right away.

Lex feigns a faint, Timmy cracks a small smile. They move forward,
waist-deep in the mist.  A strange green light emanates from the
incubators.  Lex is half-consumed by the mist. She mimics the witch.

                            LEX
          I'm ... melting!

Ellie laughs and pulls Lex close.

                            WU
          Reptile eggs contain large amounts of
          yolk but no water at all.  The embryos
          must extract water from the surrounding
          environment.

                            GRANT
          That's why you create the mist.

Wu nods.  Hammond just enjoys the scene as Grant and Ellie watch a
thermal sensor moving from one egg to the next, touching each with a
flexible wand, beeping.  Lex and Timmy let their hands glide over the
sides of the green glowing incubators fully awed by the strange, big
eggs they hold.

                   
         WU
          Children, please do not touch!  The eggs
          are permeable to skin oils.

Grant that very close to an egg.  He sniffs it.

                            GRANT
          What kind of eggs are these?  Are these
          shells plastic?

                            WU
          Yes, they are,  The embryos are
          mechanically inserted and then hatched in
          this room.  But we've managed to
          sufficiently mimic the actual biological
          process - these creatures rupture the
          plastic membrane that they're contained
          in when they're born.  Like real births.

They reach an endless row of incubators, lined up along the wall,
beneath a viewing area like those found in an OB-GYN ward.

                            WU
          Eggs that are determined viable spend
          their last couple days in our specially-
          designed incubators, which help
          accelerate the pre-natal developmental
          stages.  Which is interesting becaus
e
          we're having a problem with the adult
          animals -

Hammond claps a hand over Wu's mouth and laughs.

                            HAMMOND
          There's no problem Dr. Wu can't handle.
          Now who wants to see the real thing?

As they exit the CAMERA PANS the misty aisles, studying the eggs.


EXT  VISITOR'S CENTER - DAY

Blue shadows of clouds sweep across an expansive green hill in front of
the Visitor's Center.

Grant and Hammond make their way down below to the loading area for the
park tour.  A little ahead is Gennaro and Ellie.  Gennaro chatters on
while Ellie energetically explores the area, looking at the plants.

                            GENNARO
          ... so naturally, Hammond's going to
          present everything in the best light.  I
          need to know that this park is safe.

                            ELLIE
          I'll tell you something that troubles me
          from the start.  The carnivores are all
          well-fed and kept separated from their

          natural prey.  That'll keep 'em alive,
          but it won't keep 'em happy.

                            GENNARO
          How do you mean?

                            ELLIE
          The carnivores will want to hunt.  It's
          an instinct.  And that instinct will have
          to be satisfied or suppressed.

FURTHER UP THE HILL, moving slowly, Hammond eyes the pair suspiciously.

                            HAMMOND
          Gennaro is putting negative ideas into
          Ellie's head.  He's a naysayer.  I have
          no affection for that type of thinking.

                            GRANT
          Don't worry.  Ellie makes her own
          judgments.

At the base of the hill Timmy and Lex toss a baseball.


EXT  TOUR START - DAY

The group gathers.  TWO ELECTRIC CARS glide to a stop behind them.
Regis leans out of the first one.

                            REGIS
          Hey!  Great day for a tour!

                            GENNARO
          Looks like rain to me.

         
                   REGIS
          No!  I told the rain-god to hold it off
          till we got back.

The kids pile in next to Regis and explore the high-tech cars.  Timmy
finds a a pair of very think, strange-looking goggles with dials on top.

Grant, Ellie, and Gennaro climb in the second car.

                            HAMMOND
          Kids, mind Mr. Regis.  He's in charge now.

The cars begin to move and pass Hammond.  He waves.

Gennaro looks back as the cars turn into the brush.  Hammond waves.

                            HAMMOND
          Gennaro, for once in your life, let
          something really move you.

In the cruiser, Gennaro rubs his neck.  He turns to Grant.

                            GENNARO
          Ever get the feeling we're just Hammond's
          damn guinea pigs?

                            GRANT
          I like to wait and see.

Ellie motions ahead, with excitement and apprehension, to a huge gate.
Regis and the kids wave behind to Grant, Ellie and Gennaro.

The gate's doo
rs swing open and the cruisers move forward.  The kids
squeal out a YA-HOO that floats through the air to Grant.  But Grant
wears a cautious face, his skeptical eyes scan the landscape.

A FANFARE of trumpets and then a pre-recorded voice speaks from a
console in each cruiser.  Video screens display a welcome message.

                            PRE-RECORDED VOICE
          Welcome to Jurassic Park.  You are now
          entering the lost world of the
          prehistoric past, a world of mighty
          creatures long gone from the face of the
          earth, which you are privileged to see
          for the first time ...

Regis uses his walkie-talkie to contact Grant's cruiser.

                            REGIS (ON WALKIE)
          That's Richard Kiley.  We spared no
          expense.

                            PRE-RECORDED VOICE
          We'll begin our tour today with the
          herbivores ...


INT/EXT  CRUISERS, FIRST TOUR STOP - DAY

Between massive tree trunks, a spectacular view:  stor
m clouds touch
mountaintops.  Below, the lagoon ripples in pink crescents.

                            PRE-RECORDED VOICE
          ... and the grasses are a species of
          juniper, and samples can be purchased at
          the gift shop.  Now, if everyone will
          take a look to the right ...

All eyes swing that way.  Grant doesn't see a thing.  Nor do the others.

AHEAD, Timmy pulls the binoculars out of the equipment pouch and studies
the location.  Lex grabs the night goggles.  Timmy pulls them from her.

                            REGIS
          Look ...

                            LEX AND TIMMY
          I don't see anything.  Do you see
          anything?  There's nothing there.

                            REGIS
          Something's out there ...

IN THE SECOND CAR, a fly buzzes on Grant's windshield.  Grant hangs out
his window almost sniffing the air for some movement.  Nothing.

SUDDENLY the trees in front of them move!  A deep trumpeting SOUND and
TWO BRACHIOSAURS rumble away fr
om the side of the road.  The ground
SHAKES as they walk, their BELLOWING fills the air.  Led by Grant, the
passengers rise through the open top of their Land Cruisers, to look up
at the dinosaurs far above.

DROOPING FROM ABOVE, leaves and little branches shower on Grant.  Utter
amazement fills Grant's face, then his mouth breaks into a giant smile
then a laugh.  He simply can't believe his eyes. His laugh becomes
raucous and euphoric.

                            GRANT
          Ellie!  Can you imagine the excavation
          team seeing this!

Behind him, Ellie's whole person is awestruck, immobile.  Gennaro
squints, straining to make sense of this unbelievable reality.

IN THE CAR AHEAD, Lex and Timmy stare open-mouthed.  Regis looks at the
animal and then at the group's reverie.  He smiles knowingly: he's been
there, too.  He bends and whispers:

                            REGIS
          Congratulations. You're the first kids in
          the whole wide world ever to see real
          dinosaurs.

The
 kids look up at Regis with wonder in their eyes.

GRANT CAN'T stop laughing.  Still chewing, a brachiosaur cranes down to
peer at this laughing man.  The brachiosaur's huge head stops inches
away from Grant.  Grant, awestruck, stares and them -

CLOSE ON - Grant as his eyes slowly roll back and ... he faints.

The dinosaur casually moves away as Ellie comes to Grant's aid.

                            ELLIE
          Alan?  Alan?
              (sort of delighted)
          He fainted!

Gennaro waves to Regis that all is okay.  Grant slowly revives.  He
looks back at the brachiosaur, groggily, smiling away.  He looks at
Ellie and their eyes linger on each other longer than usual, sharing a
look of serene delight.

Gennaro plops back in his seat and ponders the scene before him.  A
glazed look fills his face.

                            GENNARO
          My God, we're going to make a fortune
          here!

CAMERA PUSHES IN on the majestic, gentle beauty of the Brachiosaurs.
JUNGLE SOUNDS DOMINATE, growing l
ouder and louder.


INT CONTROL ROOM - DAY

Hammond sits at his throne, happily watching the huge video screen which
displays the tour group.  He laughs raucously and calls to Arnold.

                            HAMMOND
          He fainted.  I've waited fifteen years to
          impress that young man.

                            ARNOLD
          Oh Mr. Hammond, I'm sorry to interrupt
          you, but Muldoon needs you by the pit.

                            HAMMOND
          Oh, balls.


INT/EXT  CRUISERS, SECOND TOUR STOP - DAY

The cruisers come to a stop.  In the distance, A HERD OF GALLIMIMUS
graze.  They stand on their hind legs to get at high palm trees, then
drop gracefully down on all fours to chew.  BABY GALLIMIMUS scamper
around the adults, eating leaves that drop from the larger animals.

                             PRE-RECORDED VOICE
          ... Gallimimus, known as the ostrich
          dinosaur for the shape of its shoulders,
          have a very strong nesting instinct ...

Grant do
esn't listen.  He is simply intoxicated with the pastoral beauty
of the gentle, grazing dinosaurs.  Suddenly, he looks away with a deep
concern.  Ellie looks at him questioningly.

                            GRANT
          Ellie?  What the hell are we going to do
          with the rest of our lives?

Ellie smiles at him, puzzled.

                            ELLIE
          What to you mean?

                            GRANT
          Can't you see it, Ellie?  We're the ones
          that are extinct now.


INT/EXT  CRUISERS, THIRD TOUR STOP - DAY

                            PRE-RECORDED VOICE
          ... lots more to see in the herbivore
          section of our park.  But as we come
          alongside out Jurassic jungle river to the
          left, let's try and catch a glimpse of a
          very unusual and dangerous carnivore.
          Look across the river and above ...

A lovely mossy clearing.  And to the side, bounded just by a thicket of
bushes, a precipitous drop to a tropical river, lus
h and clear.  The
river runs fast but it is narrow.  On the other side is a sharp rise.

                            PRE-RECORDED VOICE
          And there they are!

Standing on that natural pedestal and watching our tour come to a stop
are TWO DILOPHOSAURUS, man-sized dinosaurs with gills that hang around
their necks.  Grant and Ellie chime in with the pre-recorded voice.

                            ALL THREE
          Dilophosaurus!

Timmy and Lex point enthusiastically.  Regis holds them down with a
gentle but restraining arm.

                            PRE-RECORDED VOICE
          Dilophosaurus is one of the earliest
          carnivores.  Scientists once thought
          their jaw muscles were too weak to kill,
          but now, through the miracle of their
          cloning, we know Dilophosaurs spit venom,
          a poison which causes blindness and then
          unconsciousness.

Their distinctive HOOT drifts across the afternoon air.

                            GENNARO
          Poisonous d
inosaurs, there's a liability
          issue without a lot of precedent.

CLOSEUP of the nearly motionless Dilophosaurus.  One yawns wide.

                            GRANT
              (assessing)
          It's like a Gila monster of a cobra.  It's
          a poison ...

                            ELLIE
          Spitter!

The Spitters bound off as Grant watches, transfixed.  A flock of birds
burst from a tree and cross the sky.  Trees filter the light.

                            ELLIE
          Are we dreaming all this?


EXT  RAPTOR PIT - DAY

A big hole in the ground, covered with a think wire mesh.  Suddenly, a
dark claw pushes against the wire web. A SHOWER OF SPARKS.  A SCREECH
animals GROWL and SNARL.  An animal slams its face into the mesh.  SPARKS
illuminate a set of RAZOR-SHARP TEETH.

Muldoon stands next to the pit, carefully loading an assault rifle.
Hammond comes in a hurry.  Muldoon sees Hammond and puts down the rifle.
He walks to Hammond, talking before he gets there.

               
             MULDOON
          These raptors are too damn dangerous. One
          of them tunneled out this morning.  He
          ripped a boy's arm off before I could get
          a bullet in him.

                            HAMMOND
          A bullet?  Muldoon - no!  Now what?  I
          have five left?

                            MULDOON
          John, they're mean as scorpions and smart
          as chimps.  Their little fingers make
          them natural cage-breakers.  We should
          terminate the raptor program.  They're
          just too smart.  Too damn smart.

                            HAMMOND
          Oh balls.  I will not terminate the raptors
          just because they're behaving normally.
          They're hunters.  Why can't we contain them
          properly?

Hammond starts to walk away.  Muldoon follows, he's not finished at all.

                            MULDOON
          John, remember back in '88, when we
          started to build the containment devices?
         
 We ordered cattle prods, tasers, guns
          that blow out electric nets.  They're all
          too slow for these guys. If we're going
          to keep the raptors, I want TOW missiles
          and laser-guided devices.

Hammond laughs warmly.  He pats Muldoon on the back.

                            HAMMOND
          It's just a zoo, Muldoon.  A zoo.  Figure
          out a way to contain them.  And we'll sit
          down and have a nice long discussion about
          raptors - after my guests leave, okay?

Hammond walks away.  Muldoon stares after him, jingling keys in his
hand.  Muldoon lumps over to A WORKER.

                            MULDOON
          Okay!  Get a 'dozer, start digging round
          the pit.  We're gonna bury some fence.
          And wear your rifle when you're working!


INT  CONTROL ROOM - AFTERNOON

Hammond enters and crosses to his throne.  Hammond swivels to Arnold who
exhales smoke.  Nedry looks over, keeps typing.

                            HAMMOND
          Wh
ere are they?  Punch 'em up.

                            ARNOLD
          They'll be by the trike's in a moment.
          Trike's sick again.

                            HAMMOND
          How can you say it so matter-of-factly?
          The trike's.  You casually accept it, but
          I never can.  You know what it means when
          you say "by the trikes"?  "By the
          trike's" means that they're out there by
          the species:  triceratops horridus.  It
          astounds me every time what I've done
          here.  What magic, what alchemy.  We
          turned a piece of a rock into a dinosaur.
          I will never be complacent about that.

Arnold smiles and punches a button.  WE HEAR the pre-recorded tour voice
and some chatter of the kids.

EAVESDROPPING on the tour IS INTERRUPTED by a radio transmission to the
control room.  Arnold slides over and shuts off the tour monitoring.
The picture on the video screen is now of a cargo boat at a dock.

                            RADIO
 
         Hello, John.  This is the Anne B at the
          dock.  I'm looking at the storm patterns
          just south of us.  Requesting permission
          to leave before unloading the last three
          food containers.

Nedry looks up quickly, listening carefully.

                            RADIO
          Don't want to be stuck here if this chop
          gets much worse.

Hammond reacts with quiet dismay.  Nedry quietly gets up.

                            NEDRY
          Coffee anyone?

He's ignored.  Arnold defers to Hammond who leans to the microphone.

                            HAMMOND
          Hello skipper, John Hammond, how are you
          tonight?  I certainly don't want to
          imperil anyone.  But can you give us one
          more container of food?  Then we'll feel
          comfortable is the storm delays your
          return.  Could you help us out here?  Of
          course, if it looks too choppy just go,
          but you'd be doing us a big favor.

                 
           RADIO
          Well ... we'll do our best, sir.  We'll
          get one more container off. How's that?

Hammond thanks him and signs off.  Arnold looks at the darkening clouds.


INT/EXT  CRUISERS, FOURTH TOUR STOP - LATE AFTERNOON

The cars twist through dense vegetation with a GRINDING of gears.  The
first car comes to a jerky stop.

There is a huge TRICERATOPS lying on its side, moving very slowly,
breathing laboriously.  HARDING, the tall, balding park vet, kneels on
the ground.  He peers into the animal's mouth with a large flashlight.

Before the second car can stop completely, Grant leaps out, races to the
trike.  Regis tries to restrain the kids but they chase Grant and Ellie.

Grant joins Harding on the ground.  The trike lets out a low MOAN.
She's too sick to move.  Ellie and Lex squat by the animal.

                            LEX
          I feel so sorry for her.  She's so sick.

                            VET
          We don't know what's wrong with Freda.
          Every six we
eks she gets like this.

                            REGIS
          Oh, she'll be up and around in no time.
          After a big night, I feel the same way.

Grant very gently opens the Trike's mouth.

                            GRANT
          Poor girl.  What's the matter?  Ellie,
          look at this.

A dark purple tongue droops limply from her mouth.  Ellie shines the
light on it, illuminating silvery blisters.  Gennaro turns away.

                            ELLIE
          Microvesicles.  Interesting.

Grant scratches one of the blisters with his ball-point pen.  It oozes.
The kids share a grossed-out look.

                            LEX
          Doesn't she have a mommy and a daddy?

                            HARDING
          We make these dinosaurs in the lab,
          sweetheart.  But they do form attachments.
          Freda has a little one that follows her
          around, thinks Freda's his mom.

Grant starts to look around.

                            ELLIE
          What does sh
e eat?  Where does she feed?

                            HARDING
          Animal this size takes in a minimum of
          six hundred pounds of plants a day.  We
          truck in hay and meadow grasses seven
          times a day.  That's all she touches.

Grant studies the nearby grass and bushes.  Timmy quietly follows Grant.

Ellie lifts a huge eyelid on the triceratops.  A runny eye just stares.

Grant comes up triumphantly with a bouquet of weeds clutched in his
hand.  These weeds have little purple berries.  Ellie looks over.

                            ELLIE
          West Indian Lilacs!

                            GRANT
          These'd give anybody a stomachache.

                            HARDING
          I'm telling you, the animals don't eat
          don't eat that stuff.

Regis keeps a babysitter's eye on the kids.  Timmy comes up with a
handful of smooth stones.  He approaches Grant shyly.

                            TIMMY
          Dr. Grant, sir?  How 'bout these?
          There'
s lots of little piles of these?

Grant fingers one distractedly, then suddenly comes to attention.

                            GRANT
          Hey, Ellie take a look at his.  Good
          work, Timmy.

Ellie gets up, brushes herself off, comes over and examines the stone.

                            ELLIE
          Extremely smooth.  Purple stains, could
          be those lilac berries.

She and Grant smile and each other and nod.  Gennaro is curious.

                            HARDING
          I don't get it.

                            GRANT
          Looks like your trike swallows stones to
          help her digest her food.  Walking
          around, she crushes berries against the
          stones.  And even just a little crushed
          berry is eventually enough,

                            ELLIE
          So, she poisons herself periodically.

                            HARDING
          Bet we tested her saliva for any trace of -

                            GRANT
          But with th
e stones, she swallows them
          and probably bypasses any mucosal
          contact.  Straight to the stomach.  I
          would test her excrement.

                            LEX
          Yo, yuk!

A light RAIN begins.  Automatically, with a soft hiss, the glass roofs
of the cruisers slide shit.  Gennaro taps Regis and indicates the cars.

                            GENNARO
          Hey Regis, where are your rain gods?
          It's gonna pour.  Let's finish our tour.

Grant agrees, heads for the cruisers.  He turns and looks for Ellie.
Ellie stands by the Trike.  She gives Grant a meaningful look.

                            ELLIE
          I'm staying.

Grant smiles at her decision.

                            GRANT
          Soil samples?

                            ELLIE
          You read my mind.
              (confidentially)
          I think she's sicker then they're saying.
          Her skin is dry and flaky.  And her gums
          are pale.  I'm going to talk to Dr. Wu.

        
                    GRANT
          Good idea.  I'll keep my eyes open.

Gennaro climbs in with Grant.  The two cruisers start off and Timmy
turns backward to stare wistfully at Grant.  Regis and Lex wave to the
Trike.  Grant looks back to Ellie who has already begun to work.

ON TRIKE - a mosquito lands on its back.  The trike's tail slaps it dead.


INT  MACHINE ROOM - LATE AFTERNOON

With difficulty, Nedry shoves his large body down the crawl space behind
a large rack of electronic equipment.  He stops and uses a suction cup
device to lift a section of the tiled floor.  He gropes among cables and
pulls out a small wireless radio.  He transmits:

                            NEDRY (INTO RADIO)
          Jim, what the hell's with you  ... I know
          a storm's coming, I can't ... it's all so
          tightly planned ... that's not enough ...
          ok, twenty minutes, I'll be there.  Damn!

Nedry returns the radio to its hiding place.  He sucks in his gut to
make the crawl out of  the narrow space.


INT/EXT  CRUISERS, T-REX FEEDING AREA - DUSK

The cruisers stop on the rise of a hill.  They over look a forested area,
sloping down to the edge of the lagoon.

                            TOUR
          The mighty T-Rex arose late in dinosaur
          history.  Dinosaurs ruled the earth for a
          hundred and twenty million years, but
          there were tyrannosaurs for only the last
          fifteen million years of that period ...

Farther south, they see the graceful necks of the brachiosaurs standing
at the water's edge.  Their bodies, mirrored in the moving surface,
break apart with the continuing drops of rain.  Hear lightning rhythmic-
ally pulses the sky.  All is quiet except for the soft drone of cicadas
and the tapping of light rain.

Regis calls Grant on the walkie-talkie.

                            REGIS (TO WALKIE)
          You know, Dr. Grant, Hammond likes to
          come here in the evening and just sit.

                            GRANT (OVER WALKIE)
          Where is the T-
Rex?

                            REGIS (TO WALKIE)
          Good question.

ON GRANT - as he takes that in, nodding to himself. Studies the land.

                            GRANT
          Maybe she's down hunting apatosaurs.

OVER WALKIE - Regis laughs, his voice tinny over the radio.

                            REGIS (OVER WALKIE)
          Would if she could, believe me.  Some-
          times she stands by the lagoon and stares
          at those animals, and wiggles those
          little forearms of hers in frustration.
          But the T-Rex territory is completely
          enclosed with trenches and fences.
          Believe me, she can't go anywhere.

                            GRANT
          Then where is she?

They hear A SOFT BLEATING.  In the center of the field, a small cage
rises into view, lifted on hydraulics from underground.  The cage bars
slide down.  A GOAT remains tethered in the field, BLEATING plaintively.

The tour group stares out their windows, expectantly.


BACK ON CONTRO
L ROOM -

Hammond, pleased, watches the giant screen that displays the tour group.
Muldoon limps into the control room.  Arnold looks over.

                            MULDOON
          Just checking in.  Everything ok?

                            HAMMOND
          Look at them.  Leaning out the windows,
          so eager.  They can't wait to see it.
          They have come for the danger.

                            MULDOON
          That's what I'm afraid of.

Muldoon twirls the keys on his fingers and watches the land cruisers.


BACK ON CRUISERS, T-REX FEEDING AREA -

Grant watches quietly.

The BLEATING becomes louder, more insistent.  The goat tugs frantically
at its tether, racing back and forth, kicking.

                            LEX
          What's going to happen to the goat?  Is
          the T-Rex gonna come eat the goat?

Grant senses something.  He sits straight up.  Looks out intently.

                            GRANT
          He's here.

The goat is tethered in the middle of the fi
eld, thirty yards from the
nearest tree.  Grant scans the tree for the T-Rex.

The goat senses something too.  It struggles and strains, bleating
frantically.  Suddenly the mechanical SOUND of the cage coming up.  Its
bars surround the goat with safety once again.

                            REGIS
          Looks like the Rex will have its snack a
          little later today.

                            RECORDED VOICE
          The sensors don't see the Rex around.
          She usually comes within five minutes of
          hearing dinner. If she doesn't, that
          means she's sleeping - we might have
          access to her at the picnic area.

Lex and Timmy let out a sigh of relief.  The tension is gone.

                            LEX
          I didn't want to see him get eaten.  I
          liked the goat.


BACK IN THE CONTROL ROOM -

Hammond studies the large video monitor.  He watches Grant and Gennaro.
Their voices are heard in the control room.

                            GENNARO (MONITOR
ED)
          What is a carnivore got out?

                            GRANT (MONITORED)
          There'd be no stopping it.  Huge, with no
          natural enemies, and a suppressed hunting
          instinct.

Hammond glares.  Arnold, aware, shuts off the screen.

                            HAMMOND
          Damn those people.  They are so negative.

                            ARNOLD
          It's natural.  They can't fully
          appreciate that we've engineered the
          animals and the park for total safety.

                            HAMMOND
          They comb this island like a bunch of
          accountants.  They don't experience the
          wonder, the awe of it all.

                            ARNOLD
          You can't make people experience wonder.

Hammond gets up and stands before the big windows overlooking the park.
The quartz FLOODLIGHTS outside their area COME ON with a rosy glow and
the dark jungle is opened again to their inspection.

At his console, Nedry looks at Hamm
ond.  Hammond stares out the window.
The RAIN PICKS UP and bounces off the window.  Hammond speaks to Arnold
without turning.

                            HAMMOND
          It's like the Garden of Eden out there.
          This is the most beautiful time of day.

                            ARNOLD
          Better rout the tour back.  They can
          start again sun-up tomorrow morning.

                            HAMMOND
          Yup.  Call the kitchen.  Those kids'll be
          hungry when they get in.

Arnold picks up the phone.  STATIC.  He glances over at Nedry.

                            NEDRY
          Sorry 'bout that.  I've taken all the
          lines to upload some data.

Hammond's annoyed, but contains it.  Arnold looks at Nedry, who smiles.

                            NEDRY
          I'll clear a couple of lines for you at
          the end of the next transmission, sir.
          Here you go now, this will make it all
          better, Mr. Hammond.

Nedry punches in a code.

CLOSE ON 
- Nedry's fat finger punching a last key.

CLOSE ON - amber video display terminal as a countdown begins.

As the screen counts down from ten to zero, Nedry peers at Hammond with
a steely glint in his eyes.

BACK ON SCREEN - three, two, one, the countdown hits zero.

Nedry's data-filled screen blinks off.  Nedry looks up to the rack of
monitors.  Unnoticed by Hammond or Arnold two more monitors go blank.
Then a third one.


BACK  ON CRUISERS, REST AREA - NIGHT

The electric cars turn up into a scenic area high above the rest of the
park.  HUGE QUARTZ LIGHTS REVEAL a dramatic view down to the ocean.
There the supply ship, the ANNE B, unloads its last crates.

RAIN INCREASES.  On the other side of the road are picnic tables, an
unfinished snack bar and rest rooms.  To the side of this rest area is a
view of the interior of the island.  A guard-rail separates visitors

To the other side of the rest area is a concrete moat and in the back of
this is a tall, electrified fence.  Surrounding the electric fence is a

smaller protective fence.

                            PRE-RECORDED VOICE
          ... enjoy a healthy snack.  This is also
          a good time to ...

                            LEX
          Hey, is that bathroom working?

                            REGIS
          Sure.
              (he uses his walkie)
          Rest stop.

The kids take off towards the bathroom, running through the rain.  Grant
gets out of his cruiser, strides to Regis.  He indicates the fence.

                            GRANT
          Is that still the T-Rex paddock?

                            REGIS
          Yes.  But she never comes here.  I don't
          know why not.  Probably too much
          construction.

GENNARO, jacket over his head against the rain, looks down to the ocean.

GENNARO'S POV - THE ANNE B UNLOADS he last cargo crate.

GRANT LOOKS at the concrete moat.  Studies its deep curve.  He looks up
at the tell electrical fence with its 10,000 volt warning.  He sees
conventional power lines on the opposite sid
e of the road.

CAMERA EXAMINES the empty cruisers.  Inside, the pre-recorded voice is
chatting on.  It slows eerily and stops.  Video SCREENS BLINK OUT.


BACK ON CONTROL ROOM -

Nedry yawns loudly.

                            NEDRY
          Yup!  Looks like a never-ending weekend
          for me.  I'm gonna get a Diet Coke.
          Don't touch my console, ok?  Line will
          be clear in five minutes.

Nedry leaves.  Hammond swings around and growls under his breath.

                            HAMMOND
          Slob!

                            ARNOLD
          Well, at least he knows what he's doing.


INT  UPPER FLOOR, VISITOR'S CENTER - NIGHT

Nedry races through the series of security doors.  He ignores the
security x-ray device and just SHOVES each door open with his hand.


BACK ON CRUISERS, REST AREA -

THE QUARTZ LIGHTS GO OUT, leaving the group in shadowy darkness and now
STEADY RAIN.  There's a ripple of surprise from the group.  Regis rounds
them all up and directs them back into the 
cruisers.

                            REGIS
          Everything's just fine.  It's a temporary
          glitch due to the rain.  No doubt,
          they're going to re-rout some circuits
          back at the mainframe.  We'll have the
          power back on in moments.  Let's get back
          in the cruisers, they may start up, and
          I'd like us all to be seated in them.

The cruisers are STILL.  IN THE REAR CRUISER, Gennaro turns to Grant.

                            GENNARO
          I knew we shouldn't have kids here.

A vivid FLASH of LIGHTNING.  IN THE FIRST CAR:  Lex covers her eyes.
Then she looks up at Regis with a frightful face.

                            LEX
          Mr. Regis, are dinosaurs ... nocturnal?

                            REGIS
          No, darling, of course not.

                            LEX
          Mr. Regis?  What's ... nocturnal?

Another LIGHTNING FLASH.  Lex cries.  Regis comforts her.

                            REGIS
          Don't you worry about d
inosaurs.  They're
          all very safe in their paddocks just like
          animals in a big, strong zoo.  They're not
          going anywhere we don't tell them to go.

Timmy looks out the window excitedly.


INT  INCUBATION ROOM, LABORATORY - NIGHT

All those eggs on tables.  No moving sensors.  Nedry pulls a portable
incubator away from the dozens lined up against the wall.  Its
electrical cord goes flying.  Furiously, Nedry fills the incubator with
eggs, one after the other.

                            NEDRY
          Okay, little ones!  Here we go!

Nedry grabs the handles of the incubator and runs with it.  The
incubator careens on one wheel as he turns the corner and exits.


BACK ON CONTROL ROOM -

Hammond looks out the large window as the LIGHTS EXTINGUISH.  He twirls.

                            HAMMOND
          What's going on, Arnold?  I want those
          lights on.  I don't want my grandchildren
          scared.

                            ARNOLD
          Jesus, the computer's gone
 down.

                            HAMMOND
          Well, I want the computer up.  This is
          the wrong weekend for glitches.

Arnold still examines his console.  He looks out with worry.

                            ARNOLD
          That's not the worst of it.

                            HAMMOND
          Oh yeah?  Please tell me what's worse
          than the lights going out?

Wu smashes through the door.

                            WU
          All the security doors are open.  Someone
          has been in my laboratory and the eggs
          have been disturbed.

The camera pushes in on Hammond's face.

                            HAMMOND
          Where the hell is Nedry?  Where is he?
          Did anybody check the damn john?

Hammond storms out.


INT  CORRIDOR, VISITOR'S CENTER - CONTINUING ACTION

Hammond enters the hall.  Muldoon, racing from the other direction, yells:

                            MULDOON
          John, the generator's shut down.  Who cut
          the power?

     
                       HAMMOND
          Arnold's on it.  You go out and bring
          back the tour right away.  I don't need
          any of this!

Muldoon is already running back the way he came.


INT  GARAGE - NIGHT

Several electric land cruisers are stored in this shadowy room.  There
is a glassed-in area where Muldoon's weapons are stored:  assault
rifles, tasers, tear gas canisters.

To the side of the garage s Muldoon's red jeep.  In the passenger side
of the front seat is a rocket launcher.

Nedry storms in, wheeling his incubator.  He stop suddenly and listens.
Approaching FOOTSTEPS.

                            NEDRY
          Oh, shit!


INT  BASEMENT STAIRS, VISITOR'S CENTER -

Muldoon runs down a long corridor, stop with a skid and yanks open the
door to the garage.  He runs out.  His boots RESOUND on the concrete.

BACK ON - NEDRY'S PANICKED FACE as he listens to the footsteps.
Wheezing, with great difficulty, Nedry bends his knees and strains.  With
everything he's got, he lifts the incub
ator waist-height.  And holds it.

BACK ON MULDOON - Muldoon's footsteps ECHO as they come closer and closer
to the garage.  Muldoon whips down the curve in the stairs.  His jacket
catches on an incomplete section of banister. Yanks him to a stop.

CLOSE ON - Muldoon's jacket as it RIPS, stays caught.

BACK ON - NEDRY as he tries to heave higher, can't.  Beads a sweat roll
down his brow.

MULDOON FREES HIS caught jacket and then keep going.

Nedry's face drips with sweat.  The incubator slips out of his sweaty
palms.  Catches it with his knee.  Nedry curses and with one forceful
boost, he lifts the incubator shoulder height.

CLOSE ON - Muldoon's feet on long stairwell. BOOM. BOOM. BOOM.

NERVOUS, NEDRY BREATHES in a labored fashion.  He looks this way and
that.  He closes his eyes and with one superhuman effort, he heaves the
incubator into the back seat of the red jeep.  Nedry exhales.

At that moment, MULDOON ENTERS the vestibule between stairs and garage.

NEDRY EYES the shadowy figure in the vestibule.  
Nedry's frightened face.

MULDOON STOPS and reaches in his belt.  He pulls out his pistol.  He
takes out long, shiny cartridges.  He loads the pistol.

NEDRY LEAPS in the front of the jeep, pushing aside the rocket launcher,
and zooms into the night.

A moment later, Muldoon enters the garage.  He sniffs at the exhaust
that still hangs in the air.  He looks over and is surprised to see his
jeep gone.  He bends and inspects fresh tread marks. He looks up, his
face straining to understand.


EXT  PARK ROAD - NIGHT

Nedry's red jeep flies down the park road.

CLOSE ON - Nedry's wheel as he turns it.

His tires skid sideways, then regain traction.  The jeep bolts up a
smaller access road.  He skids to a stop at the top of the hill.

Nedry jumps out and looks up.  His high beams illuminate a huge electric
fence prominently labeled:  DANGER!  10,000 Volts!

Two safety fences separate Nedry from the electric fence.  He races to
the first one, pulls out a key chain.  He tries one key, then another,
and another.  It f
its.  Nedry unlocks the gate, swings open the door.

Nedry runs to the second gate.  He slips in the mud.  He slides to the
ground, dropping keys in a muddy pool.

CLOSE ON - Nedry's hand frantically fishing for the key chain in the
muddy water.  Got them!   Unlocks the second gate.

He races to the electric fence.  RAIN PELTS him now.  Water beads on his
face.  Lightning flashes on the 10,000 volts warning.

He grabs the gate with his bare hand and swings it open.

Nedry heads back to his jeep, his fat body strobed by its high beams.
He jumps in the jeep and drives through.  Behind him, the open gates
move recklessly in the stormy night.


BACK ON GARAGE

Ellie and Harding pull in, in their own gas-powered jeep.  Muldoon is
waiting for them.  Now there's a rifle slung over his shoulder.  Harding
jumps out of the jeep.

                            MULDOON
          Get out, get out!  I need this jeep.
          There's a problem with the tour.  Ellie,
          Hammond'll fill you in.

Ellie is concerned, the
n decisive.

                            ELLIE
          No!  I'm going with you, Muldoon.

They race out.


EXT  DOCK - NIGHT

Headlights blazing in the darkness, Nedry's jeep skids to a stop by the
dock where the ANNE B is preparing to leave.  The water is very choppy.

Nedry jumps out and pulls his incubator to the ground.  He begins to
drag it through the mud, toward the ship.  CAPTAIN FARRELL comes to meet
him, along with A COUPLE MEN, who hoist the incubator easily and carry
it toward the ship.

                            CAPTAIN FARRELL
          Good.  Glad to see you.  Were you seen?

                            NEDRY
          Nah.  I'm back in five minutes, they'll
          never know I was gone.
              (yells after the men with the incubator)
          Careful with that thing!  It's worth more
          than the ship.
              (to the Captain)
          When's the copter meeting you?

                            CAPTAIN FARRELL
          It's not.  The storm's coast-to-coast,
       
   nobody could land on the water.

                            NEDRY
              (totally panicked)
          Shit!  What's the backup?  I don't like
          this.  Maybe we should do it another time,
          I don't like it.  I just don't like -

                            CAPTAIN FARRELL
          Shhh!  I wired Baker, he'll have a man at
          the dock in Puntaremas.  We should be
          able to make that in time.

                            NEDRY
              (somewhat relieved)
          Ten hours?

                            CAPTAIN FARRELL
          Yeah, now relax.  I got a lot riding on
          this too, you know.  No one's going to
          mess up now.  Baker's not going to mess
          up.  His people won't let him.

                            NEDRY
          Ok.  Ok.  Here.

Nedry pulls an aerosol can out of the baggy crotch of his pants.

                            NEDRY
          Look, this is insulating spray.

CLOSE ON - Nedry sprays a big mound of white foam into his
 hand,

                            NEDRY
          In about eight hours, spray down all the
          eggs with this stuff.  It'll keep 'em
          warm but not too warm.  I hope Baker has
          it together with the dock.


BACK ON CRUISERS, REST AREA -

Rain drums down on the cruiser.  Timmy stares out at the dark.  Lex
stares nervously out the side window.  Timmy picks up the night goggles
and snaps them on.

                            TIMMY
          Hey, these thing work great.  I can see
          in the dark and I can see far.

He swivels away from the T-Rex paddock and looks out toward the ocean.
He reaches up and adjusts the knob.

                            TIMMY
          Hey!  I wonder if that boat's still
          there?  It is. I think they're getting
          ready to go.

TIM'S POV - the fluorescent green image of men untying casting lines on
the boat.

Another LIGHTNING FLASH and Lex SCREAMS and covers her face.  She cries.

                            REGIS
          Timmy, can you
 give her the goggles?

Lex clamps her hands over her eyes.  Timmy gently nudges her.

                            TIMMY
          Want to look at the boat, Lex?

Timmy hands her the night goggles. Lex dries her eyes and takes a peek
with the goggles toward the ocean.

                            LEX
          Hey, that fat guy's down there. Is he
          gonna come get us and take us to Grandpa?

LEX'S POV - the picture streaks but clearly reveals Nedry shouting at
the Captain.  Men heave the incubator onto the ship.

                            LEX
          They have one of those things from the
          room with all the eggs - you know, where
          they help the baby eggs grow up.

                            TIMMY
          You mean an incubator?

                            GRANT (ON WALKIE)
          What's the commotion?

                            REGIS
          Let me see.  Give them to men, sweetheart.

                            TIMMY (TO WALKIE)
          Uh, Dr. Grant?

REGIS GRABS th
e walkie talkie and tries to silence Timmy.  He knows he
gets there too late and reluctantly lets Timmy have it back.

                            TIMMY
          We saw that computer guy helping 'em load
          an incubator onto the ship.

                            LEX (TO WALKIE)
          Yeah, he's stealing them, Dr. Grant!
          He's stealing my Grandpa's eggs!

                            GRANT (ON WALKIE)
          Nedry?  With an incubator?  Regis??

                            REGIS (TO WALKIE)
              (finally acknowledges)
          That's what they saw.

ON GRANT - He looks sharply at Gennaro.

                            GRANT (TO WALKIE)
          We gotta tell Hammond and Arnold right
          away.  How far is it to the mainland?

ON TIMMY - He looks at Regis.

                            REGIS (TO WALKIE)
          Uh, it's a hundred miles to Puntaremas.
          About a sixteen hour voyage in this
          weather.

ON GRANT - He fiddles with the radio in his cruiser.  No r
esponse still.

                            GRANT
          I wouldn't like to see dinosaurs running
          around Costa Rica.

                            GENNARO
          When's the damn power coming on?


INT/EXT MULDOON'S JEEP, OTHER BACK ROADS

Muldoon and Ellie drive into the storm.  Suddenly, he slams on his
brakes.  In front of him, a tree has fallen, completely blocking the
road.  Muldoon curses, swerves around, and skids to a stop.

As Muldoon gets out and assesses the situation, Ellie lodges herself
between the tree and the jeep.  She pushes the tree with her strong legs
and moves it a good five feet. Quickly, Muldoon and Ellie drag the tree.
As they struggle.

                            MULDOON
          Strong legs.

                            ELLIE
          Lot of track in college.


BACK ON CRUISERS, REST AREA -

IN THE FIRST CAR, Regis drums his fingers on the dashboard.  Timmy wears
his goggles and stares into the rain.  Lex shifts her body around,
trying to get comfortable to rest.

 
                           LEX
          I'm hungry.  When can we get going?

                            REGIS
          When the electricity comes back on,
          honey.  These cars run on electric cables
          buried in the road.

IN THE SECOND CAR, Grant tries the radio to no avail.  Gennaro smokes.
Grant looks forward toward the first cruiser.  He can barely make out
the car in the dark and rain.  Occasionally, LIGHTNING reveals all.

TIMMY PULLS GUM out of his pocket.  Feels a tiny shake, looks around.
He puts it in his mouth, chewing quietly.  SUDDENLY, the whole car
VIBRATES.  Regis' sunglasses jump off the dashboard and fall to the
floor.  The kids look at him.

                            REGIS
          Must be turning on the electricity.

Lex sits up, looks around groggily.

                            LEX
          Feels like a vibration.


INT  T-REX PADDOCK - NIGHT

The T-Rex's huge hind feet crash down, one large foot following after
the other in long, powerful strides.


BACK ON CRUISE
RS, REST AREA - FIRST CRUISER

There is a thud, and then a THUD, and then a THUD.   Tim and Lex share a
frightened look.  Now the thud grows LOUDER.  There is a CRASHING SOUND,
the whole cruiser SHAKES.  Then silence.  Then another SHAKE.

CAMERA PUSHES IN TILL CLOSE - Timmy stares out with his night goggles.

TIM'S NIGHTSCOPE POV IN CLOSE - T-Rex paws rest on the electric fence.

Tim takes off his goggles, stares, transfixed.  Regis picks them up.

EXTREME CLOSEUP - of muscular forepaws with pebbled, grainy skin and
thick, curved nails comfortably gripping a thick wire strand.

The T-Rex moves his body forward of the brush, pushes against the fence.


IN THE SECOND CRUISER -

Grant and Gennaro stare out, unseeing in the rain and darkness.


CLOSE ON LEX -

Tears roll down her cheek.  She cries silently with an unknown fear.
Regis pulls the goggles from his eyes, starts to gag, checks it.

                            REGIS
          Jesus Christ.

                            LEX
          Bad language.

     
                       REGIS
          Jesus Christ.  The fence isn't
          electrified.

                            LEX
          Is that bad?

Regis turns, looks out the side window, away from the T-Rex.

Regis is shaking uncontrollably.  Suddenly he throws open his door and
bolts off into the rain, leaving the door open.  No move from the Rex.

Regis races by the second cruiser.  Grant stares out at him.

                            TIM
          Mr. Regis!  Mr. Regis, where are you
          going?

                            LEX
          He just left us.  He just left us all
          alone.  Timmy, Timmy how could he do
          that?  We're all alone!  We're all alone!

FLASH OF LIGHTNING.  FLASH.  The Rex butts his head.

TIM'S POV - The fence bangs down on top of his cruiser.

Timmy and Lex recoil from the scrape  of the wire mesh against the car.


IN THE SECOND CRUISER -

GRANT AND GENNARO'S POV - through the almost obscuring rain they see the
fallen fence.  An unseen weight pulls on it fur
ther, causing its
electric wire to pop like over-tuned guitar strings.


TIMMY REACHES -

out into the rain for the open door handle.

Another LIGHTNING FLASH and the creature is revealed standing between
the two cruisers, atop the crushed fence.  His head turns back and
forth, he's deciding on his prey.  Grant and Gennaro or Tim and Lex?

Timmy slams the door shut.  He looks directly at the Rex, just a few
feet away.  The Rex turns to him, stares back.

Lex SCREAMS and Timmy claps a hand over her mouth.

There is a whisper over Tim's walkie-talkie.

                            GRANT (ON WALKIE)
          Timmy, be quiet. Don't move.


BACK ON GRANT -

He snaps off the walkie-talkie.

HIS POV - The rain runs in rivulets down the pebbled skin of the
muscular hind legs.  The animal's head is out-of-view, above the
rooftops of the cars.  The Rex lifts its huge hind leg.

                            GENNARO
          Holy shit!  Any suggestions what we do
          now?

                            GRANT
        
  Can't think of a thing.

The T-Rex slowly circles Grant's cruiser.


BACK ON TIM -

He watches the beast move.


BACK ON GRANT AND GENNARO -

As they twist and turn, trying to find a circling Rex in dark and rain.
The Rex pauses right next to Gennaro's window.  He lowers his head,
looking for movement inside.

CLOSE ON - the beady, expressionless reptilian eye moving in the socket.

Grant whispers, hardly moving his lips.

                            GRANT
          Don't move.

Gennaro's leg trembles uncontrollably.


IN THE FIRST CRUISER -

Very frightened, Lex discovers a flashlight.  She flicks it on and off,
distracting herself.  The beam shows her eyes full of a quiet panic.

                            LEX
          It's too, too dark out there.

Tim waves his hands in caution.


BACK ON GRANT, GENNARO, AND THE REX -

The Rex bends down, bumps the windshield with his nose.  Just stays
there, breathing heavily.  In the distance, the flashlight goes on
again.  The Rex raises his head suddenly.  Grant g
rabs his walkie.

                            GRANT (TO THE WALKIE)
          Shut that flashlight, Tim!

As the Rex heads off, a casual swipe of his tail SMASHES the side of the
cruiser, throwing Grant and Gennaro across the inside of the car.


ON TIM -

He lunges for the flashlight.  Lex dodges him, keeps it lit.

                            LEX
          No, it's mine.  Please, I need it.

Tim looks up through the sun roof.  The massive head of the
Tyrannosaurus Rex appears.  Tim watches, transfixed.  Lex looks up.
Irrational with terror, she aims her flashlight like a gun.  Blasts him.
Her flashlight beam cuts through the dark and rain - she sees the beast
plainly for the first time and SCREAMS!

The POOL OF LIGHT bathes the Rex's face.  He smashes his head down onto
the Plexiglass bubble.  It crunches, and falls into the car, crushing
the children.  Tim uses his feet to push it to the side.

Above, the Rex displays is gaping maw, drooling toward the opening.


GRANT -

watches the Rex raise his mighty h
ead again, above the kids' cruiser.


TIMMY AND LEX -

have a half-instant of relief.  Then SLAM.  The Rex butts his head
against the cruiser.  The Rex comes back down, tries to discover his
prey inside the cruiser.  Pushes his head close to the glass, looking.

The dinosaur stands in front of the cruiser, his whole chest heaving,
his forelimbs pawing the air.

Timmy whispers to Lex.

                            TIMMY
          Are you ok?  Be quiet and don't move.

Lex barely nods and grabs Timmy's hand.

The Tyrannosaur places his head next to the car.  He begins to shove the
cruiser with his head.  The cruiser ROCKS.  The back window bursts,
shards go flying.

Inside, the kids are THROWN back and forth, SHOVED against each other,
and finally FLUNG against the top of the car as the cruiser FLIPS.

The whole world TILTS CRAZILY - trunks of palm trees slide by, the
ground above, the blazing eye of the rex, the tops of palm trees.

The cruiser SLAMS DOWN on its side, the windows splat in the mud.  Lex
falls he
lplessly against the side window and lies motionless.  Timmy
falls beside her, banging his head.  He reaches for Lex.

                            TIMMY
              (softly)
          Lex?  Lex?

SILENCE.  No movement from Lex.

THE ANIMAL toys with the cruiser.  Like a dog with its bone, the
dinosaur pushes the cruiser along with his head.  He pushes it past the
picnic tables toward the ripped fence and the embankment.  Each shove
sends the children flying again.

The cruiser is pushes closer and closer to the unprotected embankment.
The cruiser slams to a stop completely upside-down.  The T-Rex steps
right on the cruiser, crushing the roof against the ground.

INSIDE - the children crawl for their lives as the car crushes further
down from above and a tidal wave of mud oozes in from the sides.

THE REX - gnaws at the car, grabs a tire with his teeth,  It ruptures
with a pitiful pop.  The Rex grabs at the axle with his teeth, begins to
drag the car back.  THe kids, half-outside, are pulled with the car.



GRANT DANCES -

with a flare!  The Rex is distracted.

CLOSE ON - the Rex as he ROARS.  The flare gleams in his eyes.

The Rex starts toward Grant.  He tosses the flare over the half-standing
part of the fence.  The Rex lunges after the flare.

GENNARO has reached his limit.  Terrorized, he leaps out and SCREAMS:

                            GENNARO
          Extinct animals should stay extinct!

He bolts.  The Rex sees him and starts after him, THUNDERING by Grant,
who stays frozen in place.

Gennaro sprints for his life.  He's not even a distant match for the T-
Rex jogging behind him.

Gennaro dives into the LADIES ROOM.

INSIDE - he slams the door and shoves the trashcan against the door.
POUNDING FOOTSTEPS APPROACH!  Gennaro backs up into one of the stalls.
LOUDER POUNDING, THE WALLS BEGIN TO VIBRATE!  Gennaro assumes a 'tuck'
position.

ON THE INTERIOR DOOR - The Rex smashes right through the steel-clad
door.  Pieces go flying.

Gennaro hides amidst the wreckage as the Rex sniffs around.


GRANT RUNS BA
CK -

to check on the kids.  He reaches a hand underneath the flipped car,
sitting in the mud.  Lex's soft voice can be heard.

                            LEX (OFF)
          Dr. Grant!

Grant fishes under, finds Lex's hand, drags her out.  He quickly checks
her for broken bones.

                            GRANT
          Lex, are you okay?

                            LEX
          Timmy's unconscious, he won't move.

Lex SCREAMS.  Grant turns to see the Rex return.  He squeezes Lex tight.
The animal goes right past them, back to his toy - Tim's land cruiser!

The Rex BELLOWS a huge cry.  Timmy awakens and sees the Rex above him.
He SCREAMS.

Lex, squeezed in Grant's arms, sees her imperiled brother.

                            LEX
          Timmy!

The Tyrannosaur looks up, GROWLS across the upside-down cruiser, opens
its huge jaws menacingly, all the time staring at Grant and Lex.

INSIDE THE CAR - Timmy tries to unwedge himself.  A thin trickle of
blood runs down his forehead.  He's jammed between the
 crushed roof and
the bent bench seat.  He can't free himself.

The Rex begins to SHOVE the cruiser toward Grant and Lex.  They back up
but they have very few feet left - they're almost at the embankment.
But if they don't move, they'll by crushed by the oncoming car.

Grant slings Lex onto his back.  She grabs her hands around his neck and
digs her feet into his sides.  Grant begins to climb over the downed
fence and into the embankment - it's a huge drop!

Grant grabs a broken cable and lowers himself and Lex over the side of
the embankment.

Just in time as the Rex SHOVES the cruiser further.  Now, the cruiser
TEETERS right on the edge, turning again on its side.  Tim hangs halfway
out of the car, unable to get out further.

Grant, with Lex on his back, slides down the cable, rappelling down the
embankment.  ABOVE, the car looms over them, rocking on the edge.  Lex
looks up and grabs Grant so tightly, she chokes him, unknowingly.

Grant, eyes bulging, sees the danger from above.  He pushes off the wall
and
 swings them toward the next hanging cable.  He reaches out and -

- GRABS THE NEXT CABLE just as -

- the T-Rex BELLOWS and lowers her head, and gives a final shove.  Timmy
and the cruiser SAIL INTO SPACE.  Timmy SCREAMS!

Grant and Lex swing out of the way as the cruiser sails past them.  Lex
SCREAMS, squeezing Grant's neck even tighter!   They watch helplessly as
the cruiser BOUNCES off the wall and CRASH-LANDS into the top of a tree
at the base of the wall.

Grant and Lex stare down at the wreck in the tree.  Timmy can't be seen.
Grant, choking from Lex's grip, grabs her fingers.

                            GRANT
          Let ... go ... please.

The Rex ROARS above.  They look up.

THE REX paws the air, GRUNTS in frustration and STALKS off, LIGHTNING
FLASHES.


EXT  NEDRY'S JEEP, BACK ROADS -

Nedry speeds along the rain-slick road, fish-tailing as he goes.

CLOSE ON - Nedry at the wheel.

NEDRY'S POV - the dark, wet road running alongside a ten-foot chain-link
fence.  Suddenly, a beast-like visage blur
s across the road.

Nedry swerves.  The jeep skids.  Nedry tries to over-steer, can't bring
the careening jeep under control.

The jeep crashes though the fence, bounces down a cement culvert, and
dives into a raging gully.

Nedry curses.  He spins the wheel.  The tires spin and spray.  The
jeep's hopelessly stuck in the gully.  From Nedry's seat in the jeep, he
cranes his head around, examining his situation.

NEDRY'S POV - On the opposite side of the gully, there is an equipment
graveyard.  By the titled jeep headlights, steely monsters all around
can be seen - discarded earth movers, graders, and tractors.

Nedry gets out of the jeep, grabs the winch from the jeep's back end.
and wades over to an abandoned tractor.

                            NEDRY
          Shit. I'm going to have to change clothes.

He loops the winch around the tractor's base.  Suddenly, he stops and
looks around as he hears a gentle HOOTING.  He squints, looking at the
strange steel graveyard lit by the bright beams of the jeep headli
ghts.

HOOT!  HOOT!  A distinctive HOOTING.  Nedry looks up in fear.  SILENCE.

Nedry starts moving toward his jeep.  Again, the HOOT!  Nedry stops,
looks right, looks left.  A RUSTLE in the trees.  Nedry's head cocks.

Looking through trees, lit by the strong beams, Nedry sees a SPITTER in
the eerie mist.  Now it's gone.  Now it's back.  It circles Nedry
warily, hunting him.  Nedry stares.

                            NEDRY
          I hope this is one of them herbivores.

Nedry scrambles the other way, full-tilt.  Hop, hop, and the Spitter
drops in front of Nedry from the other side.  HOOT!

Nedry jumps back, lands on his butt.  The Spitter zips in from the side
- HOOT!

Nedry doubles back, racing through the abandoned equipment, ducking and
rolling under a cement mixer, spinning past a tree.  He splashes down
the embankment, trying to get to his jeep.  He uses the winch line to
steady himself again the raging current.  He finally reaches the jeep,
swings open the door - and, surging out of the water like a
 demonic
apparition, is the SPITTER!  Nedry backs away, directly into the glare
of the headlights!

CLOSE ON - the Spitter.  It's plume opens, bright orange gills swell out
like an umbrella around its neck.  Something squirts beneath its jaws.

A big glob SMACKS Nedry on the arm.  He brushes it off.

                            NEDRY
          Gross.

EXTREME CLOSEUP - the Spitter's head.  The jaws puff, the hood flares
out, the neck snaps forward.  And - it spits.

This glob misses Nedry, splashes off the steaming headlight.

VERY EXTREME CLOSEUP - The Spitter's swollen poison sacs are inflated.
They fire!

This glob hits Nedry in the eyes.  He SCREAMS.

                            NEDRY
          I'm blind, I'm blind.

He falls against the jeep, rubbing his eyes.  The Spitter calmly hops to
the embankment and watches the blinded Nedry weave drunkenly in the
water.  Nedry grabs onto the jeep and pulls himself along toward the
driver's door.  The Spitter stalks, watching him.

Nedry pulls open the jeep door, 
thrusts his head in, slams it against
the door frame.  Now Nedry heaves his whole body into the jeep.  The
Spitter's long ostrich-like legs stretch and bend in an easy gait as it
closes it on Nedry.

Nedry sits behind the wheel, unseeing as the Spitter watches patiently
turns his blind eyes that way.

A long beat.  The Spitter leaps forward, the CAMERA PULLS BACK WIDER AND
WIDER.  Nedry lets out an ear-splitting SCREAM and the car horn BLARES.


INT  TIMMY'S CRUISER

Timmy lies against a spidered side window, his head pressed against the
door handle.  He pushes himself up on one elbow, opens his eyes, and
tries to focus.  Rain has nearly stopped but a light drizzle hits him

Timmy tries to straighten up, but he's too dizzy.  He stops and hears A
CREAKING and feels the whole car gently swaying back and forth.  With a
further effort, he raises his body so that he's standing with his feet
on the window frame and looks out the broken roof.

TIM'S POV - Dense foliage, moving in the wind, hard to see through.  An
o
pen space and - THE GROUND, FORTY FEET AWAY!


INT/EXT  CRUISER - CONTINUING ACTION

Tim's cruiser is lying on its side, stuck in the higher branches of a
tree on the hillside.

                            TIMMY
          Oh shit!

Timmy pulls his body up carefully, trying to get a better view.  He
grabs the steering wheel for support and it spins free in his hand.

CRACK!  The cruiser slips a few inches down the tree.  Timmy grabs the
window frame and freezes.  The car sways in the wind.

CRACK!  The car slips a quick and rocky two feet.

                            TIMMY
          Oh shit, oh shit, oh shit, oh shit!

Timmy hears something.  He raises his head very carefully.  Climbing up
the tree, pulling himself on a nearby branch, is Dr. Grant.

                            GRANT
          Timmy.  Are you ok?

                            TIMMY
          Thank God you're here.  Where's Lex?

                            GRANT
          Below.  She's fine.  Let's get you down.

Timmy nods.

Grant peers throug
h the broken roof of the cruiser, analyzing Timmy's
predicament.  He cranes his head back to examine how the cruiser is
supported in the tree.  Grant turns back to Timmy.

                            GRANT
          Try the door you're leaning against.
          Nice and slow.

Timmy places his weight on the two sides of the door frame and reaches
between his legs, trying to open the door handle.  Stuck.  CRACK!  The
cruiser drops another foot.

Grant scrambles down a couple branches until he is even with the cruiser
again.  He motions for Timmy to hold still.

Grant reaches across to the other car door and tries the outer door
handle.  This one opens and very slowly, he pushes open the door.  Grant
gingerly holds it half-open in mid-air.

                            GRANT
          Crawl this way.  Slowly.

Carefully testing his weight with each step, Timmy lowers his body down.
He pushes his legs out the door.  They kick in the air and slowly come
to rest on a lower branch.  He lets himself down.  Now he si
ts on a
branch, a few feet below the cruiser.

CRACK!  The cruiser drops.  Grant still hangs onto the door but now his
footing on the branch is gone.  His legs hang in space.  The cruiser
hangs precariously above Timmy.  They're all twenty feet in the air.

                            GRANT
          We're going to have to make a jump for
          it, Timmy.  Okay?

Timmy agrees.

                            GRANT
          One, two, three, jump.

Timmy lets go and DROPS.  Grant follows.  So does the cruiser.  It's
hurtling right at them.

Timmy BANGS against the wet tree-trunk and slides down.  Branches WHIP
against his face, his hands SCRAPE against the trunk.  Grant BOUNCES
them.  They scramble down as quick as they can.

Timmy pulls his hands along the sap-sticky surface of the tree.  CRACK!
Grant is stopped for a terrible instant - doubled over a branch, he
flips himself over, dropping further.  The cruiser jolts along, just a
half-step behind them.

Timmy dives the last six feet and HITS the wet earth 
with a THUD!  Grant
CRASHES next to him.  Before they can roll out of the way, the cruiser
keeps coming.  Grant and Timmy look up at it.

GRANT'S POV - The cruiser dropping, dropping toward them.  And finally
stops, just inches away, its dented grill grinning at them, its cracked
headlight glaring.

Oil drips down on Grant.  He grabs Timmy, who grabs the night goggles.
The two roll away.  That second the cruiser SMASHES to the ground.

Grant brushes himself off painfully, extends a hand to Timmy.  Timmy
slowly reaches up and pulls himself standing.

                            TIMMY
          Thanks, Dr. Grant.

                            GRANT
          You owe me one.

Grant turns around in a slow, fluid circle, checking out the forest.

                            GRANT
          Where'd Lex go?

They hear a faint WHIMPERING.

                            TIMMY
          There's Lex.

He runs.  Grant follows.


INT  DRAINPIPE -

Lex is curled up inside the drainpipe.  Her baseball glove is in her
mouth and
 she is rocking back and forth, rhythmically banging her head
against the back of the pipe.  She WHIMPERS.

ON THE HILLSIDE -

Grant and Timmy arrive at the drainpipe and stare in at Lex.

                            GRANT
          Come on out now, Lex.

Lex continues to band her head.  Timmy tries again.

                            TIMMY
          It's your turn to wear the goggles, Lex.

She shakes her head.  He holds up her baseball but she doesn't look.

                            TIMMY
          I found your baseball.

                            LEX
          You did?

But she doesn't move.  Grant speaks encouragingly.

                            GRANT
          Cone on, Lex, it must be cold in there.
          And tight.  Why don't you come out?

                            LEX
          I'm afraid of the "animals".

                            TIMMY
          The "animals" are gone.

                            LEX
          Where did it go?

                            TIMMY
          I don't kno
w but it's not here now.

                            LEX
          Are there any grownups out there?

                            GRANT
          I'm a grownup, Lex.  Come on out.  Gimmie
          you hand, come on, here you go.

                            LEX
          I'm hungry.

                            GRANT
          Me, too.  We've got to get ourselves back
          to civilization.


EXT  ROADSIDE

Regis slowly crawls out from between a couple large boulders.  He looks
around carefully.  He peels mud off his face and rubs his neck.

He touches his cheek.

CLOSE ON Regis' swollen cheek.  He rubs it with his finger.  Suddenly,
he swats at his own mouth.  He reaches in and pulls out a leech fat with
blood.  He hurls it to the ground, spitting.  He grabs another off his
arm and rips if off, leaving a bloody streak.  He digs in his pants and
pulls out another.  He SCREAMS.

As soon as he has done so, he knows he's made a mistake.  He looks
around frantically.  Sees the Rex trot down the road toward 
him.

                            REGIS
          Noooooo!


BACK ON HILLSIDE -

Grant and the kids crest the hill.  Grant puts on the night goggles and
adjusts the dial and looks toward Regis.  The kids can't see that far.

                            TIMMY
          What's going on?

Grant's green POV - Regis and the Rex bounding after him.  Regis hugs a
tree, unmoving.

Grant whispers to the kids.

                            GRANT
          It's Regis and the Rex is after him.  But
          it's okay.  Regis knows the Rex can't see
          him.  Evidently, he can only see move-
          ment.  Regis'll be ok if he stays still.

AFTER A LONG MOMENT, the tyrannosaur walks away, disappears into the
shadows.  Regis waits another long moment and releases his tree.

GRANT'S POV - The tyrannosaur leaps out of the shadows and knocks Regis
to the ground.  Regis jumps up and backs off.  The animal knocks him
right back down.  Regis jumps up again and screams at the beast.

                            REGIS
    
      You don't want to hurt Mr. Regis.  Go
          away.  Ed's your friend.  Back off!

THE REX watches him dance around.  It goes toward him.  This time its
jaws are open.  Regis SCREAMS and in the middle, the scream cuts off.

Grant lets the goggles fall off his face.  They hit the ground with a
METALLIC CLINK.  The Rex turns toward Grant and the kids.

                            GRANT
          Let's go!

Grant grabs both the kids' hands and they begin to run.


BACK ON  TOUR REST AREA -

Drops of water splat on a big fern.  Light swims in the little puddle.
In the sky above, clouds hurry by, intermittently revealing a half-
obscured moon.

The torn fence lies in a crumpled, twisted mess.  The wheel of a Land
Cruiser spins.  A little lizard runs in place on it.

The SOUND of the jeep's engine.  It's Muldoon and Ellie.

THEIR POV - a single cruiser lies on its side in the middle of the road.

                            ELLIE
          Oh, My God!  Where's the other one?

Before the cruiser stops, she j
umps out.   Muldoon shouts a whisper.

                            MULDOON
          Ellie!

Ellie turns in the headlight beams.  Muldoon tosses her a flashlight.

                            MULDOON
          Wait up.

Muldoon skids to a stop, leaps out of the car.  He catches up to Ellie.

They share a frightened, apprehensive look.  Muldoon gets on his knees
and and touches a muddies area.

                            MULDOON
          T-Rex tracks.

Ellie looks out into the forest.

                            ELLIE
          Then they must be out there.  They must
          be out there.  I know it.

                            MULDOON
          Perhaps.

                            ELLIE
          No!  They're out there.

                            MULDOON
          I've seen a lot of animal attacks in the
          bush.  It's not as gory and horrifying to
          see as you'd think.  No pools of blood or
          exposed bones.  There is usually little or
          no evidence left behind.  And if
 victims
          are small, a predator can kill by just
          shaking the little thing to death, eating
          it, and leave not so much as a button.

A definite RUSTLING in the brush.

Ellie jumps and SCREAMS.  Muldoon puts his hand over her mouth and
pushes her down.  They both squat by the cruiser.  SILENCE.  Ellie
swallows.  Muldoon slowly gets up.  Ellie follows.

Their flashlights swing back and forth in the night.  Twigs crack under
their feet.

Ellie hears the RUSTLE at the edge of the forest.  She shines her light
into the brush.  She catches her breath.  Her hand shakes.

Ellie flashes her beam right, left, up, down.  Jumps.  Something is
coming at her, rolling at her.  She gasps, steps back.  It's too late.
It's Gennaro.  His limp body stops at her feet.  She covers her mouth.
Muldoon runs to her.

Gennaro is face-down.  Muldoon takes his pulse.

                            MULDOON
          Thank God.  (beat)  We have to carry him.
          First I have to ...

He stands and removes his 
jacket.

CLOSE ON - Muldoon tears the jacket into long strips.

He wraps Gennaro's wounds.

                            MULDOON
          He's losing a lot of blood.  Help me.

Muldoon and Ellie carry Gennaro to the jeep.  They lay him on the back
seat.  Muldoon jumps in back with him.  He keeps wrapping the wounds.
Ellie starts the engine, looks back at him.

                            ELLIE
          Looks like you've been through this
          before.

Muldoon looks up.

                            MULDOON
          I told you I've seen big game attacks in
          Africa.

She starts the engine.

                            ELLIE
          Right.

Ellie skids out of there.


INT  CONTROL ROOM - NIGHT

The dark room is lit with two outdoor torches.  Light flickering on
their faces, Arnold and Wu stare at the console screen.

                            WU
          Why?

                            ARNOLD
          Because Nedry messed with the code.
          That's why I'm checking it.

              
              WU
          But that could take weeks.  What would be
          faster?  Try keychecks.

Arnold snaps his fingers, grabs Wu,

                            ARNOLD
          That's true.  Keychecks will give me a
          record of every button Nedry pushed.

With a rapid series of keys, Arnold initiates "keystrokes".  The
computer displays a short series of commands.  Arnold runs his finger
down the screen.

                            ARNOLD
          Jesus, that's all he did all afternoon?
          He was just dicking around, maybe waiting
          to get his nerve up.

Wu points to a line.  It reads:  WHTE-RBT.OBJ

                            WU
          What's that?

                            ARNOLD
          Some sort of object.  Let's see if we can
          trace it.

Arnold types FIND WHTE-RBT.OBJ.  Nothing.  He tries DEFINE WHTE-RBT.OBJ.
Still nothing.  LIST WHTE-RBT.OBJ.  The screen fills with data.  Each
line defines another security system that has been shut off:  SECURITY
PERIM
ETER FENCES OFF/   SECURITY - INTERIOR FENCES OFF/  SECURITY -
LABORATORY DOORS OFF/, etc.

                            WU
          What's it mean?

                            ARNOLD
          It wasn't a bug.  It was a trap door that
          fat bastard left for himself.  When he
          hit WHTE-RBT. OBJ, it initiates a set of
          commands that turned the whole goddamn
          park off.  Hammond was right about him.

                            WU
          If I did that I'd leave a way to turn it
          back on.  In case I had to.  I'm sure
          Nedry did.  You're find it.

Arnold nods grimly.


INT  CAFETERIA - NIGHT

Hammond sits quietly in the deserted cafeteria, calmly spooning ice
cream into his mouth.  This room is lit by dozens of candles.

Muldoon walks in, stares at Hammond in the semi-darkness.

                            MULDOON
          We found Gennaro.  He'd badly injured.
          Harding's tending to him in your
          quarters.  He'll be all right if we can
    
      radio for help.  Your grandchildren and
          Grant are somewhere in the park.  I
          believe they're alive but I don't know
          where they are.

                            HAMMOND
          I'm sure you'll find them.

                            MULDOON
          I certainly hope so.

                            HAMMOND
          I'm sure we will.  After all, I keep
          telling everyone, this park is made for
          children.

                            MULDOON
          Just so you understand that they're
          missing, sir.

                            HAMMOND
          Missing?  Of course I know they're
          missing.  You just said that.  Look, Bob,
          let's not get carried away.  We've had a
          little breakdown from the storm or
          whatever, and as a result we've had a
          regrettable, unfortunate accident.  And
          that's all that happened.  We're dealing
          with it.  Arnold will get the computers
          cleaned up, and
 the radio and phone lines
          open.  You'll find those kids and my good
          friend, Dr. Grant.  I'm sure they'll want
          some of this ice cream.  It's very good.


INT  HAMMOND'S QUARTERS - NIGHT

Dark.  Ellie helps Harding get Gennaro comfortable on Hammond's couch.
Blood from Gennaro's injuries stain the rich leather.  Gennaro babbles.

                            GENNARO
          That Rex didn't even give me his full
          attention.  That's what hurts.  I was
          just an afterthought.  I gave him my full
          attention.

                            HARDING
          He's had a lot of morphine.

                            GENNARO
              (sings)
          Not enough.

                            ELLIE
          I need to find Wu.  I have to run a few
          tests in his lab.

                            HARDING
          He's probably in the control room, get-
          ting in the way while Arnold tries to put
          things together.

As Ellie leaves, Genna
ro is singing a shanty in his morphine stupor.

                            GENNARO
          Yo ho, I'll close this place down ...


EXT  THE ANNE B AT SEA - NIGHT

The ship is tossed around on a stormy sea.

                                                     MATCH CUT TO:


INT  STATEROOM -

The eggs are tossed around in the womb of the incubator.  The swell
settles but the rocking of one egg doesn't stop.  The egg cracks, a
silvery line runs down its side.


EXT  PARK - NIGHT

Somewhere in the dark park, laced by low fog, Grant, Timmy and Lex walk.

                            LEX
          I'm tired.

                            TIMMY
          You're too big to be carried.

                            LEX
          But I'm tired-tired.

                            GRANT
          Okay, Lex.

Grant picks her up.

                            GRANT
          Oof!  You're heavy.

The full moon is blurred by drifting clouds.  Their blunted shadows lead
the three across an open field toward dark woods beyond
.  Grant is lost
is thought, trying to decide where to go.

                            GRANT
          I think we're still in his paddock.

Lex's heavy eyes open.  Her eyes grow big.  She taps Grant's shoulder.

                            GRANT
          What?

                            LEX
          Don't you see?  Don't you see?

                            GRANT
          What?

                            LEX
          The fence.

                            GRANT
              (squinting)
          No.

                            TIMMY
          Oh I do, right there!

Lex lets herself slide off Grant and runs into the woods.  Timmy
follows.  Grant follows, squinting.  Finally, he sees.  A big smile.

The kids look up at a twelve foot high electric fence.  Timmy gulps.

                            LEX
          Timmy's scared of heights.

Timmy spins in fury.

                            TIMMY
          Shut up.

Lex and Timmy stare at each other.  No fighting - now.  They relax.

                   
         GRANT
          Okay with the fence, Timmy?

Timmy eyes it.  Nods hesitantly.  They start to climb.  Lex climbs easily.

                            LEX
              (mumbles quietly)
          'Fraid of heights.

Timmy climbs tentatively.  A dinosaur ROARS in the distance.

CLOSE ON - Timmy's foot loses its grip.

Timmy hangs for a moment, held only by his straining hands.

All three stop.  Wait.  Timmy regains his balance.  Slowly, they proceed
up and over.

On the other side, Grant looks around.  More high trees.  Beyond a field.

                            GRANT
          A herbivore grazing area.  Excellent.

Grant starts to walk toward it.  Timmy stops.  Lets sits on a tree root.

                             TIM
          We gonna walk all night?

Grant looks at his watch.

                            GRANT
          Twelve hours before that ship reaches the
          mainland.

                            TIM
          We need sleep.

True, and Grant's thinking the same thing.  He looks aro
und, surveying
the misty forest.  He looks straight up into the beautiful, tall trees
that ring the wide-open grassy meadow.

                            GRANT
          Up there.

                            TIM
          Climb?  Again?  I can't climb again?

Grant smiles.

                            GRANT
          Sure you can.

Grant checks out and rejects tree after tree.  Near the meadow he finds
it.  A good, basic climbing tree.


EXT  UPPER BRANCHES OF THE TREE

Grant helps Lex get comfortable on his lap.  Timmy tucks himself in
between Grant's outstretched legs.  Grant looks out.  Back to kids.

Timmy and Lex are already snoring.  Lex turns and hugs Grant close to
her.  She murmurs in her sleep.  Grant starts to pat her shoulder when
Timmy, without waking, reaches to her and strokes her hair.

                            TIMMY
              (mumbles)
          It's ok, Lex.  Everything's gonna be okay.

                                                       CUT TO:

CLOSE ON - amoeba-like creatures 
swimming in a pool.


INT  INCUBATION ROOM, LABORATORY - NIGHT

Ellie lifts her head away from the powerful microscope.

The dark room is lit by flashlight.  Battery packs power the microscope.
Wu paces the room, regarding his eggs with dismay.  Sitting on their
long tables with no moving wands above them - no thermal sensors.

                            WU
          What is taking Arnold so long?  This room
          is too cold.  My eggs will be damaged.

Ellie swings the lens to Wu.  Not so interested but peers in politely.

                            ELLIE
          No sign of those berries.  Really
          interesting.  There are indications of a
          similar virus in every tissue sample.
          But it's not in the ground.  Could I look
          at some of the discarded embryos?

Wu reluctantly agrees.  He opens a cabinet and brings her samples.

                            WU
          I'm sure you'll find your virus ... or a
          similar one.  All animals carry many
          viruses 
in a dormant condition.  It's
          almost impossible to say with certainty
          which are the same strains.

Ellie begins a test on a sample.  She adds a reagent and marks up a
slide.  As she works:

                            ELLIE
          And yet from what Harding tells me, many
          of you animals have similar symptoms -
          besides the microvesicles, a lack of
          hunger, loss of reproductive urges, sores
          in the mouth and gums.

Wu waves his arms.

                            WU
          What the hell does Harding know?  He's a
          veterinarian, not a pathologist.


BACK ON  CONTROL ROOM -

Arnold pushes his chair away from his console and claps his hands as
Muldoon walks in.  Muldoon asks hopefully.

                            MULDOON
          What is it?

Arnold points to the screen.

                            ARNOLD
          That's it.

Muldoon comes closer.

                            MULDOON
          That's what?

                            ARNOL
D
          I found the command to restore the
          original code.  It resets the linked
          parameters.

                            MULDOON
          The fences and the power?

                            ARNOLD
          Right.  And it does something else. It
          erases the code lines that refer to it.  It
          destroys all evidence it was ever there.

                            MULDOON
          Nedry could steal the eggs, get back and
          reset the whole show.  No one would ever
          miss him.

                            ARNOLD
          Watch this.

Arnold types in a command.  The screen flickers and changes.  Arnold and
Muldoon look out the window as lights come on through out the park.

                            ARNOLD
          Hot damn!

                            MULDOON
          Are the fences back on?

                            ARNOLD
          You bet they are.  It will take a few
          seconds to get up to full power, because
          we've got fift
y miles of fence out there,
          and the generator has to feed the
          capacitors along the way.  But in a half
          a minute we'll be back in business.

Arnold points to the transparent map of the park.  On it, bright red
lines snake out, moving throughout the park, as electricity surges
through the fences.

                            MULDOON
          Motion sensors?

                            ARNOLD
          Got them too.   It will be a few minutes
          while the computer counts.  Then I'll
          tell you where Grant and the kids are and
          you can go and get them.  But every-
          thing's working.  Half past ten and we've
          got the whole thing back up and running.

Muldoon picks up a phone, shakes his head.

                            MULDOON
          Just hiss.


BACK ON  GRANT AND KIDS IN TREE -

Grant snores.  A mosquito buzzes around him.  He waves him away and
continues to sleep.

In the distance, a tiny BEEPING. Below the towering tree, across the
f
ield, a sensor beeps, it's green light blinks, and the beeping stops.

IN THE HIGH TREE, the branches sway.  Grant and the kids sleep on.


BACK ON  CONTROL ROOM -

The glowing, glass map.  Arnold and Muldoon stare at it.

                            MULDOON
          What is taking so damn long?  Where are they?

                            ARNOLD
          There's a lot of extraneous movement out
          there.  Branches blowing, birds, back-
          ground movement.  It may take, ah, okay,
          count's finished.

Muldoon looks at Arnold anxiously.  Arnold looks down.

                            ARNOLD
          Hmmmm.  I don't see them.  Maybe they're
          out of range of a sensor.

                            MULDOON
          Shit.  I don't know where they are.  I
          wish I could go out there   But I haven't
          got anything to use on the Rex.  My
          rocket launcher's in the jeep Nedry
          stole.  And going out with a big gun in
          the dark would be suicide
.


INT  INCUBATION ROOM, LABORATORY - NIGHT

Brightly lit again.  Ellie performs tests with a centrifuge.  She looks
at Wu, who sits across from her in a high stool, stifling a yawn.

                            ELLIE
          Why don't you get some sleep, Dr. Wu?
          I'm just going to run a couple more tests
          and then I'm going to turn in myself.

Wu doesn't need to be told twice.  He climbs off his stool.

                            WU
          No point in everyone being exhausted.

He starts to leave.  He comes back and speaks consolingly at Ellie.

                            WU
          I'm sure Muldoon will find Dr. Grant as
          soon as there is light.

Ellie appreciates his effort, nods seriously, goes back to work.

                                                      DISSOLVE TO:


EXT  OCEAN - JUST BEFORE DAWN

Beautiful dark ocean.  The sky is a rich blue.  A morning star fades as
the sky lightens.  The Anne B is a small dot on the massive ocean.


INT  STATEROOM, ANNE B 
-

Eggs sit in the incubator.  A hand sprays them with foam.  Leaves.
CAMERA EXAMINES the eggs as the foam disperses.  More cracks.  One egg
jumps with a bolt from within.  It settles.  Jumps again.

                                                      CUT TO:

ESTABLISHING AERIAL - the primordial beauty of Isla Nublar at dawn.


EXT  VISITOR'S CENTER - DAWN

Muldoon drives out into the park in Harding's jeep.  THREE WORKERS
travel with him.  Each carries a rifle.


EXT  GRANT'S TREE - DAWN

CAMERA LOOK DOWN on Grant, Lex and Timmy still sleeping in the tree.  A
large shadow falls on their quiet faces.  Lex opens an eye. She SCREAMS.

Grant and Timmy wake up with a start.

THEIR POV - AS THE CAMERA LOOKS THROUGH THEIR LEGS AND TILTS UP right
into the huge face of A DUCK-BILLED HADROSAUR, a gigantic dinosaur with
cow eyes.  Its head moves up through the canopy of the trees.  Then the
head swoops way down below.  And returns to Grant's level and stares at
his shoe.

The hadrosaur tastes Grant's shoe.  The kids
 press tightly into Grant.

                            LEX
          He gonna eat us?

                            GRANT
          I don't think so.  She's a ...

                            GRANT AND TIMMY
          ... herbivore.

The hadrosaur HONKS.  Lex covers her ears.  Grant smiles and motions to
Lex.  He picks a big fruit off the tree and tosses it into the
hadrosaur's mouth.  CHOMP.  He feeds it again.  Lex and Timmy toss a few.

CHOMP!  CHOMP!  HONK!  HONK!

The hadrosaur's big head swoops way down, momentarily gone.

When she returns, all three quickly gather fruits and throw them into
her mouth.  The hadrosaur pulls back with her giant mouthful of fruit.
She pulls further and further back and then her huge head turns and
moves down.

Grant, Lex and Timmy strain to see through the branches.

THEIR POV - The hadrosaur is feeding four scampering, baby hadrosaurs.
Letting the fruit tumble from her mouth into theirs.  Lex YELLS:

                            LEX
          Come here, babies!  Get your b
reakfast!

The babies run to the base of the tree.  The kids toss fruits right down
to them.  Lex and Timmy climb lower to feed them right from their hands.

Grant and the mother hadrosaur stare at each other.  She sniffs his
foot.  He moves closer, straddling a branch.  He lifts up her lip and
examines her gums.

CLOSE ON - a ripped piece of fence stuck in her teeth.

Grant yanks it out.  He lets it drop to the ground.  He take a large
leaf and rubs her teeth with it.

CLOSE ON - her mouth as Grant's hand touches the side of her tongue.  He
sees little tiny bumps.

The hadrosaur lets out a low groan.   Grant is puzzled, rubs harder.

                            GRANT
          Like the trike.  Maybe it's not the stones.

HONK!   She pulls her mouth away.  The baby hadrosaurs turn to the
honking adult.  She is leaving quickly.  They follow quickly behind her.
The small herd leaves, casually trampling trees as they go.


EXT  BACK ROADS, PARK - MORNING

Muldoon and workers drive rapidly in the jeep.  Suddenly,
 Muldoon slams
on the brakes.

MULDOON'S POV - ABOUT TWENTY PROCOMPSOGNATHIDS (COMPYS), small chicken-
sized scavenging dinosaurs, scramble across the road.

                            MULDOON
          Where the hell are they going?

Muldoon watches them cross.  He thinks it over.  Spins the wheel and
follows them off the road.

                            MULDOON
          Let's see what's up.


EXT  BELOW THE TREE, PARK - MORNING

Timmy bravely jumps from a very low branch.  He smiles and looks at
Grant, who's already on the ground.  Grant looks off in the distance.

                            GRANT
          Tim, I think there's a motion sensor
          across the field and down there.

                            TIM
          Where's Lex?

ALONE IN THE BUSHES -  Lex kneels.  She holds a big fruit and calls:

                            LEX
          C'mere boy, c'mere.

She tosses the fruit.

CLOSE ON - the fruit rolling away.

Lex gets up and follows the rolling fruit.  She picks it up.

           
                 LEX
          It's very, very good.

She tosses it again.

                            LEX
          C'mere boy, c'mere.

Lex's eyes scan the bushes, then stop.  She smiles.

LEX'S POV - hidden in the brush, a baby triceratops' eye peeks at Lex.

Lex pushes the fruit closer.  The BABY TRICERATOPS comes out of the
brush, squeaking as it goes.  It nibbles the fruit.  Lex rolls another.

BACK ON GRANT AND TIM - They look around.  Timmy stops, mouth open, YELLS:

                            TIM
          Dr. Grant, Dr. Grant, look.

Grant turns, looks OFFSCREEN.  He's astonished by when he sees.

HIS POV - a row of shrubs, which Lex seems to soar above.  As a break in
the shrubs, it's clear that she's riding the baby triceratops.  Loving it.

                            LEX
          Whoa!

With a whoop, Grant and Timmy chase after Lex on her triceratops.

Lex rides through low brush, ducking down as she goes.  Then beneath the
tall trees as she enters the forest.  She crosses a stream on a log
b
ridge.  Light showers down through the branches.  The water shimmers.
Lex in is paradise.

Behind her, Grant and Timmy shout for her to stop.  She waves, kicks the
triceratops like it's a horse and YELLS:

                            LEX
          Giddyup!

The trike takes off, in a rush.  It trips over a fallen tree, downed by
the storm.  The trike takes a spill and Lex goes flying.

                            LEX
          Whoa!!  Take is easy!

She passes over the trike's head, in the air, and SCREAMS as she flies:

                            LEX
          I can't swim!

She SPLASHES into the stream.

Timmy, first to arrive on the scene, dives in heroically.  He comes up
sheepish and muddy - and sees Lex standing in a foot of water.

The baby dinosaur rolls to a stop, mowing down a patch of saplings as
she goes.  It stands up, dizzy and out of breath.

Timmy wipes mud off himself.  Grant helps the kids out of the water.
The baby triceratops follows them.  Grant yells to the baby trike.

                 
           GRANT
          Go home now.  Home to Freda!

                            LEX
          Oh, let him stay.  He likes me to ride
          him.  He could carry me instead of you,
          Dr. Grant.  Please, let him stay,

Grant shakes his head,

                            GRANT
          Go!  Go away.  Go!  Get out of here!

The trike whimpers and watches the three of them walk on.  Lex is
heartbroken.

                            LEX
          Will I ever play with him again?

Grant looks across the field, abundantly beautiful in the early morning.
He has to keep them going.   He points across the field.

                            GRANT
          We gotta get to that motion detector.
          It's still a ways.

Lex looks behind her.  In the distance, more hadrosaurs join the herd
eating from the tall trees.  Some cool off in a shallow lagoon.  They
drink, lowering their flat heads, meeting their own reflections in the
still water.  When they look up again, their heads swivel.  At the
water's 
edge, a baby hadrosaur ventures out, squeaks, and scrambles back
while the adults watch indulgently.


EXT  OFF ROAD, PARK - MORNING

Muldoon and his workers now follow the compys on foot.  The compys trail
off in different directions.  Muldoon and his workers break apart to
track the different groups.

A BEARDED WORKER follows his party of compys.  He looks ahead and sees a
small group stopped ahead.  Their heads are bent to the ground.

A BALD WORKER has reached another cluster of compys.  Kicking, he
scatters them.

Muldoon's tracking leads him to the equipment graveyard where Nedry was
lost.  He sees his stolen red jeep.  He rushes to it.  On the passenger
side still sits the rocket launcher.  He opens the door to retrieve it.
When he leans in, his eye catches the tilted side-view mirror.  The
image is of many compys bent over the ground.  He comes around, YELLING.

                            MULDOON
          I found Nedry!

In the distance, the call is ECHOED.

                            BEARDED WORKE
R (OFF)
          I found him!

                            BALD WORKER (OFF)
          Found him!


INT  HAMMOND'S QUARTERS - DAY

Hammond peeks in the door and sees Gennaro, heavily bandaged, dozing on
the couch.  Gennaro's eyes flutter and Hammond enters and smiles.

                            HAMMOND
          He, Donald.  Glad you're awake.  I hope
          you're not going to take this little
          mishap you had and hold it against my
          park.  It would be terrible if the
          finishing funds were in any way held up.

Gennaro just grins and shakes his head.  He's very high on morphine.  He
wants to speak but Hammond keeps talking.  After each sentence, Gennaro
enthusiastically agrees with a nod.

                            HAMMOND
          You really shouldn't have gotten out of
          the vehicle.  The park is actually quite
          safe.  A disenchanted worker sabotaged
          some equipment.  Arnold, Muldoon, and Wu,
          all loyal employees, are righting damage
    
      as we speak.

                            GENNARO
          Oh good, 'cause I love the park!  It's
          more than we ever dreamed!  Those
          brachiosaurs are so big!  And those
          Spitters -
              (he spits)
          - incredible!  I only have one problem.
          Aren't we going to have pterodactyls?
              (he frowns, smacks his forehead)
          Oh, they'd fly away!

Gennaro looks off, watching the imaginary pterodactyls fly away.
Hammond takes out a bag.

                            HAMMOND
          Take a look at these, Donald.  Have you
          seen these?  These are great.

Hammond dumps things out of the bag.  They are souvenirs of the park.

                            HAMMOND
          Wind-up toys.  Spitter umbrellas.

Gennaro is thrilled.

                            HAMMOND
          I got some great t-shirts.  Dinosaur
          bingo, hey ...

Hammond leans closer.

                            HAMMOND
          Wu says he can make a foot high
    
      triceratops.  We'll sell pets as living
          souvenirs.  Bio-engineered to eat only
          food we sell, of course.

Gennaro can't take it.  Great idea!  He high-fives Hammond repeatedly.

Harding enters and gently taps Hammond on the shoulder.

                            HARDING
          You'll have to bear with him, Mr. Hammond.
          He's doped to infinity and back.


INT  INCUBATION ROOM, LABORATORY - DAY

Sunlight pours through the windows.  Ellie sits with her head in hands.
She looks around and wanders the lab.  Notices a drawer, slides it open.

X-rays.  She shuffles through, finds some marked: FREDA.

Ellie snaps on a viewing light at her lab station.  She studies the X-
ray.  She looks up in surprise.   Studies it again.

The viewing light is snapped off.  Ellie looks again.  Wu stands there.

                            WU
          Who gave you permission -

Ellie attacks back.

                            ELLIE
          I'm here to investigate this park. And
          there's
 plenty you haven't told me.

                            WU
          That's absurd.

                            ELLIE
          These bones aren't fully formed.

                            WU
          You're qualified to interpret x-rays of
          living dinosaurs?  I doubt it.  It took
          me many months to learn.

                            Y
          I'll tell you something else, Freda isn't
          an adult, just a huge juvenile.

                            WU
          You're making a lot of assumptions here.

                            ELLIE
          Right.  What the hell is going on, Wu?

They stare at each other in the bright sunlight.

                            HAMMOND (OFF)
          Growth hormones.

The two swing around.  Hammond stands in the sharp shadows of the room.

                            WU
          She didn't have a right to explore my lab.

                            HAMMOND
          Let's not argue, Wu, we have a serious
          problem.
              (to 
Ellie)
          These animals don't last.  There is a
          regularity, a predictability about when
          they die.  It's always ... very young.
          We don't know why.  Given time, I'm sure
          Wu will figure it out.  It's just ...

                            WU
          Just some adjustment in the code is
          required.

                            HAMMOND
          But there are deadlines.  The park opens
          next summer. And it requires full-grown
          specimens.  So Wu uses growth hormones to
          achieve the desired size in a short
          amount of time.  But they all keep dying
          and we don't know how to stop it.

Ellie and Wu stare at Hammond.  He steps forward.  The light is so hot
behind him that his appearance is like an apparition.

                            HAMMOND
          I was going to tell you all this myself,
          Dr. Sattler, after Gennaro stopped
          breathing down my neck.  That's why I
          wanted you and Dr. Grant 
here on my
          island - you have to help me keep the
          dinosaurs alive.  Won't you please help
          me?

                                                      CUT TO:

IN THE SKY, the sun momentarily burns through the clouds -


INT  HAMMOND'S QUARTERS - DAY


Ellie enters.  On the couch, Gennaro snores lightly.  In a chair nearby
Harding sleeps, a roll of gauze grasped in his hands.

Ellie walks over to the large model of the park that Hammond revealed.
She looks at the miniature dinosaurs that sit in different sectors of
the park.  She picks up the plastic Rex, examines it, drops it back in.

She brushes by Harding and studies Gennaro's pasty, sleeping face.  Air
blows in and out of his dry lips.  She examines the gauze wrapped around
his wounded leg.  It seeps with blood.


INT CONTROL - DAY

Arnold works at his console.  Hammond and Wu lean over his shoulder.
Ellie bursts in, very agitated.  Hammond looks up.

                            ELLIE
          Gennaro's losing a lot of blood. 
 He
          needs transfusions.  We gotta get a
          rescue helicopter.  Arnold, what's with
          the phones?

                            ARNOLD
          Ah hell. I just can't find it.

He sips his coffee and stares bleary-eyed at the screen.

                            ELLIE
          Find what?

                            ARNOLD
          Nedry jammed all the communication lines.
          He inserted some command, a lockout into
          the program code.  I can't find it,
          because I gave that restore command and
          it erased part of the program listings.

                            WU
          So?  Just reset - shut the system down
          and you'll clear the memory.  Everything
          will be in the normal wakeup mode.

                            ARNOLD
          Shut the system down?

                            WU
          And reset.

                            ARNOLD
          I've never done that before.  And I'm
          reluctant to do it.  Maybe it's tr
ue, all
          systems will come on, but maybe they won't.

                            ELLIE
          Look, there is a sick man here who needs
          medical attention or he'll die.  Four
          people are out there, missing in your
          park.  We need search teams.  We have to
          have a phone or radio.

Arnold still hesitates.

                            ELLIE
          Well?

                            ARNOLD
          Well, it's just that the safety systems
          don't function with the computer shut
          down and -

Ellie boils over.

                            ELLIE
          - turn the goddamn safety systems off!
          Can't you get it through your head that
          we have no choice?

Arnold looks at Hammond, who now stares out into the park.  Without
turning, Hammond nods his consent.

                            ARNOLD
          Okay.

Arnold gets up and goes to the main panel.  He opens the doors and
uncovers the metal swing-latches over the safety switches. 
 He pops them
off, one after another.

                            ARNOLD
          You asked for it.  And you got it.

He throws the master switch.

The control room goes black.  All monitors go black.  Arnold, Wu and
Ellie stand in the dark.

                            ELLIE
          How long do we have to wait?

                            ARNOLD
          Thirty seconds.


EXT  FIELD IN THE PARK -

Grant and kids walk through a clearing.  Lex stops.

                            GRANT
          What is it?

                            LEX
          I hear something.

                            GRANT
          Come on.

Timmy looks around. The morning is still and peaceful. Branches are
motionless.  Only a little bird jumps from one branch to another.

                            LEX
          Hear it now?

                            TIMMY
          You're hearing things.  Come on, we gotta
          get back and warn them about the boat.

Lex hesitates but doesn't want to be left behind.  She runs betw
een
Grant and Timmy.  Then they all hear it.

HONKING.  It comes from the herd of duck bills behind them.  First the
honking of a single animal, then another animal joins in, then another
and another, until the whole herd has taken up the honking cry.

                            TIMMY
          What's going on?

                            GRANT
          They're agitated.

The duckbills twist and turn.  They hurry out of the water, circling the
young ones to protect them.

With a ROAR, the T-Rex bursts from the trees, just a hundred yards away
straight toward the hadrosaurs.

                            LEX
          I told you I heard something!

The earth SHAKES.  A low rumble is heard and felt as the hadrosaurs begin
to run  in a parallel direction to the course of Grant and the kids.

                            GRANT
          Outta the way, kids! Run!

Grant grabs Lex, lifting her bodily off the ground, and carries her like
a football.  Timmy runs beside them.

Hadrosaurs run alongside of them.  Grant
 hears the crashing of trees.
He takes a glance over his shoulder.

GRANT'S POV - a flurry of flamingos takes flight and spooks the herd
into changing direction.  The hadrosaurs swerve and charge right into
the path of Grant, Lex and Timmy.  They all SCREAM.


BACK ON  CONTROL ROOM -

The quiet black room.  Hammond stands by the big window.  His pensive
presence affects all in the room.

Arnold looks at his illuminated watch.

                            ARNOLD
          Memory should be cleared by now.

He pushes the main switch back on.  Nothing on.

                            ARNOLD
          Damn.

Arnold pushes the switch off and then on again.  Still nothing.  He
glances at Hammond's back.  Sweat forms on his brow.

                            ELLIE
          What's wrong?

                            ARNOLD
          Oh hell!  I have to turn the safety switches
          back on before I restart the power.

Arnold flips on three safeties, and covers them again with latch covers.
Holding his breath, he
 turns on the main power switch.

First, there is the computer beep.  Ellie jumps.  Then relaxes.  The
lights come on.  The screens hum.  Hammond's shoulder twitches slightly.

                            ARNOLD
          Thank God!

The room is jubilant.  Hugs and cheers.  Ellie picks up a phone.

                            ELLIE
          Arnold!  They're still not working.

                            ARNOLD
          No, it sounds dead but after a reset, all
          system modules have to be brought on line
          manually.

Arnold quickly goes back to work at his console.  Hammond turns.

                            WU
              (to Hammond)
          Arnold's about to get the phones up.

Arnold pushes the chair back.

                            ARNOLD
          Okay, we're up again!

Ellie grabs the phone back up.

                            ELLIE
          No we're not.  Phones still dead.

Arnold swings her way.

                            ARNOLD
          Can't be -

                    
        HAMMOND
          My God, look at this, Arnold.

Hammond points to the transparent map.  A tight cluster of dots by the
lagoon move in a coordinated way.  Moving fast, in a kind of swirl.

                            ELLIE
          What's happening?

                            ARNOLD
              (tonelessly)
          The duckbills.

                            WU
          My good God.

                            ELLIE
          What?

                            ARNOLD
          It's the Rex ...

                            HAMMOND
          They've stampeded ...


BACK ON  THE HADROSAURS - LOW ANGLE ON THE STAMPEDE -

Grant and kids run for their lives.  Behind them the duckbills charge
with surprising speed.  Their enormous bodies charge in a tight group,
kicking up dirt, rocks, whole trees as they thunder along.

CLOSE ON - a charging duckbill as he HONKS, eyes wild with fear.

A horrible ROAR of the T-Rex sends a duckbill infant squealing and
struggling to stay out from underfoot.

CLOSE ON
 - A huge adult foot almost tramples the infant.

Frightened and confused the infant scampers even deeper into the
maelstrom.  The frenzied herd raises a great cloud of yellow dust.

GRANT AND LEX AND TIMMY run wildly.  The stampede is very close behind
Grant and the kid's faces are covered with sweat and dust.

Another deafening ROAR of the T-Rex.

Grant leads them toward a rocky outcrop with a stand of big conifers.
The animals continue to close.

CLOSE ON - the running feet of the stampeding animals.  The ground
VIBRATES every time it is struck by the huge feet.

GRANT AND THE KIDS scramble onto the rocks.  They frantically tuck in
between big boulders as the the herd reaches them.  Lex shields her
dusty face with her hands as she wedges deeper between the rocks.  Grant
pushes her down deeper and looks up from between the rocks.

GRANT'S POV - the immense legs of the first hadrosaur to pass.  Another
slams its big tail against the rocks, leaving a splash of hot blood.

Stampeding legs send clods of dirt fl
ying in the air.  Above, even the
birds are running.  Disoriented, they fly frantically along.

GRANT AND THE KIDS are enveloped in dust.  Just shadows of huge bodies
with giant limbs.  BELLOWS of pain as animals wheel and circle.

A boulder is dislodged and it rolls toward Timmy.  He dives out of his
rocky hiding place.  The boulder continues on toward Grant and Lex.
They dive after Timmy.  The group buries itself anew in a group of thick
roots tangled amidst smaller rocks.  The boulder continues on, SMASHING
the rocky enclave they have just left.

Grant and the kids huddle and watch the last under-bellies oscillate
above them.  The stampede goes past.  They lie there, unable to move.
They watch the herd trample on.


CLOSE ON - The Rex's foot as it crushes a motion sensor.

Lex SCREAMS.  Grant and Timmy cover her mouth.

The T-Rex hunts down the herd.  He targets his prey.  A young hadrosaur.

As the hadrosaur gallops into the shadowy treeline, the Rex lunges
fiercely.  The Rex and its victim are enveloped 
in dust.

Grant holds Lex close.  She watches the terrible cloud with a quiet
horror.  Timmy makes the first move to leave.

                            TIMMY
          Let's go.  Now!

The herd's remainder gallops off into the safety of the deep jungle.

Grant, Lex and Timmy run in the opposite direction.


BACK ON  CONTROL ROOM -

Hammond, Arnold, Wu, and Ellie watch the monitor as the dust slowly
clears.  Hadrosaurs scatter.

Now the Rex is calm and quiet.  BACK TO CAMERA, he gnaws on something.

                            HAMMOND
          No!  Oh no!  He make a kill.  He killed
          one of my animals!  Where's Muldoon?

                            ARNOLD
          I'm sorry, Mr. Hammond.

                            HAMMOND
          My animals!  My animals!

Muldoon enters, limping in.  Hammond is very upset.

                            HAMMOND
          Where have you been?  My Rex killed a
          hadrosaur.  You should be out there,
          doing something.

                            MUL
DOON
          I just came to tell you - you're minus
          one computer expert.


EXT  BY THE RIVER, PARK - DAY

The water rushes a few hundred yards away.  Grant and the kids have
finally rested enough.  Grant nods to Timmy.

                            GRANT
          We'll walk by the river.  That leads back
          to the Visitor's center.

                            LEX
          Not me.  I'm not walking anymore.

                            TIMMY
          Come on Lex, I'll carry you.

                            LEX
          Nope.  Too scared.

Timmy looks up at Grant.  Grant kneels down by Lex.  Lex embraces Grant.

                            GRANT
          You ready?

She wipes her tears.

                            LEX
          Can we go on the raft?  Then we don't
          have to walk so close to the animals!

                            GRANT
          What raft?

Lex points to a low concrete maintenance building with bars.  It is
twenty yards away.

                            LEX

          Where I found Freda's baby.

Grant start to stand.  He's thinking.

                            GRANT
          It's still mid-morning.  I bet we have at
          least ten miles to go.  If we take the
          raft along the river, we can make much
          faster progress.

                            TIMMY
          Let's do it.


INT  MAINTENANCE BUILDING -

Grant stumbles deep in the gloomy recesses of the building.  He pushes
past drums of herbicide, tree-pruning equipment, spare tires, coils of
cyclone fencing, huge fertilizer bags, stacks of ceramic insulators,
empty motor-oil cans, work-lights and cables.

                            GRANT
          Lex, I don't see any raft.

Timmy looks at Lex.  Where is it?  Lex doesn't know.

                            TIMMY
          Keep going.

Grant keeps pushing through bags of cement, lengths of copper pipe,
piles of green mesh.  Two plastic oars hang on the concrete wall.

                            GRANT
          Bullseye!

Timmy is reliev
ed.  Lex smiles.

                            LEX
          Told you!

Grant grabs them.  Looks around, still -

                            GRANT
          No raft. Where did you see it, Lex?

                            LEX
          Actually, I never really saw one. Just
          assumed.

                            GRANT
          Assumed?

She nods.  Grant and Timmy resume looking.

IN THE REAR OF THE BUILDING - Lex walks below a barred window.  Slats of
light fall on her back.  She sees a dark closet door ajar.  She brushes
the handle.  It swings opens and two bright orange life preservers fall
on her, knocking her to the ground.

LEX SCREAMS, frantically pushing the life preservers off.

Grant's head pops up.  Timmy runs to her side.  She is wrestling
irrationally with the life preservers.  Timmy drops to the ground.

                            TIMMY
          Lex!  Lex!  You're okay, you're okay!

Lex is overcome with fear.  Timmy grabs a preservers and puts it on.

                            TIMM
Y
          Look, Lex!  Look!

She looks at him, realizes, and bursts out laughing.  Timmy laughs with
her.  Grant joins them.  He sits on a box and laughs.

                            GRANT
          I'm afraid there's no raft.

Grant gets up.  He reaches for the hands of the kids.  Timmy sees it -
the box Grant sat on is labeled: RAFT STORAGE.  Timmy smiles..


AT THE RIVER'S EDGE -

Grant pulls a cord.

With a LOUD HISS, the rubber begins to expand uncontrollably, jerking
and jumping like a wild marionette.  Then, with a whopping HISS-WHAP! it
pops fully open on the deck: a large bright yellow rubber raft.

Timmy and Lex climb in, wearing the life preservers.  Grant gets in and
pushes off with his oars.

The small disturbance causes the cicadas to ROAR.  The raft drifts out
into the lagoon.  Grant fixes his oars into the oarlocks.

Grant surveys the river.

                            GRANT
          Looks pretty calm.

THUMP.  The raft stops moving.  They are aground.  Lex looks overboard.
She reaches in
 about elbow deep.

Grant stands and puts the oars in the water.  He pushes with all his
might.  There is a long scraping sound of the raft against the mud
floor.  But it moves.  And the raft goes into deep enough water.

A general sigh of relief as they gently float downstream.


A WIDE AREA OF THE RIVER -

Grant energetically works the oars.

CLOSE ON - Lex lets her hand trail in the water.

                            LEX
          I'll row, Dr. Grant.

                            GRANT
          No.

But he's sweating and takes a moment to rest.  Lex looks down at her
hand in the water.  It still trails.

                            LEX
          Hey, we're still moving.

Grant looks into the water.  She's right.

                            GRANT
          There's a current.

Grant lays back against the rubber gunwales, closes his eyes.  The two
kids look at him.

                            LEX
          You can't sleep.

                            GRANT
              (eyes closed)
          I'm not sl
eeping... yet.

                            LEX
          I'll do it!

Lex picks up the oars and begins.

                            TIMMY
          We gotta warn them about the boat.

Grant opens one eye and looks up at the sun in the sky.  He sighs and
takes up the oars again.  He rows powerfully with the current.


A BEND IN THE RIVER -

Current picks up speed.  The water begins to rush and ROAR.

                            TIMMY
          Cool!

White foam crashes on the raft and sprays the kids.  They burst out
laughing.  Grant smiles at them, but there is concern in his eyes.


ANOTHER BEND -

Now the raft is really racing.  The kids hold on tightly as the raft is
rocked.  White water crashed over, drenching the kids.  When Grant takes
a moment to look, he is soaked by a huge wave.

The raft tosses right and left.  Timmy holds the rubber grips.  He's
yanked to one side.  He's knocked to the raft floor.  Quickly gets his
grip again.  SHOUTS to Grant.

                            TIMMY
          Thought
 is looked calm?

                            GRANT
          Guess I was wrong.

Grant looks ahead.  The river widens.  The raft really starts to fly.

Lex, gripping very tightly, looks out.  Water sprays her again and
again.  Her face is serious.

                            LEX
          I can't swim!

Grant grabs the raft's tie line and pulls it out of its rubber rings.
He lashes it around Lex and Timmy.  Then he ties it around one of the
rubber grips.

                            GRANT
          Hold on real tight.

They go flying down the river.  The ROAR deafens.

The raft lifts out of the water.  And crashes down, rocking every way.

Jagged rocks appear.  Grant uses his paddle as a club to push off the
rocks and the rushing shoreline.  The kids duck from sudden overhanging
trees.

Grant looks ahead.  He blanches.

HIS POV - the surging edge of a tumultuous waterfall.

They're almost there.  At the huge waterfall, water rushes violently,
heaving over the magnificent precipice.

Timmy tries to tighten L
ex's vest but is thrown back down .  He YELLS:

                            TIMMY
          Hold my hand.  Hold my hand when we go.

The raft spins in the rushing water.  Everyone is thrown around.

The rope holding the kids to the raft tautens. The oars are wrestled out
of Grant's hands and go flying through the air, spilling over the edge.

At the last moment, Grant spots a tree branch arching over the cascade.
With all his might, he stands and holds his balance long enough. to let
his hands smash into the overhanging branch.

They stop right at the waterfall's edge.

Grant struggles mightily to hold onto the branch.  But the water keeps
rushing.  His strength ebbs.

                            TIMMY
          Don't let go!

Grant's veins pop out in his arms.  His hands start to slip off the wet
tree bark.  Lex watches his hands slowly lose their grip.

The rubber raft jumps and leaps below him.  Water pours into the raft.
Lex tries fruitlessly to let it out.  Timmy holds down Grant's feet.

               
             TIMMY
          You can do it!

                            GRANT
          I'm trying.  I'm trying ... Ooooo!!! ....

His hands slipping, slipping ...

                            GRANT
          No!!!!!

                                                      CUT TO:

CLOSE ON - The T-Rex, face down in the mud.


INT  CONTROL ROOM - AFTERNOON

Arnold, Wu, Muldoon, and Ellie stare raptly at the monitor.

                            MULDOON
          Son-of-a-bitch.  He's taking a nap.
          Hasn't been this well fed ... ever.

Hammond is above, in his throne.  He calls down:

                            HAMMOND
          Could he drown in that position?  That's
          a very valuable animal.

                            MULDOON
          I know it's a valuable animal.

Muldoon takes a step up toward Hammond's throne and the two argue
quietly back and forth.  In the foreground, Wu calls Arnold over.

                            WU
          What's that, John?

Wu points to the screen behind 
Arnold's head.  In the upper right-hand
corner, it blinks a yellow warning:  AUX PWR LOW!  Ellie regards it.

                            ELLIE
          You running on auxiliary power?

                            ARNOLD
          I'm not.

                            WU
          Looks like you are.

                            ARNOLD
          Can't be.

                            WU
          Print the system status log.

Arnold nods and rapidly strikes keys.  In the corner, a printer whirs to
life.  Moments later, it spins out a single page.  Arnold tears it off.

Ellie continues to stare at the screen.  It now flashes red:  AUX PWR
FAIL!  An alarm klaxon BLARES.

Hammond holds his ears against the noise.  He stands up.

The room lights begin to FLASH.  They're reflected in Hammond's eyes.
Hammond ROARS above the chaos.

                            HAMMOND
          What the hell is going on?

Onscreen, numbers begin to count backward from ten.  Hammond lurches.
At zero, the lights go off, the monitors,
 even the computer.  Just the
alarms keep screaming.

                            HAMMOND
          You're ruining my ordered, precise park!

Arnold ignores him, keeps pressing buttons.  Hammond rushes toward
Arnold.  Arnold looks over his shoulder in surprise.  Hammond SCREAMS.

                            HAMMOND
          Fix my park, Arnold!  Fix it!

Arnold crosses his hands in front of his face, blocking Hammond's
attack.  Hammond grabs Arnold's wrists and the two twirl to the ground.
Breathing heavily, Hammond clutches his hand to his own chest.

Arnold stands up, brushes off.  He puts himself together, looks at
Hammond.  He SHOUTS over the siren:

                            ARNOLD
          I know it's hard, I know it's hard, but
          I'm going to put it all back together for
          you - I promise.  I will


BACK ON RAFT AT WATERFALL -

Grant still clings to the overhanging branch, holding the raft from
toppling over the crashing waterfall.  Lex and Timmy hold onto his legs.

The ROAR of the
 water diminishes.  And the flow subsides from a raging
current to a rolling river.  And then to a gentle stream.  A trickle.
Nothing.

Grant slowly relaxes, lets go.  So do the children.  Around the raft,
the water level begins to drain.  Gradually, Grant and the kids are left
in the raft sitting in just a few puddles of water.  Around them,
various pumps and other equipment is exposed where it was once covered
by rushing white water.

                            LEX
          The waterfall stopped.

                            TIMMY
          Waterfalls aren't supposed to stop.

                            GRANT
          I think they cut the power.  Hey -

He points and the three of them look over the edge where the waterfall
once poured.  There's a shimmering rainbow and beyond that, in the mist
is the visitor's center.

                            GRANT
          Well, there's our pot of gold.  Let's go,
          kids.

They grab his hands and clamber out of the raft, running toward shore.


BACK ON CON
TROL ROOM -

Muldoon pulls open the blinds and the hot sun filters in, so the room is
alternate patches of bright and dark.

In a hot corner, Ellie squats over a prostate Hammond, mopping his brow
with a cool cloth.  He murmurs, only barely intelligible.

                            HAMMOND
          Told him, fix my park, fix my park.

Wu brings the printout to Arnold.  The printout is a chronological
rendering of control room events since the restart.  It is clear they
have been running on auxiliary power.  Wu yells above the alarm:

                            WU
          You shut down as six thirty-four this
          morning, and when you started back up, it
          was with auxiliary power.

                            ARNOLD
          Jesus.  The auxiliary generator fires up
          first and then that's used to start the
          main generator because it needs a heavy
          charge.  The main generator has to be
          manually reset.

                            WU
          Outside?  In
 the generator building?

Arnold nods.  Muldoon points to a line in the printout:

06:35:22   WARNING: FENCE STATUS (NB)  OPERATIVE - AUX POWER

                            MULDOON
          This doesn't mean the fences have been
          off since six-thirty, does it?

Arnold grabs the paper, looks at it, slams it down.

                            ARNOLD
          Backup power doesn't generate enough
          amperage to power the electrified fences,
          so they were automatically kept off.
          That's also why we had no phones or
          radio.

                            MULDOON
          All of the fences?

                            ARNOLD
          Yes.

                            MULDOON
          Including the velociraptor mesh?

                            ARNOLD
              (disgusted, exhausted)
          Yes, yes, yes.

In the corner, Hammond lifts his head and Ellie gently helps him to a
sitting position.

                            HAMMOND
          Do you mean those raptor
s could be loose?

                            ARNOLD
          I'm afraid so.

                            MULDOON
          No, no way.  Last time, it took 'em two
          days to chew through that mesh.  But give
          'em enough time, they'll get out.  We
          better get that power on now.

                            HAMMOND
          Regardless, check the pit.  Make sure
          there' five of them there.


EXT  VISITOR'S CENTER - AFTERNOON

Muldoon and Arnold run across the lawn.  Muldoon carries his rocket
launcher at a ready position.  In the distance, the alarm still SOUNDS,
lights FLASH a continued warning.

They reach the maintenance building where the generator is housed.  Its
familiar him has been replaced by its own alarms.  The closer they
approach, the louder and brighter these alarms are.  Grey steam pours
out of the vents of the building, obscuring everything.

                            ARNOLD
          What's that steam coming out of my
          generator room?

           
                 MULDOON
          Relax, it's just refrigerated air.
          There's a leaky cooling pipe.  I fixed it
          a couple times before but the original
          installation was at too sharp an angle.

Arnold accepts this.  He is about to enter when Muldoon instructs him.

                            MULDOON
          Just go and turn on your generator, then
          get right back to the control room.

Arnold lights a cigarette and disappears into the steam-shrouded door.


EXT  RAPTOR PIT - AFTERNOON

Muldoon inspects an extremely discouraging sight.  The thick mesh that
covered the pit has been chewed through and ripped open.  With heavy gun
in one hand, Muldoon shines his flashlight into the pit.  It's empty.

Muldoon looks up.

MULDOON'S POV - the dense forest surrounding the Visitor's Center.

Muldoon examines the ground.  He locates the raptor prints leading away

Muldoon breaks into a run.


INT/EXT  GENERATOR ROOM - AFTERNOON

Muldoon comes back to the generator room still runnin
g full-tilt.  He
kicks open the door.  Steam pours out.  Standing in the thick steam,
Muldoon yells for Arnold.  No answer.  He steps in the doorway and
shines his flashlight around.

MULDOON'S POV - Only the dark abstract shapes of rakes and coiled ropes
and small machinery can be seen in the steam.

Muldoon yells again.  No answer at all.  Muldoon curses and leaves.

As soon as Muldoon is gone, there is movement.  Even above the sirens,
an animalistic breathing, grunting can be heard.  Obscured by steam and
flashing lights, a reptilian claw clutches a shadow.  A pack of
cigarettes falls to the ground, spilling out on the floor.


INT  CONTROL ROOM - AFTERNOON

Muldoon enters and confronts Hammond, Ellie, and Wu,

                            MULDOON
          Raptors chewed their way out.  All five
          are out there.

                            ELLIE
          Arnold's not with you?

Muldoon looks around grimly.  He shakes his head.

                            MULDOON
          I was hoping he was ba
ck here already.

Hammond takes charge.

                            HAMMOND
          This is why my quarters were specially
          fortified.  To assist in an emergency just
          like this one.  Let's go.  Muldoon, round
          up the workers.  They'll go with us too.

Muldoon stares at Hammond, then drops it.  They prepare to go.

                            ELLIE
          Wait.  What about Arnold?


EXT  HILLSIDE, PARK -

Grant and the kids come over the hill.  Timmy sees the big fence and the
Visitor's Center close behind.

                            TIMMY
          We're home!

Lex and Grant happily run down the hill.


EXT  ELECTRIFIED FENCE IN PARK - AFTERNOON

Grant and the kids stand in the long shadows of the electric fence.
This huge fence is much higher than what Timmy has had to climb.  Grant
turns to him apologetically.

                            GRANT
          Sorry, Tim.  We gotta climb up.

                            TIM
          That's all right, Dr. Grant.  You owe me
   
       one.


EXT  HAMMOND'S QUARTERS - AFTERNOON

Wu stands at the open sliding gate of the perimeter fence surrounding
Hammond's quarters..  Next to him is Ellie.  Behind both of them,
launcher at the ready, is Muldoon.  Watching from the window above,
Hammond waves.  Ellie and Wu wear radio headsets.

                            MULDOON
          Okay Wu, I'll have you covered at every
          moment.  But this shell carries quite a
          punch, so if you're too close, it'll take
          a piece of you.  Ellie's on the headset
          with you.  If another ones come at you,
          let her know.  Then Ellie - you start
          jumping and yelling.  The buggers are
          easily distracted.  They'll come running
          and let Wu get that power on.  Then both
          of you, get behind this fence as quick as
          possible.

Wu and Ellie nod seriously and test radio contact.  We starts his way
across the lawn, Muldoon limps behind with his launcher.  Ellie stands
ready at the open 
gate.

Wu takes slow steps.  Muldoon follows.  Wu is just five feet away from
the door to the generator building.

CLOSE ON - Wu's tense face.

THE ATTACK is sudden and fierce.  It comes from the brush.  The raptor
leaps onto Wu in an instant.  Wu and the raptor roll on the ground.  Wu
struggles for his life.  Muldoon can't get a safe shot.  He SCREAM:

                            MULDOON
          Wu, get away.  Give me room to shoot.

Ellie comes running away from the safety of the gate.  She jumps up and
down, waving her hands, and SCREAMS:

                            ELLIE
          Hey you cretaceous dromaeosaur, you can't
          catch me.  Hey, come and get me, you
          flat-snouted Mongolian beast.  Hey!

The Raptor is distracted by this.  He lets Wu go for a moment, shaking
him loose from his bloody jaws.  Instantly, Wu rolls away.  Muldoon
fires the rocket launcher.  With a SIZZLE, the missile fires.  BOOM!
Direct hit!  The raptor is blown to tiny pieces.

Muldoon grabs Wu and pulls the inju
red man to safety.

                            MULDOON
          You ok?

In reply Wu gets to his feet, looks where the Raptor was.

                            WU
          Now, there's four.

Muldoon helps Wu back inside the fence.  He waves for Ellie to come in
and join them.

Ellie takes off toward the generator building.  She YELLS:

                            ELLIE
          I'm going in.  Muldoon, cover the door
          after I go in.  Wu, guide me!

Muldoon yells for her to wait but stops when he realizes that this may
be their best plan.

Ellie races like a gazelle across the open lawn.  She's very fast and
graceful.  She ducks into the generator building.

Above it all, Hammond watches at the small viewing window.


BACK ON - GRANT AND KIDS AT FENCE

The three are at the top of the fence now.  Grant carefully lifts Lex
above the barbed wire and she grabs onto the other side of the fence to
begin the climb down.  Grant grabs Tim and lifts him next.  Tim's tense
face is a river of sweat.


INT  GE
NERATOR BUILDING -

Ellie finishes the stairs and feels her way along the basement wall.
Her face is lit by a flashing yellow light.  She bangs her head on a
pipe.  She rubs her head.

                            ELLIE
          Damn, I banged my head.

                            WU (OVER RADIO)
          Oh that's good, that must be the water
          pipe.  You're really close now, there's a
          cabinet just above your head.  Reach up
          and open it.  The handle turns to the
          left.

Ellie turns the handle.  The cabinet opens.

                            WU (OVER RADIO)
          It's a large throw-switch.  Pull it down,
          count to three, and push it back up.
          That's all there is to it.

Ellie throws it down.  She counts:

                            ELLIE
          One -


BACK ON GRANT AND KIDS -

Just a few feet from the bottom of the fence.


BACK ON ELLIE -

                            ELLIE
          Two -


BACK ON GRANT AND KIDS -

Grant and Timmy jump down. 
 Lex is just behind.  Her sneaker catches in
the fence pattern.  She pulls on it.


BACK ON ELLIE -

                            ELLIE
          Three!

She throws the large switch back.


BACK ON LEX -

She jumps off the fence.  Her sneaker comes off, falls to the ground.

CAMERA PUSHES IN ON LEX - it celebrates her narrow escape.

Grant casually leans against the fence to help Lex with her shoe.
NOTHING!  STILL NO ELECTRIC FENCES!

The Visitor's Center is in sight.  They all turn to each other.  Elated.

                            LEX
          We did it!

                            TIM
          We made it!

Lex jumps up and down.  Grant smiles, high-fives Timmy.


BACK ON ELLIE -

The siren and the flashing lights stop.  The room lights go on.  Ellie
turns to go back upstairs.  Her foot slips, she falls to the ground.
She has slipped on a pool of blood.  She jumps up, recoils.

It's Arnold.  She squelches a SCREAM, covering her own mouth.

SMASH!  Ellie SCREAMS as a raptor lunges at her.   He jumps down
 from
above the water pipe Ellie banged her head on.

Ellie turns and races toward a ventilation shaft.  She dives into it.
The raptor gets there a second late and smashes against the shaft wall.

Ellie pushes herself against the shaft wall and, using her legs to push
against the wall, begins to climb up.

The raptor smashes against the shaft again and gets inside.  Ellie
scrambles up.  The raptor snarls and spits but it is momentarily pinned.

Ellie continues her scramble up the shaft.  At ground level, she slams
her feet hard against a vent, popping it open.  Scraping the wall and
banging against pipes, she races toward the door.


EXT  GENERATOR BUILDING - CONTINUING ACTION

Ellie runs full-tilt toward the fence surrounding Hammond's quarters.
Wu, injured, lies within the safety of the fenced area.  Muldoon stands
with his rocket launcher just outside the fence waiting for Ellie.
Ellie screams to him as she speeds across the lawn.

                            ELLIE
          Raptor!

The raptor EXPLODES th
rough the door of the generator building after
Ellie.

Muldoon fires at the raptor. Misses.  No time to reload.

The raptor gains on Ellie.  Muldoon ducks inside the fence's heavy gate.
He slides the gate half-shut, waving Ellie on.

Ellie dives inside the safety of the fence, losing her headset as she
goes.  The gate is almost closed.  The raptor lunges.

Muldoon slides shut the heavy gate, bashing the raptor's head with all
his might.  The raptor shudders, caught in the gate.  Stunned, for a
second, it doesn't move.

Ellie and Muldoon run to the building.  They push open the steel-clad
security door and dive inside.  Wu limping, chases after them.  With a
curse, Muldoon pushes the door back open, waves for Wu.

ELLIE AND MULDOON'S POV - Wu runs frantically.  The raptor jerks out of
the gate, inside of the fence.  He races after Wu.

                            WU
          Keep it open!  I'm coming!

Wu runs faster.  The raptor gains on him.  Wu screams, runs spastically.
Wu and the raptor are neck-and-neck
, equally close to the open door.

                            ELLIE
          Come on, Wu!  Come on!  Run!

The raptor is inches from Wu.  Both are closer and closer to the door.

                            ELLIE
          They're coming inside!

                            WU
          Help!

Wu and the raptor are at the door.

                            MULDOON
          No they're not, Ellie.

Muldoon slams the door shut on Wu and the raptor.  Wu's screams are
horrific.


INT  HAMMOND'S QUARTERS - CONTINUING ACTION

Ellie drops to her knees, her chest heaving, pulls her headset off with
a bleeding hand.  Muldoon, affected, turns to her.

                            MULDOON
          I couldn't compromise everyone's safety.

Ellie nods, catches her breath.

                            ELLIE
          Why didn't the power go on?

                            MULDOON
          You just reset the power.  Now the
          computer has to be booted.

Muldoon looks out the tiny barred window of the security do
or.

MULDOON'S POV - There is already almost no sign of Wu.  The gate to the
perimeter fence slides shut.  The raptor looks up.  He is trapped within
the perimeter fence of Hammond's quarters.

CAMERA SLOWLY TILTS to the viewing window above.  Hammond stares down.


INT  VISITOR'S CENTER -

Grant and kids walk through the open security doors.  All is empty and
quiet.  They call out but there are no answers.

                            LEX
          Where did everybody go?

Grant thinks.

                            GRANT
          Probably your grandfather's quarters.
          Let's go.

A DISTANT BELLOW.  Grant reconsiders.

                            GRANT
          Actually, stay here.

He corrals the kids into the half completed enclosure of the Gift Shop.

                            LEX
          No, I want to stay with you.

Grant looks around tensely.

                            GRANT
          No, keep an eye on things round here for
          me.  I'll be back with the others.

                 
           TIMMY
          What about -

Grant looks at Timmy.

                            GRANT
          I'll radio the ship as soon as I find
          somebody.  (beat)  You're in charge now.
          Don't move from here ... unless you have
          to, ok?

Timmy nods.  Lex is happy, sinks to the floor.

                            LEX
          Goody!  I'm gonna rest.

She finds a box of wind-up dinosaur toys. She winds one. Sends it
walking to Timmy.

                            TIMMY
          Tired!  He carried you the whole way.

Grant slips off into the concealing shadows of the skeletal display of
the T-rex and raptor in combat.  He looks back above his own shoulder
into the menacing jaws of the skeletal raptor.  He shouts back.

                            GRANT
          Be right back.


INT  HAMMOND'S QUARTERS -

It's a madhouse in the crowded baronial quarters of Hammond.  Gennaro is
singing at the top of his-lungs while Harding tries to restrain him.
Scared Workers huddle together, many a
re injured.  Hammond sits on the
floor, in a meditative trance.

Ellie and Muldoon stare out the window.

THEIR POV - The raptor is jumping in the air.  With every jump he comes
closer to leaping onto the roof of their small building.

Muldoon regards his rocket launcher ruefully.

                            ELLIE
          Why don't you just nail that bastard?

                            MULDOON
          No more ammo.  I requisitioned six
          charges but the bean-counter -
              (he thrusts a finger at Hammond)
          - cut it down to two.

Ellie looks up to the ceiling.  There is a large glass skylight with
crisscrossing iron bars casting an ominous shadow in the sun.


EXT  THE ANNE B AT SEA - DAY

The ship continues along smooth sunlit sea.  Land is in distant sight.


INT  STATEROOM -

The cracked egg is nudged open.  The cute scaly head of a six-inch baby
raptor nuzzles its way out of the shell.  It shakes off a few pieces of
clinging shell and immediately begins to devour one of the
 remaining eggs.

                                                      CUT TO:

CLOSE ON - The wind-up dinosaur skitters across the polished floor.  It
bands against the  the wall again and again.

Timmy looks down at it and smiles at Lex.

                            LEX
          Any candy behind the counter?

                            TIMMY
          Hungry?

                            LEX
          Starved.

Timmy looks behind the counter.  He sees boxes of goods.  He moves a
stack of umbrellas out of his way.  Lex gets up and pulls one out.

                            TIMMY
          Nothing.

                            LEX
          Let's go to the kitchen.

She smiles and pops to her feet.  Timmy's not sure.

                            TIMMY
          Dr. Grant said -

                            LEX
          - let's go.  We'll come right back.

CLOSE ON - Timmy's torn face.  He's hungry, too.

He makes the right decision.

                            TIMMY
          Nope.  We're waiting here t
ill Dr. Grant
          gets back.  He'll help us get some -

Interrupted by A SOUND.  A rhythmic, horrible BREATHING.   Now some
light and rapid STEPS.  And a SNIFFING.  It's definitely an animal.

Lex backs off in a hurry. She knocks the umbrella over.  It skirts
across the floor.  It spins and opens by itself.  Printed on it is the
ferocious face of the Spitter, the sides of its bright poisonous gills
spinning to a stop.

The breathing gets closer and closer.  The children huddle together in a
corner of the gift shop.  They SCREAM.

It's A RAPTOR, lean and ferocious.  More like a cyborg than a hunter, it
studies the kids from just outside the gift shop entrance.  His eyes
flick back and forth between the two pieces of meat.

Timmy grabs the box of toy dinosaurs.  He winds one up and sends it off
across the hall.  The raptor glances over at the moving toy.  Timmy
grabs another, whispers as he winds it.

                            TIMMY
          Start winding now!

Lex and Timmy wind toy after toy, send th
em across the hall.  The raptor
leaps, crushing one in its jaws.  Others waddle by.  The raptor dodges
and darts, grabbing this one, smashing that one.

The kids go running out into the hall.  They race down the Visitor
Center corridor.  Timmy pulls Lex behind him toward the restaurant.

                            LEX
          Where are we going?

                            TIM
          The kitchen!


INT/EXT  HAMMOND'S QUARTERS -

With a huge leap, the raptor finally makes it to the roof of Hammond's
quarters.  He jumps lightly onto the skylight.  Glass shatters over the
assembled guests and workers below.  Total commotion and SCREAMS.

The raptor immediately begins to gnaw at the iron bars that block the
skylight.  Below, they shake off shards of glass and huddle in the
corners.  Ellie turns to Muldoon.

                            ELLIE
          How long?

                            MULDOON
          Well, they seem to be getting faster all
          the time. I would say - fifteen minutes.

Ellie no
tices something out the window.  It's Grant approaching the
gate.  She hammers on the glass.

Grant's hand reaches for the knob.

The raptor stops gnawing, its ears perked up.

Ellie screams and screams.

Grant notices some of Wu's remains inside the gate.  He stops and looks
up.  At the window, Ellie waves her arms, warning him not to enter.
Grant stops.  He sees Wu's headset on the grass, reaches through the
fence, grabs it, puts it on.

Ellie jumps up and gets her headset.  She barks into it.

                            ELLIE
          There's a raptor on the roof of this
          building.  Open that gate and you're a
          dead man.

Grant stares up at Ellie in the window.  He waves.  She presses her hand
to the glass.

                            GRANT
          Ellie, I'm go glad -

                            ELLIE
          Shut up and listen.  We have about
          fifteen minutes here.  The computer has
          to be rebooted.  That'll turn on the
          electric fences.  Besides the r
aptor
          stuck in here with us, there are four
          more ...

Grant races back to the Visitor's Center as she continues to fill him in.


INT  KITCHEN, VISITOR'S CENTER - CONTINUING ACTION

The kids hurtle through this huge, industrial kitchen.  The kitchen is a
maze of turns, from the hot lamp pickup area to the rows of stainless
steel burners to the chopping blocks to the potwashing area.  The kids
dart and duck from one area to the next, taking shortcuts under tables,
crawling behind counters, scattering pots and pans behind.

Relentlessly, with a casual speed, the raptor stalks them.  It avoids
their obstacles with a casual grace and when it cannot fit through their
shortcuts, it just continues around.

Timmy pulls open the large silvered door of the freezer.  Lex starts to
hurry inside.  Timmy grabs her.

                            TIMMY
          We'll freeze to death in there.

                            LEX
          He's going to eat us!

Timmy reaches into the freezer and grabs a pile 
of steaks.  He tosses one
toward the raptor.  The raptor gobbles it in one bite.  Timmy shoves Lex
out of the way and begins to toss the steaks on the floor.  One after the
other, he tosses them, in a row, closer and closer to the open freezer.

The raptor mechanically gobbles the steaks, following their path.  He
continues right into the freezer to grab the last of Tim's bait.

Tim leaps and slams the heavy freezer door shut.  Lex comes running and
throws her small weight alongside of Timmy's.

                            TIMMY
          PUSH!

The heave and the lock catches on the door.  From inside, there is a
strangled CRY and the door is slammed repeatedly.  The metal panels of
the door buckle but they do not break.  The door hinges bend and curve
but they do not give.

The kids collapse in relief on the kitchen floor.  In just a moment,
Timmy is back on his feet.

                            LEX
          What is it, Timmy?

                            TIMMY
          I just remembered something.  Rapto
rs are
          born in large litters.  There's probably
          more coming.  We gotta hide.

He grabs her hand and they run out of the back entrance of the kitchen.
There's a stairway and they race up.


INT  GIFT SHOP -

Grant, wearing his headset, calls for the kids and looks around the gift
shop with concern.  He sniffs the air and examines the crushed windup
toys.  He sees some animal scales on the floor.  He hears a NOISE above
and begins to run.


INT  UPPER FLOOR HALLWAY, VISITOR'S CENTER -

The kids hear this NOISE too and it's closer to them.  They bust into -


INT  AMBER ROOM, LABORATORY -

The kids knock over trays of stones as they rush through this room.


INT  EXTRACTION ROOM, LABORATORY -

Automated drills whir as Tim and Lex crash through, knocking equipment
to the ground.  The drills still whir on the ground.


INT  GENETICS ROOM -

The Hamachi-Hood sequencers explode in a heap of punch cards and
magnetic tape as the kids race by.


INT  INCUBATION ROOM, LABORATORY -

The kids slide int
o this room.  They race to its far corner, past
incubators and display cases of chemicals.  They look back and see -

KID'S POV - A raptor happily gorging itself on a table of eggs.  He's
been in this room, their place of refuge, the whole time.

CLOSE ON - The raptor's glistening eyes register the children.

He begins to stalk.  The kids SCREAM.  This time there is nowhere to go.

The raptor closes in on the kids.  Timmy feebly stands in front of his
younger sister.

CLOSE ON - The raptor licks its lips, lizard-like.

At the other end of the room, GRANT ENTERS quickly.  He surveys the
situation.  Quickly, he grabs an egg off a table.  He reaches into one
of the chemical cabinets with POISON WARNINGS prominently displayed.  He
comes out with a syringe and a vial.

The raptor is almost on the kids.  Grant coughs conspicuously.  The
raptor whirls, studies Grant.  He looks back at the children.

Grant speaks into the headset.

                            GRANT (TO RADIO)
          Talk, Ellie, just keep talking.

He tosses the headset on the ground.  Ellie's voice crackles out.  The
raptor studies it, transfixed.

Grant injects the egg, then gently rolls it on the ground.  The raptor
forgets the headset.  He comes forward and sniffs the egg, then sucks it
up, swallowing it whole.

The raptor turns back to the kids.  He takes two steps toward them,
tenses to pounce - and keels over.  DEAD.

The kids race around the dead raptor to Grant.  Grant grabs his headset
as the three run out of the room.  Grant addresses Timmy as they run.

                            GRANT
          Timmy, you know anything about computers?

                            TIMMY
          Well, I just got an XT at home.  I told
          my Dad I wanted a 386.

                            GRANT
          Ok good, you're elected.


INT  CONTROL ROOM -

Grant and Tim and Lex study the quiet room.  Grant speaks calmly into
his headset.

                            GRANT (TO RADIO)
          Okay, we've reached the computer room.
          Who can te
ll Timmy how to reboot?

                            ELLIE (OVER RADIO)
          Ah, Alan, nobody here knows how to boot
          the computer.  Please hurry, we've only
          got a couple minutes left.

                            GRANT
          Tim, you got to book the system.  They
          reset the power and there are no phones.
          We gotta turn on the fences and we gotta
          stop that ship.

                            LEX
          Are they going to be ok?

                            GRANT
          If we can get help very soon.

                            TIMMY
          Sshh, you guys, I'm thinking.

He studies a grid on a large console.  He reaches out and touches a part
of the screen.  There is a beep and a warning sign - INVALID ARGUMENT.
PLEASE TRY AGAIN.


BACK ON  HAMMOND'S QUARTERS -

The raptor has chewed almost all the way through the bars.  Panic below.
In the middle of it all, Ellie is focused, listening on her headset.


BACK ON  CONTROL ROOM -

Timmy tries somethin
g else.  BEEP.  Lex raises a hand.  Grant stops her.

                            GRANT (TO RADIO)
          Ellie, we're working as fast as we can
          here.

Timmy tries a screen section.  BEEP.  Again. BEEP.  Again.  BEEP.  BEEP.

Timmy shakes his head.  In desperation he stabs at the keyboard below
the touch screen.  He punches the ESCAPE button.

The screen lights up a new message - SYSTEM RESET COMPLETED.  ALL
SYSTEMS NORMAL.


BACK ON  HAMMOND'S QUARTERS -

The raptor has just chewed through.  He squeezes his body into the space
as the bars ELECTRIFY.  Spastically, the raptor jerks back and forth as
the current flows through him.  He can't get out.

Finally, with a WHIMPER, he stops struggling and slides through the
space he created.  With a THUMP, he drops to the floor below.

Ellie, Muldoon, Hammond and the workers look on in shock.


BACK ON  CONTROL ROOM -

Grant cheers and hugs Timmy.  Lex whoops.

                            ELLIE (ON RADIO)
          Ok, we're all right here for now.
      
    Thanks.

                            GRANT (TO RADIO)
          Don't mention it.  It was Timmy.

                            ELLIE (ON RADIO)
          But there's still one more raptor.  So be
          careful.

Timmy is pushing menus and submenus on the touchscreen now.
COMMUNICATIONS - RADIO - VEHICULAR ...  He gets the one he wants.

He indicates the radio-mike to Grant.

                            TIM
          I think this is the boat.  They called it
          the Queen Anne or something.

Grant grabs the mike.

                            GRANT
          Queen Anne, do you read me?  Queen Anne?

The radio crackles to life.

                            RADIO
          This is the Queen Anne B?  I copy.
          What's up?

                            GRANT
          Report your position!

                            RADIO
          Ah, we're just about to dock here in
          Puntaremas.  Who wants to know?  Please
          identify yourself.

Tim punches the screen which displays FARRELL, F
REDERICK D. (CAPT.)
Grant reads it and nods.  His voice is tough as nails.

                            GRANT
          Try this for identification, Captain
          Farrell.  You are in possession of stolen
          biological materials.  If you don't turn
          that boat around and return to Isla
          Nublar immediately with your contraband
          cargo, you will be found in violation of
          Section 509 of the Uniform Maritime Act,
          you will be subject to revocation of
          license, penalties in excess of fifty
          thousand dollars, and five years in jail.
          Do you copy?

SILENCE.

                            GRANT
          Do you copy, Captain Farrell?

                            RADIO
          I copy.  All ahead stern.

A blinking light on a map indicates that the ship is pulling away from
the harbor.  Grant nods to Timmy who terminates the radio contact.

                            TIMMY
          What's the Uniform Maritime Code?

                     
       GRANT
          Who the hell knows?

Grant and Timmy start to celebrate again when Lex interrupts.

                            LEX
          What good does that do?  To have the ship
          turn around?

Grant turns to her seriously.

                            GRANT
          Well it gives us ten more hours.
              (to Timmy)
          Let's see if we can raise the Costa Rican
          Coast Guard on that thing.

The last raptor smashes into the control room through Hammond's viewing
window.  Glass goes flying.  Grant and kids go running into the hallway.


INT ROTUNDA -

With the raptor in hot pursuit, the kids and Grant come flying.  Tim and
Lex jump over the railing, leaping onto the skeletal display.  Grant
goes for the stairs, jumping down them three at a time.

The raptor goes after the kids, scrambling over the balcony onto the
display.  The kids scamper down the display, knocking paint cans and
tools off the scaffolding as they go.  The raptor is just one beat
behind, and his snar
ling face is splashed with red paint as he chases.

The kids burrow into the rib cage of the Rex.  They break off floating
rubs and hurl them back at the raptor.  The raptor is undeterred,
closing the gap on the kids.

The kids are stuck at the end of the rib cage - it's closed off by the
skeleton and they can't break through.  They're imprisoned.  The raptor
is pushing through the rib cage, bones crackling as it goes.

Grant leaps up the scaffolding, grabs a beam, swings his weight onto it,
and slams it into the T-Rex's neck.  The neck shatters and the massive
head of the T-Rex drops free.

It falls directly onto the last raptor, squashing him flat.  Dead.

                            GRANT
              (grimly)
          And then there were none.


EXT  HELICOPTER PAD - DUSK

Muldoon leads his workers onto an army helicopter.  Two workers carry
Gennaro on a stretcher.  Ellie boards with the kids on each side of her,
holding her hands.

Grant and Hammond walk together, toward the helicopter.

              
              HAMMOND
          Dr. Grant, don't abandon this beautiful
          place.  I need a man just like you to
          help me get my park back on its feet
          again.  And it will be on its feet again.

                            GRANT
          We have to leave now.

Hammond stops.

                            HAMMOND
          Oh you don't know.  There are wonderful
          plans in the works, sites already
          purchased for Euro-Jurassic and Jurassic
          Japan.

Grant is unimpressed.  He holds a hand out to Hammond.  Hammond tries a
new approach.

                            HAMMOND
          Don't you see I've exalted human
          potential here?  You must see it.  You
          must feel it.  I called back a life form.
          Listen, Dr. Grant, don't go.  Be a part
          of this.  I'm inviting you to do just
          that - let the others go, if they want.

                            GRANT
          You interrupted natural law.  There are
          regulations,
 rules that nature follows
          that make her knowable.

                            HAMMOND
          You mean there are rules that nature
          follows that create barriers to our
          knowledge.

                            GRANT
          Barriers?  Like the seasons?  The earth
          spinning, orbiting the sun?  The entire
          solar system in interlocking motion.  Our
          own beings in biological step with it
          all.  Mr. Hammond, you've disrupted the
          pattern and look what it's done!

                            HAMMOND
          I know what it's done.  I've made
          triceratops and gallimimus and a T-Rex.
          I've got a batch of iguanadons being born
          on Tuesday.  What do you say to that?

                            GRANT
          Don't count on it.  Now get in.

Grant jumps in the copter, holds out a hand to Hammond.

                            GRANT
          You created mutant forms that you further
          mutated to create amus
ement attractions.
          You made biological puppets with
          heartbeats and an early death sentence.

                            HAMMOND
          I created genetic miracles!

                            GRANT
          You created a park to generate a profit-
          making merchandising operation.

                            HAMMOND
          The merchandise is just a by-product.
          Souvenirs for people to reflect on the
          wonder.  You fainted when you saw the
          brachiosaur.  Alan, look, let's not
          argue.  The problem is that my employees
          were not up to par with my dream.  They
          failed me.  The park, I promise you, is
          safe.  It really is.

Grant grabs Hammond's arm, starts to tug.

                            GRANT
          You park is doomed.  Now come with me.
          
                            HAMMOND
          It is not!  It's blooming!  In the throes
          of labor!  You are one more more negative
          voice in a 
universe of negativity.
          You'll amount to nothing.  You'll be a
          bone-brusher all your life.  I pity you.

Hammond pulls his arm away and strides away from the helicopter just as
the ROTORS START UP.  Hammond's suit whips in the wind.  Grant calls to
him, reaching out his arm.

                            GRANT
          Come back, Mr. Hammond!  It's over!

Hammond keeps walking.  He disappears over a grassy knoll.

Grant's outstretched hand drops to his side when THE ATTACK comes.

With a huge bellow, the T-Rex comes charging at the helicopter.  THE
PILOT screams for all to board as he starts to lift off.

The Rex bites onto the copter skid as the copter tries to escape.  The
copter angles dangerously as the Rex holds on.

Ellie fires a fire-extinguisher into the furious face of the Rex and its
jaws relax.  The copter escapes and starts to climb high into the sky.
The Rex paws after it, then drops down to four legs and gives the copter
a final swipe with its tail.

The tail SWISHES through 
the air and CRACKS against the plexiglass
windshield which fissures and pops.  The pilot struggles to maintain
altitude and manages to keep the craft in the air.

With a ROAR of its own, the copter breaks into the blue sky and soars.
away, leaving an angry T-Rex alone.  Unnoticed by the frustrated Rex,
Hammond slips away and walks into the jungle.


IN THE COPTER -

SLOWLY PAN the exhausted faces of Muldoon and his workers, Lex and Timmy
holding onto each other, and Grant huddles next to Ellie.  He reaches
out and puts an arm around her shoulder.  She reaches up and pulls his
arm close.

                            ELLIE
          They're so beautiful.  They're condemned,
          aren't they?  Even those embryo fragments
          had the same viral contamination.

                            GRANT
          I have a theory.

Ellie looks up in surprise.  She give him a big smile.

                            ELLIE
          You have a theory?

Grant smiles back at her.

                            GRANT
   
       I think that they could never completely          
          isolate the dinosaur DNA.  There was
          always some microscopic mosquito
          contamination.  But at the molecular
          level, that was enough.  Every dinosaur
          received the same genetic massage, the
          encoding that every mosquito gets to
          terminate life after a season.

                            ELLIE
          So the very process itself was flawed.

She's sad.  Grant hugs her.  Over her shoulder he gives a parting glance
to the island.  A green jewel in a blue sea.  Suddenly it is obliterated
by clouds.

CAMERA PANS AWAY AND SWOOPS DOWN from the copter.  IT CROSSES the sky.
THE CAMERA DESCENDS to Isla Nublar, slowly reveling in its natural
beauty and finally coming to earth in the midst of the verdant jungle.


IN THE JUNGLE - MAGIC HOUR

Hammond slowly climbs a steep hill covered with creeping growth.  He
almost reaches the top when he slips.  He falls to the soft ground and
rolls. He tumbles he
lplessly, rolling and spinning down the sharp drop,
finally coming to a complete stop in a shallow pool of water.  Face
down, his head splashes into the puddle.  No movement. Just the sound of
labored breath.

CAMERA PANS to Hammond's hand, half-submerged in water.  CAMERA MOVES
INTO EXTREME CLOSEUP as a mosquito lands on his hand.

                                         RACK OUT AND DISSOLVE TO:


EXT  OCEAN - NIGHT

The army copter circles lower and lower as it finds the Queen Anne B,
slowly drifting across the moonlit water.

                                                      FADE OUT.

1 	EXT. PACIFIC OCEAN  DAY	1

	A speedboat cuts swiftly through the ocean swells beneath the
	looming cliffs of ISLA SORNA.


2 	EXT. BOAT - DAY 							2

	Illegal Costa Rican parasail operator ENRIQUE CARDOSO helps
	Americans BEN HILDEBRAND and twelve-year-old ERIC KIRVY --
	already wearing life-vests -- strap themselves into a two-
	person PARASAIL HARNESS.


3 	EXT. BOAT - DAY 							3

	Ben and Eric clamber onto a makeshift PLATFORM that hangs over
	the back of the board. Dangling from Ben's neck is a CAMCORDER.

				BEN
		You make sure to get us as close as you can,
		okay? If it's a good trip, I'll give you a 
		little extra. 

				ENRIQUE
		Don't worry. I take you close. But not too 
		close.
			(rubbing Eric's head)
		You don't want them to eat you.

	Enrique heads toward the driver's seat and a large SECOND-HAND
	WINCH bolted to the deck.

				ENRIQUE (CONT'D)
		Ready, amigos?

	Ben and Eric nod excitedly and give the thumbs up. Ben lifts the
	camcorder to the record the action.

	Enrique jams the down the throttle down, and with a loud RAOR, the
	speedboat shoots forward. Soon the boat is whipping across the 
	rolling ocean.

	Strapped together, Ben and Eric lean back over the passing
	water, intently watching for Enrique's signal.

	As the boat picks up speed, Enrique eyes the speedometer.

	Ben grabs the end of the RIPCORD attached to the harness. He and
	Eric braces themselves.

	Enrique finally signals with a pulling motion. He pulls
	the winch, Ben yanks the cord and - 

	WOOOSH! A brightly colored PARASAIL blossoms behind the boat,
	hoisting Ben and Eric aloft. In a big BLOCK LETTERS on the
	parasail is stitched "DINO-SOAR."

	THE TOWNLINE unsold rapidly from its enormous reel.

	BEN AND ERIC climb higher and higher.

	ENRIQUE keeps an eye on the clients. When they reach a certain 
	height, he LOCKS OFF the reel.

	High overhead, Ben and Eric are floating in wonderful, quiet
	splendor. The motor of the boat now sounds strangely distant.

	Down below, the boat enters a think blanket of FOG.

	Eric points excitedly at the islands as Ben films him with the
	camera.

	Then, a sudden TUG on the thing line cause Ben to drop the camera,
	which now dangles from his neck.

				ERIC
		What was that?

	A second tug...and now the faintest of screams.

	Ben and Eric look down to find that the boat has disappeared
	into the low bank of FOG.

	By the time the boat emerges on the far side of the mist...THEIR
	IS NO SIGN OF ENRIQUE. The deck is splattered with blood.

	As Ben considers the driverless boat...

				ERIC (CONT'D)
		Ben!

	Ben glances over at Eric, staring in horror at something 
	below. Following his gaze, Ben finds that their boat is only
	moments away from crashing into A LARGE REEF.

	Sticking out of the water, the imposing reef is being battered
	by waves.

	AS THE BOAT SMASHES INTO THE REEF, it splinters into a
	number of pieces.

	A panicked Ben turns to Eric.

				BEN
		Unclip your line!

	Eric and Ben frantically unclip their lines. Catching an
	updraft, the parasailers float upward.

	A strong wind sends them wafting over the daunting cliffs
	of ISLA SORNA...


4 	EXT. SUBURBAN BACKYARD - DAY 					4

	TWO PLASTIC DINOSAURS enter the frame and do battle accompanied
	by a child's ferocious sounds.

				CHILD (O.S.)

		RRRRROW! GRRRRRR!

	WINDER TO REVEAL -

	CHARLIE, a three-year old boy, plays in a sandbox with his
	favorite toy dinosaurs. ALAN GRANT squats next to him and
	watches with great delight.

	ELLIE SATLER stands over them, an INFANT in her arms -- a
	picture of the perfect family.

				GRANT
		Oh, actually, Charlie, those two are
		herbivores. They wouldn't be interested in
		fighting each other. But these...
			(picking up two other dinosaurs)
		See, these are carnivores. And this one here
		-- see its claws -- this one here uses its
		claws to gouge at the throat of its opponent

	As Grant demonstrates with some GRUNT and GROANS of his
	own, he only succeeds in frightening the boy.

				ELLIE
			(interrupting)
		Uh, Alan?


				GRANT
		Hmm?

				ELLIE
		He's three. Why don't you wait till he's a
		little older?


				GRANT
		Oh, right.
			(back to Charlie)
		Happy dinosaurs.

	He bounces them along the sandbox edge.

	Then, the sound of a CAR ENGINE turning off and a door
	SLAMMING is heard.

				ELLIE
		That must be Mark.
			(calling out)
		Mark, were back here!

	Ellie and Grant turn to see --

MARK DEGLER coming through the gate carrying a briefcase. He's their age, handsome but not annoyingly so, with a friendly,
	balance demeanor.

	He and Ellie kiss tenderly on the lips.

				ELLIE (CONT'D)
		Good day?

				MARK
		Keeping the world safe.
			(re: baby)
		Here, let me take her.

	Ellie hands off the baby.

				ELLIE
		Mark, this is Alan Grant.

				MARK
		Nice to meet you, Alan. I've heard a lot about
		you.

	The two men shake hands, and we now realize it is Grant
	who is the stranger in this household. Little Charlie runs to
	his father, showing his dinosaur.

				CHARLIE
		Daddy, this is a herbabore.

	Grant smiles uncomfortably, a third wheel.


5 	INT. DINING ROOM - NIGHT 					5

	WINDEN to a PARROT in a large cage. Grant is teasing 
the bird with a cookie, holding a it just out of reach.

				GRANT
		What's my name? Come on, Jack, say it. Is my
		name Alan? Say my name.

		The bird doesn't respond.

				GRANT (CONT'D)
		He used to know me.

				ELLIE
		Sorry, Alan it's been six years.

	Grant shrugs, gives Jack the cookie, and heads towards the table.
	The three adults are finishing their dessert and coffee. The
	The children have been out to bed.

	An awkward moment of silence. Uncomfortable smiles. Then --

				MARK
		More coffee?

				ELLIE
			(relived)
		Yes. Great.

	Mark stands and collects their cups.

				ELLIE (CONT'D)
		So, Mark's working at the State Department
		now.

				GRANT
		Really? 
(To Mark)
What do you do there?

				MARK
			(with mock bravado)
		I could tell you about it, but than I'd have to
		kill you.

				GRANT
		Indeed.

	Mark smiles, nodding. Then he goes into the kitchen. Another
	uncomfortable silence.

				ELLIE
	So what are you working on now?

				GRANT

	We have a new site in Montana. At least until
	the money runs out.

				ELLIE
		Anything good?

				GRANT
		Raptors, mostly.

				ELLIE
		My favorite.

	Grant leans forward, realizing Ellie's one of the few people he
	can talk to about this.

				GRANT
		You remember the sounds they made?

				ELLIE
		I try not to.

				GRANT
		We've done cranial scans, and raptors
		actually had a quite sophisticated
		resonating chamber. I have a theory that
		their ability to vocalize is the key to their
		social intelligence. The way they can work
		together as a team.

				ELLIE
		You think they could talk to each other?

				GRANT
		To a degree we never imagined.

	And from the cage in the corner of the room...

				JACK
		Bullshit!

	Both look back at the parrot. ELLIE smiles.

				ELLIE
		You taught him that.


6 	EXT. SUBURBAN STREET - NIGHT 					6

	Ellie and Grant head toward the rental car parked in the
	driveway.

				ELLIE
		Good luck with the fund raising.

				GRANT
		It was never easy, but before Jurassic Park,
		you could find money. Somewhere. Now fossils
		are out. Everyone wants to see a real live
		dinosaur.

				ELLIE
		Times change Alan. But you're the still the
		best. I mean that.

				GRANT
		The last of my breed.

	A long moment passes between them as both consider where
	they've ended up.

				GRANT (CONT'D)
		I'd better get going.

				ELLIE
		Let me know if I can help, Alan. Youre bad
		about asking for help, but please ask me.
		Anything, anytime.

				GRANT
			(deep down knowing he never
			 will)
		Okay. Goodbye, Ellie.

				ELLIE
		Goodbye, Alan.

	Not sure what the right thing to do is, they finally end up with
	a friendly hug. They keep it short.

	Grant gets in his car. Starts the ENGINE.

	He's about to pull off when Ellie knocks on the window. He rolls
	it down.

				ELLIE (CONT'D)
		When I met you, I thought that one day
		millions of years ago, all the dinosaurs
		became extinct. Wiped out. But you told me
		otherwise. When conditions changed,
		dinosaurs changed. They became other things.
		They evolved.

				GRANT
		A well-accepted theory.

				ELLIE
			(simply)
		Alan don't be afraid to evolve.

	Grant hears her, but Ellie knows it didn't really get through.
	A forced half-smile, than Grant waves goodbye.

	Ellie watches as he drives off.


7 	INT. AUDITORIUM - DAY 						7

	The last stop on Grant's fund-raising tour, it's a public
	lecture hosted by some foundation. There are SCIENTISTS and
	STUDENTS here, but also a lot of DINO-FANS, some even with
	costumes.

	Grant finishes his speech to what was a full house -- some
	ATTENDEES are grabbing their coats and sneaking out. This
	wasn't the exciting guest speaker they were all expecting.

	A new slide comes up. Just black and white, and indecipherable.

				GRANT
		It's through the painstaking study of the
		Interior chamber in multiple specimens that
		we can determine this exciting correlation
		between the larynx and the upper plate. That
		lets us theorize -- theorize, mind you -- that
		the raptor might have been capable of bird-
		like vocalizations. Which as you can
		imagine, would be a tremendous breakthrough.

	He's finished, but no one seems to notice at first. Then the
	SYMPOSTUM LEADER stands up, leading a smattering round of
	APPLAUSE.

				SYMPOSTIUM LEADER
		Thank you very much Dr. Grant. Now does
		anyone have a question?

	Nearly every hand goes up. Grant doesn't seem surprised.

				GRANT
		Does anyone have a question that doesn't 
		relate to Jurassic Park?

	Quite a few hands go down.

				GRANT (cont'd)
		Or the incident in San Diego, which I'll
		remind you, I did not witness.

	Now most of the hands are down. Picking one of the few
	remaining...

				MALE STUDENT
		Your theory on raptors is good and all, but
		isn't all this conjecture kind of moot?

	The STUDENT'S BUDDY nods in agreement.

				MALE STUDENT (CONT'D)
		I mean, once the U.N. and Costa Rica and
		everyone decides how to handle the second
		island, scientist will just go in and look
		for themselves.

				TOO-CLEVER SCIENCE REPORTER
		Isn't paleontology itself in danger of
		extinction?

	Recognizing those as fighting words, the symposium leader is
	about to step in. But Grant will take this himself.

				GRANT
		No, and let me be perfectly clear on this
		point. Dinosaurs lived 65 million years ago.
		What's left of them is fossilized in stone
		the actual scientists spend years to
		undercover.
								   (MORE)

				GRANT (CONT'D)
		what John Hammond and InGen created are
		theme park monsters. Nothing more, nothing
		less.

		The class clearly disagrees with his assessment.

				ANOTHER STUDENT
		You're saying you wouldn't want to study
		them if you had the chance?

				GRANT
		No force on this earth or in heaven could get me on
		that island.


8 	INT. DERELICT COCKPIT - DAY 					8

	Looking through the cracked windshield of a junkyard plane, we
	see someone spray painting red circles on the outside of the
	glass.


9 	EXT. AIRCRAFT GRAVEYARD - DAY 					9

	NASH, a wry, intelligent mercenary pilot and soldier, is
	painting huge eyes the windows of a wrecked plane. Finished, he
	tosses the paint can through the open windows and walks quickly
	away from the plane.

	We now see that RED TEETH are painted on the craft's nose. It
	looks absurdly like some angry beast.

	We are one the edge of a dry lake bed, part of an aircraft
	graveyard. Wrecked planes lie all around.

	We hear a phone RINGING...


10 	INT. CARGO PLANE - DAY 					       10

	A RINGING satellite phone rests on a stack of gun cases.

	UDESKY, the leader of this crew, answers it. 

				UDESKY
		Udesky.
			(beat)
		Yes sir. we're good to go. I'll lock it down as
		soon as you drop me the payment.

	With the phone still to his ear, Udesky wanders out of the
	craft...


11 	EXT. CARGO PLANE - DAY 					       11

	Udesky looks over at Nash and COOPER, another mercenary.

	Cooper's the quiet muscle of the bunch, a weapons specialist. He
	finishes loading a massive gun, essentially a hand-cannon. It's
	aimed at Nash's grimacing aircraft.

				UDESKY
		That's right, two of the very best I could
		find. No, I haven't worked with them
		personally, but they come with the highest
		recommendations.

	Then --

	Cooper FIRES at the grimacing aircraft. A projectile rockets
	into the plane and EXPLODES with a fireball.

	Nash and Cooper exchange a satisfied smile.

				UDESKY (CONT'D)
		You've got nothing to worry about, sir. This
		is going to be a piece of cake.

	Pieces of the demolished craft come raining down.


12 	EXT. EXCAVATION BASE CAMP, PT. PECK LAKE, MT - DAY 	12

	CLOSE ON a man's hand, carefully scraping the stone away from a
	dinosaur fossil. We follow his hand back as he wipes off his
	sweaty brow, revealing him to be BILLY BRENNAN, 25, an
	associate professor and site manager. He's a charmer.

	Looking past him, we see CHERYL, 21, a junior at junior of State. She's one
	of a dozen COLLEGE STUDENTS working at the site, and the one
	most smitten with her supervisor.

				CHERYL
		Billy? I don't think I'm doing this right.

	He scoots over, lying down beside her. Checks her work.

				BILLY
		You need to go slowly. See, just take it little
		at a time.

	She's not listening, just watching his eyelashes.

				CHERYL
		I can never tell what's bone and what's rock.

				BILLY
		Technically, it's all rock. The calcium in the
		bones is replaced during fossilization. But
		you can feel the difference. See? Rough,
		smooth. Rough, smooth.

	He runs her bare fingers over the two different patches, showing
	her. After a pause, she runs her finger along his
	stubbly chin...

				CHERYL
		Rough.

	...and along his lips.

				CHERYL (cont'd)
		Smooth.

	Billy may not have started this flirtation, but he's not ending
	it either. It's then that a

	SHADOW

	falls across them. Billy looks up to see...

				BILLY
		Dr. Grant!

	Grant has just returned, a bag over his shoulder.

				GRANT
		Mr. Brennan.

										CUT TO:


12A	EXT. WALKING TO THE MAIN TENTS - DAY 			12A

	Billy takes one of Grant's bags, talking as they go.

				BILLY
		How was your trip? Profitable?

				GRANT
		We'll be broke in four weeks.

				BILLY
		Three weeks. I had to rent some equipment.

	The cross into one of the tents, which only has two "walls". On
	a dust-taped table, a dusty Macintosh is feeing data into a
	strange machine the size of a dorm refrigerator. A mechanical arm sweeps
	back and forth across a tray of fine sand.

				GRANT
		You rented an automated litter box.

				BILLY
		It's a rapid prototyper. I feed in the scan
		data from the raptor skull, than the computer
		breaks it into thousands of slices which this
		thing prints, one layer on top of the other.
		It's the future of paleontology.

				GRANT
		Not if it can't dig.

	The arm stops and suddenly the tray of sand shakes, dropping
	through holes in the bottom to reveal an object the size of 
	a person's fist.

				BILLY
		I give you a raptor's resonating chamber.

	Grant hates technology, but he can't help but be amazed by the
	result. He lifts the strange object up, shaking out the
	remaining sand.

	Billy puts it to his lips and blows through it like a conch shell.
	The resulting SOUND is unique and piercing, the cry of an 
	non-existent animal. Grant is speechless with excitement. And so he
	uses it again and again, producing different SOUNDS and
	variations.

	In the distance, flocks of birds rise to the sky and fly off.

	Billy looks up to see a MAN and a WOMAN getting out of 	
	a Cadillac. Cheryl is pointing them in the direction of the 		
	tent. 									

				BILLY (cont'd) 				
			(falsely casual) 					
		Oh, I forgot to tell you. Some visitors 			
		wanted to come by and talk	to you. I 
told them you'd be happy to see them. 
		maybe even have dinner with them. 						

				GRANT 					
		Absolutely not. 						

				BILLY 						
		They're here. 							

				GRANT 					
		What? 								

	Only now does Grant realize these two people
Who were walking up to them.
Putting on a friendly smile, Billy goes up to them.				

				MAN 						
		Dr. Grant? 							

				GRANT 					
		Yes? 								

				MAN 						
			(extending his hand)					
		Paul Kirby. Kirby Enterprises				 	
			(reaching into his pocket) 	
		My card. 							

	PAUL KIRBY is a talkative optimist with				
	no "off" switch. His wife AMANDA KIRBY, just
as friendly, is harder to read. There seems to be			
	exhaustion behind her eyes. 					

				GRANT 					
		What can I do for you, Mr. Kirby? 				

				PAUL 						
		Well sir, I am a great admirer
of yours, and I have an extremely interesting 
proposition to discuss. Would you let my wife 
and I take you to have dinner tonight? Our treat.					

				GRANT 					
		You know, I've been traveling and I'm very 		
		tired. Maybe some other time. 				

				PAUL
		I guarantee it'll be worth your while.

	Behind Kirby, Bill furtively rubs his thumb and fingers
	together, indicating the guy is loaded.

	Grant musters a weak smile.

				GRANT
		It's be my pleasure.


13 	INT. HELL CREEK BAR AND GRILL, JORDAN, MT - NIGHT 	13

	Theyre only halfway through the entree, but Grant is ready to
	bolt. It's only Billy who's keeping him from being rude. They walk
	over to Paul and Amandas table and sit down.

				PAUL
		First off let me say as a dinosaur enthusiasts,
		Amanda and I have admired your work for
		years.

				AMANDA
		It is truly, whats the word? Inspiring.

				GRANT
		Thank you.

	It's everything Grant can do just to be polite. He desperately
	wants to leave and get back to his dig.

				PAUL
		Amanda and I, well, we just love the outdoors.
		Heck we've been on pretty much any adventure
		tour they can come up with: Galapagos, K2,
		the Nile...

				AMANDA
		We even have two seats reserved aboard the
		first commercial moon flight.

	Billy nudges Grant.

				GRANT
		Hmmm.

				PAUL
		Now, for our wedding anniversary this year
		we wanted to do something really special,
		something...

	He places his hand on his wife's.

				AMANDA
		...once-in-a-lifetime.

				PAUL
		We've arranged for a private airplane to
		take us flying over Isla Sorna. And we want
		you to be our guide.

	The Kirby's look to Grant as if they've offered him an amazing
	gift. But Grant just sighs and smooths the tablecloth.

				GRANT
		That's a very nice offer, Mr. Kirby, but I'm
		afraid I'm much to busy. If you like I can
		refer you to a number of highly qualified...

				PAUL
		No, no, see Dr. Grant, you're the best. You've
		seen these animals in the flesh. No one else
		has come close to you.

				GRANT
		I'm flattered, but I've taken this little
		adventure tour. And with the air
		restrictions they've imposed after the
		incident in San Diego, you cant fly low
		enough to see anything of interest.

	Paul is momentarily stymied, but Amanda rallies.

				AMANDA
		You see, that's just the thing. Paul and I
		have special permission to fly low.

				BILLY
		How low?

				PAUL
		Well, I'm no aviation specialist. But I do
		know it's hell of a lot lower than anyone
		else.

				AMANDA
		From what I understand, it's pretty much
		whatever we want.

				GRANT
		That's hard to believe.

				PAUL
		Let's just say that through my business --
		imports/exports, emerging markets -- I've
		made some friends in high places. In this
		case, the Costa Rican government.

				AMANDA
		Dr. Grant, you don't know how important it is
		for us to have you come along. It would make
		all the difference.

	Grant is trying to find another way to say no, when Paul pulls
	out his checkbook.

				PUAL
		And of course, we're prepared to make a
		sizeable contribution to your research here.

	Billy looks at Grant. Don't say no.

				PAUL (cont'd)
		I can write all kinds of numbers on this
		check. Just tell me what exactly it would
		take.

	We HOLD ON a conflicted Dr. Alan Grant.

		  		  CUT TO:

14 	EXT. SKY - DAY 							14

	NNNNNRRRRRRNNNNNRRRRR...

	A SMALL AIRPLANE - a Beechcraft Kingair 200 Turboprop, to be
	exact - cruises through clear blue skies.


15 	INT. PLANE - DAY 							15

	Grant re-settles, trying to get comfortable. Billy is across
	from him, finishing cleaning his camera lenses before putting
	them back in the ragged case.

				GRANT
		Even with what I pay you, you could get a
		better bag.

				BILLY
		No way. This is lucky. Couple years ago
		some buddies and I went hang gliding off
		these cliffs in New Zealand. Updraft sent me
		right into the side. BOOM!

				GRANT
		That does sound lucky.

				BILLY
		It was this strap alone that saved my life.
		Got caught on a rock as I was falling.

				GRANT
		Reverse-Darwinism. Survival of the most
		idiotic.

	Because he hasn't really said it...

				BILLY
		Listen Alan, I really appreciate you
		bringing me along.

				GRANT
		The bones will be there when we get back.
		That's the nice thing about them. They never
		run away.
			(beat)
		And besides, you got me into this. I don't
		intend to be alone with these people.

	ON PAUL AND AMANDA

	sitting near the front of the plane. Paul draws a long, nervous
	breath and looks at Amanda. She seems just as tense.

	Finally finding a comfortable position, Grant puts his hat over
	his eyes, ready to take a nap.

	Done with his camera, Billy turns to someone just off screen.

				BILLY
		So how do you know the Kirby's?

	and we reveal...

	Mercenary Cooper, the weapons specialist we met earlier. He's
	wearing sunglasses so dark you can't tell whether he's staring
	at you or fast asleep.

	He doesn't answer. Did he even hear? And then --

				COOPER
		Through our church.

				BILLY
		What Religion?

				COOPER
		Uhthe one that worships God and believes in being
		Good. 



16 	EXT. SKY - DAY 							16

	The plane continues onward.


17 	INT. PLANE - DAY / HOURS LATER 					17

	Grant slowly wakes in his chair, groggy. All the other
	passengers are fast asleep. Then Grant turns to his right.

	A RAPTOR

	sits besides him. The dinosaur eyes him curiously, then opens
	his mouth...

				RAPTOR
		Alan.

	And than it STRIKES.


18 	INT. PLANE - DAY 					       		18

	Grant wakes up with a start, disoriented. Billy is leaning over
	him.

				BILLY
	Alan. We're almost there.

	The adrenaline still surging through him, Grant turns and looks

	THROUGH THE WINDOW.

	Clouds obscure the view, than parts reveal

	ISLA SORNA

	rising majestically out of the water.


19 	EXT. SKY - COUNTINUOUS DAY 					19

	We watch the plane descend sharply to the island.


20 	INT. PLANE - COUNTINUOUS DAY 					20

	In various combinations, Grant and Billy, Paul and Amanda look
	out the windows at the amazingly green island.

	Cooper looks out through a window of his own.


21 	INT. COCKPIT - COUNTINUOUS DAY 				21

	Here we find the rest of the crew from the junkyard. Nash is
	piloting.

	A VOICE comes over their radio headsets.

				RADIO VOICE
			(Spanish accent)
		Unidentified aircraft approaching Isla
		Sorna, this is San Juan approach. You are
		flying in restricted airspace. Immediately
		turn to the coordinates two-zero-zero. I repeat
		redirect to...

	A look from Nash then Udesky switches off the radio.


22 	EXT. PLANE - COUNTINUOUS DAY 				       22

	The plane now descends to a mere hundred feet above the
	treetops.


23 	INT. PLANE - CONTINUOUS DAY 				       23

	Paul puts his hand atop Amanda's as they stare intently out the
	window.

	Billy looks to Grant.

				BILLY

		Admit it. You're excited.

	Grant will admit nothing.

	Calling back from the cockpit...

				UDESKY
		Cooper! Yell up if you see anything!

				COOPER
			(yelling back)
		No, I thought I'd keep it to myself.

	Suddenly Grant spots...

				GRANT
		There. There! An Apatosaur. Look at the
		coloration.

EXT. ISLA SORNA  GRASSY FIELD  CONTINUOUS DAY

	An Apatosaur is grazing on the grass.

INT.  PLANE  CONTINUOUS DAY

				BILLY
			(amazed)
		I'm so use to seeing bones. It's weird to see
		skin.

				GRANT
		Mr. and Mrs. Kirby! If you look out the right
		you can see...

	But Paul just waves him away with a hand, staring intently out
	his window. We HOLD ON Grant a moment, thinking that odd.


24 	INT. COCKPIT - CONTINUOUS DAY 				       24

	Udesky puts down his binoculars.

				UDESKY
		South shore is clear. The rest is rock.

				NASH
		Are we on?

				UDESKY
		We're on.


25 	INT. MAIN CABIN - CONTINUOUS DAY  			       25

	Looking out the window, Grant notices they're flying awfully
	low. Just then, he hears a MECHANICAL HUM and a LOW RUSH from
	outside. Now wanting to believe --

				GRANT
		That's not the landing gear?

	Paul, Amanda and Cooper don't respond.

				GRANT (CONT'D)
		What you're...
			(realizing)
		You can't land.

	Paul turns back to him.

				PAUL
		Dr. Grant if you'd just sit tight, we'll
		explain this all in a jiffy.

				GRANT
		This plane can not land!

				AMANDA
		It's going to be all right. Just...

	Grant is out of his seat, heading for the cockpit. He'll wrestle
	the controls if he has to.

	Cooper grabs him, pulling him back. Grant starts to struggle,
	but he's certainly no match. A well-practiced fist hits him
	dead on.

	CUT TO BLACK.


26 	OVER THE DARKNESS 						26

	we hear Amanda's voice, strangely distant but amplified.

				AMANDA
		Eric! Eric! Are you there honey? Ben!
		Erriccc!

	Her calls continue as we FADE UP to...


27 	INT. PLANE - DAY 							27

	GRANT'S P.O.V. -- blurry and disorientated. He finds himself lying
	on the floor of the plane.

	Seeing him come to, Billy helps him slowly get up. Grant's head
	is pounding.

				GRANT
		Tell me we didn't land.

	By his expression, we see Billy would have to lie.

				BILLY
		I think they're looking for someone.


28 	EXT. LANDING STRIP, ISLA SORNA - DAY 			       28

	The jungle has almost reclaimed this patchy vine-covered
	runway. The airplane is parked at one end.

	Nash, Udesky, and Cooper are checking their weapons.

	Amanda is at the edge of the tarmac calling into the jungle on a
	BULLHORN.

	Billy and a groggy Grant emerge from the airplane. Paul trots
	over.

				PAUL
		Dr. Grant, are you alright? I'm sorry we
		had to be so...

	The three mercenaries are now walking into the jungle with
	their guns.

				GRANT
		What the hell is going on? What are they
		doing?

				PAUL
		Establishing a perimeter. Making it safe.
		These guys are really good. One of them was a
		Green...

				GRANT
		Mr. Kirby, trust me, on this island, there is
		no such thing as safe. We have to get back in
		this plane...

	Grant looks to Amanda, who shouts through a bull horn.

				AMANDA
			(on-bullhorn)
		ERRR-IIIC!

				GRANT
		And tell your wife to stop making so
		much noise! We're food to these damn 
animals.

				PAUL
			(yelling)
		Amanda, Honey! Dr. Grant says it's a bad
		idea!

				AMANDA
			(on the bullhorn)
		What?

				PAUL
			(pointing broadly at Alan)
		He says it's a bad idea!

				AMANDA
			(on the bullhorn)
		What's a bad idea?

	As in on cue, there is a DEAFENING ROAR from the jungle.

	Everyone turns toward the sound and freezes.

				PAUL
			(to Alan)
		What was that?

	Grant doesn't answer, still listening to the reverberations. 
Then a couple shots are heard.

				BILLY
			(low)
		Is it a rex?

				GRANT
		I don't think so.

	Billy and Paul breathe a small sign of relief.

				GRANT (CONT'D)
		Sounds bigger.

	Nash and Udesky come RUNNING out of the jungle, headed for
	the plane.

				UDESKY
		We gotta go, now!

				PAUL
		What's the problem? Can't you guys...?

	As Udesky and Nash sprint past Paul in interrupted by a
	second, closer, DEAFENING ROAR. He pales.


29 	INT. PLANE - CONTINUOUS - DAY 				       29

	Udesky waits by the door, hustling everyone inside. Nash
	hurries into the cockpit. Everyone scrambles to a seat. Amanda
	climbs next to Paul.

				AMANDA
		We can't just...

				PAUL
		Don't worry, honey. We'll circle around and
		come back.

	Udesky closes the door.

				BILLY
		What about the other guy?

				UDESKY
		Coop's a professional. He can handle himself.

	A blood-curdling SCREAM echoes through the jungle followed by
	MACHINE GUN FIRE.

				NASH
			(yelling back)
		We're going!

	Udesky climbs into the copilot's seat, and Nash revs the engine.


30	EXT. RUNAWAY - DAY						30

	The plane starts down the runway.


31	INT. PLANE - DAY							31

	The passengers bounce in their seats as the plane picks up
	speed down the overgrown strip.


32	EXT. RUNWAY - DAY							32

	Suddenly, two hundred yards ahead of the plane,

	COOPER

	emerges from the jungle. He stands in the middle of the runway.
	waving one arm wildly. His second, badly injured arm hangs
	limp by his side.

				COOPER
		Come on, Nash. Slow down, buddy.


33	INT. THE COCKPIT - DAY					       33

	Nash spots Cooper, shoots a glance at the airspeed indicator.

				NASH
		Coop, you know I can't do it pal.

	He slams down full throttle in an attempt to reach flying speed.

	Seeing that Nash has no intention of stopping, Paul shouts from
	the cabin.

				PAUL
		What are you doing? That's Mr. Cooper!


34	EXT. RUNWAY - CONTINUOUS - DAY				34

	We are looking down on Cooper from behind. As the plane
	approaches,

	A SHADOW

	falls over the injured mercenary. Then with brutal speed, an
	ENORMOUS BEAST seizes him in its massive jaws and lifts him
	into the air.

	From this angle we get only a glimpse of a long crocodilian
	snout, powerful clawed forearms and spiny sail rising from the
	creature's back.


35	INT. THE COCKPIT - CONTINUOUS - DAY			       35

	All eyes are on the creature as it devours Cooper. Amanda turns
	away in horror.

				AMANDA
		Oh, my God! Paul, my God!


36	INT. THE COCKPIT - CONTINUOUS - DAY			       36

	Looking through the windshield, we see the creature is directly
	in the path of the plane.

	Nash pulls back on the stick. The plane rises.

	The left propeller clips the flank of the enormous
	dinosaur, SNAPPING the blade.

	Blood sprays the windshield and side windows.


37	EXT. RUNWAY - CONTINUOUS - DAY 				37

	The turboprop banks into the jungle, out of control.


38	INT. PLANE - CONTINUOUS - DAY 					38

	The passengers are thrown about as the craft CRASHES through
	trees, tearing off a wing and pieces of the tail.

	Finally coming to rest in the jungle canopy, the plane settles
	in the trees.

	SILENCE.

	The passengers slowly recover and have a look around. Foliage
	blocks most windows, making it impossible to see out.

				BILLY
		Is anyone hurt?

	Checking themselves, everyone seems pretty much intact.

	Still thinking of himself as in charge...

				UDESKY
		Quiet! We're okay. Let's everybody just stay
		put.

	He attempts to turn on the cockpit radio, but it's dead.

				NASH
		Who's got the sat-phone?

				PAUL
		Right here!

	Paul hands the bulky phone up to Nash, who dials out.

	Grant unstraps himself, climbs to the back to the side door and shoves.
	The door opens a few inches before hitting a branch.

	He looks out the and lets out a quiet gasp as the ground reels

	THIRTY FEET BELOW.

	He quickly shuts and latches the door.

	CLOSE ON the sat-phone. pressed against Nash's ear.

				RECORDED VOICE
		We're sorry. All circuits are busy. Please
		try your call again later...

				NASH
		Shit!

				PAUL
		What is it? What's the matter?

	Amanda SCREAMS.

	A huge reptilian face appears in the cockpit window. Everyone
	else SCREAMS now.
	
	The plane LURCHES - and we hear a deep GROWL.
	
	The passengers hold tight, paralyzed. Nash buckles himself into
	his seat.

	Suddenly, the plane is YANKED from the side to side. Battered this
	way and that, the terrified passengers tightly grip their 
	seats.
	
	Finally, the horrible sounds of WRENCHING METAL as the nose of
	the plane is RIPPED RIGHT OFF.

	Nash and Udesky are suddenly sitting in open air. The nose of
	the plane is tilting downwards, the jungle floor far below.

	The passengers hang almost vertically in their seats,

	Debris tumbles out the open end of the plane, some of it
	striking Nash in the head.

	Udesky unbuckles his seat belt and climbs back up into the
	cabin. Nash follows.

	Suddenly, a long snout with dagger-like teeth pushes past the
	cockpit seats, opens wide, and

	CLAMPS DOWN

	on Nash's legs.

	The pilot CRIES OUT in agony. The others passengers grab onto
	his arms, trying to pull him back. But it's no use. The dinosaur
	rips Nash out of their grasp and down the aisle.

	Nash desperately grabs on to the seat cushion, then watches in
	horror as the fabric RIPS AWAY. He's pulled out of the plane and 
	dropped to the ground. A giant foot steps in the way as the snout
	of the creature reaches down and quickly devourers the screaming
pilot.

	It's horrifying sight, but no one can turn away.

	Pleased with the appetizer, the creature comes back for the
	main course.

	Grant tries to force open the jammed rear door. Billy tries to
	help, but the door won't budge.

	The dinosaur JAMS its snout into the fuselage and lunges for
	Amanda in the first row. She yanks her legs back as the jaws
	SNAP SHUT.

	Behind Amanda, Billy reaches forward, UNSNAPS her seat belt
	and pulls her into the next row back.

	The others unstrap their belts and crowd into the rear of the
	passenger compartment.

	The shift in weight sends the fuselage tipping backwards.


39	EXT. JUNGLE - CONTINUOUS - DAY				       39

 	The plane breaks free of the tree limbs and DROPS tail-first to
	the jungle floor.

	It SLAMS hard, then flips over onto its roof.


40	INT. PLANE - CONTINUOUS - DAY				       40

	The passengers are prowled on the ceiling of the plane, dazed
	by the impact. Everyone is cut and bruised.

	Out of the open cockpit, they see two approaching dino feet.

	A window near Amanda fogs over with condensation. when it
	clears, she finds herself looking right into enormous eyes.

	Then all hell breaks loose as the plane is SLAMMED across the
	jungle clearing.

	The passengers are hammered against the walls of the plane,
	tumbling like socks in a dryer. Debris, seats and luggage fly
	everywhere.


41	EXT. JUNGLE FLOOR - CONTINUOUS - DAY			41

	The plane comes to an abrupt halt as it SMASHES into a tree.

	A gargantuan FOOT steps on the fuselage and FLATTENS it like a 
	paper tube.


42	INT. PLANE - CONTINUOUS - DAY					42

	Inside, windows EXPLODE, raining glass over the passengers. As
	the walls compress, Udesky becomes trapped in the rear of the 
	plane, the others in front.

				BILLY
		Over here!

	Udesky dives into the narrowing gap, and Billy pulls him the
	rest of the way through.

	Billy is as terrified as the rest of them, but he thrives under
	this rush of adrenaline.
	
	Then a huge CLAW digs into the skin of the fuselage and begins
	to slowly PEEL the plane open. Grant looks up in dread at the
	widening tear.

				GRANT
		This way!

	Grant leads the group out the open end of the cockpit. They
	make a mad dash for the jungle.

	A tremendous ROAR causes Billy to look behind him. He can't
	help but steal a glimpse of this terrifying, but utterly
	fascinating, animal.

	Grant yanks him forward.


43	EXT. JUNGLE - DAY						       43

	With Grant in the lead, and Udesky taking up the rear, the group
	tears through the jungle.

	Concealed by the dense undergrowth, the unseen dinosaur bears
	down on them -- mowing down the young trees which TOPPLE all
	around them.

	Grant spots a grove of

	HEAVIER TREES

	and leads the group into it.

	The dinosaur cannot fit between the trunks. It ROARS at
	the fleeing humans, searching desperately for a route after
	them.

	The group continues their relentless pace, putting as much 
	distance as they can between themselves and the beast. Paul
	Kirby looks like he's about to have a heart attack. Even Billy
	is gasping for air.

	They stop, thinking they've outrun it.

	Grant directs the group through some underbrush and into --


44	EXT. CLEARING - CONTINUOUS - DAY				44

	Our friends stop dead in their tracks. Amanda stifles a cry.

	Before them lies an immense unmoving SAUROPOD.

				GRANT
		Don't worry. It's dead.

	Then a full-grown bull

	TYRANNOSAURUS

	rises up behind the carcass. It was feeding, its mouth mottled
	with blood and carrion.

	Grant FREEZES.

				GRANT (CONT'D)
		Nobody move a muscle.

	Remember: the T-Rex tracks motion.

	Obeying, the group FREEZES for a few long beats. Then Udesky
	takes off running.

	And T-Rex ROARS.

	Everyone runs. T-Rex is right behind them.


45	EXT. JUNGLE - DAY							45

	Dashing back the way they came, the group suddenly comes face
	to face with --

	THE FIRST MONSTER.

	We now get our first full unobstructed view of the gigantic
	creature, SPINOSAURUS AEGYPTICUS. Over forty feet long and
	twenty-five feet high, the dinosaur has a bony sail along its
	back. Its head is crocodilian with rows of long, curving teeth.
	Sinewy six foot arms terminate in three fingers hands with
	fourteen inch claws.

	Nowhere else to run, the group scatters into the brush as the
	two behemoth predators rush forward, their ROARS thunderous.

	Paul and Amanda scramble into one direction, Billy and Udesky in
	the other. But Grant can't go anywhere - his foot is stuck 
	between two branches.

	He manages to free himself as the two dinosaurs approach.
	They'll have to deal with each other before eating the humans.

	Grant dives down between two fallen trees as the Spinosaurus and T-
	Rex circle one another like gladiators, each searching for the
	other's weakness.

	Laying flat on his back, Grant lets out a terrified GASP as the
	giant foot of Spinosaurus lands across the two trunks mere
	inches from his face.

	Spinosaurus lunges forward, powerful jaw open wide.

	T-Rex sidesteps the assault, its tail knocking down small
	trees as it spins out of the way.

	In the tress, Paul and Amanda scurry again for cover.

	Between the fallen trunks, Grant attempts to get away on his
	hands and knees.

	T-Rex presses the attack, slamming its tail into the flank of
	its adversary. Spinosaurus is knocked back, and Grant is again
	forced to duck for cover.

	As Spinosaurus struggles to regain its balance, T-Rex dives
	forward. Spinosaurus is driven backwards as T-Rex tries to
	grip its throat.

	Amanda yanks Paul out of their path. They Scramble over to
	Billy.

	Now on its side, Spinosaurus fights back ferociously. It slashes
	at T-Rex with its long arms and razor sharp claws, then finally
	kicks the animal with one mammoth foot.

	Tyrannosaurus staggers back, wounded.

	Down below, Grant is splashed by the blood pouring from the
	dinosaur, as he slowly makes his way towards his fellow humans.

	Spinosaurus lunges for the T-rex with gaping jaws and manages to
	topple T-Rex off its feet and sends the falling dinosaur to the
	ground.

	With an earth-shuttering CRASH, the dinosaur lands between
	Grant and the rest of the group.

	The companions scurry out of the way, but as they do so, the
	head of the T-Rex now lands almost directly on top of them.

	Plastered against an immense tree, the group watches in horror
	as T-Rex starts to rise but is thrown back down as Spinosaurus
	latches onto its throat.

	Spinosaurus crushes the life out of its adversary, and T-Rex
	opens and closes its jaw a mere inches from our terrified 
	friends.

	Finally, Grant reaches the others.

				GRANT
		Come on!

	Spinosaurus lets out a victorious HOWL, and the blood-drenched
	professor leads the group through the undergrowth.


46	EXT. JUNGLE - DAY							46

	Winded from running, Paul is caught off-guard as a furious
	Grant slams his back against a tree. Only one thing he wants to
	know --

				GRANT
		Why did you bring us here?

	Paul is too startled to speak. Udesky tires to step in, but
	Grant gives him back a look.

				AMANDA
		Our son is on this island. We need your help
		to find him.

	Still crunched against the tree, Paul pulls out a photo from his
	shirt pocket.

				PAUL
		This is him. Eric. Hes thirteen now. He's
		just about the greatest kid in the world.

	Letting go of Paul, Grant takes the photo, a Sears-style
	portrait of the boy we saw Parasailing at the beginning. He
	shakes his head, disbelieving. He hands the photo to Billy.

	The group splits into two sides -- Paul and Amanda, Grant and
	Billy -- with Udesky stuck between. Dialogue overlaps in
	places.

				AMANDA
		He's with a man named Ben Hildebrand.

				BILLY
		Who's that?

				PAUL
		Her new boyfriend.

				AMANDA
		A friend. We were vacationing. Eric wanted
		to see the island and the dinosaurs, so Ben
		found a guy who would take them parasailing.
		They never came back.

				PAUL
		We called everyone, did everything we could.
		Because of all the controversy over this
		island, no one will step in. Costa Rica says
		it's a no-fly zone, it's their own damn fault.
		Guys at the U.S Embassy -- our U.S. Embassy --
		said we should "accept the inevitable." You
		believe that?

				GRANT
		So you hired these mercenaries.

				UDESKY
		We prefer "recovery specialists." We do
		overseas custody issues and...

				GRANT
			(interrupting)
		Then you duped us into coming here.

				PAUL
		We needed somebody who knew the lay of the
		land. Somebody who'd been to this island before.

				GRANT
			(disbelieving)
		I have never been on this island!

				PAUL
		Sure you have. You wrote that book...

				BILLY
		That was Isla Nublar. This is Isla Sorna.
		The second island.

				PAUL
			(low, to Udesky)
		I didn't know, there were two islands.

				AMANDA
		Still, you have survived the dinosaurs before. You
		saved those kids.

				GRANT
		A few of us survived. A lot more died. And we
		were better prepared and better armed.
			(finally)
		How many days have they been missing?

	A look between Amanda and Paul.

				PAUL
		Eight weeks.

	Grand and Billy are speechless. It might as well be eight years.

				GRANT
		After what you've seen today, you really
		think your son could be alive?

				AMANDA
		He's smart, Dr. Grant. And he knows so much
		about dinosaurs.

	Before anyone else can talk, Grant puts his hand out. He wants
	everyone to shut up while he plans their next move.

				GRANT
		No, I'm sorry, but no. We'll savage what we
		can from the plane. Then we head for the
		coast. There may be a boat left, something to
		get us off this island.

				PAUL
		Dr. Grant, we're not leaving without our son.

				GRANT
		You can stick with us, or you can go and look for
		him. Either way you're probably not getting
		out of here alive.

	With that he leaves, A beat later, Billy follows. He has
	genuine sympathy for the Kirby's, but he's logical enough to
	know Grant is right.

	BACK WITH PAUL AND AMANDA

	They look to Udesky.

				PAUL
		What do we do?

	Udesky is clearly at a loss, but for everyone's reassurance he
	tries to mutter some brio.

				UDESKY
		Well, I think we should start searching for your
son. In the direction they're going.

				PAUL
		Excellent.

	They follow after Grant and Billy.


47	EXT. PLANE CRASH SITE						47

	The five survivors search through the wreckage, trying to find
	anything useful. The task is grim. Mindful of Grant's 
	warnings, they move quickly and quietly.

	Udesky picks up a gun out of the swampy water. The barrel is bent
	almost 90 degrees, unless.

	Billy finds his camera, intact.

	Digging a change of clothes out of his suitcase, Paul steps
	around the side of the plane to change. He's in his underwear
	before he notices Amanda is also there changing.

				PAUL
		Sorry.

				AMANDA
		Nothing you haven't seen before.

	A beat. Amanda looks over as they get dressed.

				AMANDA (CONT'D)
		How much weight have you lost?

				PAUL
		Twenty, twenty-fire pounds. I've been
		swimming at the Y.

				AMANDA
		You hate to swim.

				PAUL
		People change.

	A nod to mean, that's the truth.

				PAUL (CONT'D)
		You look good.

				AMANDA
		So do you.

	They make brief eye contact, which Amanda breaks.

	Around the side, Billy is taking photos of a giant footprint the
	dinosaur left in the mud during its attack on the plane. Grant
	looks over.

				GRANT
		How would you classify it?

				BILLY
		Obviously a superpredator.
			(best guess)
		Suchimimus. that snout.

				GRANT
		They never got that big.

				BILLY
		Baryonyx?

				GRANT
		Not with that sail.
			(Billy gives up)
		Spinosaurus Aegypticus.

				BILLY
		I don't remember that on InGen's list.

				GRANT
		That's because it wasn't on their list. Who
		knows what else they were up to?

	Billy looks past Grant to see Paul approaching. He's struggling
	with the straps on his backpack. turning in circles.

	Billy regards him with suspicion.

				BILLY
		So Mr. Kirby, tell me, when you climbed K2,
		did you base camp at 25- or 30,000 feet?

				PAUL
		Thirty-thousand, I think. Closer to the top.

				BILLY
		About a thousand feet above it, actually.
			(closer)
		Most mountain-climbers remember how tall
		that mountains were.

	Paul knows he's caught.

				GRANT
		There is no Kirby Enterprises, is there?

				PAUL
		There is. I own a place called Kirby Paint
		and Title Plus. We're out in the Westgate
		Shopping Center in Enid, Oklahoma. The
		"plus" is for bathroom fixtures, fireplaces
		accessories, patio furniture. Stuff like 
		that.

				BILLY
		I don't suppose that check you wrote us is
		any good.

				UDESKY
		He paid us half up front. Cash.

				PAUL
		Mortgaged everything we had to do it. Even
		the store. and if we make it off this island
		with my son, I swear, I'll make good on the
		money I owe you. I don't care if it takes me
		the rest of my life.

	Grant and Udesky exchange a dubious glance.

				UDESKY
		However long that is.


48	EXT. JUNGLE PATH - DAY						48

	Amanda, Paul, Billy, Udesky and Grant walk through the jungle.

				AMANDA
		Eric!

				GRANT
		Quiet!

				PAUL
			(loud whisper to Amanda)
		Stop that. Dr. Grant says this is dangerous
		territory.

				AMANDA
		Well we should split up or something. We can
		cover twice the area.

				PAUL
		No, Dr. Grant says...

				AMANDA
		Dr. Grant says this, Dr. Grant says that...

				PAUL
		Well what's the use of hiring an expert if
		your not going to listen to him?

				AMANDA
		Because "Dr. Grant" isn't looking for Eric.
		Dr. Grant is looking for the coast.

				PAUL
		Fine...and when the Tricyclatops comes after
		you, don't come crying to me.

				AMANDA
		Oh, don't worry about that.

				PAUL
		What?

				AMANDA
		Nothing.

				PAUL
		What did you say?

				AMANDA
		Nothing.

				PAUL
		What did you say!

				AMANDA
		Just drop it Paul!

	The Kirby's conversation trails off into the jungle. Udesky
	moves up next to Grant and Billy.

				UDESKY
		If they split up, I'm going with you.

	And as they continue forward, Billy spots something in the
	trees ahead.


49	EXT. JUNGLE CLEARING - DAY					49

	A parasail chute is caught in the branches of a tree. A yellow
	life vest hangs limply from a branch.

	Paul rushes over, unsnags it, and examines the label.

				PAUL
		Young adult.

				AMANDA
		Eric...

				UDESKY (O.S)
		Hey. Got something here.

	All turn to see Udesky holding up a camcorder encased in a
	waterproof shell.

				AMANDA
		That's Ben's!

	She grabs it from Udesky and pops open the housing. She tries
	the power switch on the camcorder, but the battery's dead.

	Udesky pull out a flashlight from his pack and looks to Amanda.

				UDESKY
		Here, give that to me.

	And as Udesky fiddles with the flashlight, Grant and Billy
	consider the parasail.

				BILLY
		It looks intact.

				GRANT
		We should take it with us to signal any planes.

				UDESKY (O.S)
		I think I've got it.

	Udesky has rigged the wires on the flashlight so that the
	batteries can be used to power the camcorder.

	He brings a live wire to back of the camcorder. A red power
	light comes on.

				AMANDA
		It works!

				UDESKY
		I don't know for how long.

	Udesky swings the tiny screen out and pushes play. The others
	crowd around.

	ON THE SCREEEN

	Eric and Ben play frisbee on the beach.

				PAUL (O.S.)
			(excited)
		That's him. Thats Eric!

				AMANDA (O.S.)
		I filmed this the morning they left.

	Ben catches the frisbee, checks his watch and motions to Eric.

	Eric runs over, and Ben puts his arm around him as they run to
	the camera.

	Paul reacts to this image but holds his tongue.

	THE VIDEO SCREEN -

	The image now CUTS to a shot from aboard Enrique's boat
	speeding towards ISLA SORNA -- the start of the movie. Eric
	points excitedly at the island and smiles at the camera.

	We replay the opening moments of the movie from Ben and Eric's
	perspective, soaring high until...

				ERIC
		Ben!

				BEN
		Unclip the line!

	THE JUNGLE -

	A PAN from face to face of all watching this tape with a
	mixture of hope and nausea.

	ON SCREEN -

	Angle again with Ben's legs in the foreground. Falling fast.

				BEN (CONT'D)
		Hand on! Hang on buddy!

	Now the camera penetrates the jungle canopy and the picture
	and sound become complete chaos: SCREAMS from the both,
	branches BREAKING, flashes of Ben and Eric's frightened faces
	as the camera is buffeted in all directions.

	With a lurch the terrifying descent in finally over, and the
	jungle floor is just ten feet away, swaying back and forth
	beneath Ben and Eric's feet.

				BEN (CONT'D)
		Are you ok, buddy?

	There's GURGLING to his voice. Ben may be more hurt than he's
	letting on.

				ERIC
			(through his sobs)
		I don't know. I think so.

				BEN
		We're okay. It's going to be okay. Here, get
		ready. I'm going to unhook you.

	The sound of PUMPLING is followed by the sight of Eric DROPPING		
	into the frame, landing on the ground rolling. He stands and
	looks back up at Ben.

				ERIC
		I'm all right

				BEN (O.S)
			(weaker)
		We're going to get out of this, pal.

	And on that, the power and picture fade away.

	BACK ON PAUL AND AMANDA - overjoyed.

				PAUL
		See? He's okay. He's alive! Everything's
		going to be all right now.

	Amanda brings a hand to her mouth, silently nodding her head.

	Grant and Billy exchange a dubious look, than begin pulling the
	parasail out of the tree. As they do so, the sail gets caught on
	a branch.

	They pull harder. The branch bends, but the sail won't come
	loose. One last tug and than, SNAP. The branch breaks, the chute
	falls away to reveal

	A SKELETON.

	It swings down directly at Amanda. She SCREAMS.

	Finally, the others are able to pull her away. As they untangle
	the lines, the men are able to get the first view of the remains
	of Ben Hillenbrand, still caught in his harness.

	Amanda's knees buckle. Regaining her balance, she runs off into
	the jungle.

	Paul quickly follows.

				PAUL (CONT'D)
		Amanda!


50	EXT. THICKNESS - DAY						50

	Reeling, Amanda comes to a stop in an area with thick
	undergrowth. It's danger here, very still and quiet.

	She tries to calm herself, but each effort to suppress just
	makes her more emotional. She's surprised as Paul wraps an arm
	around her to comfort her. But she doesn't fight it.

				PAUL
		I'm sorry Amanda. I am. And I'm sorry for
		the things I said about him.

				AMANDA
		No, it's...

				PAUL
		I know you liked Ben. I had no right to...

				AMANDA
			(frustrated)
		Its not about him. It's Eric. He's alone out
		here somewhere. Our baby is all alone.

	Saying it aloud, the reality sinks in for both of them

				AMANDA (CONT'D)
		I guess I was hoping that with Ben around,
		there'd be someone to keep him safe.

	Checking in on clients, Udesky stops at the edge of the
	thicket. Something raises the hairs on the back of his neck.

				UDESKY
		Dr. Grant!

	He nods for the others to take a look at this. They head over,
	Grant at the rear.

	As he approaches, Billy is packing up the rest of the chute in a
	backpack. He stops short from what he sees.

	Looking down, we CIRCLE across the jungle floor. Here we find a
	strange, hollowed-out construction made of sod and branches.
	Maybe six feet around.

	Just now noticing the others' stare, Paul looks down into one
	of the bowls at his feet, a half-buried nest. It's filled with
	football-sized eggs, laid in a spiral.

	And this isn't the only nest. Amanda counts twelve in all, laid
	out in an oddly symmetrical pattern.

	The last to arrive, Grant identifies the species in a horrified
	instant.

				GRANT
		Raptors.

And as he says the words, off in the distance, we hear
	the cry of some herbivores, around by the chorus of
	snarls.


							SMASH CUT TO:

51	EXT. FUTHER IN THE FOREST - DAY				51

	The party blasts through the forest, trying to keep up with
	Grant. They haven't even had time to ask --

				AMANDA
			(to Paul)
		Whats a raptor?

	Paul has no idea.

				UDESKY
		They don't look that big. I mean,
		comparatively.

				GRANT
		If we came across one, we might live.

				PAUL
		Well that's good.

				GRANT
		But you never came across just one.

	From the back --

				AMANDA
		Wait! Where's Billy?

	They all stop. The only one not there is --

				Grant
		Billy! Billy!

				AMANDA
			(almost sotto)
		I thought we weren't suppose to yell.

				BILLY (O.S)
		Here!

	He comes in from the left. Excited, he explains to Grant --

				BILLY (CONT'D)
		I got some great pictures of the nest. You
		know this proves raptors raised their young
		in colonies.

	Furious with his student. Grant just keeps moving. There's no
	time to stand around and argue.

				BILLY (CONT'D)
		This speaks to a larger social structure, the
		possibility of Darwinian altruism. It
		changes everything.

	A beat. Trying not to sound presumptuous --

				BILLY (CONT'D)
		We could co-write a paper.

				GRANT
		Ah yes, the first rule of academics. Publish
		or perish.


52	SCENE PREVIOUSLY OMITTED					52


53	EXT. RIDGE - DAY (HOURS LATER)					53

	Much fatigued, the five now mach upward towards a crest.

	Panting and flushed, they reach the top of the ridge and gaze
	into the distance.

	A jungle valley stretches before them. Not far off in A VAST
	COMPOUND - comprised of several buildings. One building alone
	seems to cover several acres.

	The weary group breathes a sigh of relief.

				PAUL
		I bet there's a very good chance Eric's in
		there. I'd bet my bottom dollar.

	Udesky and Grant share dubious looks and continue down into
	the valley.


54	EXT. INGEN COMPOUND - DAY					54

	The group emerges from the jungles and enters the compound.
	They walk through an overgrown parking lot, littered with
	abandoned vehicles. Some are lying on their side. Others are
	overturned completely.

	They're not going to be driving anywhere.

	A troubled Grant peers through a windshield, partially caved
	in, like some giant head butted the glass. (Think back to Lost 
World)

	And the group finally approaches the front doors of an
	enormous building. As they head up the front steps, we see
	something in the distance behind them:

	CAT-LIKE MOVEMENTS

	on the high ridge. To fast to see what it was. But too ominous
	to dismiss.


55	INT. BUILDING LOBBY - DAY					55

	Our friends now find themselves in a sparse, one quietly
	opulent corporate lobby now in the process of being reclaimed
	by the jungle/ Roots and ivy poke through the floor and walls.

	In the waiting area, the cushions of a sofas and chairs have been
	gnawed at and pulled apart. Dusty coffee mugs and filled
	ashtrays lie on the table. The water has turned brackish in a
	near by cooler.

	Sudden FLAPPING. We look up and see BIRDS nesting in the
	rafters. It is an eerie, haunted place.

				PAUL
			(calling out)
		Eric! Are you here?

				AMANDA
		Eric!

	All listen for a response. Nothing. Paul and Amanda exchange a
	despondent look.

	Sitting on the reception counter is an official-looking
	telephone. Everyone has the same thought, but no one dares.
	Finally -

				AMANDA (CONT'D)
		What the hell.

	Amanda puts the receiver to her ear. Nada.

	With Grant in the lead, they head deeper into the building.

	Unseen by the group, a fleeting SHADOW flits across the lobby's
	dirty windows with terrifying speed.


56	INT. CORRIDOR - DAY						56

	A couple vending machines stand at the one end of this long
	hallway covered with vines.

	Paul notices them and pulls change from his pocket.

				PAUL
		Let's see. I've got about a dollar seventy-
		five. How about you guys?

	Billy SMASHES IN the window of one machine with his boot.
	Picking through the glass, he pulls out some candy bars and
	chips. He checks the expiration date. 	


	CONTINUED:								56

				BILLY
		Thank God for preservatives.

	He tosses the food to the others.

	Paul now turns to his own vending machine and SMASHES it with
	his heal. The glass refuses to break.


57	INT. HATCHING LABORATORY					57

	Grant and Billy push through a set of doors to see
	
	A CAVERNOUS HATCHING FACILITY

	filled with much of the same equipment we recognized from the
	first island, although the sheer size of this place dwarfs any
	of the facilities seen previously.

	As the group walks down the ramp and onto the floor, they begin to
	absorb the incredible array of technology: enormous cryonic
	freezer, their plug pulled years ago; empty incubators; tanks
	of formaldehyde with dinosaur fetuses and body parts.

	Machines with intricate tubing and wing arms stand beside
	conveyer belts cris crossing the room at different levels.

				AMANDA
		This is how you make dinosaurs?

				GRANT
		This is how you play God.

	Billy looks around the lab. He can't help but be impressed.

				BILLY
		Okay if I take pictures?

	Grant nods.

	Billy sets his lucky camera back down on the worktable. Two years
	from now, astute observers of the DVD will not that Billy
	doesn't actually take his camera from the bag; he was carrying
	it because there wasn't any room inside.

	Billy pulls a new roll of film from the bag and zips it shut.

	ACROSS THE LAB

	Amanda is passing a large cylindrical tanks with half-formed
	embryos floating in formaldehyde -- genetic experiments gone
	awry. Finally she reaches

	A GIGANTIC MANIFIED RAPTOR HEAD

	floating in the one tank.

	Something about this specimen catches Amandas attention. She
	bends forward, getting very close to the glass. She peers right
	into the eyes of the nightmarish creature. Then --

	AN ACTUAL RAPTOR

	lunges at her form behind the tank. She SCREAMS.

	Fortunately the raptor can't get between the closely spaced
	tanks. Amanda runs.

				PAUL
		Amanda!

				GRANT
		Back out! Move!

	And as the group races through the lab the Raptors find a
	larger gap between the tanks.


58	INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS - DAY				58

	Paul leads the way, checking the door for possible escape
	routes or hiding places. Twenty feet behind,

	THE RAPTOR

	rounds a corner, bolting after them. Paul ducks in the closest
	door.

				PAUL
		In here!


59	INT. DINO KENNEL - CONTINUOUS - DAY				59

	The group slams the door behind them and quickly takes in the
	room.

	There are several rows of oversized steel cages, apparently
	used for containing young dinosaurs. Many of the cage doors are
	standing open.

	The group races down a lone aisle. Close behind, the raptor
	BURSTS into the room, ROARS.

	As the Raptor gains ground, Udesky and Billy run into one of the
	open cages, SLAMMING the door behind them.

	Grant, Paul and Amanda duck into another. Before they can
	swing the cage door shut behind them, however, the raptor SLAMS
	into it, driving the door into the cage.

	They are forced back against a chain-like wall, trapped in a
	small triangle space by the advancing door. The angry
	Raptor is now inches away through the cage door.

	Then, suddenly, the raptor looks up. We follow its gaze. The top
	of their triangular enclose is wide open.

	The eager raptor climbs up the chain-like door. Catching the
	tail of an idea, Amanda grabs the door and nods to the others.

				AMANDA
		Push!

	They push hard on the cage door, swinging it and the raptor
	right through the opening of the cage.

	Now the raptor is trapped in a small triangular space, the door
	going right to the ceiling.

	Amanda slides the door's bolt through the chain like wall,
	temporarily trapping the dinosaur.

	The raptor struggles desperately, GRAWLING AND SNARLING, but
	the cage door seems to be holding.

	As everyone rushes back to the door.

	The raptor begins to make a LOW, HAUNTING MOAN.

	As the others head for the door, Grant lingers a step, listening
	to the beast's simple melodic cry. It has the same tones as
	came from the model resonating chamber.

				GRANT
		She's calling for help.


60	EXT. COMPOUND - DAY						60

	The group exits the rear of the lab building and finds itself in
	a large equipment yard. The CALL of the raptor is still audible
	as they head for the tree line.

	Now they moan is ANSWERED from distant jungle quarters.

	The responses quickly MULTIPLY. To the group's dismay, they
	soon find themselves virtually SURROUNDED by raptor CRIES both
	distant and near.

	Grant looks around with amazement. It's vindication of his
	theory on raptor communication, but it couldn't come at a worse
	time.

	Responding to the growls, a herd of grazing HADROSAURS suddenly
	flees across the open space. Then, in the distance behind the
	herd

	A PACK OF RAPTORS

	emerges from the jungles, coming their way.

				GRANT
		Head for the trees!

	From the lab building, the raptor we left imprisoned now BURSTS
	out one of the doors and HOWLS to the pack -- the same cry we
	heard in the lab.

	The raptor pack moves into the hunting formation. One ALPHA-MALE
	RAPTOR. slightly larger than the others, leads the charge up the
	middle.

	Grant risks a looks back. But doesn't stop running.

				GRANT (cont'd)
		THIS WAY!

	In an effort to escape the oncoming raptors, Grant leads the
	group right into the stampeding heard of hadrosaurs.

	Suddenly, all is chaos. Hadrosaurs race past, splitting up the
	group.

	Letting the others get ahead of him, Grant looks back. Much to
	his dismay, the raptors are ignoring the hadrosaurs.

	Indeed, the pack weaves its way through the herd -- the raptors
	only want them.

	In the chaos of the stampede, everyone loses sight of each other.

	Up ahead, Billy trips and falls. As he rolls the strap on his
	camera bag breaks. He doesn't notice it's missing until he's
	already back on his feet and running.

	Amanda and Paul keep close to each other. Further back, Grant
	spots Billy's fallen camera back. He grabs it as he runs past.

	Looking back, Billy sees that Grant now has his back...

				BILLY
		ALAN!

				GRANT
		KEEP GOING!

	They lose sight of each other in the rush.


61-19	OMIT									61-69


69A	EXT. EDGE OF THE JUNGLE - DAY					69A

	As the hadrosaurs WHIP PAST, Paul and Amanda climb up into a
	tree. A raptor leaps at Paul, barely missing his leg.

	Trying to pull Paul up, Amanda nearly loses her balance. This
	time, Paul catchers her.

	Billy climbs up a nearby tree of his own in sight of Paul and Amanda.

	Udesky has nearly reached a tree of his own when he finds
	himself

	HEADED OFF

	by a raptor. He turns to the other way, but finds

	THERE ARE MORE RAPTORS.

	He picks up a fallen branch as these dinosaurs cautiously
	approach. Not more than a few feet away, the leader of the trio
	stops, peering at him.

	Udesky swings hard, but the dinosaurs feints. From behind him,
	another raptor slashes at the back of his legs, severing his
	muscles. Udesky CRIES OUT and drops to the ground.

	IN THE TREETOPS

	Paul, Amanda and Billy can hear him.

				PAUL
		Udesky.

				AMANDA
			(Listening)
		He's this way.

	From here, the thick branches overlap, forming a kind of
	"second floor" above the ground. It's not easy, but you can move
	from branch to branch, tree to tree.

	ON THE FLOOR

	Unable to walk, Udesky attempts to crawl away from the animals.
	The effort clearly causes him great pain. Strangely, the
	raptors suddenly don't seem interested in him anymore.

	Rather, they're "talking" among themselves. Udesky is amazed to
	find him self still alive.

	Suddenly, one of the raptors SLASHES at him again. But it's
	delicately not a mortal blow, just a very painful one. Udesky
	CRIES OUT, louder this time.

	IN THE TREES

	Hearing the new cry, Paul, Amanda and Billy move faster, now
	finally seeing Udesky on the ground. He's face-down, barely
	moving but still MOANING.

	The raptors are gone.

	In the lead, Amanda starts to climb down. But Paul grabs her,
	holds her back.

				PAUL
		It's not safe.

				AMANDA
		We have to help him.

				BILLY
		He's right. A predator wouldn't leave a kill
		wounded.

				AMANDA
		He's not a kill, he's still alive.

	She breaks from Paul's grip and drops to the ground. She's only
	a foot away from the tree when

	ALL FOUR RAPTORS

	lead out from their hiding places. They almost catch her as
	Billy and Paul pull her back up on the limb

	The raptors stare up at them, angry their plan didn't work.

				PAUL
		They couldnt climb up, so they were trying
		to get us to come down.

				BILLY
		They set a trap
			(amazed)
		They actually set a trap.

	Bored with waiting, the raptors go back to finish off Udesky,
	making a meal out of it. Up in the branches, the survivors are
	horrified and sickened.

	Then, from the deep in the forest, a new RAPTOR CRY. The feasting
	raptors look up, listening, then suddenly run off into the dark
	jungle.

				PAUL
		Where's Grant?


69B	EXT. ELSEWHERE IN THE JUNGLE - DAY				69B

	Climbing higher in a tree, Grant is just feet above a growing
	pack of raptors. He scales one branch, the next, finally
	reaching a perch that the dinosaurs can't jump to.

	LOOKING DOWN

	The entire pack is now standing still, watching him. In the
	center, the Alpha Male lets out a sort of BARK. Responding to the
	cry, the other raptors CALL BACK.

	As terrified as he is, he can't help but be fascinated by their
	communication. Like a hellish bird song, there's a rhythm to it,
	a structure. They're clearly talking about something.

	Under his breath, Grant is able to mimic its patterns.

				GRANT
		What does that mean? What are you saying?

	Of course they can't answer. They just keep using the same
	"phrase."

	Ready to ditch Billy's camera bag in order to climb higher --
	he's had to hold it by the strap -- Grant finds his hand covered
	with a runny slime. He looks down at the camera bag, and that's
	the source. It's oozing out the bottom.

	He unzips the bag to find

	A BROKEN RAPTOR EGG

	inside, the white and green yolk still dripping from the pieces
	of the shell. There's another intact egg beside it.

	This is what the raptors where chasing.

				GRANT (CONT'D)
		God damn you, Billy.

	Ever the scientist, Dr. Grant tests a theory even in the face of
	danger: he holds up the intact egg so that the raptors can see it.
	They suddenly go crazy, howling the same phrase but LOUDER.

				GRANT (CONT'D)
		It means, "Give us the egg," doesn't it? "We
		want the egg."

	He gently drops the bag to the ground. Although the raptors are
	interested, pulling out the unbroken egg, they're still by no means
	placated. The song may have changed, but they still want Grant
	dead.

	They begin to jump at him, eventually, hopping up on each
	others backs. It's only a matter of time till they reach him.

	Grant moves to climb higher, but sees no branches he can reach.
	And than he hears the low CREAKING. A CRACK. The branch he's
	on is starting to give in.

	He looks down at the face of his enemies, knowing he'll be
	their next meal. And then,

	A SMALL CANISTER

	lands at the base of the trees, immediately SPRAYING out a thick
	cloud of oily fog. It's the first of

	FIVE CANISTERS

	that land in the area, creating a thick cloud. It's not just
	smoke though something far more caustic.

	As it hits the raptors they immediately recoil, those closest
	to the canisters SHRIEKING in pain. Tumbling in the dirt.
	There may be a pheremonal element to the mist as well -- they
	seem panicked, disoriented.

	Pack mentality takes over, and after the first ten raptors take
	off running, so do the rest, some tripping over their feet
	blindly.

	This may be dino-tear gas, but it's not good for humans either.
	Up in the tree, Grant's eyes immediately burn from the vapor
	He squints to see through the fog, where he spots

	A HUMAN SHAPE

	at the edge of the smoke

				VOICE
		Come on! They'll be back!

	Grant half-climbs, half-falls out of the tree, rushing to get
	through the heaviest of the smoke.

	A SMALL DIRTY HAND

	grabs his, pulling him along.


69C	EXT. JUNGLE - LATE DAY						69C

	Eyes swollen from the gas. Grant stumbles, barely able to see as
	the other person pulls him along. It's only now we can identify
	his rescuer as

	ERIC KIRBY,

	the boy he was brought to rescue. A lot has changed in the last
	eight weeks. It's not just dirt and muck -- he's the filthiest
	child you've ever seen -- something primal has come out in him.

	Something wild.


69D	EXT. INGEN COMPOUND - TWILIGHT				69D

	On the far side of the tipped over vehicle, Eric pulls open a
	hatch -- his hiding place. The door opens part way.

	Eric motions for Grant to follow.


69E	INT. INSIDE THE BUNKER - TWILIGHT				69E

	Squeezing in sideways -- it's very tight fit -- Grant finds
	himself in a space no bigger than the inside of a Datsun. lit by
	a small battery-powered lantern. This is where Eric has been
	hiding.

	The minute Grant's inside, Eric goes back to work re-sealing
	the door. This 13-year old boy has become astonishingly
	efficient at staying alive.

				GRANT
		Eric...

	The boy holds up a hand. He listens for a moment. He doesn't
	hear anything outside.

				GRANT (CONT'D)
		Eric, your parents are both here.

				ERIC
		In Costa Rica?

				GRANT
		On the island.

	Eric truly can't believe it. He hoped to be rescued but...

				ERIC
		They'll never make it. I mean, they can't
		manage when the cable goes out.

				GRANT
		You'd be surprised what people can do when
		they have too.

	Eric studies his guest, finally certain he recognizes him.

				ERIC
		You're Alan Grant, aren't you?
			(off surprised reaction)
		I read both of your books.

				GRANT
		Which one do you prefer?

				ERIC
		The first one. Before you where on the island.
		You liked dinosaurs back then.

				GRANT
		Back then, they hadn't tried to eat me.

	Grant takes a better look around Eric's tiny hideaway,
	impressed with what he's been able to scavenge. Among the many
	items we see another smoke canister, some battery-powered
	lanterns and lots of candy wrappers. This kid's been living on
	chocolate for weeks.

				ERIC
		When InGen cleared out, they left a lot of
		stuff behind.

				GRANT
		Any weapons, radios?

	Eric pulls up a long cattle prod to show Grant.

				ERIC
		Found this, but the battery's dead.

				GRANT
		It's a wonder you aren't. I'm amazed, Eric. I 
		barely lasted 30 hours. You lasted eight
		weeks.

	The line catches Eric strangely. It's the first moment of true
	emotion we've seen him in.

				ERIC
		Is that all it's been? I thought it was longer.

				GRANT
			(trying to be positive)
		The important thing is we both made it.
		That's something we have in common.

	Eric rips into a candy bar. After a moment, he realizes he
	should offer one to his guest as well.

	Grant takes it. A lone beat. Than, Grant just has to know...

				GRANT (CONT'D)
		Did you read Malcolm's book?

				ERIC
		Yeah.

				GRANT
		What did you think?

				ERIC
		I dunno. I mean, it was kind of preachy.
		Chaos-this, chaos-that. And like, to me, the
		guy seemed kind of high on himself.

	Grant smiles.

				GRANT
		That's two things we have in common.


69F	EXT. TREETOPS - NIGHT						69F

	The trio is where we left them, perched up in the branches.
	They're far from safe, but nothing's after them for a
	while.

	In Billy's eyes, we can see a storm of guilt raging. But he
	hasn't said anything. Won't say anything.

				AMANDA
		We can't just stop looking. Eric and Dr.
		Grant are out there somewhere.

				PAUL
		I want to find them too, but we can't do a bit
		of good right now. For every scary thing we
		saw in the daylight, I'll bet there ten times
		more of 'em at night.
			(to Billy)
		Am I right?

				BILLY
		I dont know.

				PAUL
		I thought you were an expert.

				BILLY
		Dr. Grant was.

				AMANDA
		Well Dr. Grant isn't here, so we're going to
		have to figure out what to do ourselves.

	Amanda is impressed by her own determinations. A long beat.

				AMANDA (cont'd)
		So what do we do?

	No one has the faintest clue.


69G	EXT. DEEP IN THE FOREST - NIGHT					69G

	VARIOUS SHOTS; The creatures of Isla Sorna walk past in the
	shadows, some looking up at the light in the trees.

	Suddenly, one of the creatures is attacked by another. We hear
	ROLLING, SNARLING, HISSING, just seeing the outline of the
	fight. Just as fast as it began, the fight is over, the winner
	snakes on the loser.


69H	EXT. TREETOPS - NIGHT (LATER)					69H

	Everyone's moved to different branches, trying to settle in for
	the night. Paul keeps looking over to the tearful Amanda, about
	to say something. He finally does.

				PAUL
		I just want you know, Amanda. It's not
		your fault what happened.

	Amanda looks over, not sure what his absolution.

				PAUL (cont'd)
		Eric has always been headstrong, and you
		throw Ben Hildebrand into the mix and well...

				AMANDA
		Well what?

				PAUL
		Well damn it. I don't speak ill of the dead.
		What I'm trying to say is, its was just a crazy
		accident. The exact same thing could have
		happened if he was with me. You can't go
		beating yourself up about it.

	Realizing he's trying his best, Amanda cant stay angry with
	him.

				AMANDA
		This wouldn't happen if he was with
		you. I mean, you drive five miles below the
		speed limit. I totaled three cars in fives
		years.

				PAUL
		That one time was just the bumper.

				AMANDA
		He would have been, safe. Completely,
		entirely, suffocatingly safe.
			(beat)
		I would have him to see more of the world than
		Enid, Oklahoma. I wanted to see more of the
		world than Enid, Oklahoma. And so yes, it's
		my fault that this happened. I'm sorry that
		you have to be here.

	Really looking at her...

				PAUL
		I'm not sorry at all.


69I	EXT. INGEN COMPOUND - DAY					69I

	Morning on Isla Sorna. A low mist hangs tight to the forest
	floor as Eric seals up his hideaway for hopefully the last time.

	They start walking. Eric pulls something out of his pocket,
	shows it off to Grant.

				ERIC
		Know what this is?

				GRANT
			(takes it)
		A raptor claw. I use to have one. A fossil.

				ERIC
		Mine's new.

	Grant hands it back.

	Eric is becoming more and more a normal thirteen-year old boy.
	There's an innocence to him that's coming back.

				GRANT
		How much of this island have you explored?

				ERIC
		I stayed pretty close to the compound,
		Figured if anyone came to look for me, that's
		where they'd start.

				GRANT
		We need to head for the coast.

				ERIC
		Are you sure?

				GRANT
		Why?

				ERIC
		Closer you get to the water, the bigger
		things get.


69J	EXT. JUNGLE - DAY							69J

	Billy and Amanda wait for Paul as he comes out of the bushes,
	hiking up his shorts.

	Trying to take charge...

				BILLY
		We need to stick to the plan. Head for the
		coast.

				AMANDA
		What about Eric and Dr. Grant?

				BILLY
		Going to the coast was Alan's idea. If he's
		alive, thats where he's headed.

				AMANDA
		What about Eric?

	Billy represses his instinct to say Eric's dead.

				PAUL
			(rationalizing)
		He's probably has a better chance by the coast
		as it is. Figures that all the big dinosaurs
		would live in the center of the island.
			(to Billy)
		Right?

				BILLY
		Sure.


69K	EXT. JUNGLE - DAY							69K

	As Grant and Eric walk, both stop, hearing a strange sound. But
	for a change, it's not an ominous one.

	It's a human one.

	A phone is RINGING, very faintly. Without a word to each other,
	Grant and Eric decide its coming from the right.

69L	EXT. JUNGLE - CONTUNUOUS DAY					69L

	Paul is picking the briars out of his socks as they hike,
	risking tripping on every step. Then Amanda stops short. She's
	the first to hear it:

	THE SAME RINGING.

	After a beat, everyone else can hear it too. And recongnition
	finally lights on Paul's face...

				PAUL
		My phone.

	Suddenly, Paul frantically searches his pockets as the others
	anxiously watch.

				AMANDA
		You had the phone the whole time?

				BILLY
		Where is it?

				PAUL
		I don't know. I don't have it with me.

				AMANDA
		When did you have it last?

				PAUL
		I don't remember

				AMANDA
		Think.

	And Paul wracks his memory...

				PAUL
		The plane. I got a call on the plane, put it in
		my coat pocket, and...

	Bust suddenly, he stops, his face is lighting with an awful
	realization. Amanda couldnt bear the wait...

				AMANDA
		What?...WHAT!?

				PAUL
		I loaned it to Nash. He must have had it on
		him when he...

	The hideous implication of his words slowly sink in.


69M	EXT. JUNGLE - DAY							69M

	Still following the faint RINGING, Grant and Eric turn to find

	A SAIL

	moving through the low trees. We recognize it as the back of a
	spinosaurus. We might think it's any random spinosaurus,
	except for the RINGING coming from somewhere inside it.

	Grant and Eric press back against a tree, keep perfectly
	still as they hear the THOOOOMB, THOOOOMB, THOOOMB of the
	creature's footsteps reverberating. It's tail RUSTKES against
	the brush.

	It's moving behind them, and it's close.

	We hear the RINGING move from left to right as it passes. So
	far, its has no idea they're there.

	Looking across the clearing, Eric is startled to see

	PAUL AND AMANDA

	are no more than 20 yards away, also hiding. An involuntary
	reflex, Eric calls out...

				ERIC
		Mon! Dad!

	Grant immediately covers the boys mouth. But it's to late.
	The dinosaur has stopped. We still can't see it. We don't know how
	close it is.

	Paul and Amanda spot Eric with Grant. They're a thousand
	emotions at once: relieved, disbelieving, terrified, overjoyed.
	They want to run to him, to yell out to him, but the monster is
	close.

	Grant takes his hand off Eric's mouth. They both stay
	completely silent.

	All this time, the sat-phone is RINGING.

	Than it stops.

	And after an agonizing beat, the beast moves. At first we're
	not sure which direction it's headed, but finally we can tell
	its moving away.

	Once the sail is finally out of sight, Eric breaks from Grant's
	hold and dashes to his parents' arms. They coop him up. Hug
	him, kiss him, their affection unquenchable. He's crying.

				AMANDA
			(reassuring him)
		Sweetheart, you're okay.
			(reassuring herself)
		You're okay.
			(disbelieving)
		You're okay.

				PAUL
		Never had a doubt. Never did. Us Kirby men,
		we stick around, huh?

				ERIC
		We do.

	Looking at her grubby son, Amanda licks her shirttail, trying
	to rub his face clean.

				PAUL
		Honey, there's not enough spit in the world
		for that.

	She LAUGHS. It's the first times she's laughed in two months.

	Billy crosses the distance to Grant.

				GRANT
		We need to keep moving.

				BILLY
		Alan, I want to tell you that I'm so sorry
		about the...

				GRANT
		Billy, I can't talk to you now.

	He walks off. Billy follows him.

				BILLY
		Please, okay? Just yell at me. Call me an
		idiot. An asshole. Stupid. Tell me I screwed
		up because I know I did.

	Grant doesn't respond.

				BILLY (CONT'D)
		I thought if we could get a raptor back
		to the mainland, we could get serious money
		for it. Enough to fund the digging for 10
		years. More. Whatever it took.

	Grant shakes his head, disgusted, But doesn't stop.

				BILLY (CONT'D)
		You have to believe me. I did it with the
		best intentions.

				GRANT
			(finally turning on him)
		Some of the worst things imaginable have
		been done with the best intentions. You
		rushed in with no thought to the
		consequences, to yourself or anyone else.
			(finally)
		You're no better than the people who built
		this place.

	Grant keeps walking, leaving Billy with his guilt.


70	INT. CANYON BUILDING - DAY					70

	The group enters a structure with giant windows designed to
	look into the canyon beyond -- only there's nothing to see but a
	thick fog.

	Toward the center of the room, a spiral staircase that leads to
	a lower level.

	With Billy lagging, Grant approaches the stairs and peers down
	the circular opening in the floor. There is not much to see, just
	fog, a glint of sunlight.


71	EXT. RIVER CANYON - DAY						71

	Step by step, Grant leads the group down a rusty spiral
	staircase below the observation room. The stairs end in a lower
	level. Although we're technically outside, this whole place feel
	strangely enclosed.

	There's a thick fog at this level -- clouds, really -- but far
	below we can see the river. And at its banks, a barge.

				GRANT
		We climb down to the barge and follow the
		river out to the ocean. With any luck, the
		Costa Rican coast guard will pick us up.

				ERIC
		Then we go home?

				AMANDA
		Then we go home.

	Grant leads everyone down a RAMP to --


72	EXT. LANDING - DAY							72

	A catwalk branches off, a SET OF STAIRS continuing down the
	along the canyon wall.

	Grant starts down the stairs. He's only taken a few steps down
	the rusty staircase suddenly

	BREAKS BENEATH HIS FEET.

	Paul grabs him in the nick of time. The staircase vanish into
	the fog. CLANFING AGAINST the canyon wall. After a few more
	seconds of silence, they hear the CRASH far below.

				AMANDA
		You okay?

	Grant nods and looks in the other direction.

				GRANT
		How about if we try this way?

	Their only other option is a precarious catwalk that
	disappears into the mist.

				AMANDA
		Do you think it goes all the way across?

				GRANT
		One way to find out.

	The only way to get his-near-fall is to push ahead. But his
	stomach turns at being so high.

	Amanda follows. The catwalk creaks and groans, listing
	slightly. She freezes mid-stride.

				GRANT (CONT'D)
			(glancing back)
		We'd better do this one at a time.

	Amanda steps of and Grant carefully pushes forward,
	disappearing into the thick fog.

	The others listen to the CREAKING of the catwalk until it STOPS
	ABRIPTLY.

	SILENCE.

				PAUL
		Dr. Grant?

	More silence. Then, out of the fog, a distant voice call out --

				GRANT (O.S.)
		Come on over. One at a time.

	Amanda steps tentatively forwards. Eric is clinging to her.

				AMANDA
		Eric, its okay. You'll be right behind me.

				PAUL
		We're not going anywhere, I promise.

	As Paul holds Eric, and Amanda shares a look.

				Amanda
		We're all together now, Eric.

	Eric reluctantly releases her mother. Amanda starts to cross.


73	EXT. REVER CANYON - FAR WALL - DAY				73

	Grant has stopped at a lateral support across the
	catwalk, trying to get the sense of where they are and what
	purpose this place may have served.

	Seeing that the support beams are brace high arched walls of steal
	mesh, it becomes obvious that we are inside this vast
	construction.

	Amanda emerges from the mist and turns back to the catwalk.

				AMANDA
			(calling out)
		Okay! Come on, Eric!


74	EXT. LANDING - DAY							74

	Eric is next to go across. He's still tentative.

				PAUL
		How 'bout if I...

				ERIC
		No, I can do it.

	Billy and Paul look on as Eric disappears into the vapor.

				PAUL
			(muttering to himself)
		That's it Eric. Nice and easy...


75	EXT. CATWALK - DAY							75

	Eric slowly gropes his way forward. He feels a GUST OF WIND and
	a HEAVY THUD ahead on the catwalk which now sways beneath
	him.

	Regaining his balance, Eric peers forward, but the fog prevents
	him from seeing more than fifteen feet ahead. There is an EERIE
	SILENCE. Eric calls out timidly.

				ERIC
		Mom?


75A	EXT. RIVER CANYON - FAR WALL - DAY				75A

	Across the canyon, Grant moves across the later support. With
	his hand on the railing, he sends a white, hardened substance
	dropping into the mist.

	Looking up, Grant notices a large strut, covered with the same
	substance. Realizing what it could be.

				GRANT
		Oh, my God.

				AMANDA
		What is it?

				GRANT
		A bird cage.

	Then, the sound of Eric SCREAMING.


75B	EXT. CATWALK - DAY							75B

	Eric watches as A LOOMING SHAPE emerges from the fog -- a
	nightmarish vision stalking purposefully forward.

	A FULL GROWN PTERANODON,

	standing over seven feet high, walks upright on clawed feet, his
	thirty foot wings folded bat-like at his side.

	The creature sees Eric and fixes him with a demonic glare.

	Eric CRIES OUT and dashes back down the teetering catwalk.

	The Pteranodon ruses to its feet, spreads its thirty-foot wings
	and flies directly at him.

	AT THE OTHER END OF THE CATWALK

	Hearing Eric's SCREAMS, Paul charges onto the catwalk,
	searching in the fog.

				PAUL
		Eric!

				BILLY
		It won't hold!

	Suddenly,

	ERIC

	emerges from the fog, racing toward his father. And then
	
	THE PTERANODON

	swoops out of the fog, opens its giant rear claws, and snatches
	the terrified boy from the catwalk.

	Paul Kirby watches in stunned, abject horror as the Pteranodon
	carries Eric directly overhead --

				PAUL
		ERIC!

	The flying reptile struggles with the boy's weight. Paul
	watches helplessly as Eric is carried high across the canyon.

	Paul runs back alone the catwalk in a desperate attempt to keep
	Eric in sight.

	Billy stays behind, moving back up the platform to try to
	keep the dinosaur in view. With a new idea, he races back up the
	stairs to the observation room. He has a way to save Eric.

	When he reaches the canyon wall, Paul turns a corner and runs
	along another enclosed catwalk leading deeper into the canyon.

	Grant and Amanda now come pounding down the catwalk trying to
	catch up with Paul.

				AMANDA
			(shouting)
		Paul! Where is he? Can you see him?

				PAUL
			(shouting back)
		I'm trying! That thing took him down this
		way!

				GRANT
		Split up!

	THE PTERANODON

	carries Eric deeper into the canyon. The creature's wings beat
	steadily overhead, and the WIND is fierce. Eric looks down and
	sees the river far below.

	The Pteranodon swoops over an isolated outcropping of rocks at
	the end of the canyon and drops Eric into --


75C	EXT. PTERANODON NEST - DAY					75C

	A large bowl of mud and branches the size of a satellite dish.
	Eric lands right on top of a pile of dinosaur bones picked
	clean. Mixed among is one human skull.

	Before Eric has time to cry out, he looks up to find

	SIX PTERANODON HATCHLINGS

	closing in on him with sharp-edged beaks.

	He picks up the human skull and whips it to the hatchlings.
	They easily duck it and keep coming.

76	EXT. OBSERVATION ROOM - CONTINUOUS DAY			76

	Grant looks up to see Billy leaning out over the edge of the
	observation platform. He suddenly realizes what Billy is about
	to do.

				GRANT
		BILLY! WAIT!

	Billy SHOUTS BACK, an excited-terrified grin on his face.

				BILLY
		I CAN GET HIM!

				GRANT
		NO!

				BILLY
		I KNOW THE CONSEQUENCES!

	Billy jumps off the railing and

	DROPS TOWARDS THE CANYON BELOW.

	Grant, Paul and Amanda watch as Billy FALLS past them like a
	stone, plummeting towards certain death. But then --

	THE PARASAIL CHUTE

	blossoms above him.

	Not only does it slows Billy's descent, but he even manages to
	catch an updraft and begin to rise.

	He struggles to control the parasail, swooping dangerously
	close to the canyon wall, barely avoiding it.

	Up ahead he catches sight of Eric and steers towards him.


77-80	OMIT									77-80


81	EXT. PTERANODON NEST - DAY					81

	Eric struggles to keep away from the hatchlings. But there's
	no way out of this nest.

	Billy SWOOPS overhead, but he's too high to reach Eric.

				BILLY
		ERIC! HOLD ON!

	He circles around to make another attempt.


82	EXT. ENCLOSED CATWAY - DAY					82

	Paul rounds the corner and finally catches sight of Eric in the
	nest, some fifty feet below, fighting off the hatchlings.

				PAUL
		Hang on, Eric!

	Paul sees an outcropping he could jump onto from here. It's a
	big leap, though, he might not make it. He steels himself up for
	the jump, then chickens out.

	Grant and Amanda come up behind him. Suddenly,

	A SECOND PTERANODON

	CRASH LANDS on the catwalk enclosure about them -- right next
	to a gaping hole in the mesh. The catwalk GROANS with the
	extra weight.

	The pteranodon JAMS its head through the hole, SNAPPING at
	them.


83	EXT. CANYON - IN THE AIR - DAY					83

	Billy circles, making his approach.

	In the nest, Eric kicks at the hatchlings, but they're
	undeterred. Billy and Eric will only have one chance.

	As Billy swoops past, Eric jumps and grabs onto his boot. He is
	yanked up and out of the nest. But than, MOTHER PTERANODON
	shoots past, tearing out a piece of the parasail in its beak.


84-85	OMIT									84-85


86	EXT. OVER THE RIVER - DAY					86

	The pteranodon who landed on the top of the catwalk continues to
	SNAP through the hole in the enclosure.

	Finally the reptile's massive weight proves to much, and the
	entire section of the catwalk BREAKS FREE of the canyon wall
	and FLIPS OVER LATERALLY.

	Amanda, Grant and Paul are able to hang on, but so is the
	pteranodon, who now climbs their way.


87	OMIT									87


88	EXT. OVER THE RIVER - DAY					88

	His parasail badly damaged, Billy tries to keep aloft. Heading
	as low as he dares, he yells to Eric --

				BILLY
		Let go!

	Terrified, Eric falls into the river safely. He surfaces,
	immediately swimming to shore.

	Trying to gain altitude, Billy bends hard to the right. But the
	rigging is too badly damaged. He flies right into the canyon
	wall, hitting hard.

	Instead of tumbling down to the river, he finds himself
	swinging from his harness - the parasail snagged on a rock
	spire above him.


89	EXT. BROKEN CATWALK - DAY					89

	Paul, Grant and Amanda struggle to stay away from the
	pteranodon as it moves towards them.

	Suddenly. the far end of this inverted section of catwalk
	detaches from the canyon wall and

	SWINGS DOWNWARD.

	The force of the action sends the three tumbling directly
	towards the pteranodon.

	Miraculously, they manage to avoid its open beak. But they
	are all sent plummeting toward the river below.


90	EXT. RIVER - DAY							90

	They hit the water hard, resurfacing moments later. The
	current is carrying them downstream.


91	EXT. CANYON WALL - DAY						91

	The two pteranodons who were pursuing Billy now land on nearby
	ledges and consider how best to dispatch their prey.

	Billy frantically tries to unhook his harness, but the tension
	is so tight from his own weight that he can't loosen the
	buckles.


92-93	OMIT							  92-93


94	EXT. RIVER BANK - DAY					      94

	Paul and Amanda emerge from the water by the canyon wall and
	find their son hiding behind a rock, searching the skies for
	Billy.

	Amanda takes Eric tightly in her arms, and Paul urges them to
	keep moving. Up ahead, the mesh of the aviary meets the river.

	Wading the shore, Grant now scans the canyon, searching for
	Billy. It doesn't take long to spot him.

95	EXT. CANYON WALLL - DAY						95

	Billy continues to struggle with the harness but to no avail.

	The doomed young man is suspended high up on the canyon wall
	like a modern Prometheus, an entire FLOCK of pteranodons
	gathering around him preparing to peck away his liver. And
	everything else.

	A MAMMOTH PTERANADON has landed beside him and looks him
	straight in the eye.

	The gigantic creature lunges at him. Billy dodges away as best
	he can. The pteranodon's frustrated bite severs a crucial
	juncture on Billy's harness, and Billy is able to wriggle free.


96	EXT. RIVER BANK - DAY						96

	Eric, Amanda, Paul and Grant watch in amazement as Billy is the
	last to PLUNGE DOWN into the river.

				GRANT
		He made it!

	Billy bobs to the surface and spots the group downstream. He
	waves and begins to swim towards them. Soon he nears the shore
	and gets to his feet, wading as he comes.

	Grant, Paul, Amanda and Eric hurry to meet him.

	Grant is overjoyed to see him alive. But his smile quickly
	fades as he sees

	THE ENTIRE FLOCK OF PTERANODONS

	diving down from above in angry pursuit of their lost prey.

				GRANT (CONT'D)
		Billy, look out!

	Billy glances behind him. He races forward, motioning fro his
	companions to turn around.

				BILLY
		Get back! Get back!

	Just then Billy is knocked down by the lead pteranodon. It
	strikes from behind with a brutal, calculated beak to the head.
	Billy stumbles and falls to the ground.

	Grant rushes forward with Paul right after him. Amanda takes
	Eric to safety down river.

	Billy SCREAMS as the ENTIRE FLOCK of pteranodons now swarms
	around him, picking him apart with their beaks and claws.

				GRANT
		Billy!

				PAUL
		It's no use, Dr. Grant. No use.

	Grant can't take his eyes off Billy, whose BLOOD stains the
	water rushing by.

	And now several pteranodons are heading their way. Difficult
	as it is to leave Billy behind, Grant and Paul make a run for it.

	Just as the pteranodons are about to swoop in for the kill, Alan
	and Paul dive back into the river...


97	EXT. THE RIVER - CONTINUOUS DAY				97

	...and resurfaces on the far side of the mesh aviary wall, GASPING
	for air. Just behind them, the mammoth

	PTERANODON

	CRASHES into the mesh. It tears at the steel, actually ripping
	it in one place.

	At the dock up ahead, Amanda and Eric have found a rusty,
	waterlogged barge that's somehow still floating. Carrying a
	tarp-covered cage, the boat was meant for transporting dinos
	up and down the river.

	Amanda pushes them away from the dock as Alan and Paul climb
	on board.


98	EXT. ON THE BARGE - CONTINUOUS DAY				98

	The current takes the craft downstream, letting us get our
	first good look at the incredible
	
	AVIARY.

	It's a vast, domed mesh structure that spans the entire canyon.
	In all, a feat of remarkable engineering and unmistakable
	hubris.

	Catching their breath, our four survivors look at the cage they
	were caught in.


99	EXT. DOWN RIVER - DAY / LATER					99

	Yanking the starter rope one final time, Paul finally gets the
	engine to turn over, PUTTERING along. Amanda is beside him,
	bailing water.

				PAUL
		My own kid was right in front of me and I
		didn't do a damn thing.

				AMANDA
		You couldn't have made that jump.

				PAUL
		I should have tried. It should have been me
		on that beach back there, not Billy.

				AMANDA
		How would you have helped Eric?
			(he can't answer)
		He needs you, Paul. He needs us.

				PAUL
		He could have died.

				AMANDA
		But he didn't. And neither did you. And I'm
		glad about that.


99A	UP ON THE BOW							99A

	Grant is beside Eric, keeping watch, but also feeling the weight
	of Billy's death.

				ERIC
		Do you have any kids?

				GRANT
		No. Although I've studied them in the wild.

	Eric looks over, not sure what that means.

				GRANT (CON'T)
		I have a theory that there's two kinds of
		boys. Those who want to be astronomers and
		those who want to be astronauts.

				ERIC
		I want to be an astronaut.

				GRANT
		See, I was the opposite. I never understood
		why anyone would want to go into space. It's
		so dangerous. You do one thing wrong and
		you're dead. The astronomer -- or the
		paleontologist -- get to study these amazing
		things from a place of complete safety. And
		truthfully, everything you really need to
		learn, you can learn it from the ground.

				ERIC
		But then you never get to go in space.

				GRANT
		Exactly. The difference between imagining
		how things might be and seeing how they
		really are. To be able to touch them. That's
		what Billy wanted to do.

	The barge starts to round a bend. On the bow, Grant and Eric
	are the fist to see something remarkable. Eric GASPS,
	unprepared. We don't know yet what they see.

				GRANT (cont'd)
		I can blame the people who made this island.
		But I can't blame the people who want to see
		it. To study it.

	At the rear of the barge, Paul just now sees what's ahead. Awe-
	struck, he slows the motor and motions for Amanda to take a
	look. And so do we.

	UP AHEAD

	The setting sun illuminates an incredible valley filled with
	dinosaurs. We see armored ANKYLOSAURS with clubbed
	tails. Duck-billed CORYTHOSAURS. We float under the gigantic,
	arching necks of eighty-foot BRACHIOSAURS.

	With the mist from the river and the play of light, we're
	witnessing a kind of primal Eden.

				GRANT (cont'd)
		How's a boy suppose to resist this?


100	EXT. FURTHER DOWNSTREAM - NIGHT				100

	A FULL MOON passes behind clouds. THUNDER quietly rumbles, and
	LIGHTNING flickers in the distance.

	Paul is still at the wheel. The river is narrower here, and
	cautions must be taken to avoid the banks.

	As the barge begins to round another bend. a FAMILIAR HIGH-
	PITCHED SOUND pierces the darkness. Muffled but unmistakable,
	it is the RINGING SAT-PHONE.

	All exchange looks of sheer PANIC, expecting Spinosaurus to
	leap out at any moment. Grant scans the river banks.

				GRANT
		Keep quiet.

	Paul cuts the motor, and time seems to stop as the four stand
	posed for action.

	The barge finishes rounding the curve, and the ringing grows
	LOUDER. The suspense is excruciating until finally...

	Their eyes widen at some horrifying sight, more horrifying
	than anything they've yet seen.

	SEVEN MOUNDS OF DINOSAUR DUNG sit on the patch off treeless flat
	ground just beyond the river bank.

	As our friends consider the sight, an idea comes to them all of them
	almost simultaneously.

	With Eric still in the boat, Amanda, Paul, and Alan jump into
	the river and rush to the bank.


101	EXT. RIVER BANK - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT				101

	The three companions sprint towards the source of the RINGING.

				GRANT
		Find it before it stops ringing!

	And bracing themselves and hocking their breath, they PLUNGE
	their arms into their respective dung-heaps. After a few
	moments of this disgusting search...

				PAUL
		I've got something. I think I've got
		something!

	All turn to Paul. Clearing away the clinging defecation, he
	holds up to a beeper. And still the phone RINGS.

	Returning to their bleak task, they shovel the excrement with
	their arms. Finally:

				AMANDA
		I've got it! I've got it!

	Grant snatches the RINGING SAT-PHONE from Amanda's hands,
	presses a button, and puts it to his ear.

				RECORDED VOICE (ON PHONE)
		You too can own a time share in beautiful
		Guadalajara. Enjoy a meal in one of our four
		star restaurants, explore our coral reefs, or
		just walk on the beach...

	The Kirbys hear the recorded voice and let out a collective,
	heavy sigh. Grant shuts off the phone.

	In all the excitement, none of them notice a fierce horned
	CARNOTAUR right behind them. The giant creature ROARS, ready
	to eat them.

	But as it gets in close, it smells them. Even a dinosaur won't
	eat something that is covered in shit. After a beat, the
	Carnotaur turns and walks away, back into the jungle.

				PAUL
		Can't help but be a little offended.


102	EXT. BACK ON THE BARGE - NIGHT					102

	CLOSE ON the cleaned satellite phone's display. The battery
	level indicator is FLASHING.

				PAUL
		Whatever you do, don't call the U.S. Embassy.
		They won't do a God Damn thing.

				GRANT
		Well, we don't exactly have a Costa Rican
		phone book here, so it will have to be
		somebody we know in the states. Someone we
		can absolutely count on to send help.

				PAUL
			(to Amanda)
		Stan.

				AMANDA
		I wouldn't trust Stan with a snowball in a
		blizzard.

	Paul glares at her. Now Eric notices something odd in the
	river.

				ERIC
		What's that?

	The others look down in the murky water. Just below the
	surface,

	A SHIMMERING WAVE OF SILVER

	passes beneath the boat.

	Then a SINGLE FISH jumps from the water. And another. And
	another.

				GRANT
		Bonitas.

				ERIC
		Something must've scared them.

	Another roll of THUNDER, this time much closer.

				GRANT
		Get the motor going.

	Paul moves the motor and pulls the start cord. The engine
	sputters but won't come to life.

	And now the phone BEEPS. The battery is getting even weaker.

	Grant makes a quick decision and DIALS.

				AMANDA
		Who are you calling?

	But Grant ignores the question. RING. RING.

				GRANT
		Pick up! Pick up!


103	INT. ELLIE'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT				103

	Wearing his jammies, three-year old Charlie awkwardly picks up
	the phone with both hands. He has the mouthpiece next to his
	lips, but the earpiece is hanging out in space.

				CHARLIE
		Hewwo?

	INTERCUT

	Recognizing who it must be...

				GRANT
		Charlie? Charlie. Get your mother. Right
		away!

	A long silence. Charlie bites his lip, looks around.

				GRANT (CONT'D)
		Charlie? Are you there?

				CHARLIE
		Hewwo?

	The sat-phone BEEPS again, this time much LOUDER.

	Amanda and Eric watch Grant, realizing their fate may hang on
	this single call. Paul struggles without success to start the
	motor.

	Then, unseen by the group, a

	GIGANTIC FIN

	rises from the water just fifty yards from the barge. It's
	headed right to them and closing fast.

				GRANT
			(desperate)
		Charlie! It's the dinosaur man! Go get
		mommy, okay?

				CHARLIE
		Okay.

	Not sure what to do with the phone, Charlie makes a logical
	choice and hangs it back up.

	He walks away to his mom.


104	EXT. BARGE - NIGHT [END INTERCUTTING]			104

	Grant realizes he's been cut off. He's about to redial when

	WHAM!

	The barge is RAMMED, sending everyone tumbling. Grant manages
	to stay on top of the wheelhouse, but he loses grip on the
	phone, which falls on deck.

	SPINOSAURUS

	rises from the water, towering over the barge. As lightning
	FLASHES and thunder CRACKS, the dinosaur lets out an ear-
	splitting ROAR.

	It lunges at Grant with gaping jaws. Grant leaps out of
	the way just in time as the dinosaur

	RIPS OFF

	the entire wheelhouse.

							            CUT TO:


105	INT. ELLIE'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT				105

	Charlie leads Ellie into the room. Hands her the phone. Of
	course, it's just a DIAL TONE.

				ELLIE
		Was somebody on the phone?

				CHARLIE
		Dinosaur man.

	Ellie looks at him with confusion, then quickly checks the
	Caller ID box besides the phone. It's international, and not a
	number she recognizes.

							          BACK TO:


106	EXT. THE BARGE - NIGHT						106

	Grant stays one step ahead of the Spinosaurus as the beast rips
	apart the quickly-sinking boat.

	It spits out the wheelhouse and bites down on the stern of the
	boat, ripping off a chunk.

	Grant is heading up to the other three when he hears the sat-
	phone RING.  He spots it, just about to fall into the water.
	Dives for it, answering...

				GRANT
		ELLIE!


106A	INT. ELLIES LIVING ROOM - NIGHT					106A

				ELLIE
		Alan?

	She can hear the Spinosaurus ROAR.

				ELLIE (CONT'D)
		Alan? Alan!

	But he's cut off by a SECOND ROAR, the sound of someone
	SCREAMING.

	And then the line goes dead.

	Ellie pales. Charlie looks at her with a smile.

				CHARLIE
			(imitating)
		Raaaar!


106B	EXT. BACK ON THE BARGE - NIGHT					106B

	Dropping the dead phone, Grant scrambles towards the front of
	the boat and joins Paul, Amanda and Eric, who have taken refuge
	in the dinosaur cage.

	The fearsome beast now lifts the stern of the boat clear out of
	the water.

	The cage SCRAPES across the deck and SLAMS into the gunwale,
	toppling off the barge and

	INTO THE RIVER.

	Grant and the Kirbys are still inside.


107	EXT. THE RIVER - UNDERWATER - NIGHT				107

	The cage sinks. The closest to the door, Paul manages to get out.

	The other three aren't as lucky. The cage rotates as it descends
	and lands on the river bottom with the door side down, trapping
	them inside.

	In the cold murky depths, they pull frantically on the bars.
	Debris and equipment float around them.

	Paul surfaces out of the breath and disoriented. Spinosaurus
	pushes past the boat. If anyone is going to save his family, it
	has to be him.

	And so he dives.

	Pushing with all his might, he manages to tip the heavy
	structure, just enough so Amanda, Eric and Grant can get out.
	Paul himself isn't so lucky.

	Spinosaurus grabs the cage and Paul, throwing both straight up
	out of the water. Paul flies twenty feet away, further from the
	shore.

				AMANDA
		PAUL!

				ERIC
		DAD!

	Spinosaurus is going after the heroic Mr. Kirby, who dives,
	swimming underwater. He's trying to lead it away from his
	family.

				GRANT
			(looking around)
		Up! Up!

	He points to a heavy crane assembly, designed for lifting cages
	off the large boats. Now well accustomed to fleeing on
	command, Amanda sends Eric up first, climbing the scaffolding
	like a jungle gym.

	All the while, they're trying to spot Paul.

	Grant is the last to climb, reaching the first section as
	Spinosaurus returns from the water, SLAMMING into the base of
	the crane. The whole assembly SHUDDERS, threatening to rip into
	the water.

				ERIC
		Where's Dad?

				AMANDA
		Just hold on.

	Try as it might, the beast can't climb the crane. So instead it
	RAMS it, SHAKES it, trying to knock them off. Eric slips, but
	Amanda catches him.

	About to shed his bag to climb higher, Grant finds one last
	hope. It's the resonation chamber model. A beat before he
	decides: It may not be the best choice, but it's the only choice.

	He blows through it, the same EERIE PITCH we heard before. On
	the third try, he's able to approximate the "egg" cry he heard
	the raptors give. He keeps it up, repeating over and over.

	Spinosaurus stops for a beat, confused How this sound could be
	coming from a non-raptor. But then keeps SMASHING.

	We can hear the mounting bolts STRAIN. Soon the whole crane
	will tip.

	But not before a MATCHING CRY is heard in the jungle. Grant
	stops, not certain he heard it. But there it is AGAIN.

	He keeps blowing.

	The crane is close to tipping when a single RAPTOR appears
	from the darkness, CHIRP-BARKING at the Spinosaur, who simply
	bats away.

	But then MORE RAPTORS come. And even MORE. Soon there are
	dozens gathering, circling.

	Grant stops signaling. All three survivors watch with
	horrified fascination, knowing their fate is perilous no matter
	which side wins.

	Looking at his adversaries, Spinosaurus ROARS. And suddenly
	the raptors attack.

	Spinosaurus easily handles the first few, but like ants they
	just keep coming. They climb up his back, slicing, into him with
	their razor-sharp claws.

				GRANT
		Jump! Swim for the far shore!

	All three drop from the crane arm into the water.

	Meanwhile, the fight continues. Spinosaurus rallies, shaking
	off many of the raptors, but they just keep coming. Their
	hooked claws dig in, scraping the meat to the bone.

	Spinosaurus puts up a brave fight to the end, but finally
	collapses, dead. The raptors continue to shred it to ribbons.
	Then one of the raptors looks over to see the survivors
	swimming away.

	But a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush. It goes back to
	its meal.


107A	EXT. FAR SHORE - NIGHT						107A

	Grant is trying to move them along. still headed downstream.
	But Eric won't budge another foot.

				ERIC
		We have to keep looking for Dad. We have to.

				AMANDA
		I know. I know. I want to look for him too.

				ERIC
		then we should...

	She kneels down, facing him. She's just as upset as he is, but
	motherhood carries the burden of remaining calm.

				AMANDA
		Let me tell you a few things about you Dad,
		okay? He's very very very clever, very very brave,
		and he loves you ever very much.

				ERIC
		He loves you too.

				AMANDA
		Okay. He loves us very very much. And I know
		that right now more than anything, your Dad
		would want to know that we're safe. Okay?

	Eric nods.

				AMANDA (CONT'D)
		We're going to get out of this, and
		everything's going to be all right, I promise.

				A VOICE
		Listen to your mother.

	Out of the darkness steps Paul Kirby. Amanda is knocked over
	with surprise. Eric runs to him, nearly tackling him.

				PAUL
		Good thing I've been swimming, huh?

	Amanda hugs him and Eric so tightly they can't breath.


									CROSSFADE TO:


108-109	OMIT								108-109


110	EXT. BEACH - DAY							110

	The foursome sit back on the wide beach, one facing
	each direction, keeping watch. A light rain is falling, but they
	don't seem to notice.

	Trying to keep his boy's spirit up...

				PAUL
		You remember when we went fishing last
		summer? And I was trying to put the boat in
		and the trailer sank? And then the tow truck
		came and tried to pull it out, but it got
		dragged in? And the truck driver threatened
		to knock your Dad's lights out? So I said I
		was the governor and he believed me?

	Eric really smiles, remembering the day.

				ERIC
		Yeah.

	Amanda is smiling too. She had completely forgotten the
	incident.

				PAUL
		That was a fun day.

	To Paul, after some consideration....

				AMANDA
		We should try fishing again.

				PAUL
		You mean it?

				AMANDA
		I do. It's worth another shot. And who knows?
		Things might turn out differently.

	Her hand takes his, gently brushing off the wet sand, fingertips
	touching. It's a small thing, but it's a start.

	Sensing his cue to leave, Grant gets up and starts walking down
	the beach. Eric hurries to follow him. He speaks
	conspiratorially, not wanting to alarm his parents.

				ERIC
		The lady you called, how do you know she can
		help us?

				GRANT
		She's the one person I could always count on.
		And she's saved me more times than she
		realizes. I owe her everything.

	A long beat as they walk.

				GRANT (CONT'D)
		It's strikes me now I never told her that.

				ERIC
		You should.

				GRANT
		You're right.

	As they keep walking, Grant notices something rammed against
	the rocks ahead. It's a speedboat, its hull ripped open from the
	impact.

	And it's not just any boat either -- it's the same Dino-Soar
	boat that was pulling the parasail. Eric hasnt seen it yet, so
	Grant stops him.

				GRANT (CONT'D)
		Eric, do you know what happened to the boat?
		that brought you here? Why did it crash?

				ERIC
		No. I couldn't see.

				GRANT
		Do me a favor. Go back to your parents for a
		minute, would you?
			(pre-empting objections)
		They look worried.

	Eric nods and heads back to Paul and Amanda. Grant forges on,
	approaching the speedboat wreckage. He doesn't know what he'll
	find, but he needs to look.

	Almost reaching his parents, Eric stops. Looks out over the
	ocean, where he sees

	TWO LIGHTS.

	He doesn't say anything for a moment, trying to make sure
	they're real. They are. And they're coming closer.

				ERIC
			(excited)
		Mom! Dad!

	They look up to see the distant lights, just now making out
	full forms...

				PAUL
		Helicopters. Helicopters!

	He SHOUTS with joy. Paul, Amanda and Eric wave their arms,
	making as much motion as possible. The helicopters -- big
	military choppers -- change direction, heading straight for
	them.

	Paul and Amanda embrace, then kiss, the moment getting the best
	of them

	AT THE SPEEDBOAT

	Grant looks in, prepared to see anything in the wreckage. But
	the cabin is surprisingly intact, just a little blood. There are
	three gashes on the driver's seat back. Grant measures their
	spacing with his fingers.

				ERIC
			(yelling over)
		Dr. Grant! Helicopters are coming!

	Grant looks down to the wet sand around him, finding a trail of
	three-toed tracks.

				ERIC (CONT'D)
		We're safe!

				GRANT
			(to himself)
		No we're not.

	THE FIRST CHOPPER.

	flies right overhead. Paul and Amanda are confused, until the
	second helicopter starts to land -- the first on is there to 
	cover them.

	Grant YELLS at the first chopper, trying to wave it away. But
	the noise of the blades is DEAFENDING.

				GRANT (CONT'D)
		NO! STAY BACK! THEY'RE IN THE TREES!

	At the treeline, the upper branches are shaking. At first, it
	looks like it's just the wind off the chopper, but
	something more is happening.
	
	A PTERANODON

	flies up out of the trees, the first of twenty. It's a gorgeous
	and terrifying sight.


110A	INT. FIRST CHOPPER - DAWN					110A

	Terrified, the Costa Rican CHOPPER PILOT veers away, but the
	pteranodons are already on him. They SMASH at the windows,
	grabbing on the skids, The chopper rolls wildly.

	One over-eager pteranodon sticks his head up to high, getting
	decapitated by the blade.


110B	EXT. BEACH - DAWN							110B

	As the second chopper touches down on the beach, Eric, Amanda
	and Paul load in. Grant is running their way.


110C	EXT. BY THE TREES - DAWN						110C

	Meanwhile, the first copper is losing the battle even as it
	climbs higher. The helicopter suddenly tips, falling, SMASHING
	into the trees with a massive fireball.


110D	INT. SECOND CHOPPER - DAWN					110D

	Seeing the explosion, the SECOND CHOPPER PILOT takes off. Eric,
	Amanda and Paul are on board, but Grant is still running up.
	The helicopter passes right over him.

				AMANDA
			(to the pilot)
		You have to go back! We can't leave him!

	Seeing a ladder release by the door, Paul throws the lever. A cord-
	and-steel-ladder unfurls, dragging across the sand.


110E	EXT. THE BEACH - DAWN					   110E

	Grant chases after us, catching a rung just as it goes over the
	water. Behind him, pteranodons are circling the wreckage of
	the first chopper and starting to go after the second.

	Buffeted by the wind, Grant climbs the ladder up towards the
	chopper. A pteranodon flies up right behind him, trying to
	bite. It catches Grant's shoulder.

	Grant spins to the far side of the ladder. The pteranodon goes
	to bite him again, but finds it head caught between the rungs.
	As it tries to free itself, it just gets more entangled.

	The entire ladder starts to lift, caught by the updraft from the
	creatures wings.


110F	INT. SECOND CHOPPER - DAWN					110F

	Up with the pilot, Amanda sees the other pteranodons are headed
	back to the island, unable to keep up.

				AMANDA
		They're not following.

	In back, Paul and Eric get the ladder mechanism to begin to
	retract. It reels Grant in faster. It also reels in the
	pteranodon, which may be caught, but is still plenty dangerous.

	As Grant reaches the cabin, they shut off the ladder engine.
	The pteranodon is still working its way free, pulling itself closer
	and closer.

				GRANT
			(shouting over the noise)
		We have to cut it! Find something sharp!

	Everyone checking the cabin for a knife, anything sharp.

	Finally, Eric hands Grant the raptor claw.

	Grant uses it to rip the line. The fibers break and fray, but
	the pteranodon keeps coming closer.

	Paul throws a wrench at the pteranodon, WHACKING it straight
	in the head. It felt good, and damn if it didn't slow it down a
	little.

	Grant has cut through the cord. He started on the second when
	the pteranodon SNAPS at him, going for his hand. There's
	nowhere for Grant to cut without the pteranodon getting him.

	And idea, Grant very deliberately places in his hand on the line,
	pulling away at the last moment. The pteranodon itself bites
	through the line.


110G	EXT. OCEAN - DAWN							110G

	The pteranodon falls away from the helicopter, catching wind
	just before it hits the water.

	It circles and flies back to Isla Sorna.

	As horrifying as the creature was a moment ago, it's suddenly
	beautiful again. Each motion of its giant wings is a small
	symphony.


110H	INT. COPPER / FLYING - DAWN					110H

	Sitting between his parents, Eric looks back at the island in
	the distance.

				ERIC
		What do you think is going to happen with the
		dinosaurs?

				GRANT
		The population will Stabilize eventually.
		They'll adapt to fit different roles.

	ON PAUL AND AMANDA

				PAUL
		Either that, or the government will firebomb
		it back to the Stone Age.

				AMANDA
		I would completely support that.

	ON ERIC AND GRANT

	looking back at the island.

				ERIC
		I hope they don't. I want to come back
		someday.

	And Dr. Grant realizes...

				GRANT
		So do I.

EXT. OCEAN  DAWN
The helicopter flies away across the ocean, leaving the island behind.

1 	EXT. PACIFIC OCEAN  DAY	1

	A speedboat cuts swiftly through the ocean swells beneath the
	looming cliffs of ISLA SORNA.


2 	EXT. BOAT - DAY 							2

	Illegal Costa Rican parasail operator ENRIQUE CARDOSO helps
	Americans BEN HILDEBRAND and twelve-year-old ERIC KIRVY --
	already wearing life-vests -- strap themselves into a two-
	person PARASAIL HARNESS.


3 	EXT. BOAT - DAY 							3

	Ben and Eric clamber onto a makeshift PLATFORM that hangs over
	the back of the board. Dangling from Ben's neck is a CAMCORDER.

				BEN
		You make sure to get us as close as you can,
		okay? If it's a good trip, I'll give you a 
		little extra. 

				ENRIQUE
		Don't worry. I take you close. But not too 
		close.
			(rubbing Eric's head)
		You don't want them to eat you.

	Enrique heads toward the driver's seat and a large SECOND-HAND
	WINCH bolted to the deck.

				ENRIQUE (CONT'D)
		Ready, amigos?

	Ben and Eric nod excitedly and give the thumbs up. Ben lifts the
	camcorder to the record the action.

	Enrique jams the down the throttle down, and with a loud RAOR, the
	speedboat shoots forward. Soon the boat is whipping across the 
	rolling ocean.

	Strapped together, Ben and Eric lean back over the passing
	water, intently watching for Enrique's signal.

	As the boat picks up speed, Enrique eyes the speedometer.

	Ben grabs the end of the RIPCORD attached to the harness. He and
	Eric braces themselves.

	Enrique finally signals with a pulling motion. He pulls
	the winch, Ben yanks the cord and - 

	WOOOSH! A brightly colored PARASAIL blossoms behind the boat,
	hoisting Ben and Eric aloft. In a big BLOCK LETTERS on the
	parasail is stitched "DINO-SOAR."

	THE TOWNLINE unsold rapidly from its enormous reel.

	BEN AND ERIC climb higher and higher.

	ENRIQUE keeps an eye on the clients. When they reach a certain 
	height, he LOCKS OFF the reel.

	High overhead, Ben and Eric are floating in wonderful, quiet
	splendor. The motor of the boat now sounds strangely distant.

	Down below, the boat enters a think blanket of FOG.

	Eric points excitedly at the islands as Ben films him with the
	camera.

	Then, a sudden TUG on the thing line cause Ben to drop the camera,
	which now dangles from his neck.

				ERIC
		What was that?

	A second tug...and now the faintest of screams.

	Ben and Eric look down to find that the boat has disappeared
	into the low bank of FOG.

	By the time the boat emerges on the far side of the mist...THEIR
	IS NO SIGN OF ENRIQUE. The deck is splattered with blood.

	As Ben considers the driverless boat...

				ERIC (CONT'D)
		Ben!

	Ben glances over at Eric, staring in horror at something 
	below. Following his gaze, Ben finds that their boat is only
	moments away from crashing into A LARGE REEF.

	Sticking out of the water, the imposing reef is being battered
	by waves.

	AS THE BOAT SMASHES INTO THE REEF, it splinters into a
	number of pieces.

	A panicked Ben turns to Eric.

				BEN
		Unclip your line!

	Eric and Ben frantically unclip their lines. Catching an
	updraft, the parasailers float upward.

	A strong wind sends them wafting over the daunting cliffs
	of ISLA SORNA...


4 	EXT. SUBURBAN BACKYARD - DAY 					4

	TWO PLASTIC DINOSAURS enter the frame and do battle accompanied
	by a child's ferocious sounds.

				CHILD (O.S.)

		RRRRROW! GRRRRRR!

	WINDER TO REVEAL -

	CHARLIE, a three-year old boy, plays in a sandbox with his
	favorite toy dinosaurs. ALAN GRANT squats next to him and
	watches with great delight.

	ELLIE SATLER stands over them, an INFANT in her arms -- a
	picture of the perfect family.

				GRANT
		Oh, actually, Charlie, those two are
		herbivores. They wouldn't be interested in
		fighting each other. But these...
			(picking up two other dinosaurs)
		See, these are carnivores. And this one here
		-- see its claws -- this one here uses its
		claws to gouge at the throat of its opponent

	As Grant demonstrates with some GRUNT and GROANS of his
	own, he only succeeds in frightening the boy.

				ELLIE
			(interrupting)
		Uh, Alan?


				GRANT
		Hmm?

				ELLIE
		He's three. Why don't you wait till he's a
		little older?


				GRANT
		Oh, right.
			(back to Charlie)
		Happy dinosaurs.

	He bounces them along the sandbox edge.

	Then, the sound of a CAR ENGINE turning off and a door
	SLAMMING is heard.

				ELLIE
		That must be Mark.
			(calling out)
		Mark, were back here!

	Ellie and Grant turn to see --

MARK DEGLER coming through the gate carrying a briefcase. He's their age, handsome but not annoyingly so, with a friendly,
	balance demeanor.

	He and Ellie kiss tenderly on the lips.

				ELLIE (CONT'D)
		Good day?

				MARK
		Keeping the world safe.
			(re: baby)
		Here, let me take her.

	Ellie hands off the baby.

				ELLIE
		Mark, this is Alan Grant.

				MARK
		Nice to meet you, Alan. I've heard a lot about
		you.

	The two men shake hands, and we now realize it is Grant
	who is the stranger in this household. Little Charlie runs to
	his father, showing his dinosaur.

				CHARLIE
		Daddy, this is a herbabore.

	Grant smiles uncomfortably, a third wheel.


5 	INT. DINING ROOM - NIGHT 					5

	WINDEN to a PARROT in a large cage. Grant is teasing 
the bird with a cookie, holding a it just out of reach.

				GRANT
		What's my name? Come on, Jack, say it. Is my
		name Alan? Say my name.

		The bird doesn't respond.

				GRANT (CONT'D)
		He used to know me.

				ELLIE
		Sorry, Alan it's been six years.

	Grant shrugs, gives Jack the cookie, and heads towards the table.
	The three adults are finishing their dessert and coffee. The
	The children have been out to bed.

	An awkward moment of silence. Uncomfortable smiles. Then --

				MARK
		More coffee?

				ELLIE
			(relived)
		Yes. Great.

	Mark stands and collects their cups.

				ELLIE (CONT'D)
		So, Mark's working at the State Department
		now.

				GRANT
		Really? 
(To Mark)
What do you do there?

				MARK
			(with mock bravado)
		I could tell you about it, but than I'd have to
		kill you.

				GRANT
		Indeed.

	Mark smiles, nodding. Then he goes into the kitchen. Another
	uncomfortable silence.

				ELLIE
	So what are you working on now?

				GRANT

	We have a new site in Montana. At least until
	the money runs out.

				ELLIE
		Anything good?

				GRANT
		Raptors, mostly.

				ELLIE
		My favorite.

	Grant leans forward, realizing Ellie's one of the few people he
	can talk to about this.

				GRANT
		You remember the sounds they made?

				ELLIE
		I try not to.

				GRANT
		We've done cranial scans, and raptors
		actually had a quite sophisticated
		resonating chamber. I have a theory that
		their ability to vocalize is the key to their
		social intelligence. The way they can work
		together as a team.

				ELLIE
		You think they could talk to each other?

				GRANT
		To a degree we never imagined.

	And from the cage in the corner of the room...

				JACK
		Bullshit!

	Both look back at the parrot. ELLIE smiles.

				ELLIE
		You taught him that.


6 	EXT. SUBURBAN STREET - NIGHT 					6

	Ellie and Grant head toward the rental car parked in the
	driveway.

				ELLIE
		Good luck with the fund raising.

				GRANT
		It was never easy, but before Jurassic Park,
		you could find money. Somewhere. Now fossils
		are out. Everyone wants to see a real live
		dinosaur.

				ELLIE
		Times change Alan. But you're the still the
		best. I mean that.

				GRANT
		The last of my breed.

	A long moment passes between them as both consider where
	they've ended up.

				GRANT (CONT'D)
		I'd better get going.

				ELLIE
		Let me know if I can help, Alan. Youre bad
		about asking for help, but please ask me.
		Anything, anytime.

				GRANT
			(deep down knowing he never
			 will)
		Okay. Goodbye, Ellie.

				ELLIE
		Goodbye, Alan.

	Not sure what the right thing to do is, they finally end up with
	a friendly hug. They keep it short.

	Grant gets in his car. Starts the ENGINE.

	He's about to pull off when Ellie knocks on the window. He rolls
	it down.

				ELLIE (CONT'D)
		When I met you, I thought that one day
		millions of years ago, all the dinosaurs
		became extinct. Wiped out. But you told me
		otherwise. When conditions changed,
		dinosaurs changed. They became other things.
		They evolved.

				GRANT
		A well-accepted theory.

				ELLIE
			(simply)
		Alan don't be afraid to evolve.

	Grant hears her, but Ellie knows it didn't really get through.
	A forced half-smile, than Grant waves goodbye.

	Ellie watches as he drives off.


7 	INT. AUDITORIUM - DAY 						7

	The last stop on Grant's fund-raising tour, it's a public
	lecture hosted by some foundation. There are SCIENTISTS and
	STUDENTS here, but also a lot of DINO-FANS, some even with
	costumes.

	Grant finishes his speech to what was a full house -- some
	ATTENDEES are grabbing their coats and sneaking out. This
	wasn't the exciting guest speaker they were all expecting.

	A new slide comes up. Just black and white, and indecipherable.

				GRANT
		It's through the painstaking study of the
		Interior chamber in multiple specimens that
		we can determine this exciting correlation
		between the larynx and the upper plate. That
		lets us theorize -- theorize, mind you -- that
		the raptor might have been capable of bird-
		like vocalizations. Which as you can
		imagine, would be a tremendous breakthrough.

	He's finished, but no one seems to notice at first. Then the
	SYMPOSTUM LEADER stands up, leading a smattering round of
	APPLAUSE.

				SYMPOSTIUM LEADER
		Thank you very much Dr. Grant. Now does
		anyone have a question?

	Nearly every hand goes up. Grant doesn't seem surprised.

				GRANT
		Does anyone have a question that doesn't 
		relate to Jurassic Park?

	Quite a few hands go down.

				GRANT (cont'd)
		Or the incident in San Diego, which I'll
		remind you, I did not witness.

	Now most of the hands are down. Picking one of the few
	remaining...

				MALE STUDENT
		Your theory on raptors is good and all, but
		isn't all this conjecture kind of moot?

	The STUDENT'S BUDDY nods in agreement.

				MALE STUDENT (CONT'D)
		I mean, once the U.N. and Costa Rica and
		everyone decides how to handle the second
		island, scientist will just go in and look
		for themselves.

				TOO-CLEVER SCIENCE REPORTER
		Isn't paleontology itself in danger of
		extinction?

	Recognizing those as fighting words, the symposium leader is
	about to step in. But Grant will take this himself.

				GRANT
		No, and let me be perfectly clear on this
		point. Dinosaurs lived 65 million years ago.
		What's left of them is fossilized in stone
		the actual scientists spend years to
		undercover.
								   (MORE)

				GRANT (CONT'D)
		what John Hammond and InGen created are
		theme park monsters. Nothing more, nothing
		less.

		The class clearly disagrees with his assessment.

				ANOTHER STUDENT
		You're saying you wouldn't want to study
		them if you had the chance?

				GRANT
		No force on this earth or in heaven could get me on
		that island.


8 	INT. DERELICT COCKPIT - DAY 					8

	Looking through the cracked windshield of a junkyard plane, we
	see someone spray painting red circles on the outside of the
	glass.


9 	EXT. AIRCRAFT GRAVEYARD - DAY 					9

	NASH, a wry, intelligent mercenary pilot and soldier, is
	painting huge eyes the windows of a wrecked plane. Finished, he
	tosses the paint can through the open windows and walks quickly
	away from the plane.

	We now see that RED TEETH are painted on the craft's nose. It
	looks absurdly like some angry beast.

	We are one the edge of a dry lake bed, part of an aircraft
	graveyard. Wrecked planes lie all around.

	We hear a phone RINGING...


10 	INT. CARGO PLANE - DAY 					       10

	A RINGING satellite phone rests on a stack of gun cases.

	UDESKY, the leader of this crew, answers it. 

				UDESKY
		Udesky.
			(beat)
		Yes sir. we're good to go. I'll lock it down as
		soon as you drop me the payment.

	With the phone still to his ear, Udesky wanders out of the
	craft...


11 	EXT. CARGO PLANE - DAY 					       11

	Udesky looks over at Nash and COOPER, another mercenary.

	Cooper's the quiet muscle of the bunch, a weapons specialist. He
	finishes loading a massive gun, essentially a hand-cannon. It's
	aimed at Nash's grimacing aircraft.

				UDESKY
		That's right, two of the very best I could
		find. No, I haven't worked with them
		personally, but they come with the highest
		recommendations.

	Then --

	Cooper FIRES at the grimacing aircraft. A projectile rockets
	into the plane and EXPLODES with a fireball.

	Nash and Cooper exchange a satisfied smile.

				UDESKY (CONT'D)
		You've got nothing to worry about, sir. This
		is going to be a piece of cake.

	Pieces of the demolished craft come raining down.


12 	EXT. EXCAVATION BASE CAMP, PT. PECK LAKE, MT - DAY 	12

	CLOSE ON a man's hand, carefully scraping the stone away from a
	dinosaur fossil. We follow his hand back as he wipes off his
	sweaty brow, revealing him to be BILLY BRENNAN, 25, an
	associate professor and site manager. He's a charmer.

	Looking past him, we see CHERYL, 21, a junior at junior of State. She's one
	of a dozen COLLEGE STUDENTS working at the site, and the one
	most smitten with her supervisor.

				CHERYL
		Billy? I don't think I'm doing this right.

	He scoots over, lying down beside her. Checks her work.

				BILLY
		You need to go slowly. See, just take it little
		at a time.

	She's not listening, just watching his eyelashes.

				CHERYL
		I can never tell what's bone and what's rock.

				BILLY
		Technically, it's all rock. The calcium in the
		bones is replaced during fossilization. But
		you can feel the difference. See? Rough,
		smooth. Rough, smooth.

	He runs her bare fingers over the two different patches, showing
	her. After a pause, she runs her finger along his
	stubbly chin...

				CHERYL
		Rough.

	...and along his lips.

				CHERYL (cont'd)
		Smooth.

	Billy may not have started this flirtation, but he's not ending
	it either. It's then that a

	SHADOW

	falls across them. Billy looks up to see...

				BILLY
		Dr. Grant!

	Grant has just returned, a bag over his shoulder.

				GRANT
		Mr. Brennan.

										CUT TO:


12A	EXT. WALKING TO THE MAIN TENTS - DAY 			12A

	Billy takes one of Grant's bags, talking as they go.

				BILLY
		How was your trip? Profitable?

				GRANT
		We'll be broke in four weeks.

				BILLY
		Three weeks. I had to rent some equipment.

	The cross into one of the tents, which only has two "walls". On
	a dust-taped table, a dusty Macintosh is feeing data into a
	strange machine the size of a dorm refrigerator. A mechanical arm sweeps
	back and forth across a tray of fine sand.

				GRANT
		You rented an automated litter box.

				BILLY
		It's a rapid prototyper. I feed in the scan
		data from the raptor skull, than the computer
		breaks it into thousands of slices which this
		thing prints, one layer on top of the other.
		It's the future of paleontology.

				GRANT
		Not if it can't dig.

	The arm stops and suddenly the tray of sand shakes, dropping
	through holes in the bottom to reveal an object the size of 
	a person's fist.

				BILLY
		I give you a raptor's resonating chamber.

	Grant hates technology, but he can't help but be amazed by the
	result. He lifts the strange object up, shaking out the
	remaining sand.

	Billy puts it to his lips and blows through it like a conch shell.
	The resulting SOUND is unique and piercing, the cry of an 
	non-existent animal. Grant is speechless with excitement. And so he
	uses it again and again, producing different SOUNDS and
	variations.

	In the distance, flocks of birds rise to the sky and fly off.

	Billy looks up to see a MAN and a WOMAN getting out of 	
	a Cadillac. Cheryl is pointing them in the direction of the 		
	tent. 									

				BILLY (cont'd) 				
			(falsely casual) 					
		Oh, I forgot to tell you. Some visitors 			
		wanted to come by and talk	to you. I 
told them you'd be happy to see them. 
		maybe even have dinner with them. 						

				GRANT 					
		Absolutely not. 						

				BILLY 						
		They're here. 							

				GRANT 					
		What? 								

	Only now does Grant realize these two people
Who were walking up to them.
Putting on a friendly smile, Billy goes up to them.				

				MAN 						
		Dr. Grant? 							

				GRANT 					
		Yes? 								

				MAN 						
			(extending his hand)					
		Paul Kirby. Kirby Enterprises				 	
			(reaching into his pocket) 	
		My card. 							

	PAUL KIRBY is a talkative optimist with				
	no "off" switch. His wife AMANDA KIRBY, just
as friendly, is harder to read. There seems to be			
	exhaustion behind her eyes. 					

				GRANT 					
		What can I do for you, Mr. Kirby? 				

				PAUL 						
		Well sir, I am a great admirer
of yours, and I have an extremely interesting 
proposition to discuss. Would you let my wife 
and I take you to have dinner tonight? Our treat.					

				GRANT 					
		You know, I've been traveling and I'm very 		
		tired. Maybe some other time. 				

				PAUL
		I guarantee it'll be worth your while.

	Behind Kirby, Bill furtively rubs his thumb and fingers
	together, indicating the guy is loaded.

	Grant musters a weak smile.

				GRANT
		It's be my pleasure.


13 	INT. HELL CREEK BAR AND GRILL, JORDAN, MT - NIGHT 	13

	Theyre only halfway through the entree, but Grant is ready to
	bolt. It's only Billy who's keeping him from being rude. They walk
	over to Paul and Amandas table and sit down.

				PAUL
		First off let me say as a dinosaur enthusiasts,
		Amanda and I have admired your work for
		years.

				AMANDA
		It is truly, whats the word? Inspiring.

				GRANT
		Thank you.

	It's everything Grant can do just to be polite. He desperately
	wants to leave and get back to his dig.

				PAUL
		Amanda and I, well, we just love the outdoors.
		Heck we've been on pretty much any adventure
		tour they can come up with: Galapagos, K2,
		the Nile...

				AMANDA
		We even have two seats reserved aboard the
		first commercial moon flight.

	Billy nudges Grant.

				GRANT
		Hmmm.

				PAUL
		Now, for our wedding anniversary this year
		we wanted to do something really special,
		something...

	He places his hand on his wife's.

				AMANDA
		...once-in-a-lifetime.

				PAUL
		We've arranged for a private airplane to
		take us flying over Isla Sorna. And we want
		you to be our guide.

	The Kirby's look to Grant as if they've offered him an amazing
	gift. But Grant just sighs and smooths the tablecloth.

				GRANT
		That's a very nice offer, Mr. Kirby, but I'm
		afraid I'm much to busy. If you like I can
		refer you to a number of highly qualified...

				PAUL
		No, no, see Dr. Grant, you're the best. You've
		seen these animals in the flesh. No one else
		has come close to you.

				GRANT
		I'm flattered, but I've taken this little
		adventure tour. And with the air
		restrictions they've imposed after the
		incident in San Diego, you cant fly low
		enough to see anything of interest.

	Paul is momentarily stymied, but Amanda rallies.

				AMANDA
		You see, that's just the thing. Paul and I
		have special permission to fly low.

				BILLY
		How low?

				PAUL
		Well, I'm no aviation specialist. But I do
		know it's hell of a lot lower than anyone
		else.

				AMANDA
		From what I understand, it's pretty much
		whatever we want.

				GRANT
		That's hard to believe.

				PAUL
		Let's just say that through my business --
		imports/exports, emerging markets -- I've
		made some friends in high places. In this
		case, the Costa Rican government.

				AMANDA
		Dr. Grant, you don't know how important it is
		for us to have you come along. It would make
		all the difference.

	Grant is trying to find another way to say no, when Paul pulls
	out his checkbook.

				PUAL
		And of course, we're prepared to make a
		sizeable contribution to your research here.

	Billy looks at Grant. Don't say no.

				PAUL (cont'd)
		I can write all kinds of numbers on this
		check. Just tell me what exactly it would
		take.

	We HOLD ON a conflicted Dr. Alan Grant.

		  		  CUT TO:

14 	EXT. SKY - DAY 							14

	NNNNNRRRRRRNNNNNRRRRR...

	A SMALL AIRPLANE - a Beechcraft Kingair 200 Turboprop, to be
	exact - cruises through clear blue skies.


15 	INT. PLANE - DAY 							15

	Grant re-settles, trying to get comfortable. Billy is across
	from him, finishing cleaning his camera lenses before putting
	them back in the ragged case.

				GRANT
		Even with what I pay you, you could get a
		better bag.

				BILLY
		No way. This is lucky. Couple years ago
		some buddies and I went hang gliding off
		these cliffs in New Zealand. Updraft sent me
		right into the side. BOOM!

				GRANT
		That does sound lucky.

				BILLY
		It was this strap alone that saved my life.
		Got caught on a rock as I was falling.

				GRANT
		Reverse-Darwinism. Survival of the most
		idiotic.

	Because he hasn't really said it...

				BILLY
		Listen Alan, I really appreciate you
		bringing me along.

				GRANT
		The bones will be there when we get back.
		That's the nice thing about them. They never
		run away.
			(beat)
		And besides, you got me into this. I don't
		intend to be alone with these people.

	ON PAUL AND AMANDA

	sitting near the front of the plane. Paul draws a long, nervous
	breath and looks at Amanda. She seems just as tense.

	Finally finding a comfortable position, Grant puts his hat over
	his eyes, ready to take a nap.

	Done with his camera, Billy turns to someone just off screen.

				BILLY
		So how do you know the Kirby's?

	and we reveal...

	Mercenary Cooper, the weapons specialist we met earlier. He's
	wearing sunglasses so dark you can't tell whether he's staring
	at you or fast asleep.

	He doesn't answer. Did he even hear? And then --

				COOPER
		Through our church.

				BILLY
		What Religion?

				COOPER
		Uhthe one that worships God and believes in being
		Good. 



16 	EXT. SKY - DAY 							16

	The plane continues onward.


17 	INT. PLANE - DAY / HOURS LATER 					17

	Grant slowly wakes in his chair, groggy. All the other
	passengers are fast asleep. Then Grant turns to his right.

	A RAPTOR

	sits besides him. The dinosaur eyes him curiously, then opens
	his mouth...

				RAPTOR
		Alan.

	And than it STRIKES.


18 	INT. PLANE - DAY 					       		18

	Grant wakes up with a start, disoriented. Billy is leaning over
	him.

				BILLY
	Alan. We're almost there.

	The adrenaline still surging through him, Grant turns and looks

	THROUGH THE WINDOW.

	Clouds obscure the view, than parts reveal

	ISLA SORNA

	rising majestically out of the water.


19 	EXT. SKY - COUNTINUOUS DAY 					19

	We watch the plane descend sharply to the island.


20 	INT. PLANE - COUNTINUOUS DAY 					20

	In various combinations, Grant and Billy, Paul and Amanda look
	out the windows at the amazingly green island.

	Cooper looks out through a window of his own.


21 	INT. COCKPIT - COUNTINUOUS DAY 				21

	Here we find the rest of the crew from the junkyard. Nash is
	piloting.

	A VOICE comes over their radio headsets.

				RADIO VOICE
			(Spanish accent)
		Unidentified aircraft approaching Isla
		Sorna, this is San Juan approach. You are
		flying in restricted airspace. Immediately
		turn to the coordinates two-zero-zero. I repeat
		redirect to...

	A look from Nash then Udesky switches off the radio.


22 	EXT. PLANE - COUNTINUOUS DAY 				       22

	The plane now descends to a mere hundred feet above the
	treetops.


23 	INT. PLANE - CONTINUOUS DAY 				       23

	Paul puts his hand atop Amanda's as they stare intently out the
	window.

	Billy looks to Grant.

				BILLY

		Admit it. You're excited.

	Grant will admit nothing.

	Calling back from the cockpit...

				UDESKY
		Cooper! Yell up if you see anything!

				COOPER
			(yelling back)
		No, I thought I'd keep it to myself.

	Suddenly Grant spots...

				GRANT
		There. There! An Apatosaur. Look at the
		coloration.

EXT. ISLA SORNA  GRASSY FIELD  CONTINUOUS DAY

	An Apatosaur is grazing on the grass.

INT.  PLANE  CONTINUOUS DAY

				BILLY
			(amazed)
		I'm so use to seeing bones. It's weird to see
		skin.

				GRANT
		Mr. and Mrs. Kirby! If you look out the right
		you can see...

	But Paul just waves him away with a hand, staring intently out
	his window. We HOLD ON Grant a moment, thinking that odd.


24 	INT. COCKPIT - CONTINUOUS DAY 				       24

	Udesky puts down his binoculars.

				UDESKY
		South shore is clear. The rest is rock.

				NASH
		Are we on?

				UDESKY
		We're on.


25 	INT. MAIN CABIN - CONTINUOUS DAY  			       25

	Looking out the window, Grant notices they're flying awfully
	low. Just then, he hears a MECHANICAL HUM and a LOW RUSH from
	outside. Now wanting to believe --

				GRANT
		That's not the landing gear?

	Paul, Amanda and Cooper don't respond.

				GRANT (CONT'D)
		What you're...
			(realizing)
		You can't land.

	Paul turns back to him.

				PAUL
		Dr. Grant if you'd just sit tight, we'll
		explain this all in a jiffy.

				GRANT
		This plane can not land!

				AMANDA
		It's going to be all right. Just...

	Grant is out of his seat, heading for the cockpit. He'll wrestle
	the controls if he has to.

	Cooper grabs him, pulling him back. Grant starts to struggle,
	but he's certainly no match. A well-practiced fist hits him
	dead on.

	CUT TO BLACK.


26 	OVER THE DARKNESS 						26

	we hear Amanda's voice, strangely distant but amplified.

				AMANDA
		Eric! Eric! Are you there honey? Ben!
		Erriccc!

	Her calls continue as we FADE UP to...


27 	INT. PLANE - DAY 							27

	GRANT'S P.O.V. -- blurry and disorientated. He finds himself lying
	on the floor of the plane.

	Seeing him come to, Billy helps him slowly get up. Grant's head
	is pounding.

				GRANT
		Tell me we didn't land.

	By his expression, we see Billy would have to lie.

				BILLY
		I think they're looking for someone.


28 	EXT. LANDING STRIP, ISLA SORNA - DAY 			       28

	The jungle has almost reclaimed this patchy vine-covered
	runway. The airplane is parked at one end.

	Nash, Udesky, and Cooper are checking their weapons.

	Amanda is at the edge of the tarmac calling into the jungle on a
	BULLHORN.

	Billy and a groggy Grant emerge from the airplane. Paul trots
	over.

				PAUL
		Dr. Grant, are you alright? I'm sorry we
		had to be so...

	The three mercenaries are now walking into the jungle with
	their guns.

				GRANT
		What the hell is going on? What are they
		doing?

				PAUL
		Establishing a perimeter. Making it safe.
		These guys are really good. One of them was a
		Green...

				GRANT
		Mr. Kirby, trust me, on this island, there is
		no such thing as safe. We have to get back in
		this plane...

	Grant looks to Amanda, who shouts through a bull horn.

				AMANDA
			(on-bullhorn)
		ERRR-IIIC!

				GRANT
		And tell your wife to stop making so
		much noise! We're food to these damn 
animals.

				PAUL
			(yelling)
		Amanda, Honey! Dr. Grant says it's a bad
		idea!

				AMANDA
			(on the bullhorn)
		What?

				PAUL
			(pointing broadly at Alan)
		He says it's a bad idea!

				AMANDA
			(on the bullhorn)
		What's a bad idea?

	As in on cue, there is a DEAFENING ROAR from the jungle.

	Everyone turns toward the sound and freezes.

				PAUL
			(to Alan)
		What was that?

	Grant doesn't answer, still listening to the reverberations. 
Then a couple shots are heard.

				BILLY
			(low)
		Is it a rex?

				GRANT
		I don't think so.

	Billy and Paul breathe a small sign of relief.

				GRANT (CONT'D)
		Sounds bigger.

	Nash and Udesky come RUNNING out of the jungle, headed for
	the plane.

				UDESKY
		We gotta go, now!

				PAUL
		What's the problem? Can't you guys...?

	As Udesky and Nash sprint past Paul in interrupted by a
	second, closer, DEAFENING ROAR. He pales.


29 	INT. PLANE - CONTINUOUS - DAY 				       29

	Udesky waits by the door, hustling everyone inside. Nash
	hurries into the cockpit. Everyone scrambles to a seat. Amanda
	climbs next to Paul.

				AMANDA
		We can't just...

				PAUL
		Don't worry, honey. We'll circle around and
		come back.

	Udesky closes the door.

				BILLY
		What about the other guy?

				UDESKY
		Coop's a professional. He can handle himself.

	A blood-curdling SCREAM echoes through the jungle followed by
	MACHINE GUN FIRE.

				NASH
			(yelling back)
		We're going!

	Udesky climbs into the copilot's seat, and Nash revs the engine.


30	EXT. RUNAWAY - DAY						30

	The plane starts down the runway.


31	INT. PLANE - DAY							31

	The passengers bounce in their seats as the plane picks up
	speed down the overgrown strip.


32	EXT. RUNWAY - DAY							32

	Suddenly, two hundred yards ahead of the plane,

	COOPER

	emerges from the jungle. He stands in the middle of the runway.
	waving one arm wildly. His second, badly injured arm hangs
	limp by his side.

				COOPER
		Come on, Nash. Slow down, buddy.


33	INT. THE COCKPIT - DAY					       33

	Nash spots Cooper, shoots a glance at the airspeed indicator.

				NASH
		Coop, you know I can't do it pal.

	He slams down full throttle in an attempt to reach flying speed.

	Seeing that Nash has no intention of stopping, Paul shouts from
	the cabin.

				PAUL
		What are you doing? That's Mr. Cooper!


34	EXT. RUNWAY - CONTINUOUS - DAY				34

	We are looking down on Cooper from behind. As the plane
	approaches,

	A SHADOW

	falls over the injured mercenary. Then with brutal speed, an
	ENORMOUS BEAST seizes him in its massive jaws and lifts him
	into the air.

	From this angle we get only a glimpse of a long crocodilian
	snout, powerful clawed forearms and spiny sail rising from the
	creature's back.


35	INT. THE COCKPIT - CONTINUOUS - DAY			       35

	All eyes are on the creature as it devours Cooper. Amanda turns
	away in horror.

				AMANDA
		Oh, my God! Paul, my God!


36	INT. THE COCKPIT - CONTINUOUS - DAY			       36

	Looking through the windshield, we see the creature is directly
	in the path of the plane.

	Nash pulls back on the stick. The plane rises.

	The left propeller clips the flank of the enormous
	dinosaur, SNAPPING the blade.

	Blood sprays the windshield and side windows.


37	EXT. RUNWAY - CONTINUOUS - DAY 				37

	The turboprop banks into the jungle, out of control.


38	INT. PLANE - CONTINUOUS - DAY 					38

	The passengers are thrown about as the craft CRASHES through
	trees, tearing off a wing and pieces of the tail.

	Finally coming to rest in the jungle canopy, the plane settles
	in the trees.

	SILENCE.

	The passengers slowly recover and have a look around. Foliage
	blocks most windows, making it impossible to see out.

				BILLY
		Is anyone hurt?

	Checking themselves, everyone seems pretty much intact.

	Still thinking of himself as in charge...

				UDESKY
		Quiet! We're okay. Let's everybody just stay
		put.

	He attempts to turn on the cockpit radio, but it's dead.

				NASH
		Who's got the sat-phone?

				PAUL
		Right here!

	Paul hands the bulky phone up to Nash, who dials out.

	Grant unstraps himself, climbs to the back to the side door and shoves.
	The door opens a few inches before hitting a branch.

	He looks out the and lets out a quiet gasp as the ground reels

	THIRTY FEET BELOW.

	He quickly shuts and latches the door.

	CLOSE ON the sat-phone. pressed against Nash's ear.

				RECORDED VOICE
		We're sorry. All circuits are busy. Please
		try your call again later...

				NASH
		Shit!

				PAUL
		What is it? What's the matter?

	Amanda SCREAMS.

	A huge reptilian face appears in the cockpit window. Everyone
	else SCREAMS now.
	
	The plane LURCHES - and we hear a deep GROWL.
	
	The passengers hold tight, paralyzed. Nash buckles himself into
	his seat.

	Suddenly, the plane is YANKED from the side to side. Battered this
	way and that, the terrified passengers tightly grip their 
	seats.
	
	Finally, the horrible sounds of WRENCHING METAL as the nose of
	the plane is RIPPED RIGHT OFF.

	Nash and Udesky are suddenly sitting in open air. The nose of
	the plane is tilting downwards, the jungle floor far below.

	The passengers hang almost vertically in their seats,

	Debris tumbles out the open end of the plane, some of it
	striking Nash in the head.

	Udesky unbuckles his seat belt and climbs back up into the
	cabin. Nash follows.

	Suddenly, a long snout with dagger-like teeth pushes past the
	cockpit seats, opens wide, and

	CLAMPS DOWN

	on Nash's legs.

	The pilot CRIES OUT in agony. The others passengers grab onto
	his arms, trying to pull him back. But it's no use. The dinosaur
	rips Nash out of their grasp and down the aisle.

	Nash desperately grabs on to the seat cushion, then watches in
	horror as the fabric RIPS AWAY. He's pulled out of the plane and 
	dropped to the ground. A giant foot steps in the way as the snout
	of the creature reaches down and quickly devourers the screaming
pilot.

	It's horrifying sight, but no one can turn away.

	Pleased with the appetizer, the creature comes back for the
	main course.

	Grant tries to force open the jammed rear door. Billy tries to
	help, but the door won't budge.

	The dinosaur JAMS its snout into the fuselage and lunges for
	Amanda in the first row. She yanks her legs back as the jaws
	SNAP SHUT.

	Behind Amanda, Billy reaches forward, UNSNAPS her seat belt
	and pulls her into the next row back.

	The others unstrap their belts and crowd into the rear of the
	passenger compartment.

	The shift in weight sends the fuselage tipping backwards.


39	EXT. JUNGLE - CONTINUOUS - DAY				       39

 	The plane breaks free of the tree limbs and DROPS tail-first to
	the jungle floor.

	It SLAMS hard, then flips over onto its roof.


40	INT. PLANE - CONTINUOUS - DAY				       40

	The passengers are prowled on the ceiling of the plane, dazed
	by the impact. Everyone is cut and bruised.

	Out of the open cockpit, they see two approaching dino feet.

	A window near Amanda fogs over with condensation. when it
	clears, she finds herself looking right into enormous eyes.

	Then all hell breaks loose as the plane is SLAMMED across the
	jungle clearing.

	The passengers are hammered against the walls of the plane,
	tumbling like socks in a dryer. Debris, seats and luggage fly
	everywhere.


41	EXT. JUNGLE FLOOR - CONTINUOUS - DAY			41

	The plane comes to an abrupt halt as it SMASHES into a tree.

	A gargantuan FOOT steps on the fuselage and FLATTENS it like a 
	paper tube.


42	INT. PLANE - CONTINUOUS - DAY					42

	Inside, windows EXPLODE, raining glass over the passengers. As
	the walls compress, Udesky becomes trapped in the rear of the 
	plane, the others in front.

				BILLY
		Over here!

	Udesky dives into the narrowing gap, and Billy pulls him the
	rest of the way through.

	Billy is as terrified as the rest of them, but he thrives under
	this rush of adrenaline.
	
	Then a huge CLAW digs into the skin of the fuselage and begins
	to slowly PEEL the plane open. Grant looks up in dread at the
	widening tear.

				GRANT
		This way!

	Grant leads the group out the open end of the cockpit. They
	make a mad dash for the jungle.

	A tremendous ROAR causes Billy to look behind him. He can't
	help but steal a glimpse of this terrifying, but utterly
	fascinating, animal.

	Grant yanks him forward.


43	EXT. JUNGLE - DAY						       43

	With Grant in the lead, and Udesky taking up the rear, the group
	tears through the jungle.

	Concealed by the dense undergrowth, the unseen dinosaur bears
	down on them -- mowing down the young trees which TOPPLE all
	around them.

	Grant spots a grove of

	HEAVIER TREES

	and leads the group into it.

	The dinosaur cannot fit between the trunks. It ROARS at
	the fleeing humans, searching desperately for a route after
	them.

	The group continues their relentless pace, putting as much 
	distance as they can between themselves and the beast. Paul
	Kirby looks like he's about to have a heart attack. Even Billy
	is gasping for air.

	They stop, thinking they've outrun it.

	Grant directs the group through some underbrush and into --


44	EXT. CLEARING - CONTINUOUS - DAY				44

	Our friends stop dead in their tracks. Amanda stifles a cry.

	Before them lies an immense unmoving SAUROPOD.

				GRANT
		Don't worry. It's dead.

	Then a full-grown bull

	TYRANNOSAURUS

	rises up behind the carcass. It was feeding, its mouth mottled
	with blood and carrion.

	Grant FREEZES.

				GRANT (CONT'D)
		Nobody move a muscle.

	Remember: the T-Rex tracks motion.

	Obeying, the group FREEZES for a few long beats. Then Udesky
	takes off running.

	And T-Rex ROARS.

	Everyone runs. T-Rex is right behind them.


45	EXT. JUNGLE - DAY							45

	Dashing back the way they came, the group suddenly comes face
	to face with --

	THE FIRST MONSTER.

	We now get our first full unobstructed view of the gigantic
	creature, SPINOSAURUS AEGYPTICUS. Over forty feet long and
	twenty-five feet high, the dinosaur has a bony sail along its
	back. Its head is crocodilian with rows of long, curving teeth.
	Sinewy six foot arms terminate in three fingers hands with
	fourteen inch claws.

	Nowhere else to run, the group scatters into the brush as the
	two behemoth predators rush forward, their ROARS thunderous.

	Paul and Amanda scramble into one direction, Billy and Udesky in
	the other. But Grant can't go anywhere - his foot is stuck 
	between two branches.

	He manages to free himself as the two dinosaurs approach.
	They'll have to deal with each other before eating the humans.

	Grant dives down between two fallen trees as the Spinosaurus and T-
	Rex circle one another like gladiators, each searching for the
	other's weakness.

	Laying flat on his back, Grant lets out a terrified GASP as the
	giant foot of Spinosaurus lands across the two trunks mere
	inches from his face.

	Spinosaurus lunges forward, powerful jaw open wide.

	T-Rex sidesteps the assault, its tail knocking down small
	trees as it spins out of the way.

	In the tress, Paul and Amanda scurry again for cover.

	Between the fallen trunks, Grant attempts to get away on his
	hands and knees.

	T-Rex presses the attack, slamming its tail into the flank of
	its adversary. Spinosaurus is knocked back, and Grant is again
	forced to duck for cover.

	As Spinosaurus struggles to regain its balance, T-Rex dives
	forward. Spinosaurus is driven backwards as T-Rex tries to
	grip its throat.

	Amanda yanks Paul out of their path. They Scramble over to
	Billy.

	Now on its side, Spinosaurus fights back ferociously. It slashes
	at T-Rex with its long arms and razor sharp claws, then finally
	kicks the animal with one mammoth foot.

	Tyrannosaurus staggers back, wounded.

	Down below, Grant is splashed by the blood pouring from the
	dinosaur, as he slowly makes his way towards his fellow humans.

	Spinosaurus lunges for the T-rex with gaping jaws and manages to
	topple T-Rex off its feet and sends the falling dinosaur to the
	ground.

	With an earth-shuttering CRASH, the dinosaur lands between
	Grant and the rest of the group.

	The companions scurry out of the way, but as they do so, the
	head of the T-Rex now lands almost directly on top of them.

	Plastered against an immense tree, the group watches in horror
	as T-Rex starts to rise but is thrown back down as Spinosaurus
	latches onto its throat.

	Spinosaurus crushes the life out of its adversary, and T-Rex
	opens and closes its jaw a mere inches from our terrified 
	friends.

	Finally, Grant reaches the others.

				GRANT
		Come on!

	Spinosaurus lets out a victorious HOWL, and the blood-drenched
	professor leads the group through the undergrowth.


46	EXT. JUNGLE - DAY							46

	Winded from running, Paul is caught off-guard as a furious
	Grant slams his back against a tree. Only one thing he wants to
	know --

				GRANT
		Why did you bring us here?

	Paul is too startled to speak. Udesky tires to step in, but
	Grant gives him back a look.

				AMANDA
		Our son is on this island. We need your help
		to find him.

	Still crunched against the tree, Paul pulls out a photo from his
	shirt pocket.

				PAUL
		This is him. Eric. Hes thirteen now. He's
		just about the greatest kid in the world.

	Letting go of Paul, Grant takes the photo, a Sears-style
	portrait of the boy we saw Parasailing at the beginning. He
	shakes his head, disbelieving. He hands the photo to Billy.

	The group splits into two sides -- Paul and Amanda, Grant and
	Billy -- with Udesky stuck between. Dialogue overlaps in
	places.

				AMANDA
		He's with a man named Ben Hildebrand.

				BILLY
		Who's that?

				PAUL
		Her new boyfriend.

				AMANDA
		A friend. We were vacationing. Eric wanted
		to see the island and the dinosaurs, so Ben
		found a guy who would take them parasailing.
		They never came back.

				PAUL
		We called everyone, did everything we could.
		Because of all the controversy over this
		island, no one will step in. Costa Rica says
		it's a no-fly zone, it's their own damn fault.
		Guys at the U.S Embassy -- our U.S. Embassy --
		said we should "accept the inevitable." You
		believe that?

				GRANT
		So you hired these mercenaries.

				UDESKY
		We prefer "recovery specialists." We do
		overseas custody issues and...

				GRANT
			(interrupting)
		Then you duped us into coming here.

				PAUL
		We needed somebody who knew the lay of the
		land. Somebody who'd been to this island before.

				GRANT
			(disbelieving)
		I have never been on this island!

				PAUL
		Sure you have. You wrote that book...

				BILLY
		That was Isla Nublar. This is Isla Sorna.
		The second island.

				PAUL
			(low, to Udesky)
		I didn't know, there were two islands.

				AMANDA
		Still, you have survived the dinosaurs before. You
		saved those kids.

				GRANT
		A few of us survived. A lot more died. And we
		were better prepared and better armed.
			(finally)
		How many days have they been missing?

	A look between Amanda and Paul.

				PAUL
		Eight weeks.

	Grand and Billy are speechless. It might as well be eight years.

				GRANT
		After what you've seen today, you really
		think your son could be alive?

				AMANDA
		He's smart, Dr. Grant. And he knows so much
		about dinosaurs.

	Before anyone else can talk, Grant puts his hand out. He wants
	everyone to shut up while he plans their next move.

				GRANT
		No, I'm sorry, but no. We'll savage what we
		can from the plane. Then we head for the
		coast. There may be a boat left, something to
		get us off this island.

				PAUL
		Dr. Grant, we're not leaving without our son.

				GRANT
		You can stick with us, or you can go and look for
		him. Either way you're probably not getting
		out of here alive.

	With that he leaves, A beat later, Billy follows. He has
	genuine sympathy for the Kirby's, but he's logical enough to
	know Grant is right.

	BACK WITH PAUL AND AMANDA

	They look to Udesky.

				PAUL
		What do we do?

	Udesky is clearly at a loss, but for everyone's reassurance he
	tries to mutter some brio.

				UDESKY
		Well, I think we should start searching for your
son. In the direction they're going.

				PAUL
		Excellent.

	They follow after Grant and Billy.


47	EXT. PLANE CRASH SITE						47

	The five survivors search through the wreckage, trying to find
	anything useful. The task is grim. Mindful of Grant's 
	warnings, they move quickly and quietly.

	Udesky picks up a gun out of the swampy water. The barrel is bent
	almost 90 degrees, unless.

	Billy finds his camera, intact.

	Digging a change of clothes out of his suitcase, Paul steps
	around the side of the plane to change. He's in his underwear
	before he notices Amanda is also there changing.

				PAUL
		Sorry.

				AMANDA
		Nothing you haven't seen before.

	A beat. Amanda looks over as they get dressed.

				AMANDA (CONT'D)
		How much weight have you lost?

				PAUL
		Twenty, twenty-fire pounds. I've been
		swimming at the Y.

				AMANDA
		You hate to swim.

				PAUL
		People change.

	A nod to mean, that's the truth.

				PAUL (CONT'D)
		You look good.

				AMANDA
		So do you.

	They make brief eye contact, which Amanda breaks.

	Around the side, Billy is taking photos of a giant footprint the
	dinosaur left in the mud during its attack on the plane. Grant
	looks over.

				GRANT
		How would you classify it?

				BILLY
		Obviously a superpredator.
			(best guess)
		Suchimimus. that snout.

				GRANT
		They never got that big.

				BILLY
		Baryonyx?

				GRANT
		Not with that sail.
			(Billy gives up)
		Spinosaurus Aegypticus.

				BILLY
		I don't remember that on InGen's list.

				GRANT
		That's because it wasn't on their list. Who
		knows what else they were up to?

	Billy looks past Grant to see Paul approaching. He's struggling
	with the straps on his backpack. turning in circles.

	Billy regards him with suspicion.

				BILLY
		So Mr. Kirby, tell me, when you climbed K2,
		did you base camp at 25- or 30,000 feet?

				PAUL
		Thirty-thousand, I think. Closer to the top.

				BILLY
		About a thousand feet above it, actually.
			(closer)
		Most mountain-climbers remember how tall
		that mountains were.

	Paul knows he's caught.

				GRANT
		There is no Kirby Enterprises, is there?

				PAUL
		There is. I own a place called Kirby Paint
		and Title Plus. We're out in the Westgate
		Shopping Center in Enid, Oklahoma. The
		"plus" is for bathroom fixtures, fireplaces
		accessories, patio furniture. Stuff like 
		that.

				BILLY
		I don't suppose that check you wrote us is
		any good.

				UDESKY
		He paid us half up front. Cash.

				PAUL
		Mortgaged everything we had to do it. Even
		the store. and if we make it off this island
		with my son, I swear, I'll make good on the
		money I owe you. I don't care if it takes me
		the rest of my life.

	Grant and Udesky exchange a dubious glance.

				UDESKY
		However long that is.


48	EXT. JUNGLE PATH - DAY						48

	Amanda, Paul, Billy, Udesky and Grant walk through the jungle.

				AMANDA
		Eric!

				GRANT
		Quiet!

				PAUL
			(loud whisper to Amanda)
		Stop that. Dr. Grant says this is dangerous
		territory.

				AMANDA
		Well we should split up or something. We can
		cover twice the area.

				PAUL
		No, Dr. Grant says...

				AMANDA
		Dr. Grant says this, Dr. Grant says that...

				PAUL
		Well what's the use of hiring an expert if
		your not going to listen to him?

				AMANDA
		Because "Dr. Grant" isn't looking for Eric.
		Dr. Grant is looking for the coast.

				PAUL
		Fine...and when the Tricyclatops comes after
		you, don't come crying to me.

				AMANDA
		Oh, don't worry about that.

				PAUL
		What?

				AMANDA
		Nothing.

				PAUL
		What did you say?

				AMANDA
		Nothing.

				PAUL
		What did you say!

				AMANDA
		Just drop it Paul!

	The Kirby's conversation trails off into the jungle. Udesky
	moves up next to Grant and Billy.

				UDESKY
		If they split up, I'm going with you.

	And as they continue forward, Billy spots something in the
	trees ahead.


49	EXT. JUNGLE CLEARING - DAY					49

	A parasail chute is caught in the branches of a tree. A yellow
	life vest hangs limply from a branch.

	Paul rushes over, unsnags it, and examines the label.

				PAUL
		Young adult.

				AMANDA
		Eric...

				UDESKY (O.S)
		Hey. Got something here.

	All turn to see Udesky holding up a camcorder encased in a
	waterproof shell.

				AMANDA
		That's Ben's!

	She grabs it from Udesky and pops open the housing. She tries
	the power switch on the camcorder, but the battery's dead.

	Udesky pull out a flashlight from his pack and looks to Amanda.

				UDESKY
		Here, give that to me.

	And as Udesky fiddles with the flashlight, Grant and Billy
	consider the parasail.

				BILLY
		It looks intact.

				GRANT
		We should take it with us to signal any planes.

				UDESKY (O.S)
		I think I've got it.

	Udesky has rigged the wires on the flashlight so that the
	batteries can be used to power the camcorder.

	He brings a live wire to back of the camcorder. A red power
	light comes on.

				AMANDA
		It works!

				UDESKY
		I don't know for how long.

	Udesky swings the tiny screen out and pushes play. The others
	crowd around.

	ON THE SCREEEN

	Eric and Ben play frisbee on the beach.

				PAUL (O.S.)
			(excited)
		That's him. Thats Eric!

				AMANDA (O.S.)
		I filmed this the morning they left.

	Ben catches the frisbee, checks his watch and motions to Eric.

	Eric runs over, and Ben puts his arm around him as they run to
	the camera.

	Paul reacts to this image but holds his tongue.

	THE VIDEO SCREEN -

	The image now CUTS to a shot from aboard Enrique's boat
	speeding towards ISLA SORNA -- the start of the movie. Eric
	points excitedly at the island and smiles at the camera.

	We replay the opening moments of the movie from Ben and Eric's
	perspective, soaring high until...

				ERIC
		Ben!

				BEN
		Unclip the line!

	THE JUNGLE -

	A PAN from face to face of all watching this tape with a
	mixture of hope and nausea.

	ON SCREEN -

	Angle again with Ben's legs in the foreground. Falling fast.

				BEN (CONT'D)
		Hand on! Hang on buddy!

	Now the camera penetrates the jungle canopy and the picture
	and sound become complete chaos: SCREAMS from the both,
	branches BREAKING, flashes of Ben and Eric's frightened faces
	as the camera is buffeted in all directions.

	With a lurch the terrifying descent in finally over, and the
	jungle floor is just ten feet away, swaying back and forth
	beneath Ben and Eric's feet.

				BEN (CONT'D)
		Are you ok, buddy?

	There's GURGLING to his voice. Ben may be more hurt than he's
	letting on.

				ERIC
			(through his sobs)
		I don't know. I think so.

				BEN
		We're okay. It's going to be okay. Here, get
		ready. I'm going to unhook you.

	The sound of PUMPLING is followed by the sight of Eric DROPPING		
	into the frame, landing on the ground rolling. He stands and
	looks back up at Ben.

				ERIC
		I'm all right

				BEN (O.S)
			(weaker)
		We're going to get out of this, pal.

	And on that, the power and picture fade away.

	BACK ON PAUL AND AMANDA - overjoyed.

				PAUL
		See? He's okay. He's alive! Everything's
		going to be all right now.

	Amanda brings a hand to her mouth, silently nodding her head.

	Grant and Billy exchange a dubious look, than begin pulling the
	parasail out of the tree. As they do so, the sail gets caught on
	a branch.

	They pull harder. The branch bends, but the sail won't come
	loose. One last tug and than, SNAP. The branch breaks, the chute
	falls away to reveal

	A SKELETON.

	It swings down directly at Amanda. She SCREAMS.

	Finally, the others are able to pull her away. As they untangle
	the lines, the men are able to get the first view of the remains
	of Ben Hillenbrand, still caught in his harness.

	Amanda's knees buckle. Regaining her balance, she runs off into
	the jungle.

	Paul quickly follows.

				PAUL (CONT'D)
		Amanda!


50	EXT. THICKNESS - DAY						50

	Reeling, Amanda comes to a stop in an area with thick
	undergrowth. It's danger here, very still and quiet.

	She tries to calm herself, but each effort to suppress just
	makes her more emotional. She's surprised as Paul wraps an arm
	around her to comfort her. But she doesn't fight it.

				PAUL
		I'm sorry Amanda. I am. And I'm sorry for
		the things I said about him.

				AMANDA
		No, it's...

				PAUL
		I know you liked Ben. I had no right to...

				AMANDA
			(frustrated)
		Its not about him. It's Eric. He's alone out
		here somewhere. Our baby is all alone.

	Saying it aloud, the reality sinks in for both of them

				AMANDA (CONT'D)
		I guess I was hoping that with Ben around,
		there'd be someone to keep him safe.

	Checking in on clients, Udesky stops at the edge of the
	thicket. Something raises the hairs on the back of his neck.

				UDESKY
		Dr. Grant!

	He nods for the others to take a look at this. They head over,
	Grant at the rear.

	As he approaches, Billy is packing up the rest of the chute in a
	backpack. He stops short from what he sees.

	Looking down, we CIRCLE across the jungle floor. Here we find a
	strange, hollowed-out construction made of sod and branches.
	Maybe six feet around.

	Just now noticing the others' stare, Paul looks down into one
	of the bowls at his feet, a half-buried nest. It's filled with
	football-sized eggs, laid in a spiral.

	And this isn't the only nest. Amanda counts twelve in all, laid
	out in an oddly symmetrical pattern.

	The last to arrive, Grant identifies the species in a horrified
	instant.

				GRANT
		Raptors.

And as he says the words, off in the distance, we hear
	the cry of some herbivores, around by the chorus of
	snarls.


							SMASH CUT TO:

51	EXT. FUTHER IN THE FOREST - DAY				51

	The party blasts through the forest, trying to keep up with
	Grant. They haven't even had time to ask --

				AMANDA
			(to Paul)
		Whats a raptor?

	Paul has no idea.

				UDESKY
		They don't look that big. I mean,
		comparatively.

				GRANT
		If we came across one, we might live.

				PAUL
		Well that's good.

				GRANT
		But you never came across just one.

	From the back --

				AMANDA
		Wait! Where's Billy?

	They all stop. The only one not there is --

				Grant
		Billy! Billy!

				AMANDA
			(almost sotto)
		I thought we weren't suppose to yell.

				BILLY (O.S)
		Here!

	He comes in from the left. Excited, he explains to Grant --

				BILLY (CONT'D)
		I got some great pictures of the nest. You
		know this proves raptors raised their young
		in colonies.

	Furious with his student. Grant just keeps moving. There's no
	time to stand around and argue.

				BILLY (CONT'D)
		This speaks to a larger social structure, the
		possibility of Darwinian altruism. It
		changes everything.

	A beat. Trying not to sound presumptuous --

				BILLY (CONT'D)
		We could co-write a paper.

				GRANT
		Ah yes, the first rule of academics. Publish
		or perish.


52	SCENE PREVIOUSLY OMITTED					52


53	EXT. RIDGE - DAY (HOURS LATER)					53

	Much fatigued, the five now mach upward towards a crest.

	Panting and flushed, they reach the top of the ridge and gaze
	into the distance.

	A jungle valley stretches before them. Not far off in A VAST
	COMPOUND - comprised of several buildings. One building alone
	seems to cover several acres.

	The weary group breathes a sigh of relief.

				PAUL
		I bet there's a very good chance Eric's in
		there. I'd bet my bottom dollar.

	Udesky and Grant share dubious looks and continue down into
	the valley.


54	EXT. INGEN COMPOUND - DAY					54

	The group emerges from the jungles and enters the compound.
	They walk through an overgrown parking lot, littered with
	abandoned vehicles. Some are lying on their side. Others are
	overturned completely.

	They're not going to be driving anywhere.

	A troubled Grant peers through a windshield, partially caved
	in, like some giant head butted the glass. (Think back to Lost 
World)

	And the group finally approaches the front doors of an
	enormous building. As they head up the front steps, we see
	something in the distance behind them:

	CAT-LIKE MOVEMENTS

	on the high ridge. To fast to see what it was. But too ominous
	to dismiss.


55	INT. BUILDING LOBBY - DAY					55

	Our friends now find themselves in a sparse, one quietly
	opulent corporate lobby now in the process of being reclaimed
	by the jungle/ Roots and ivy poke through the floor and walls.

	In the waiting area, the cushions of a sofas and chairs have been
	gnawed at and pulled apart. Dusty coffee mugs and filled
	ashtrays lie on the table. The water has turned brackish in a
	near by cooler.

	Sudden FLAPPING. We look up and see BIRDS nesting in the
	rafters. It is an eerie, haunted place.

				PAUL
			(calling out)
		Eric! Are you here?

				AMANDA
		Eric!

	All listen for a response. Nothing. Paul and Amanda exchange a
	despondent look.

	Sitting on the reception counter is an official-looking
	telephone. Everyone has the same thought, but no one dares.
	Finally -

				AMANDA (CONT'D)
		What the hell.

	Amanda puts the receiver to her ear. Nada.

	With Grant in the lead, they head deeper into the building.

	Unseen by the group, a fleeting SHADOW flits across the lobby's
	dirty windows with terrifying speed.


56	INT. CORRIDOR - DAY						56

	A couple vending machines stand at the one end of this long
	hallway covered with vines.

	Paul notices them and pulls change from his pocket.

				PAUL
		Let's see. I've got about a dollar seventy-
		five. How about you guys?

	Billy SMASHES IN the window of one machine with his boot.
	Picking through the glass, he pulls out some candy bars and
	chips. He checks the expiration date. 	


	CONTINUED:								56

				BILLY
		Thank God for preservatives.

	He tosses the food to the others.

	Paul now turns to his own vending machine and SMASHES it with
	his heal. The glass refuses to break.


57	INT. HATCHING LABORATORY					57

	Grant and Billy push through a set of doors to see
	
	A CAVERNOUS HATCHING FACILITY

	filled with much of the same equipment we recognized from the
	first island, although the sheer size of this place dwarfs any
	of the facilities seen previously.

	As the group walks down the ramp and onto the floor, they begin to
	absorb the incredible array of technology: enormous cryonic
	freezer, their plug pulled years ago; empty incubators; tanks
	of formaldehyde with dinosaur fetuses and body parts.

	Machines with intricate tubing and wing arms stand beside
	conveyer belts cris crossing the room at different levels.

				AMANDA
		This is how you make dinosaurs?

				GRANT
		This is how you play God.

	Billy looks around the lab. He can't help but be impressed.

				BILLY
		Okay if I take pictures?

	Grant nods.

	Billy sets his lucky camera back down on the worktable. Two years
	from now, astute observers of the DVD will not that Billy
	doesn't actually take his camera from the bag; he was carrying
	it because there wasn't any room inside.

	Billy pulls a new roll of film from the bag and zips it shut.

	ACROSS THE LAB

	Amanda is passing a large cylindrical tanks with half-formed
	embryos floating in formaldehyde -- genetic experiments gone
	awry. Finally she reaches

	A GIGANTIC MANIFIED RAPTOR HEAD

	floating in the one tank.

	Something about this specimen catches Amandas attention. She
	bends forward, getting very close to the glass. She peers right
	into the eyes of the nightmarish creature. Then --

	AN ACTUAL RAPTOR

	lunges at her form behind the tank. She SCREAMS.

	Fortunately the raptor can't get between the closely spaced
	tanks. Amanda runs.

				PAUL
		Amanda!

				GRANT
		Back out! Move!

	And as the group races through the lab the Raptors find a
	larger gap between the tanks.


58	INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS - DAY				58

	Paul leads the way, checking the door for possible escape
	routes or hiding places. Twenty feet behind,

	THE RAPTOR

	rounds a corner, bolting after them. Paul ducks in the closest
	door.

				PAUL
		In here!


59	INT. DINO KENNEL - CONTINUOUS - DAY				59

	The group slams the door behind them and quickly takes in the
	room.

	There are several rows of oversized steel cages, apparently
	used for containing young dinosaurs. Many of the cage doors are
	standing open.

	The group races down a lone aisle. Close behind, the raptor
	BURSTS into the room, ROARS.

	As the Raptor gains ground, Udesky and Billy run into one of the
	open cages, SLAMMING the door behind them.

	Grant, Paul and Amanda duck into another. Before they can
	swing the cage door shut behind them, however, the raptor SLAMS
	into it, driving the door into the cage.

	They are forced back against a chain-like wall, trapped in a
	small triangle space by the advancing door. The angry
	Raptor is now inches away through the cage door.

	Then, suddenly, the raptor looks up. We follow its gaze. The top
	of their triangular enclose is wide open.

	The eager raptor climbs up the chain-like door. Catching the
	tail of an idea, Amanda grabs the door and nods to the others.

				AMANDA
		Push!

	They push hard on the cage door, swinging it and the raptor
	right through the opening of the cage.

	Now the raptor is trapped in a small triangular space, the door
	going right to the ceiling.

	Amanda slides the door's bolt through the chain like wall,
	temporarily trapping the dinosaur.

	The raptor struggles desperately, GRAWLING AND SNARLING, but
	the cage door seems to be holding.

	As everyone rushes back to the door.

	The raptor begins to make a LOW, HAUNTING MOAN.

	As the others head for the door, Grant lingers a step, listening
	to the beast's simple melodic cry. It has the same tones as
	came from the model resonating chamber.

				GRANT
		She's calling for help.


60	EXT. COMPOUND - DAY						60

	The group exits the rear of the lab building and finds itself in
	a large equipment yard. The CALL of the raptor is still audible
	as they head for the tree line.

	Now they moan is ANSWERED from distant jungle quarters.

	The responses quickly MULTIPLY. To the group's dismay, they
	soon find themselves virtually SURROUNDED by raptor CRIES both
	distant and near.

	Grant looks around with amazement. It's vindication of his
	theory on raptor communication, but it couldn't come at a worse
	time.

	Responding to the growls, a herd of grazing HADROSAURS suddenly
	flees across the open space. Then, in the distance behind the
	herd

	A PACK OF RAPTORS

	emerges from the jungles, coming their way.

				GRANT
		Head for the trees!

	From the lab building, the raptor we left imprisoned now BURSTS
	out one of the doors and HOWLS to the pack -- the same cry we
	heard in the lab.

	The raptor pack moves into the hunting formation. One ALPHA-MALE
	RAPTOR. slightly larger than the others, leads the charge up the
	middle.

	Grant risks a looks back. But doesn't stop running.

				GRANT (cont'd)
		THIS WAY!

	In an effort to escape the oncoming raptors, Grant leads the
	group right into the stampeding heard of hadrosaurs.

	Suddenly, all is chaos. Hadrosaurs race past, splitting up the
	group.

	Letting the others get ahead of him, Grant looks back. Much to
	his dismay, the raptors are ignoring the hadrosaurs.

	Indeed, the pack weaves its way through the herd -- the raptors
	only want them.

	In the chaos of the stampede, everyone loses sight of each other.

	Up ahead, Billy trips and falls. As he rolls the strap on his
	camera bag breaks. He doesn't notice it's missing until he's
	already back on his feet and running.

	Amanda and Paul keep close to each other. Further back, Grant
	spots Billy's fallen camera back. He grabs it as he runs past.

	Looking back, Billy sees that Grant now has his back...

				BILLY
		ALAN!

				GRANT
		KEEP GOING!

	They lose sight of each other in the rush.


61-19	OMIT									61-69


69A	EXT. EDGE OF THE JUNGLE - DAY					69A

	As the hadrosaurs WHIP PAST, Paul and Amanda climb up into a
	tree. A raptor leaps at Paul, barely missing his leg.

	Trying to pull Paul up, Amanda nearly loses her balance. This
	time, Paul catchers her.

	Billy climbs up a nearby tree of his own in sight of Paul and Amanda.

	Udesky has nearly reached a tree of his own when he finds
	himself

	HEADED OFF

	by a raptor. He turns to the other way, but finds

	THERE ARE MORE RAPTORS.

	He picks up a fallen branch as these dinosaurs cautiously
	approach. Not more than a few feet away, the leader of the trio
	stops, peering at him.

	Udesky swings hard, but the dinosaurs feints. From behind him,
	another raptor slashes at the back of his legs, severing his
	muscles. Udesky CRIES OUT and drops to the ground.

	IN THE TREETOPS

	Paul, Amanda and Billy can hear him.

				PAUL
		Udesky.

				AMANDA
			(Listening)
		He's this way.

	From here, the thick branches overlap, forming a kind of
	"second floor" above the ground. It's not easy, but you can move
	from branch to branch, tree to tree.

	ON THE FLOOR

	Unable to walk, Udesky attempts to crawl away from the animals.
	The effort clearly causes him great pain. Strangely, the
	raptors suddenly don't seem interested in him anymore.

	Rather, they're "talking" among themselves. Udesky is amazed to
	find him self still alive.

	Suddenly, one of the raptors SLASHES at him again. But it's
	delicately not a mortal blow, just a very painful one. Udesky
	CRIES OUT, louder this time.

	IN THE TREES

	Hearing the new cry, Paul, Amanda and Billy move faster, now
	finally seeing Udesky on the ground. He's face-down, barely
	moving but still MOANING.

	The raptors are gone.

	In the lead, Amanda starts to climb down. But Paul grabs her,
	holds her back.

				PAUL
		It's not safe.

				AMANDA
		We have to help him.

				BILLY
		He's right. A predator wouldn't leave a kill
		wounded.

				AMANDA
		He's not a kill, he's still alive.

	She breaks from Paul's grip and drops to the ground. She's only
	a foot away from the tree when

	ALL FOUR RAPTORS

	lead out from their hiding places. They almost catch her as
	Billy and Paul pull her back up on the limb

	The raptors stare up at them, angry their plan didn't work.

				PAUL
		They couldnt climb up, so they were trying
		to get us to come down.

				BILLY
		They set a trap
			(amazed)
		They actually set a trap.

	Bored with waiting, the raptors go back to finish off Udesky,
	making a meal out of it. Up in the branches, the survivors are
	horrified and sickened.

	Then, from the deep in the forest, a new RAPTOR CRY. The feasting
	raptors look up, listening, then suddenly run off into the dark
	jungle.

				PAUL
		Where's Grant?


69B	EXT. ELSEWHERE IN THE JUNGLE - DAY				69B

	Climbing higher in a tree, Grant is just feet above a growing
	pack of raptors. He scales one branch, the next, finally
	reaching a perch that the dinosaurs can't jump to.

	LOOKING DOWN

	The entire pack is now standing still, watching him. In the
	center, the Alpha Male lets out a sort of BARK. Responding to the
	cry, the other raptors CALL BACK.

	As terrified as he is, he can't help but be fascinated by their
	communication. Like a hellish bird song, there's a rhythm to it,
	a structure. They're clearly talking about something.

	Under his breath, Grant is able to mimic its patterns.

				GRANT
		What does that mean? What are you saying?

	Of course they can't answer. They just keep using the same
	"phrase."

	Ready to ditch Billy's camera bag in order to climb higher --
	he's had to hold it by the strap -- Grant finds his hand covered
	with a runny slime. He looks down at the camera bag, and that's
	the source. It's oozing out the bottom.

	He unzips the bag to find

	A BROKEN RAPTOR EGG

	inside, the white and green yolk still dripping from the pieces
	of the shell. There's another intact egg beside it.

	This is what the raptors where chasing.

				GRANT (CONT'D)
		God damn you, Billy.

	Ever the scientist, Dr. Grant tests a theory even in the face of
	danger: he holds up the intact egg so that the raptors can see it.
	They suddenly go crazy, howling the same phrase but LOUDER.

				GRANT (CONT'D)
		It means, "Give us the egg," doesn't it? "We
		want the egg."

	He gently drops the bag to the ground. Although the raptors are
	interested, pulling out the unbroken egg, they're still by no means
	placated. The song may have changed, but they still want Grant
	dead.

	They begin to jump at him, eventually, hopping up on each
	others backs. It's only a matter of time till they reach him.

	Grant moves to climb higher, but sees no branches he can reach.
	And than he hears the low CREAKING. A CRACK. The branch he's
	on is starting to give in.

	He looks down at the face of his enemies, knowing he'll be
	their next meal. And then,

	A SMALL CANISTER

	lands at the base of the trees, immediately SPRAYING out a thick
	cloud of oily fog. It's the first of

	FIVE CANISTERS

	that land in the area, creating a thick cloud. It's not just
	smoke though something far more caustic.

	As it hits the raptors they immediately recoil, those closest
	to the canisters SHRIEKING in pain. Tumbling in the dirt.
	There may be a pheremonal element to the mist as well -- they
	seem panicked, disoriented.

	Pack mentality takes over, and after the first ten raptors take
	off running, so do the rest, some tripping over their feet
	blindly.

	This may be dino-tear gas, but it's not good for humans either.
	Up in the tree, Grant's eyes immediately burn from the vapor
	He squints to see through the fog, where he spots

	A HUMAN SHAPE

	at the edge of the smoke

				VOICE
		Come on! They'll be back!

	Grant half-climbs, half-falls out of the tree, rushing to get
	through the heaviest of the smoke.

	A SMALL DIRTY HAND

	grabs his, pulling him along.


69C	EXT. JUNGLE - LATE DAY						69C

	Eyes swollen from the gas. Grant stumbles, barely able to see as
	the other person pulls him along. It's only now we can identify
	his rescuer as

	ERIC KIRBY,

	the boy he was brought to rescue. A lot has changed in the last
	eight weeks. It's not just dirt and muck -- he's the filthiest
	child you've ever seen -- something primal has come out in him.

	Something wild.


69D	EXT. INGEN COMPOUND - TWILIGHT				69D

	On the far side of the tipped over vehicle, Eric pulls open a
	hatch -- his hiding place. The door opens part way.

	Eric motions for Grant to follow.


69E	INT. INSIDE THE BUNKER - TWILIGHT				69E

	Squeezing in sideways -- it's very tight fit -- Grant finds
	himself in a space no bigger than the inside of a Datsun. lit by
	a small battery-powered lantern. This is where Eric has been
	hiding.

	The minute Grant's inside, Eric goes back to work re-sealing
	the door. This 13-year old boy has become astonishingly
	efficient at staying alive.

				GRANT
		Eric...

	The boy holds up a hand. He listens for a moment. He doesn't
	hear anything outside.

				GRANT (CONT'D)
		Eric, your parents are both here.

				ERIC
		In Costa Rica?

				GRANT
		On the island.

	Eric truly can't believe it. He hoped to be rescued but...

				ERIC
		They'll never make it. I mean, they can't
		manage when the cable goes out.

				GRANT
		You'd be surprised what people can do when
		they have too.

	Eric studies his guest, finally certain he recognizes him.

				ERIC
		You're Alan Grant, aren't you?
			(off surprised reaction)
		I read both of your books.

				GRANT
		Which one do you prefer?

				ERIC
		The first one. Before you where on the island.
		You liked dinosaurs back then.

				GRANT
		Back then, they hadn't tried to eat me.

	Grant takes a better look around Eric's tiny hideaway,
	impressed with what he's been able to scavenge. Among the many
	items we see another smoke canister, some battery-powered
	lanterns and lots of candy wrappers. This kid's been living on
	chocolate for weeks.

				ERIC
		When InGen cleared out, they left a lot of
		stuff behind.

				GRANT
		Any weapons, radios?

	Eric pulls up a long cattle prod to show Grant.

				ERIC
		Found this, but the battery's dead.

				GRANT
		It's a wonder you aren't. I'm amazed, Eric. I 
		barely lasted 30 hours. You lasted eight
		weeks.

	The line catches Eric strangely. It's the first moment of true
	emotion we've seen him in.

				ERIC
		Is that all it's been? I thought it was longer.

				GRANT
			(trying to be positive)
		The important thing is we both made it.
		That's something we have in common.

	Eric rips into a candy bar. After a moment, he realizes he
	should offer one to his guest as well.

	Grant takes it. A lone beat. Than, Grant just has to know...

				GRANT (CONT'D)
		Did you read Malcolm's book?

				ERIC
		Yeah.

				GRANT
		What did you think?

				ERIC
		I dunno. I mean, it was kind of preachy.
		Chaos-this, chaos-that. And like, to me, the
		guy seemed kind of high on himself.

	Grant smiles.

				GRANT
		That's two things we have in common.


69F	EXT. TREETOPS - NIGHT						69F

	The trio is where we left them, perched up in the branches.
	They're far from safe, but nothing's after them for a
	while.

	In Billy's eyes, we can see a storm of guilt raging. But he
	hasn't said anything. Won't say anything.

				AMANDA
		We can't just stop looking. Eric and Dr.
		Grant are out there somewhere.

				PAUL
		I want to find them too, but we can't do a bit
		of good right now. For every scary thing we
		saw in the daylight, I'll bet there ten times
		more of 'em at night.
			(to Billy)
		Am I right?

				BILLY
		I dont know.

				PAUL
		I thought you were an expert.

				BILLY
		Dr. Grant was.

				AMANDA
		Well Dr. Grant isn't here, so we're going to
		have to figure out what to do ourselves.

	Amanda is impressed by her own determinations. A long beat.

				AMANDA (cont'd)
		So what do we do?

	No one has the faintest clue.


69G	EXT. DEEP IN THE FOREST - NIGHT					69G

	VARIOUS SHOTS; The creatures of Isla Sorna walk past in the
	shadows, some looking up at the light in the trees.

	Suddenly, one of the creatures is attacked by another. We hear
	ROLLING, SNARLING, HISSING, just seeing the outline of the
	fight. Just as fast as it began, the fight is over, the winner
	snakes on the loser.


69H	EXT. TREETOPS - NIGHT (LATER)					69H

	Everyone's moved to different branches, trying to settle in for
	the night. Paul keeps looking over to the tearful Amanda, about
	to say something. He finally does.

				PAUL
		I just want you know, Amanda. It's not
		your fault what happened.

	Amanda looks over, not sure what his absolution.

				PAUL (cont'd)
		Eric has always been headstrong, and you
		throw Ben Hildebrand into the mix and well...

				AMANDA
		Well what?

				PAUL
		Well damn it. I don't speak ill of the dead.
		What I'm trying to say is, its was just a crazy
		accident. The exact same thing could have
		happened if he was with me. You can't go
		beating yourself up about it.

	Realizing he's trying his best, Amanda cant stay angry with
	him.

				AMANDA
		This wouldn't happen if he was with
		you. I mean, you drive five miles below the
		speed limit. I totaled three cars in fives
		years.

				PAUL
		That one time was just the bumper.

				AMANDA
		He would have been, safe. Completely,
		entirely, suffocatingly safe.
			(beat)
		I would have him to see more of the world than
		Enid, Oklahoma. I wanted to see more of the
		world than Enid, Oklahoma. And so yes, it's
		my fault that this happened. I'm sorry that
		you have to be here.

	Really looking at her...

				PAUL
		I'm not sorry at all.


69I	EXT. INGEN COMPOUND - DAY					69I

	Morning on Isla Sorna. A low mist hangs tight to the forest
	floor as Eric seals up his hideaway for hopefully the last time.

	They start walking. Eric pulls something out of his pocket,
	shows it off to Grant.

				ERIC
		Know what this is?

				GRANT
			(takes it)
		A raptor claw. I use to have one. A fossil.

				ERIC
		Mine's new.

	Grant hands it back.

	Eric is becoming more and more a normal thirteen-year old boy.
	There's an innocence to him that's coming back.

				GRANT
		How much of this island have you explored?

				ERIC
		I stayed pretty close to the compound,
		Figured if anyone came to look for me, that's
		where they'd start.

				GRANT
		We need to head for the coast.

				ERIC
		Are you sure?

				GRANT
		Why?

				ERIC
		Closer you get to the water, the bigger
		things get.


69J	EXT. JUNGLE - DAY							69J

	Billy and Amanda wait for Paul as he comes out of the bushes,
	hiking up his shorts.

	Trying to take charge...

				BILLY
		We need to stick to the plan. Head for the
		coast.

				AMANDA
		What about Eric and Dr. Grant?

				BILLY
		Going to the coast was Alan's idea. If he's
		alive, thats where he's headed.

				AMANDA
		What about Eric?

	Billy represses his instinct to say Eric's dead.

				PAUL
			(rationalizing)
		He's probably has a better chance by the coast
		as it is. Figures that all the big dinosaurs
		would live in the center of the island.
			(to Billy)
		Right?

				BILLY
		Sure.


69K	EXT. JUNGLE - DAY							69K

	As Grant and Eric walk, both stop, hearing a strange sound. But
	for a change, it's not an ominous one.

	It's a human one.

	A phone is RINGING, very faintly. Without a word to each other,
	Grant and Eric decide its coming from the right.

69L	EXT. JUNGLE - CONTUNUOUS DAY					69L

	Paul is picking the briars out of his socks as they hike,
	risking tripping on every step. Then Amanda stops short. She's
	the first to hear it:

	THE SAME RINGING.

	After a beat, everyone else can hear it too. And recongnition
	finally lights on Paul's face...

				PAUL
		My phone.

	Suddenly, Paul frantically searches his pockets as the others
	anxiously watch.

				AMANDA
		You had the phone the whole time?

				BILLY
		Where is it?

				PAUL
		I don't know. I don't have it with me.

				AMANDA
		When did you have it last?

				PAUL
		I don't remember

				AMANDA
		Think.

	And Paul wracks his memory...

				PAUL
		The plane. I got a call on the plane, put it in
		my coat pocket, and...

	Bust suddenly, he stops, his face is lighting with an awful
	realization. Amanda couldnt bear the wait...

				AMANDA
		What?...WHAT!?

				PAUL
		I loaned it to Nash. He must have had it on
		him when he...

	The hideous implication of his words slowly sink in.


69M	EXT. JUNGLE - DAY							69M

	Still following the faint RINGING, Grant and Eric turn to find

	A SAIL

	moving through the low trees. We recognize it as the back of a
	spinosaurus. We might think it's any random spinosaurus,
	except for the RINGING coming from somewhere inside it.

	Grant and Eric press back against a tree, keep perfectly
	still as they hear the THOOOOMB, THOOOOMB, THOOOMB of the
	creature's footsteps reverberating. It's tail RUSTKES against
	the brush.

	It's moving behind them, and it's close.

	We hear the RINGING move from left to right as it passes. So
	far, its has no idea they're there.

	Looking across the clearing, Eric is startled to see

	PAUL AND AMANDA

	are no more than 20 yards away, also hiding. An involuntary
	reflex, Eric calls out...

				ERIC
		Mon! Dad!

	Grant immediately covers the boys mouth. But it's to late.
	The dinosaur has stopped. We still can't see it. We don't know how
	close it is.

	Paul and Amanda spot Eric with Grant. They're a thousand
	emotions at once: relieved, disbelieving, terrified, overjoyed.
	They want to run to him, to yell out to him, but the monster is
	close.

	Grant takes his hand off Eric's mouth. They both stay
	completely silent.

	All this time, the sat-phone is RINGING.

	Than it stops.

	And after an agonizing beat, the beast moves. At first we're
	not sure which direction it's headed, but finally we can tell
	its moving away.

	Once the sail is finally out of sight, Eric breaks from Grant's
	hold and dashes to his parents' arms. They coop him up. Hug
	him, kiss him, their affection unquenchable. He's crying.

				AMANDA
			(reassuring him)
		Sweetheart, you're okay.
			(reassuring herself)
		You're okay.
			(disbelieving)
		You're okay.

				PAUL
		Never had a doubt. Never did. Us Kirby men,
		we stick around, huh?

				ERIC
		We do.

	Looking at her grubby son, Amanda licks her shirttail, trying
	to rub his face clean.

				PAUL
		Honey, there's not enough spit in the world
		for that.

	She LAUGHS. It's the first times she's laughed in two months.

	Billy crosses the distance to Grant.

				GRANT
		We need to keep moving.

				BILLY
		Alan, I want to tell you that I'm so sorry
		about the...

				GRANT
		Billy, I can't talk to you now.

	He walks off. Billy follows him.

				BILLY
		Please, okay? Just yell at me. Call me an
		idiot. An asshole. Stupid. Tell me I screwed
		up because I know I did.

	Grant doesn't respond.

				BILLY (CONT'D)
		I thought if we could get a raptor back
		to the mainland, we could get serious money
		for it. Enough to fund the digging for 10
		years. More. Whatever it took.

	Grant shakes his head, disgusted, But doesn't stop.

				BILLY (CONT'D)
		You have to believe me. I did it with the
		best intentions.

				GRANT
			(finally turning on him)
		Some of the worst things imaginable have
		been done with the best intentions. You
		rushed in with no thought to the
		consequences, to yourself or anyone else.
			(finally)
		You're no better than the people who built
		this place.

	Grant keeps walking, leaving Billy with his guilt.


70	INT. CANYON BUILDING - DAY					70

	The group enters a structure with giant windows designed to
	look into the canyon beyond -- only there's nothing to see but a
	thick fog.

	Toward the center of the room, a spiral staircase that leads to
	a lower level.

	With Billy lagging, Grant approaches the stairs and peers down
	the circular opening in the floor. There is not much to see, just
	fog, a glint of sunlight.


71	EXT. RIVER CANYON - DAY						71

	Step by step, Grant leads the group down a rusty spiral
	staircase below the observation room. The stairs end in a lower
	level. Although we're technically outside, this whole place feel
	strangely enclosed.

	There's a thick fog at this level -- clouds, really -- but far
	below we can see the river. And at its banks, a barge.

				GRANT
		We climb down to the barge and follow the
		river out to the ocean. With any luck, the
		Costa Rican coast guard will pick us up.

				ERIC
		Then we go home?

				AMANDA
		Then we go home.

	Grant leads everyone down a RAMP to --


72	EXT. LANDING - DAY							72

	A catwalk branches off, a SET OF STAIRS continuing down the
	along the canyon wall.

	Grant starts down the stairs. He's only taken a few steps down
	the rusty staircase suddenly

	BREAKS BENEATH HIS FEET.

	Paul grabs him in the nick of time. The staircase vanish into
	the fog. CLANFING AGAINST the canyon wall. After a few more
	seconds of silence, they hear the CRASH far below.

				AMANDA
		You okay?

	Grant nods and looks in the other direction.

				GRANT
		How about if we try this way?

	Their only other option is a precarious catwalk that
	disappears into the mist.

				AMANDA
		Do you think it goes all the way across?

				GRANT
		One way to find out.

	The only way to get his-near-fall is to push ahead. But his
	stomach turns at being so high.

	Amanda follows. The catwalk creaks and groans, listing
	slightly. She freezes mid-stride.

				GRANT (CONT'D)
			(glancing back)
		We'd better do this one at a time.

	Amanda steps of and Grant carefully pushes forward,
	disappearing into the thick fog.

	The others listen to the CREAKING of the catwalk until it STOPS
	ABRIPTLY.

	SILENCE.

				PAUL
		Dr. Grant?

	More silence. Then, out of the fog, a distant voice call out --

				GRANT (O.S.)
		Come on over. One at a time.

	Amanda steps tentatively forwards. Eric is clinging to her.

				AMANDA
		Eric, its okay. You'll be right behind me.

				PAUL
		We're not going anywhere, I promise.

	As Paul holds Eric, and Amanda shares a look.

				Amanda
		We're all together now, Eric.

	Eric reluctantly releases her mother. Amanda starts to cross.


73	EXT. REVER CANYON - FAR WALL - DAY				73

	Grant has stopped at a lateral support across the
	catwalk, trying to get the sense of where they are and what
	purpose this place may have served.

	Seeing that the support beams are brace high arched walls of steal
	mesh, it becomes obvious that we are inside this vast
	construction.

	Amanda emerges from the mist and turns back to the catwalk.

				AMANDA
			(calling out)
		Okay! Come on, Eric!


74	EXT. LANDING - DAY							74

	Eric is next to go across. He's still tentative.

				PAUL
		How 'bout if I...

				ERIC
		No, I can do it.

	Billy and Paul look on as Eric disappears into the vapor.

				PAUL
			(muttering to himself)
		That's it Eric. Nice and easy...


75	EXT. CATWALK - DAY							75

	Eric slowly gropes his way forward. He feels a GUST OF WIND and
	a HEAVY THUD ahead on the catwalk which now sways beneath
	him.

	Regaining his balance, Eric peers forward, but the fog prevents
	him from seeing more than fifteen feet ahead. There is an EERIE
	SILENCE. Eric calls out timidly.

				ERIC
		Mom?


75A	EXT. RIVER CANYON - FAR WALL - DAY				75A

	Across the canyon, Grant moves across the later support. With
	his hand on the railing, he sends a white, hardened substance
	dropping into the mist.

	Looking up, Grant notices a large strut, covered with the same
	substance. Realizing what it could be.

				GRANT
		Oh, my God.

				AMANDA
		What is it?

				GRANT
		A bird cage.

	Then, the sound of Eric SCREAMING.


75B	EXT. CATWALK - DAY							75B

	Eric watches as A LOOMING SHAPE emerges from the fog -- a
	nightmarish vision stalking purposefully forward.

	A FULL GROWN PTERANODON,

	standing over seven feet high, walks upright on clawed feet, his
	thirty foot wings folded bat-like at his side.

	The creature sees Eric and fixes him with a demonic glare.

	Eric CRIES OUT and dashes back down the teetering catwalk.

	The Pteranodon ruses to its feet, spreads its thirty-foot wings
	and flies directly at him.

	AT THE OTHER END OF THE CATWALK

	Hearing Eric's SCREAMS, Paul charges onto the catwalk,
	searching in the fog.

				PAUL
		Eric!

				BILLY
		It won't hold!

	Suddenly,

	ERIC

	emerges from the fog, racing toward his father. And then
	
	THE PTERANODON

	swoops out of the fog, opens its giant rear claws, and snatches
	the terrified boy from the catwalk.

	Paul Kirby watches in stunned, abject horror as the Pteranodon
	carries Eric directly overhead --

				PAUL
		ERIC!

	The flying reptile struggles with the boy's weight. Paul
	watches helplessly as Eric is carried high across the canyon.

	Paul runs back alone the catwalk in a desperate attempt to keep
	Eric in sight.

	Billy stays behind, moving back up the platform to try to
	keep the dinosaur in view. With a new idea, he races back up the
	stairs to the observation room. He has a way to save Eric.

	When he reaches the canyon wall, Paul turns a corner and runs
	along another enclosed catwalk leading deeper into the canyon.

	Grant and Amanda now come pounding down the catwalk trying to
	catch up with Paul.

				AMANDA
			(shouting)
		Paul! Where is he? Can you see him?

				PAUL
			(shouting back)
		I'm trying! That thing took him down this
		way!

				GRANT
		Split up!

	THE PTERANODON

	carries Eric deeper into the canyon. The creature's wings beat
	steadily overhead, and the WIND is fierce. Eric looks down and
	sees the river far below.

	The Pteranodon swoops over an isolated outcropping of rocks at
	the end of the canyon and drops Eric into --


75C	EXT. PTERANODON NEST - DAY					75C

	A large bowl of mud and branches the size of a satellite dish.
	Eric lands right on top of a pile of dinosaur bones picked
	clean. Mixed among is one human skull.

	Before Eric has time to cry out, he looks up to find

	SIX PTERANODON HATCHLINGS

	closing in on him with sharp-edged beaks.

	He picks up the human skull and whips it to the hatchlings.
	They easily duck it and keep coming.

76	EXT. OBSERVATION ROOM - CONTINUOUS DAY			76

	Grant looks up to see Billy leaning out over the edge of the
	observation platform. He suddenly realizes what Billy is about
	to do.

				GRANT
		BILLY! WAIT!

	Billy SHOUTS BACK, an excited-terrified grin on his face.

				BILLY
		I CAN GET HIM!

				GRANT
		NO!

				BILLY
		I KNOW THE CONSEQUENCES!

	Billy jumps off the railing and

	DROPS TOWARDS THE CANYON BELOW.

	Grant, Paul and Amanda watch as Billy FALLS past them like a
	stone, plummeting towards certain death. But then --

	THE PARASAIL CHUTE

	blossoms above him.

	Not only does it slows Billy's descent, but he even manages to
	catch an updraft and begin to rise.

	He struggles to control the parasail, swooping dangerously
	close to the canyon wall, barely avoiding it.

	Up ahead he catches sight of Eric and steers towards him.


77-80	OMIT									77-80


81	EXT. PTERANODON NEST - DAY					81

	Eric struggles to keep away from the hatchlings. But there's
	no way out of this nest.

	Billy SWOOPS overhead, but he's too high to reach Eric.

				BILLY
		ERIC! HOLD ON!

	He circles around to make another attempt.


82	EXT. ENCLOSED CATWAY - DAY					82

	Paul rounds the corner and finally catches sight of Eric in the
	nest, some fifty feet below, fighting off the hatchlings.

				PAUL
		Hang on, Eric!

	Paul sees an outcropping he could jump onto from here. It's a
	big leap, though, he might not make it. He steels himself up for
	the jump, then chickens out.

	Grant and Amanda come up behind him. Suddenly,

	A SECOND PTERANODON

	CRASH LANDS on the catwalk enclosure about them -- right next
	to a gaping hole in the mesh. The catwalk GROANS with the
	extra weight.

	The pteranodon JAMS its head through the hole, SNAPPING at
	them.


83	EXT. CANYON - IN THE AIR - DAY					83

	Billy circles, making his approach.

	In the nest, Eric kicks at the hatchlings, but they're
	undeterred. Billy and Eric will only have one chance.

	As Billy swoops past, Eric jumps and grabs onto his boot. He is
	yanked up and out of the nest. But than, MOTHER PTERANODON
	shoots past, tearing out a piece of the parasail in its beak.


84-85	OMIT									84-85


86	EXT. OVER THE RIVER - DAY					86

	The pteranodon who landed on the top of the catwalk continues to
	SNAP through the hole in the enclosure.

	Finally the reptile's massive weight proves to much, and the
	entire section of the catwalk BREAKS FREE of the canyon wall
	and FLIPS OVER LATERALLY.

	Amanda, Grant and Paul are able to hang on, but so is the
	pteranodon, who now climbs their way.


87	OMIT									87


88	EXT. OVER THE RIVER - DAY					88

	His parasail badly damaged, Billy tries to keep aloft. Heading
	as low as he dares, he yells to Eric --

				BILLY
		Let go!

	Terrified, Eric falls into the river safely. He surfaces,
	immediately swimming to shore.

	Trying to gain altitude, Billy bends hard to the right. But the
	rigging is too badly damaged. He flies right into the canyon
	wall, hitting hard.

	Instead of tumbling down to the river, he finds himself
	swinging from his harness - the parasail snagged on a rock
	spire above him.


89	EXT. BROKEN CATWALK - DAY					89

	Paul, Grant and Amanda struggle to stay away from the
	pteranodon as it moves towards them.

	Suddenly. the far end of this inverted section of catwalk
	detaches from the canyon wall and

	SWINGS DOWNWARD.

	The force of the action sends the three tumbling directly
	towards the pteranodon.

	Miraculously, they manage to avoid its open beak. But they
	are all sent plummeting toward the river below.


90	EXT. RIVER - DAY							90

	They hit the water hard, resurfacing moments later. The
	current is carrying them downstream.


91	EXT. CANYON WALL - DAY						91

	The two pteranodons who were pursuing Billy now land on nearby
	ledges and consider how best to dispatch their prey.

	Billy frantically tries to unhook his harness, but the tension
	is so tight from his own weight that he can't loosen the
	buckles.


92-93	OMIT							  92-93


94	EXT. RIVER BANK - DAY					      94

	Paul and Amanda emerge from the water by the canyon wall and
	find their son hiding behind a rock, searching the skies for
	Billy.

	Amanda takes Eric tightly in her arms, and Paul urges them to
	keep moving. Up ahead, the mesh of the aviary meets the river.

	Wading the shore, Grant now scans the canyon, searching for
	Billy. It doesn't take long to spot him.

95	EXT. CANYON WALLL - DAY						95

	Billy continues to struggle with the harness but to no avail.

	The doomed young man is suspended high up on the canyon wall
	like a modern Prometheus, an entire FLOCK of pteranodons
	gathering around him preparing to peck away his liver. And
	everything else.

	A MAMMOTH PTERANADON has landed beside him and looks him
	straight in the eye.

	The gigantic creature lunges at him. Billy dodges away as best
	he can. The pteranodon's frustrated bite severs a crucial
	juncture on Billy's harness, and Billy is able to wriggle free.


96	EXT. RIVER BANK - DAY						96

	Eric, Amanda, Paul and Grant watch in amazement as Billy is the
	last to PLUNGE DOWN into the river.

				GRANT
		He made it!

	Billy bobs to the surface and spots the group downstream. He
	waves and begins to swim towards them. Soon he nears the shore
	and gets to his feet, wading as he comes.

	Grant, Paul, Amanda and Eric hurry to meet him.

	Grant is overjoyed to see him alive. But his smile quickly
	fades as he sees

	THE ENTIRE FLOCK OF PTERANODONS

	diving down from above in angry pursuit of their lost prey.

				GRANT (CONT'D)
		Billy, look out!

	Billy glances behind him. He races forward, motioning fro his
	companions to turn around.

				BILLY
		Get back! Get back!

	Just then Billy is knocked down by the lead pteranodon. It
	strikes from behind with a brutal, calculated beak to the head.
	Billy stumbles and falls to the ground.

	Grant rushes forward with Paul right after him. Amanda takes
	Eric to safety down river.

	Billy SCREAMS as the ENTIRE FLOCK of pteranodons now swarms
	around him, picking him apart with their beaks and claws.

				GRANT
		Billy!

				PAUL
		It's no use, Dr. Grant. No use.

	Grant can't take his eyes off Billy, whose BLOOD stains the
	water rushing by.

	And now several pteranodons are heading their way. Difficult
	as it is to leave Billy behind, Grant and Paul make a run for it.

	Just as the pteranodons are about to swoop in for the kill, Alan
	and Paul dive back into the river...


97	EXT. THE RIVER - CONTINUOUS DAY				97

	...and resurfaces on the far side of the mesh aviary wall, GASPING
	for air. Just behind them, the mammoth

	PTERANODON

	CRASHES into the mesh. It tears at the steel, actually ripping
	it in one place.

	At the dock up ahead, Amanda and Eric have found a rusty,
	waterlogged barge that's somehow still floating. Carrying a
	tarp-covered cage, the boat was meant for transporting dinos
	up and down the river.

	Amanda pushes them away from the dock as Alan and Paul climb
	on board.


98	EXT. ON THE BARGE - CONTINUOUS DAY				98

	The current takes the craft downstream, letting us get our
	first good look at the incredible
	
	AVIARY.

	It's a vast, domed mesh structure that spans the entire canyon.
	In all, a feat of remarkable engineering and unmistakable
	hubris.

	Catching their breath, our four survivors look at the cage they
	were caught in.


99	EXT. DOWN RIVER - DAY / LATER					99

	Yanking the starter rope one final time, Paul finally gets the
	engine to turn over, PUTTERING along. Amanda is beside him,
	bailing water.

				PAUL
		My own kid was right in front of me and I
		didn't do a damn thing.

				AMANDA
		You couldn't have made that jump.

				PAUL
		I should have tried. It should have been me
		on that beach back there, not Billy.

				AMANDA
		How would you have helped Eric?
			(he can't answer)
		He needs you, Paul. He needs us.

				PAUL
		He could have died.

				AMANDA
		But he didn't. And neither did you. And I'm
		glad about that.


99A	UP ON THE BOW							99A

	Grant is beside Eric, keeping watch, but also feeling the weight
	of Billy's death.

				ERIC
		Do you have any kids?

				GRANT
		No. Although I've studied them in the wild.

	Eric looks over, not sure what that means.

				GRANT (CON'T)
		I have a theory that there's two kinds of
		boys. Those who want to be astronomers and
		those who want to be astronauts.

				ERIC
		I want to be an astronaut.

				GRANT
		See, I was the opposite. I never understood
		why anyone would want to go into space. It's
		so dangerous. You do one thing wrong and
		you're dead. The astronomer -- or the
		paleontologist -- get to study these amazing
		things from a place of complete safety. And
		truthfully, everything you really need to
		learn, you can learn it from the ground.

				ERIC
		But then you never get to go in space.

				GRANT
		Exactly. The difference between imagining
		how things might be and seeing how they
		really are. To be able to touch them. That's
		what Billy wanted to do.

	The barge starts to round a bend. On the bow, Grant and Eric
	are the fist to see something remarkable. Eric GASPS,
	unprepared. We don't know yet what they see.

				GRANT (cont'd)
		I can blame the people who made this island.
		But I can't blame the people who want to see
		it. To study it.

	At the rear of the barge, Paul just now sees what's ahead. Awe-
	struck, he slows the motor and motions for Amanda to take a
	look. And so do we.

	UP AHEAD

	The setting sun illuminates an incredible valley filled with
	dinosaurs. We see armored ANKYLOSAURS with clubbed
	tails. Duck-billed CORYTHOSAURS. We float under the gigantic,
	arching necks of eighty-foot BRACHIOSAURS.

	With the mist from the river and the play of light, we're
	witnessing a kind of primal Eden.

				GRANT (cont'd)
		How's a boy suppose to resist this?


100	EXT. FURTHER DOWNSTREAM - NIGHT				100

	A FULL MOON passes behind clouds. THUNDER quietly rumbles, and
	LIGHTNING flickers in the distance.

	Paul is still at the wheel. The river is narrower here, and
	cautions must be taken to avoid the banks.

	As the barge begins to round another bend. a FAMILIAR HIGH-
	PITCHED SOUND pierces the darkness. Muffled but unmistakable,
	it is the RINGING SAT-PHONE.

	All exchange looks of sheer PANIC, expecting Spinosaurus to
	leap out at any moment. Grant scans the river banks.

				GRANT
		Keep quiet.

	Paul cuts the motor, and time seems to stop as the four stand
	posed for action.

	The barge finishes rounding the curve, and the ringing grows
	LOUDER. The suspense is excruciating until finally...

	Their eyes widen at some horrifying sight, more horrifying
	than anything they've yet seen.

	SEVEN MOUNDS OF DINOSAUR DUNG sit on the patch off treeless flat
	ground just beyond the river bank.

	As our friends consider the sight, an idea comes to them all of them
	almost simultaneously.

	With Eric still in the boat, Amanda, Paul, and Alan jump into
	the river and rush to the bank.


101	EXT. RIVER BANK - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT				101

	The three companions sprint towards the source of the RINGING.

				GRANT
		Find it before it stops ringing!

	And bracing themselves and hocking their breath, they PLUNGE
	their arms into their respective dung-heaps. After a few
	moments of this disgusting search...

				PAUL
		I've got something. I think I've got
		something!

	All turn to Paul. Clearing away the clinging defecation, he
	holds up to a beeper. And still the phone RINGS.

	Returning to their bleak task, they shovel the excrement with
	their arms. Finally:

				AMANDA
		I've got it! I've got it!

	Grant snatches the RINGING SAT-PHONE from Amanda's hands,
	presses a button, and puts it to his ear.

				RECORDED VOICE (ON PHONE)
		You too can own a time share in beautiful
		Guadalajara. Enjoy a meal in one of our four
		star restaurants, explore our coral reefs, or
		just walk on the beach...

	The Kirbys hear the recorded voice and let out a collective,
	heavy sigh. Grant shuts off the phone.

	In all the excitement, none of them notice a fierce horned
	CARNOTAUR right behind them. The giant creature ROARS, ready
	to eat them.

	But as it gets in close, it smells them. Even a dinosaur won't
	eat something that is covered in shit. After a beat, the
	Carnotaur turns and walks away, back into the jungle.

				PAUL
		Can't help but be a little offended.


102	EXT. BACK ON THE BARGE - NIGHT					102

	CLOSE ON the cleaned satellite phone's display. The battery
	level indicator is FLASHING.

				PAUL
		Whatever you do, don't call the U.S. Embassy.
		They won't do a God Damn thing.

				GRANT
		Well, we don't exactly have a Costa Rican
		phone book here, so it will have to be
		somebody we know in the states. Someone we
		can absolutely count on to send help.

				PAUL
			(to Amanda)
		Stan.

				AMANDA
		I wouldn't trust Stan with a snowball in a
		blizzard.

	Paul glares at her. Now Eric notices something odd in the
	river.

				ERIC
		What's that?

	The others look down in the murky water. Just below the
	surface,

	A SHIMMERING WAVE OF SILVER

	passes beneath the boat.

	Then a SINGLE FISH jumps from the water. And another. And
	another.

				GRANT
		Bonitas.

				ERIC
		Something must've scared them.

	Another roll of THUNDER, this time much closer.

				GRANT
		Get the motor going.

	Paul moves the motor and pulls the start cord. The engine
	sputters but won't come to life.

	And now the phone BEEPS. The battery is getting even weaker.

	Grant makes a quick decision and DIALS.

				AMANDA
		Who are you calling?

	But Grant ignores the question. RING. RING.

				GRANT
		Pick up! Pick up!


103	INT. ELLIE'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT				103

	Wearing his jammies, three-year old Charlie awkwardly picks up
	the phone with both hands. He has the mouthpiece next to his
	lips, but the earpiece is hanging out in space.

				CHARLIE
		Hewwo?

	INTERCUT

	Recognizing who it must be...

				GRANT
		Charlie? Charlie. Get your mother. Right
		away!

	A long silence. Charlie bites his lip, looks around.

				GRANT (CONT'D)
		Charlie? Are you there?

				CHARLIE
		Hewwo?

	The sat-phone BEEPS again, this time much LOUDER.

	Amanda and Eric watch Grant, realizing their fate may hang on
	this single call. Paul struggles without success to start the
	motor.

	Then, unseen by the group, a

	GIGANTIC FIN

	rises from the water just fifty yards from the barge. It's
	headed right to them and closing fast.

				GRANT
			(desperate)
		Charlie! It's the dinosaur man! Go get
		mommy, okay?

				CHARLIE
		Okay.

	Not sure what to do with the phone, Charlie makes a logical
	choice and hangs it back up.

	He walks away to his mom.


104	EXT. BARGE - NIGHT [END INTERCUTTING]			104

	Grant realizes he's been cut off. He's about to redial when

	WHAM!

	The barge is RAMMED, sending everyone tumbling. Grant manages
	to stay on top of the wheelhouse, but he loses grip on the
	phone, which falls on deck.

	SPINOSAURUS

	rises from the water, towering over the barge. As lightning
	FLASHES and thunder CRACKS, the dinosaur lets out an ear-
	splitting ROAR.

	It lunges at Grant with gaping jaws. Grant leaps out of
	the way just in time as the dinosaur

	RIPS OFF

	the entire wheelhouse.

							            CUT TO:


105	INT. ELLIE'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT				105

	Charlie leads Ellie into the room. Hands her the phone. Of
	course, it's just a DIAL TONE.

				ELLIE
		Was somebody on the phone?

				CHARLIE
		Dinosaur man.

	Ellie looks at him with confusion, then quickly checks the
	Caller ID box besides the phone. It's international, and not a
	number she recognizes.

							          BACK TO:


106	EXT. THE BARGE - NIGHT						106

	Grant stays one step ahead of the Spinosaurus as the beast rips
	apart the quickly-sinking boat.

	It spits out the wheelhouse and bites down on the stern of the
	boat, ripping off a chunk.

	Grant is heading up to the other three when he hears the sat-
	phone RING.  He spots it, just about to fall into the water.
	Dives for it, answering...

				GRANT
		ELLIE!


106A	INT. ELLIES LIVING ROOM - NIGHT					106A

				ELLIE
		Alan?

	She can hear the Spinosaurus ROAR.

				ELLIE (CONT'D)
		Alan? Alan!

	But he's cut off by a SECOND ROAR, the sound of someone
	SCREAMING.

	And then the line goes dead.

	Ellie pales. Charlie looks at her with a smile.

				CHARLIE
			(imitating)
		Raaaar!


106B	EXT. BACK ON THE BARGE - NIGHT					106B

	Dropping the dead phone, Grant scrambles towards the front of
	the boat and joins Paul, Amanda and Eric, who have taken refuge
	in the dinosaur cage.

	The fearsome beast now lifts the stern of the boat clear out of
	the water.

	The cage SCRAPES across the deck and SLAMS into the gunwale,
	toppling off the barge and

	INTO THE RIVER.

	Grant and the Kirbys are still inside.


107	EXT. THE RIVER - UNDERWATER - NIGHT				107

	The cage sinks. The closest to the door, Paul manages to get out.

	The other three aren't as lucky. The cage rotates as it descends
	and lands on the river bottom with the door side down, trapping
	them inside.

	In the cold murky depths, they pull frantically on the bars.
	Debris and equipment float around them.

	Paul surfaces out of the breath and disoriented. Spinosaurus
	pushes past the boat. If anyone is going to save his family, it
	has to be him.

	And so he dives.

	Pushing with all his might, he manages to tip the heavy
	structure, just enough so Amanda, Eric and Grant can get out.
	Paul himself isn't so lucky.

	Spinosaurus grabs the cage and Paul, throwing both straight up
	out of the water. Paul flies twenty feet away, further from the
	shore.

				AMANDA
		PAUL!

				ERIC
		DAD!

	Spinosaurus is going after the heroic Mr. Kirby, who dives,
	swimming underwater. He's trying to lead it away from his
	family.

				GRANT
			(looking around)
		Up! Up!

	He points to a heavy crane assembly, designed for lifting cages
	off the large boats. Now well accustomed to fleeing on
	command, Amanda sends Eric up first, climbing the scaffolding
	like a jungle gym.

	All the while, they're trying to spot Paul.

	Grant is the last to climb, reaching the first section as
	Spinosaurus returns from the water, SLAMMING into the base of
	the crane. The whole assembly SHUDDERS, threatening to rip into
	the water.

				ERIC
		Where's Dad?

				AMANDA
		Just hold on.

	Try as it might, the beast can't climb the crane. So instead it
	RAMS it, SHAKES it, trying to knock them off. Eric slips, but
	Amanda catches him.

	About to shed his bag to climb higher, Grant finds one last
	hope. It's the resonation chamber model. A beat before he
	decides: It may not be the best choice, but it's the only choice.

	He blows through it, the same EERIE PITCH we heard before. On
	the third try, he's able to approximate the "egg" cry he heard
	the raptors give. He keeps it up, repeating over and over.

	Spinosaurus stops for a beat, confused How this sound could be
	coming from a non-raptor. But then keeps SMASHING.

	We can hear the mounting bolts STRAIN. Soon the whole crane
	will tip.

	But not before a MATCHING CRY is heard in the jungle. Grant
	stops, not certain he heard it. But there it is AGAIN.

	He keeps blowing.

	The crane is close to tipping when a single RAPTOR appears
	from the darkness, CHIRP-BARKING at the Spinosaur, who simply
	bats away.

	But then MORE RAPTORS come. And even MORE. Soon there are
	dozens gathering, circling.

	Grant stops signaling. All three survivors watch with
	horrified fascination, knowing their fate is perilous no matter
	which side wins.

	Looking at his adversaries, Spinosaurus ROARS. And suddenly
	the raptors attack.

	Spinosaurus easily handles the first few, but like ants they
	just keep coming. They climb up his back, slicing, into him with
	their razor-sharp claws.

				GRANT
		Jump! Swim for the far shore!

	All three drop from the crane arm into the water.

	Meanwhile, the fight continues. Spinosaurus rallies, shaking
	off many of the raptors, but they just keep coming. Their
	hooked claws dig in, scraping the meat to the bone.

	Spinosaurus puts up a brave fight to the end, but finally
	collapses, dead. The raptors continue to shred it to ribbons.
	Then one of the raptors looks over to see the survivors
	swimming away.

	But a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush. It goes back to
	its meal.


107A	EXT. FAR SHORE - NIGHT						107A

	Grant is trying to move them along. still headed downstream.
	But Eric won't budge another foot.

				ERIC
		We have to keep looking for Dad. We have to.

				AMANDA
		I know. I know. I want to look for him too.

				ERIC
		then we should...

	She kneels down, facing him. She's just as upset as he is, but
	motherhood carries the burden of remaining calm.

				AMANDA
		Let me tell you a few things about you Dad,
		okay? He's very very very clever, very very brave,
		and he loves you ever very much.

				ERIC
		He loves you too.

				AMANDA
		Okay. He loves us very very much. And I know
		that right now more than anything, your Dad
		would want to know that we're safe. Okay?

	Eric nods.

				AMANDA (CONT'D)
		We're going to get out of this, and
		everything's going to be all right, I promise.

				A VOICE
		Listen to your mother.

	Out of the darkness steps Paul Kirby. Amanda is knocked over
	with surprise. Eric runs to him, nearly tackling him.

				PAUL
		Good thing I've been swimming, huh?

	Amanda hugs him and Eric so tightly they can't breath.


									CROSSFADE TO:


108-109	OMIT								108-109


110	EXT. BEACH - DAY							110

	The foursome sit back on the wide beach, one facing
	each direction, keeping watch. A light rain is falling, but they
	don't seem to notice.

	Trying to keep his boy's spirit up...

				PAUL
		You remember when we went fishing last
		summer? And I was trying to put the boat in
		and the trailer sank? And then the tow truck
		came and tried to pull it out, but it got
		dragged in? And the truck driver threatened
		to knock your Dad's lights out? So I said I
		was the governor and he believed me?

	Eric really smiles, remembering the day.

				ERIC
		Yeah.

	Amanda is smiling too. She had completely forgotten the
	incident.

				PAUL
		That was a fun day.

	To Paul, after some consideration....

				AMANDA
		We should try fishing again.

				PAUL
		You mean it?

				AMANDA
		I do. It's worth another shot. And who knows?
		Things might turn out differently.

	Her hand takes his, gently brushing off the wet sand, fingertips
	touching. It's a small thing, but it's a start.

	Sensing his cue to leave, Grant gets up and starts walking down
	the beach. Eric hurries to follow him. He speaks
	conspiratorially, not wanting to alarm his parents.

				ERIC
		The lady you called, how do you know she can
		help us?

				GRANT
		She's the one person I could always count on.
		And she's saved me more times than she
		realizes. I owe her everything.

	A long beat as they walk.

				GRANT (CONT'D)
		It's strikes me now I never told her that.

				ERIC
		You should.

				GRANT
		You're right.

	As they keep walking, Grant notices something rammed against
	the rocks ahead. It's a speedboat, its hull ripped open from the
	impact.

	And it's not just any boat either -- it's the same Dino-Soar
	boat that was pulling the parasail. Eric hasnt seen it yet, so
	Grant stops him.

				GRANT (CONT'D)
		Eric, do you know what happened to the boat?
		that brought you here? Why did it crash?

				ERIC
		No. I couldn't see.

				GRANT
		Do me a favor. Go back to your parents for a
		minute, would you?
			(pre-empting objections)
		They look worried.

	Eric nods and heads back to Paul and Amanda. Grant forges on,
	approaching the speedboat wreckage. He doesn't know what he'll
	find, but he needs to look.

	Almost reaching his parents, Eric stops. Looks out over the
	ocean, where he sees

	TWO LIGHTS.

	He doesn't say anything for a moment, trying to make sure
	they're real. They are. And they're coming closer.

				ERIC
			(excited)
		Mom! Dad!

	They look up to see the distant lights, just now making out
	full forms...

				PAUL
		Helicopters. Helicopters!

	He SHOUTS with joy. Paul, Amanda and Eric wave their arms,
	making as much motion as possible. The helicopters -- big
	military choppers -- change direction, heading straight for
	them.

	Paul and Amanda embrace, then kiss, the moment getting the best
	of them

	AT THE SPEEDBOAT

	Grant looks in, prepared to see anything in the wreckage. But
	the cabin is surprisingly intact, just a little blood. There are
	three gashes on the driver's seat back. Grant measures their
	spacing with his fingers.

				ERIC
			(yelling over)
		Dr. Grant! Helicopters are coming!

	Grant looks down to the wet sand around him, finding a trail of
	three-toed tracks.

				ERIC (CONT'D)
		We're safe!

				GRANT
			(to himself)
		No we're not.

	THE FIRST CHOPPER.

	flies right overhead. Paul and Amanda are confused, until the
	second helicopter starts to land -- the first on is there to 
	cover them.

	Grant YELLS at the first chopper, trying to wave it away. But
	the noise of the blades is DEAFENDING.

				GRANT (CONT'D)
		NO! STAY BACK! THEY'RE IN THE TREES!

	At the treeline, the upper branches are shaking. At first, it
	looks like it's just the wind off the chopper, but
	something more is happening.
	
	A PTERANODON

	flies up out of the trees, the first of twenty. It's a gorgeous
	and terrifying sight.


110A	INT. FIRST CHOPPER - DAWN					110A

	Terrified, the Costa Rican CHOPPER PILOT veers away, but the
	pteranodons are already on him. They SMASH at the windows,
	grabbing on the skids, The chopper rolls wildly.

	One over-eager pteranodon sticks his head up to high, getting
	decapitated by the blade.


110B	EXT. BEACH - DAWN							110B

	As the second chopper touches down on the beach, Eric, Amanda
	and Paul load in. Grant is running their way.


110C	EXT. BY THE TREES - DAWN						110C

	Meanwhile, the first copper is losing the battle even as it
	climbs higher. The helicopter suddenly tips, falling, SMASHING
	into the trees with a massive fireball.


110D	INT. SECOND CHOPPER - DAWN					110D

	Seeing the explosion, the SECOND CHOPPER PILOT takes off. Eric,
	Amanda and Paul are on board, but Grant is still running up.
	The helicopter passes right over him.

				AMANDA
			(to the pilot)
		You have to go back! We can't leave him!

	Seeing a ladder release by the door, Paul throws the lever. A cord-
	and-steel-ladder unfurls, dragging across the sand.


110E	EXT. THE BEACH - DAWN					   110E

	Grant chases after us, catching a rung just as it goes over the
	water. Behind him, pteranodons are circling the wreckage of
	the first chopper and starting to go after the second.

	Buffeted by the wind, Grant climbs the ladder up towards the
	chopper. A pteranodon flies up right behind him, trying to
	bite. It catches Grant's shoulder.

	Grant spins to the far side of the ladder. The pteranodon goes
	to bite him again, but finds it head caught between the rungs.
	As it tries to free itself, it just gets more entangled.

	The entire ladder starts to lift, caught by the updraft from the
	creatures wings.


110F	INT. SECOND CHOPPER - DAWN					110F

	Up with the pilot, Amanda sees the other pteranodons are headed
	back to the island, unable to keep up.

				AMANDA
		They're not following.

	In back, Paul and Eric get the ladder mechanism to begin to
	retract. It reels Grant in faster. It also reels in the
	pteranodon, which may be caught, but is still plenty dangerous.

	As Grant reaches the cabin, they shut off the ladder engine.
	The pteranodon is still working its way free, pulling itself closer
	and closer.

				GRANT
			(shouting over the noise)
		We have to cut it! Find something sharp!

	Everyone checking the cabin for a knife, anything sharp.

	Finally, Eric hands Grant the raptor claw.

	Grant uses it to rip the line. The fibers break and fray, but
	the pteranodon keeps coming closer.

	Paul throws a wrench at the pteranodon, WHACKING it straight
	in the head. It felt good, and damn if it didn't slow it down a
	little.

	Grant has cut through the cord. He started on the second when
	the pteranodon SNAPS at him, going for his hand. There's
	nowhere for Grant to cut without the pteranodon getting him.

	And idea, Grant very deliberately places in his hand on the line,
	pulling away at the last moment. The pteranodon itself bites
	through the line.


110G	EXT. OCEAN - DAWN							110G

	The pteranodon falls away from the helicopter, catching wind
	just before it hits the water.

	It circles and flies back to Isla Sorna.

	As horrifying as the creature was a moment ago, it's suddenly
	beautiful again. Each motion of its giant wings is a small
	symphony.


110H	INT. COPPER / FLYING - DAWN					110H

	Sitting between his parents, Eric looks back at the island in
	the distance.

				ERIC
		What do you think is going to happen with the
		dinosaurs?

				GRANT
		The population will Stabilize eventually.
		They'll adapt to fit different roles.

	ON PAUL AND AMANDA

				PAUL
		Either that, or the government will firebomb
		it back to the Stone Age.

				AMANDA
		I would completely support that.

	ON ERIC AND GRANT

	looking back at the island.

				ERIC
		I hope they don't. I want to come back
		someday.

	And Dr. Grant realizes...

				GRANT
		So do I.

EXT. OCEAN  DAWN
The helicopter flies away across the ocean, leaving the island behind.

THE LOST WORLD JURASSIC PARK

 
			THE LOST WORLD
			 JURASSIC PARK

			Screenplay by
			  David Koepp
	
		     based on the novel by
			Michael Crichton

	EXT. TROPICAL LAGOON - DAY

	A 135-foot-luxury yacht is anchored just offshore in a 
	tropical lagoon.  The beach is a stunning crescent of white
	sand at the jungle fringe, utterly deserted.

				ISLA SORNA
		87 miles southeast of Nublar

	Two SHIP HANDS, dressed in white uniforms, have set up a
	picnic table with three chairs on the sand and are carefully
	laying out luncheon service -- fine china, silver, crystal
	decanters with red and white wine.

	PAUL BOWMAN, fortyish, sits in a chair off to the side,
	reading.  MRS. BOWMAN, painfully thin, with the perpetually
	surprised look of a woman who's had her eyes done more than
	once, supervises the settings of the table.

	She looks up and sees a little girl, CATHY, seven or eight
	years old, wandering off down the beach.

				MRS. BOWMAN
		Cathy!  Don't wander off!

	Cathy keeps wandering.

				MRS. BOWMAN (cont'd)
		Cathy, come back!  You can look for
		shells right here!

	Cathy gestures, pretending she can't hear.

				BOWMAN
			(eyes still in his book)
		Leave her alone.

				MRS. BOWMAN
		What about snakes?

				BOWMAN
		There's no snakes on a beach.  Let
		her have fun, for once.

	FURTHER DOWN THE BEACH,

	Cathy keeps wandering away, MUTTERING to herself as her
	parents' quarreling voices fade in the distance.

				CATHY
		Please be quiet, please be quiet
		please be quiet...

	Rounding a curve in the beach, her parents disappear from view
	behind her.  A RUSTLING sound draws her attention, and she
	turns, toward where the thick jungle foliage gives way to the
	sand.

	A large bush, maybe twelve feet tall, is moving, its branches
	swaying and shaking.  Curious, Cathy walks up to the bush,
	which abruptly stops moving.

	A small, lizard-like animal, dark green with brown stripes
	along its back, steps out from the bush.  Only about a foot
	tall, it stands on its hind legs, balancing on its thick tail.
	It walks upright, bobbing its head like a chicken.

				CATHY
		Well, hello there!

	The animal (a COMPSOGNATHUS) just stares at her.  Cathy squats
	down on her haunches.

				CATHY (cont'd)
		What are you?  A little bird or
		something?

	She opens her hand.  She's got a handful of goldfish crackers.

				CATHY (cont'd)
		Are you hungry?  You want a goldfish?

	The compy bobs forward a few steps, cautiously.

				CATHY (cont'd)
		Come on.  I won't hurt you.

	The compy draws closer.  Cathy holds the cracker in the palm
	of her hand.  The compy gets closer still --

	-- and hops numbly up onto Cathy's palm.  Her arm dips a bit
	under the weight, but it's not that heavy, and she holds it up
	easily.  It bobs its head, scarfs up the goldfish, and eats
	it.

	Enchanted, Cathy breaks into an enormous grin and returns her
	hand, calling back over her shoulder.

				CATHY (cont'd)
		Mom!  Dad!  You gotta come see this!
		I found something!

	She turns back.

	Thirty more compys have come out onto the sand.  They're
	standing there, bobbing anxiously, staring at her from a few
	feet away.  Cathy's smile fades.

	She turns her head slowly to the right.  TWENTY MORE COMPYS
	have come in from that side, forming a semi-circle, bobbing
	and CHIPPING as they surround her.

				CATHY (cont'd)
			(terrified)
		What do you guys want?

	BACK ON THE BEACH,

	the table is set.  Mrs. Bowman calls out.

				MRS. BOWMAN
		Cathy, sweetheart!  Lunch is ready!

	From around the curve of the beach, a flock of birds bolts
	from the jungle trees as Cathy's shrill SCREAMS suddenly
	pierce the air.

				MRS. BOWMAN
		PAUL!

	She takes off, running down the beach, Mr. Bowman leaps out of
	his chair and follows, and all available deck hands race off
	to help, kicking up geysers of sand behind them.

	DOWN THE BEACH,

	Mrs. Bowman stops dead in her tracks when she rounds the bend
	in the beach.  We don't see what she sees, but we hear the
	frenzied SQUEAKING of the strange compys.  Mr. Bowman and the
	Hands race past her to help Cathy as Mrs. Bowman lets loose a
	horrified, slack-jawed SCREAM, her mouth a perfect oval.

							DISSOLVE TO:

	INT. BOARD ROOM - DAY

	Mrs. Bowman's screaming face dissolves slowly over the
	YAWNING face of a bored CORPORATE EXECUTIVE, TWENTY OTHER
	EXECUTIVES sit around a conference table in the boardroom of a
	monied corporation.  All are in expensive suits, most are over
	sixty.  There are rows of BACKBENCHERS too, whispering in their
	lawyers who sit behind their clients, whispering in their
	ears.  Empty coffee cups and fast food containers on the table
	hint that everyone's been here a long time.

	A familiar VOICE resounds through the boardroom as we move
	down the long table, pat the grim faces of the board members.

				VOICE (O.S.)
		The hurricane seemed like a disaster
		at the time, but now I think it was a
		blessing, nature's way of freeing
		those animals from their human
		confines.  Of giving them another
		chance to survive, but this time as
		they were meant to, without man's
		interference.

	The source of the voice is JOHN HAMMOND, the founder of InGen
	and creator of Jurassic Park.  But he's not in the room.  His
	image is on a closed circuit TV screen, which has been wheeled
	up to the end of the table.

	And he doesn't look good.  He's terribly infirmed, propped up
	in bed, his face pale and drawn, medical equipment BEEPING
	around him.

				HAMMOND (cont'd)
		There are some corporate issues that
		are not about the bottom line.  We
		have so much still to learn about
		those creatures.  A whole world of
		intricate, interlocking behaviors,
		vanished everywhere -- except for
		Site B. Please.  Let's not do what
		is good for more men at the expense
		at what is best for all mankind.

	The CHAIRMAN, seventyish, nods awkwardly to the television.

				CHAIRMAN
		Thank you, John.  Mr. Ludlow?

	He turns to PETER LUDLOW, late thirties, a man with the
	anxious look of someone who insists the buck stop on his desk.
	Ludlow flips open a file, pulls out a stack of black and white
	eight by tens, and tosses them on the table.

				LUDLOW
			(an accent similar to
			 Hammond's)
		These pictures were taken in a
		hospital in Costa Rica forty-eight
		hours ago, after an American family
		on a yacht cruise stumbled onto Site
		B.  The little girl will be fine, but
		her parents are wealthy, angry, and
		very fond of lawsuits.  But that's
		hardly new to us, is it?
			(takes a paper from the
			 file)
		Wrongful death settlements, partial
		list:  family of Donald Gennaro, 36.5
		million dollars; family of Robert
		Muldoon, 12.6 million.  Damaged or
		destroyed equipment, 17.3 million.
		Demolition, de-construction, and
		disposal of Isla Nublar facilities,
		organic and inorganic, one hundred
		and twenty-six million dollars.  The
		list goes on, gentlemen -- research
		funding, media payoffs.  Silence is
		expensive.

	He's warming up.  Not a bad performer.

				LUDLOW (cont'd)
		This corporation has been bleeding
		from the throat for four years.  You,
		our board of directors, have set
		patiently and listened to ecology
		lectures while Mr. Hammond signed
		your checks and spent your money.
		You have watched your stock drop from
		seventy-eight and a quarter to
		nineteen flat with no good and in
		sight.  And all along, we have held a
		significant product asset that we
		could have safely harvested and
		displayed for profit.  Enormous
		profit.

	He reaches out to a model on the table and gives it a shove,
	sending it sliding down the length of the table in front of
	them.  It's a mini-mall version of a zoo.  Cages hold tiny
	replicas of various kinds of dinosaurs while Boy Scout troops
	and Tourists look on in wonder.

				LUDLOW (cont'd)
		Enough money to wipe out four years
		of lawsuits and damage control and
		unpleasant infighting, enough to not
		only send our stock back to where it
		was but to double it.  And the one
		thing, the only thing standing
		between us and this asset is a
		born-again naturalist who happens to
		be our own CEO.  Well, I don't work
		for Mother Nature.  I work for you.

	Two of his Backbenchers distribute documents from a stack.
	Ludlow takes one and reads from it.

				LUDLOW (cont'd)
		"Whereas the Chief Executive
		Officer has engaged in wasteful and
		negligent business practices to
		further his own personal
		environmental beliefs --
		Whereas these practices have 
		affected the financial performance
		of the company by incurring
		significant losses --
		Whereas the shareholders have been
		materially harmed by these losses --
		Thereby, be it resolved that John
		Parker Hammond should be resolved from
		the office of Chief Executive
		Officer, affective immediately."  Mr.
		Chairman, I move the resolution be
		put to an immediate vote.  Do I have
		a second?

				BOARD MEMBER
		I second the motion,  Mr. Chairman,
		Please poll the members by a show of
		hands.

	The CHAIRMAN signs heavily, feeling like a traitor.  He can't
	bear to look at Hammond on the TV monitor.

				CHAIRMAN
		All those in favor of InGen Corporate
		Resolution 213C, please signify your
		approval by raising your right hand.

	It starts slowly, guiltily, but every hand in the room goes
	up.  Ludlow sits back, victorious.  Hammond, furious, raises
	his right hand, which holds a remote control, and points it at
	the TV screen.  It goes blank.

							CUT TO:

	EXT. WELDER'S YARD - NIGHT

	Sparks fly out the windows and doors of a shed in the middle
	of a welder's yard.  Scrap iron and steel lies everywhere.
	Somewhere inside the shed, a phone RINGS.

	The WHOOSH of the arc welder shuts off.  DIETER STARK, a big
	barrel-chested man of forty or so, his face streaked with soot
	and grime, steps outside with a cordless phone, a cigarette
	dangling from his lips.

				DIETER
		Yeah.

	He takes a deep drag while someone talks on the other end.  He
	smiles and blows out a cloud of smoke.

							CUT TO:
	INT. NEW YORK SUBWAY - NIGHT

	Smoke turns into steam as a subway THUNDER into a station
	underneath Manhattan.  The door WHOOSH open, spit out some
	COMMUTERS and suck up a few more.

	A tall man hurries down the platform, limping heavily, moving
	as fast as he can.  The subway doors begin to close, but just
	before they meet --

	-- the man jams a cane in between, stopping them.  The man
	is IAN MALCOLM, fortyish, dressed in black from head to toe.
	There's a hard wisdom in Malcolm's eyes that may not have been
	there's a few years ago -- he know what you think, and he
	doesn't care.

	INT. SUBWAY CAR - NIGHT

	MALCOLM finds a seat on the crowded subway car and sits down.
	He looks awful.  Tired.  Weathered.  He notices a CURIOUS MAN
	across from his is staring at his.  Malcolm looks away.  The
	Curious Man still stares.  Nervy, the Curious Man gets up and
	approaches.

				MALCOLM
			(under his breath)
		Shit.

	The Curious Man sits down next to Malcolm, grinning.

				MAN
		You're him, aren't you?

				MALCOLM
		Excuse me?

				MAN
		The guy.  The scientist.  I saw you
		on TV.
			(conspiratorially)
		I believed you.

	No response from Malcolm.  The guy leans in even closer.

				MAN (cont'd)
		Roooooarr.

				MALCOLM
			(a withering look)
		I was misquoted.  I was merely
		speculating on the evolutionary
		scenario of a Lost World.  I never
		said I was in any such place.

	He gets up and moves to another seat on the car, away from the
	Curious Man.  As he sits down, he notices two other COMMUTERS
	across from him are staring at him.

	He looks at them.  They looks away.

	He pulls the collar of his coat up tight around him.  Nowhere
	to hide.

	INT. JOHN HAMMOND'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

	A UNIFORMED BUTLER has a question:

				BUTLER
		Whom shall I tell Mr. Hammond is
		calling?

	MALCOLM stands in the foyer of an expensively decorated Park
	Avenue apartment.

				MALCOLM
		Ian Malcolm

	A door opens and a little dog comes YAPPING out of the back.
	It bounds straight at Malcolm, GROWLING, jaws SNAPPING.  It
	lunges --

	-- and Malcolm BATS it away with one swift swing of his cane.
	The dog rolls across the floor and slinks away, WHINING.  The
	Butler looks at Malcolm disapprovingly.
	
				BUTLER
		Not an animal lover?

				MALCOLM
		Not really.

	INT. HAMMOND'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

	MALCOLM enters a darkened bedroom.  JOHN HAMMOND lies in the
	bed we saw earlier, on the other side of the room;

	Medical equipment has been disguised as well as possible among
	the furniture and flowers, but the sheer abundance of it tells
	us that whatever has stricken him is going to win this battle.

				HAMMOND
		Ian!  Don't linger in the doorway
		like an ingenue, come in, come in!

	Malcolm steps further into the room.

				HAMMOND (cont'd)
		It's good to see you.  It really is.
		How's the leg?

				MALCOLM
		Resentful.

				HAMMOND
		When you have a lot of time to think,
		it's funny who you remember.  It's
		the people who challenged you.  It is
		the quality of our opponents that
		gives our accomplishments meaning.  I
		never told you how sorry I was about
		what happened after we returned.
	
	Noticing Hammond's deteriorated condition, Malcolm finds it
	hard to sustain anger.
	
				MALCOLM
		I didn't know you -- weren't well.
		
				HAMMOND
		It's the lawyers.  The lawyers are
		finally killing me.
		
				MALCOLM
		They do have motives.  Why did you
		want to see me?  Your message said it
		was urgent.
		
				HAMMOND
		You were right -- and I was wrong.
		There!  Did you ever think you'd hear
		me say that?  Spectacularly wrong.
		Instead of observing those animals, I
		tried to control them.  I squandered
		an opportunity and we still know next
		to nothing about their lives.  Not
		their lives as man would have them,
		behind electric fences, but in the
		wild.  Behavior in their natural
		habitat, the impossible dream of any
		paleontologist.  I could have had it,
		but I let it slip away.
			(pause)
		Thank God for Site B.
		
	Malcolm just looks at him for a long moment.
	
				MALCOLM
		What?
		
				HAMMOND
			(a spark in his eye)
		Well?  Didn't it all seem a trifle
		compact to you?
		
				MALCOLM
		What are you talking about?
	
				HAMMOND
		The hatchery, in particular?  You
		know my initial yields had to be low,
		far less than one percent, that's a
		thousand embryos for every single
		live birth.  Genetic engineering on
		that scale implies a giant operation,
		not the spotless little laboratory I
		showed you.

				MALCOLM
		I don't believe you.

				HAMMOND
		Isla Nublar was just a showroom, Ian,
		something for the tourists, Site B
		was the factory floor.  We built it
		first, on Isla Sorna, eight-some
		miles from Nublar.

				MALCOLM
		No, no, no, no, no, no . . .

				HAMMOND
		After the accident at the park, a
		hurricane wiped out our facility on
		Site B.  We had to evacuate and leave
		the animals to fend for themselves.
		And they did.  For four years I've
		fought to keep them safe from human
		meddling, now I want you to go there
		and document them.

				MALCOLM
		Are you out of your mind?  I still
		have nightmares, my reputation's a
		joke, my leg is shot -- you think I
		need more of that?

				HAMMOND
		It would be the most extraordinary
		living fossil record the world has
		ever seen.

				MALCOLM
		So what?

	Hammonnd picks up a thick file folder from the night table near
	to him and open it on his lap.  Inside, there are memos,
	charts, maps and photographs.

				HAMMOND
		I've been putting this together for
		over a year.
			(MORE)
		I have personal suggestions for your
		entire team, phone numbers, contact
		people.  They won't believe you about
		what they're going to see, so don't
		bother trying to convince them.  Just
		use my checkbook to get them there.
		I'll fund your expedition through my
		personal accounts, as such money and
		equipment as you need, but only if
		you leave immediately.  If we
		hesitate, all will be lost.

				MALCOLM
		John . . .

				HAMMOND
		You'll need an animal behaviorist,
		someone with unimpeachable
		credentials.  I believe you already
		know Sarah Harding.  She's got
		theories about parenting and
		nurturing among hunter/scavengers I
		bet she'd be dying to prove on a
		scale like this.  If you convince her
		to go, it'll be a major coup.  When
		she publishes, the scientific
		community must take it seriously.

	Malcolm just shakes his head, flipping through the file sadly.

				HAMMOND
		Your documentation, you should use
		forensic photographic methods,
		Hasselbladt still cameras, high
		definition video.  When the trick
		photography analysts take your
		evidence apart, make it impossible
		for them to say there was enhancement
		or computer graphic imaging.  Oh,
		this is very important -- avoid the
		island interior at all costs.  Stick
		to the outer rim.  Everything you
		need to know can be found there.
		Vindication lies on the outer rim.

	Malcolm gently closes the file and pushes it back to Hammond.

				MALCOLM
		I'm not going, John.

				HAMMOND
			(fatigue returning)
		Ian, you are my last chance to give
		something of real value to the world.
		I can't walk so far and leave no
		footprints; die and leave nothing
		with my name on it.  I will not  be
		known only for my failures.  And you
		will not allow yourself to go down in
		history as a lunatic.  You're too
		smart.  You'e too proud.  Dr.
		Malcolm.  Please.  This is a chance
		at redemption.  For both of us.
		There's no time to equivocate, we
		must seize it now, before --

	He stops, staring over Malcom's shoulder.  Malcom turns.
	PETER LUDLOW, still in his overcoat, is standing in the
	doorway to the bedroom.  He looks back and forth from Hammond
	to Malcolm suspiciously.

				LUDLOW
		Hello, Uncle John.  Dr. Malcolm.

	Malcolm doesn't answer.  He seems to know Ludlow, and dislikes
	him.

				LUDLOW (cont'd)
		Did I interrupt something?

	Malcolm turns back to Hammond.

				MALCOLM
		Find someone else.

							CUT TO:

	INT. HAMMOND'S APARTMENT/FOYER - NIGHT

	In the foyer, LUDLOW hands MALCOLM his coat, just a trifle
	rudely, and shepherds him to the door.

				LUDLOW
		So, you two were just, uh, telling
		old campfire stories, were you?

				MALCOLM
		Do me a favor.  Don't pretend for a
		second that you and I don't know the
		truth.  You can convince Time
		magazine and the Skeptical Inquirer
		of whatever you want, but I was 
		there.

				LUDLOW
		You signed a non-disclosure agreement
		before you went to the island that
		expressly forbade you from discussing
		anything you saw.  You violated that
		agreement.

				MALCOLM
		You cost me my livelihood.  That on
		which I relied to support my
		children.

				LUDLOW
		If your university felt you were
		causing it embarrassment by selling
		wild stories to Hard Copy, I hardly
		see how I am to--

				MALCOLM
		I didn't tell anything, I told the
		truth.

				LUDLOW
		You version of it.

				MALCOLM
		There are no versions of the truth!
		This isn't a corporate maneuver, it's
		my life.

				LUDLOW
		We made a generous compensatory offer
		for your injuries.

				MALCOLM
		It was a payoff and an insult.  InGen
		never--

				LUDLOW
		InGen is my livelihood, Dr.
		Malcolm, and I will jealously defend
		its interests.  People will know what
		I want them to know when I want them
		to know it.

	Ludlow tosses something to Malcolm, hard.  It sails across the
	foyer, upright, and Malcolm reaches out and catches it with
	one hand.  It's his cane.

				LUDLOW (cont'd)
		Don't forget that.

	Malcolm stares at him for a long moment.  Finally, he turns
	and walks away.

	But he does not out of the apartment.  Instead, he
	walks directly past Ludlow, crosses the living room, and steps
	back into Hammond's bedroom, closing the door behind him with
	a determined CLICK.

	INT. HAMMOND'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

	HAMMOND looks up, hopeful, as MALCOLM comes back into the room
	and walks over to his bed.  He reaches down --

	-- and picks up the file folder.

				MALCOLM
		Do you have a satellite phone?

	INT. MOMBASSA BAR - DAY

	ROLAND TEMBO, late sixties, skin like leather and the diamond
	hard look of a cobra, sits at a table in the middle of an
	African cafe/bar in Mombassa.

	It's daytime and the place is half full, mostly with locals,
	but there are a few obnoxious TOURISTS too, Americans on
	safari who somehow found the local handout.

	They're a noisy bunch, but Roland tunes them out, calmly
	eating his lunch and drinking a beer while he reads a book,
	eyeglasses hanging low on his nose.

	Roland suddenly stops reading and furrows his brow.  He looks
	up.  He SNIFFS the air once, then smiles and calls out a
	person's name.

				ROLAND
		Ajay?

	He turns around.  AJAY (AH-jay) SIDHU, a wiry East Indian in
	his late forties, is standing behind him, caught trying to
	sneak up.

				AJAY
			(delighted)
		How did you know?

				ROLAND
			(taps his nose)
		That cheap aftershave I send you
		every Christmas, you actually wear
		it.  I'm touched.  Sit down, sit
		down, what brings you to Mombassa?

				AJAY
		You.  Tell me, Roland, when was the
		last time you answered your phone?

				ROLAND
		Last time I plugged it in, I suppose.
		Why?

	Behind them, the group of TOURISTS, all men, laughs loudly.
	One of them, the MOST OBNOXIOUS TOURISTS, berates the WAITRESS.

				AJAY
		I got a call from a gentleman who's
		going to Costa Rica, or thereabouts.
		If he's to be believed, it's a most,
		uh, unique expedition.  And very
		well-funded.

				ROLAND
		Well, I'm a very well-funded old son
		of a bitch.  You go.

	The Most Obnoxious Tourist bellows for the Waitress.  His
	buddies LAUGHS.  Roland throws a glance, annoyed.

				AJAY
		But alone?  We always had great
		success together, you and I.

				ROLAND
		Just a little bit too much, I
		think.

				AJAY
		How do you mean?

				ROLAND
		A true hunter doesn't mind if the
		animal wins.  If it escapes.  But
		there weren't enough escapes from you
		and me, Ajay.  I've decided to spend
		a bit less time in the company of
		death.  Maybe I just feel too close
		to it my--

	The Waitress comes to the Tourists' table and the Most
	Obnoxious Tourist actually paws her ass.  Roland is out of his
	chair in a second.

				ROLAND (cont'd)
			(to Ajay)
		Excuse me.

	Romand walks over to the Tourists' table, says something to
	the Waitress in the local dialect, and she walks away, behind
	him.  He stares down at the Most Obnoxious Tourist.

				ROLAND (cont'd)
		You, sir -- are no gentleman.

				TOURIST
		Is that supposed to be an insult?

				ROLAND
		I can think of none greater.

	The Tourist looks at his Buddies and laughs.

				TOURIST
		Buzz off, you silly old bastard.

				ROLAND
		What do I have to do to pick a fight
		with you, bring your mother into it?

				TOURIST
		Are you kidding?  I could take you
		with one arm tied down.

				ROLAND
		Really?

	IN THE MIDDLE OF THE FLOOR,

	the Waiter finishes tying a man's wrist to his belt in the
	back of his pants with a napkin.  He pulls the knot tight and
	the man turns around.

	It's Roland, with his arm tied down.  The Tourist stands
	across from him.

				TOURIST
		I mean my arm.

	POW!  Roland punches him square in the jaw.  The Tourist
	reels, stunned.  Enraged, he lunges at Roland, swinging with
	both arms.

	Roland bobs, neatly ducking the punches, waits for the Tourist
	to turn around, and POPS him thrice in the face.  The Tourist
	spins and goes down to the floor, face first.  A cloud of
	sawdust and a loud CHEER from the locals rise up in the bar.

	BACK AT HIS TABLE,

	Roland drops the napkin on the table and sits back down with
	Ajay.  In the background, the Tourist's Buddies hurriedly
	carry their fallen cohort out of the bar.

				ROLAND
		Sorry.  We were saying?

				AJAY
		You broke that idiot's jaw for no
		reason other than your boredom.  Tell
		the truth, Roland.  Aren't you even
		interested in knowing this
		expedition's quarry?

				ROLAND
		Ajay.  Go on up to my ranch, take a
		look around the trophy room, and tell
		me what kind of quarry you think
		could possibly be of any interest
		to me.

	Ajay just smiles.

	EXT. AFRICAN SAVANNAH - NIGHT

	The African savannah appears in shades of fluorescent green,
	seen through night-vision goggles.  An ANIMAL YELP comes from
	the left and the green vista sweeps abruptly toward it.  The
	world blurs momentarily, then comes into focus on a field of
	long grass.

	The grass ripples in a complex pattern as animals move
	stealthily through it.  One animal head pops up above the
	grass for a split-second, teeth bared, a white stripe between
	its eyes.  SARAH HARDING pulls the goggles away from her face.

				SARAH
		Hyenas.  Ace Face is the striped
		snout.

	Sarah is thirty, with a compact, athletic body built for the
	outdoors.  She loos through the goggles again, sweeping ahead
	of the hyenas to their prey.

	It's a herd of African buffalo, standing belly-deep in the
	grass, agitated, bellowing and stamping their feet.

	Sarah turns to MAKENA, her African assistant.

				SARAH (cont'd)
		They'll try to take down a calf.
		Come on.

				MAKENA
		Closer?

	Sarah scurries up and over a rock face.  Makena follows.
	Closer now, they watch as the hyenas rush the herd, running
	through it, trying to break it up.

				MAKENA (cont'd)
		You know, we could see everything
		from up on the edge of that cliff.

				SARAH
		No way.

				MAKENA
		But the view would --

				SARAH
		No cliffs.
			(into a pocket recorder)
		F1 headed sough, F2 and F5 flanking,
		twenty yards.  F3 center.  F6
		circling wide east.  Can't see F7.

	While she talks, breathless, fascinated by the drama before
	her, Sarah continues to creep closer and closer to the action.
	Makena follows, with growing unease.

				MAKENA
		Sarah.

				SARAH
		F8 circling north.  F1 straight
		through, disrupting.  Herd moving,
		stamping.  There's F7.  Straight
		through.  F8 angling through from the
		north.

	She's practically on top of the animals now.

				MAKENA
		Dr. Harding.

	Makena has a hold of Sarah's sweatshirt and is tugging her
	back, at least trying to slow down her progress as Sarah,
	wide-eyed with fascination, creeps even closer.

	Suddenly there is a tremendous BELLOWING and the grass right
	in front of them rips apart, trampled under the feet of the
	hyenas as they cluster around a fallen buffalo calf.  They
	yelp and jump, their muzzles bloody.

	The adults move aside, making room as the hyena pups come
	forward, squealing to get at the kill.  Sarah's eyes shine
	with excitement and she moves even closer, whispering into the
	tape recorder.

				SARAH
		Brooding behavior in evidence at the
		kill site, pups are ushered forward
		and adults help them eat, pulling
		flesh away from the carcass and--

	A telephone rings.

	Sarah stops in mid-sentence, unsure if she heard what she
	thought she heard.  It rings again, the unmistakable CHIRPING
	of a cellular phone.  Sarah and Makena both move at once,
	pawing at a backpack.

				SARAH (cont'd)
			(a frantic whisper)
		I thought you turned it off!

	Two hyenas look inquisitively in the direction of the phone.
	Sarah comes up with it and jabs at a button in irritation.

				SARAH (cont'd)
		Yes?!

	Someone speaks on the other end.  Sarah rolls her eyes.

				SARAH (cont'd)
		Ian.  This better be important.

	Sarah doesn't say anything for a long moment, just listens as
	the voice on the other end talks.  And talks.

				SARAH (cont'd)
		When?

							CUT TO:

	INT. MOBILE FIELD SYSTEMS - DAY

	Ian Malcolm's leg, badly scarred, is bared and draped over the
	end of a bench.  Two sandbags are fastened to his ankle and
	MALCOLM is lifting them, painfully rehabbing his injury while
	talking on a satellite phone.

				MALCOLM
		We leave in twenty-four hours.  Five
		member team.

	Behind them, the SPARKS of a acetylene torch fly as WORKMEN
	make modifications on several vehicles, including a dark-green
	Mercedes Benz AAV (all-activity vehicle).  The hood of the AAV
	is up and the V-6 engine has been pulled out; a new, smaller
	engine is lowered in its place.  To one side are two long
	trailers, connected by an accordion-like passageway, like on a
	subway car, allowing one to be towed behind the other.

				MALCOLM
		Eddie Carr's handling all our
		equipment and he'll be there to
		maintain it.  He's designing special
		field trailers now, top of the line
		mobile research units.

	EDDIE CARR, fortyish, is barking out orders to the Workmen.

				EDDIE
		No, no, look at the plans, Henry,
		you can't place that strut laterally,
		it has to be crosswise, LOOK AT THE
		PLANS!

	From the ceiling, a large metal age CRASHES down, landing
	next to them on the floor with a deafening CLANG.  They leap
	back and look up.  A WORKMAN waves from a scaffolding.

				WORKMAN
		Sorry, Eddie!  Specs say it can't
		deform at 12,000 PSI, we had to test
		it

	Eddie bends down to inspect the cage, which is rectangular,
	constructed of inch-thick titanium-alloy bars.  Malcolm hangs
	up the phone and walks up, joining him.

				MALCOLM
		Any damage?

				EDDIE
		Minimal.

				MALCOLM
		"Minimal" is too much.   It has to be
		light, it has to be strong --

				EDDIE
		Light and strong, light and strong,
		sure, why not, it's only impossible.
		God save me from academics.

				MALCOLM
		You are an academic.

				EDDIE
		Former academic.  Now I actually make
		things.  I don't just talk.

				MALCOLM
		You think I'm all talk, Eddie?

				EDDIE
			(doesn't look at him)
		It doesn't matter what I think.

				MALCOLM
		Is there anything we've forgotten?
		Anything at all?

	Behind them, someone CLEARS THEIR THROAT.  Eddie and Malcolm
	turn around.  KELLY MALCOLM, an African-American girl around
	twelve years old, stands in the doorway to the garage, a
	duffel bag slung over one shoulder.  She looks at Malcolm and
	breaks into a wide grin.

				KELLY
		Hi, Dad.

				MALCOLM
		Kelly!  What are you doing here?

	She drops the bag on the floor, and wraps her arms around him
	in a warm embrace.  He responds stiffly.

				KELLY
		Vacation.  I'm all yours.  You didn't
		forget, did you?

	She pulls back and looks at him.

				KELLY (cont'd)
		Did you?

							CUT TO:

	INT. EDDIE'S OFFICE - DAY

	KELLY is slumped in a chair in Eddie's office next to the
	construction floor.  Outside the glass windows work on the
	vehicles continues unabated.  MALCOLM hangs up the phone.

				MALCOLM
		Okay, Karen is expecting you in half
		an hour.  You only have to stay with
		her one night, she'll put you on a
		bus in the morning and your mother
		will be at the station when you get
		there.

				KELLY
		I don't even know this woman.

				MALCOLM
		Well, I do, and she's fantastic.
		She'll take you to the museum, maybe
		to a movie if you play your cards
		right.  You're going to have a
		fantastic time.

				KELLY
		Stop saying fantastic.  Where are you
		going?

				MALCOLM
		I can't tell you.  But I'll be back
		within a week.

				KELLY
		My vacation is over in a week.

				MALCOLM
		I'll make it up to you this summer.
		I promise.

				KELLY
		I'm your daughter all the time, you
		know.  Not just when it's convenient.

				MALCOLM
		Very hurtful.  Your mother tell you
		to say that?

				KELLY
		No, Dad.  I have thoughts of my own
		once in a while.

	From the construction floor, EDDIE calls out.

				EDDIE (o.s.)
		Dr. Malcolm!

	Malcolm looks at her, trying to make peace.  Quickly.

				MALCOLM
		Is that kid still bothering you?

				KELLY
		Which one?

				MALCOLM
		You know, at the bus stop.  With the
		hair?

				KELLY
		That was about a year ago.

				MALCOLM
		Well, is he?

				KELLY
		No.  Richard talked to his parents.

				MALCOLM
		That Richard.

				EDDIE (o.s.)
		Ian, come here a minute!

				KELLY
			(to Malcolm)
		I could come with you.

				MALCOLM
		Out of the question.  You'd miss the
		gymnastics trials.  You've been
		training for that for a year.

				KELLY
		I don't care about the trials, I
		want to be with you.  I could be your
		research assistant, like I was in
		Austin.

				MALCOLM
		This is nothing like Austin.  Forget
		about it.

				KELLY
		You like to have kids, you just
		don't want to be with them, do you?

	He looks at her, hurt.  Eddie calls out a third time,
	impatient now.  Grateful for the escape, Malcolm gets up and
	heads for the door.  He pauses guiltily.

				MALCOLM
		I'm not like you wan me to be.  I've
		what I can be.

	He leaves.

	INT. MAIN FLOOR - DAY

	While MALCOLM and EDDIE argue over something in the
	background, KELLY circles around the trailers and looks up at
	the windows.  They're all made of tempered glass, fine wire
	mesh inside it.  She looks around, to see if anybody's
	watching.  They're not, so she quickly slips inside the front
	trailer.

	INT. TRAILER - DAY

	Inside, the trailer is a miracle of planning and design.  It's
	divided into sections, for different laboratory functions.
	The main area is a biological lab, with specimen trays,
	dissecting pans, and microscopes that connect to video
	monitors.

	Next to it there's an extensive computer section, a bank of
	processors, and a communications section.  All the lab
	equipment is miniaturized and built into small tables that
	slides into the walls.  Everything is bolted down.

	She notices a large map on the wall.  Off the coat of Costa
	Rica, there is an area that has been circled in heavy black
	ink.

	Kelly puts a finger on the map, crossing westward, through the
	Pacific Ocean.  Thegre are dozen s of islands out here, but in
	the highlighted region, there is a semi-circle of five.
	Matanceros.  Muerte.  Tacano.  Pena.  And Sorna.  Underneath
	the whole island chain, there is a bold legend.

	"The Five Deaths," it says.

	Slowly, an ocean barge starts to chug its way across the
	face of the map, leaving a wake that rolls the printed letters
	of those three ominous words.

							DISSOLVE TO:

	EXT. OPEN SEA - DAY

	The map dissolves slowly away as the barge SPALASEHS through
	five foot ocean swells in the open sea.  The barge is crammed
	with equipment, the AAV, trailers, a jeep, and the members of
	Malcolm's team.

	ON THE BOAT,

	MALCOLM stands in the bow, riding the choppy seas.  Next to
	him, DR. JUTTSON, fortyish, holds onto the railing,
	seasick.  He SHOUTS over the DRONE of the boat's engines.

				JUTTISON
			(as the waves pound the
			 boat)
		Couldn't -- we just -- airlift --
		into the -- island?

				MALCOLM
		Dr. Harding insisted we go by sea!
		Helicopters are too disruptive.
		These aren't piles of bones you'll be
		studying this time, Dr. Juttson, they
		live, they breathe, and they react!

	Juttson looks at him skeptically --

	-- and throws up.

	AT THE BACK OF THE BOAT,

	NICK VAN OWEN, a good-looking American in his late
	twenties, is sitting amid a pile of video cameras and other
	photographic equipment, playing with a Game Bow.  SARAH
	HARDING, dressed in field gear, sits down next to him.

				SARAH
		So what's your story, Nick?

				NICK
		I was a cameraman for Nightline for
		six years, been freelance since '91.
		Do a lot of work for Greenpeace.

				SARAH
		That must be interesting.  What drew
		you there?

				NICK
		Women.  'Bout eighty percent female
		in Greenpeace.

				SARAH
		Very noble of you.
			(of the noisy Game Boy)
		You don't think you're bringing that
		thing onto the island, do you?

	Nick grins and shuts it off.

				NICK
		Hey, I wouldn't want to spook the
		woolly mammoths.

				SARAH
		You think this is all a joke?

				NICK
		Oh, please.  How am I supposed to
		keep a straight face when --
			(gestures to the
			 black-clad Malcolm)
		-- Johnny Cash here tells me I'm
		going to Skull Island?

				SARAH
			(not amused)
		Ian's a very good friend of mine.

				NICK
		He doesn't need a friend, he needs a
		shrink.

				SARAH
		I believe in him.

	But her face says even she has her doubts.

				NICK
		Come on, there's only one reason any
		of us are here.  His check cleared.

	She looks at him.

				SARAH
		Drop the cynical pose.  You can't
		pull it off while playing Donkey
		Kong.

	The boat's CAPTAIN, a Costa Rican, points ahead and SHOUTS to
	them.

				CAPTAIN
		There it is!

	They all turn and look out over the bow.  Up ahead, shear,
	reddish-gray cliffs of volcanic rock rise dramatically out of
	the fog-heavy ocean.

				CAPTAIN (cont'd)
		Isla Sorna!

	The boat ROARS ahead, plowing into a heavy wreath of fog.  The
	mist swirls and encircles it.

	EXT. ISLAND FIORD - DAY

	A narrow inlet cuts through the steep cliffs, leading to the
	island interior.  The barge bursts through the fog at the
	mouth of the fiord and heads deeper into the island.

	EXT. LAGOON - DAY

	Lush green plants drip everywhere in this verdant lagoon.
	Sulfurous yellow steam issues from the ground, bleaching the
	nearby foliage white.  In the distance one can hear the cries
	of JUNGLE BIRDS.

	The boat is now beached and the CREW flips the tarps off the
	AAV, the jeep, and the trailers.  The trucks back down a
	narrow ramp and onto the soft clay shore at the edge of the
	lagoon.  There is a large three-toad animal imprint in the
	clay at the water's edge, and the AAV backs right over it,
	swapping its track for the animal's.

	MALCOLM is at the edge of the water with the CAPTAIN.

				MALCOLM
		Be back in three days, but keep the
		satellite phone on and your radio
		tuned to the frequency I specified in
		case we need you sooner.

				CAPTAIN
		Don't worry.  I've lived around here
		all my life, these islands are
		completely --

	In the distance, they hear the faint, strange ROAR of a very
	large animal.  The Captain looks at Malcolm, eyes wide.

				CAPTAIN (cont'd)
		-- safe.

							CUT TO:

	EXT. GRASSY PLAIN - DAY

	The jeep tows the double trailer to the edge of a grassy plain
	just beyond the lagoon, overlooking the interior of the
	island.  The noon sun is high overhead; below, the valley
	shimmers in midday heat.

	EDDIE connects a flexible cable to the jeep's power winch and
	flicks it on.  The cable turns slowly in the sunlight.  Moving
	along the length of it, we see the cable leads to a pile of
	aluminum, some kind of strut assembly painted a camouflage
	color.

	As the winch pulls the cable tight, the jumble of thin struts
	begins to move, slowly rising into the air.  The emerging
	structure climbs, spidery, struts unfolding, fifteen feet into
	the air.  The light house at the top (the cage that was
	tested back at Eddie's workshop) is now just beneath the
	lowest branches of the nearby trees, which almost conceal it
	from view.

	NICK lights a cigarette and carelessly tosses the match on the
	ground.  Malcolm notices.

				MALCOLM
		Listen.  I know you all have probably
		concluded that I'm out of my mind.

	Is it our imagination, or did the trees behind Malcolm just
	sway slightly?

				MALCOLM (cont'd)
		That's all right, for now.  But just
		humor me and be careful.

	No, it's not our imagination, there they go again.  Whole
	trees shivering and swaying from left to right and back
	again.

				MALCOLM (cont'd)
		Even if you think I'm harmless and
		deluded, I promise --

	Now the trees CREAKS and GROAN as they sway.  Everyone has seen
	it, and now Malcolm turns around too.

				MALCOLM (cont'd)
		-- this place is for real.

							CUT TO:

	INT. DOUBLE TRAILERS - DAY

	It's quiet inside the trailers that serve as their command
	post/living quarters.  The books are lined up neatly on the
	shelves.  The computers sit, booted up and awaiting data
	input.

	All the way in the back, past the spare tires and life
	preservers and canned food and bottled water, up in one
	storage bin all the way on top, there's a RUSTLING SOUND.

	A plastic student ID card pops out in the cracks under the
	bin's door.  A photograph in the lower right hand corner of
	the card is visible -- it's Kelly, Malcolm's twelve-year-old
	daughter.

	The card wriggles against the lock and, with a soft CLICK, the
	door pops open.  KELLY herself tumbles out, wrapped in several
	blankets and carrying a mason jar half full of a yellowish
	liquid.  We can guess.

	She leaps to her feet, blinks the light out of her eyes, and
	bolts to the back of the trailer as fast as she possibly can.
	She races through a narrow door and SLAMS it shut.

	A sign on the door says "RESTROOM."  Inside, a SIGH of relief
	is heard.

							CUT TO:

	EXT. JUNGLE TRAIL - DAY

	Along a stream bed, the jungle trees still shiver.  NICK loads
	a three quarter inch tape into his heavy video camera and
	chews anxiously on a piece of gum.  SARAH and DR. JUTTSON are
	beside him as the group nervously follows the GROANING forest
	trees to their right.

	At the rear, EDDIE and MALCOLM walk side by side.  Eddie is
	carrying a heavy silver rifle, an aluminum canister hanging
	beneath the barrel.  He shows it to Malcolm, his voice low and
	urgent.

				EDDIE
		Lindstradt air rifle.  Fires a
		subsonic Fluger impact-delivery dart.

	He cracks open the cartridge bank, revealing a row of plastic
	containers filled with straw-colored liquid.  Each is tipped
	with a three inch needle and carries a bright yellow warning
	tag -- "EXTREME DANGER!  LETHAL TOXICITY!"

				EDDIE (cont'd)
		I loaded the enhanced venom of Conus
		purpurascens, the South Sea cone
		shell.  Most powerful neurotoxin in
		the world.  Acts within a
		two-thousandth of a second.  Faster
		than the nerve-conduction velocity.
		The animal's down before it feels the
		prick of the dart.

	From their right, the shaking trees seen closer now.  By
	walking down the stream bed, the humans are tracking right
	along with the animals as they move in the foliage.

				MALCOLM
			(to Eddie)
		Is there an antidote?

				EDDIE
		Like if you shoot yourself in the
		foot?  Wouldn't matter.  You'd be
		dead  before you realized you'd
		accidentally pulled the trigger.

	Ahead of them, thick foliage blocks the path of the dried up
	stream bed to the height of about fifteen feet.  But around
	them, the CRASHING sounds get louder and closer, the swaying
	trees shiver right beside them.  Eddie raises the rifle in
	defense as the trees right at the edge of the stream bed sway
	and part.  Above the foliage, they see the sudden
	movement --

	-- of a row of STEGOSAUR fins.  The spade-shaped fins run
	along a ridge down the middle of the animal's back, about
	three feet tall each.  The group freezes, amazed, and as the
	stegosaur continues on, they get a good look at it through a
	break in the foliage.

	It's a large dinosaur with a small head, a thick neck, and a
	huge lumbering body.

	A double row of plates runs along the crest of its back, and
	it has a dragging trail with long spikes in it.

	The gum drops out of Nick's mouth, FLOPS onto his shirt, and
	sticks there.

				NICK
		Oh --

				JUTTSON
		-- my --

				EDDIE
		-- God!

				SARAH
		It's beautiful!

	A second stegosaur, a baby about a quarter the size of the
	first animal, breaks through the foliage, following the adult.

	While the group is reaching to that, the earth vibrates and
	a third stego, by far the biggest of the three, walks out of
	the foliage right behind them, crossing within ten feet.

	Apparently unconcerned about these little creatures in their
	environment, the stegos continue on across the stream bed.

	Sarah raises a still camera and shoots pictures.  Her shutter
	is muted, so that a muffled CLICK is all that's audible.

	Juttson raises a pocket recorder to his lips and whispers into
	it breathlessly.

				JUTTSON
		Stegosaurus, family Stegosauridae,
		infraorder Stegosauria, suborder
		Thyreophora.  Length, adult male,
		estimate twenty-five to thirty feet.

	His breathy words turn into almost helpless laughter, of all
	things, as he can't contain his astonishment.  Eddie covers
	his mouth, trying to keep him quiet.

				SARAH
			(to Juttsn)
		That was a pair bond!  A family
		group, even, long after that infant
		was nestbound!

				JUTTSON
		I want to see the nesting ground!

	Nick turns to Malcolm, eyes like saucers, and makes a futile,
	wordless, boy-was-I-wrong-on-this-one gesture.  Malcolm
	smiles, leans over, and TAPS softly on Nick's video camera.
	Nick raises it to his shoulder and flicks it on as the group
	continues on into the bush after the animals.

	IN THE BUSH,

	the baby wanders away from the group and ambles over near
	where Sarah crouches in the bushes.  Sarah raises her camera
	again and silently SNAPS a picture.  She WHISPERS to Juttson,
	who is beside her.

				SARAH
		Lone nest -- not colonial.  I don't
		see an egg clutch...

	She gestures and Juttson peers through a pair of field
	glasses.

				JUTTSON
			(whispering back)
		The empty shells are crushed and
		trampled.  The young stay in the
		birth environment, that's conclusive!

				SARAH
		Not without a shot of the nest.

	She sees an opportunity.  As the baby heads back to its
	parents, Sarah scoots right along with it, moving behind it,
	using its body as a shield to block her from the view of the
	other two.

	Nick and Eddie's faces whiten in alarm.  Nick reaches out to
	stop her, but he barely gets hold of the sole of her boot
	before she pulls away from him and duckwalks out into the
	clearing.

	IN THE CLEARING,

	Sarah slinks along behind the baby stego as it walks back,
	toward the nest, chewing the branches it carries in its south.
	She raises up sightly, squeezing off pictures of the herd,
	ever better as she gets closer.

	BACK AT THE HILL,

	the others can only watch her, aghast.

				NICK
		She's gutty.

				MALCOLM
		She's nuts.

	IN THE CLEARING,

	Sarah keeps moving closer.  The baby passes a small grouping
	of rocks and Sarah ducks behind them.  She's now in a perfect
	position to photograph the nest, and she squeezes off picture
	after picture from this ideal vantage point.

	She shoots the last picture on the roll --

	-- and the camera's autowinder WHIRS to life.  Sarah looks
	down in horror as the camera's motor WHINES loudly in her
	hands.

	Th noise startles the animals.  The male turns toward her
	the plates on its back bristling.  Sarah gets to her feet and
	starts to move away, slowly.

	The male turns away from her and swings its tail, spikes
	extended.  It WHIZZES through the air, right at her, but Sarah
	leaps back at the last second --

	-- and the tail's spikes THUD into the dirt where she was.

	Sarah CRUNCHES to the ground and the three stegosaurs dart
	away, disappearing into the bush, moving surprisingly quickly
	for animals their size.

	The others run to Sarah, help her to her feet, and pull her
	back, against a massive tree trunk.  But the tree trunk lifts
	right up off the ground.

	It's no tree, it's a DINOSAUR'S LEG, a massive one, six feet
	across, God knows how many feet high.  The Group gasps and
	looks up as a MAKENCHIASAURUS, an enormous saurupod over a
	hundred feet from nose to tail,  lumbers away from them.

	The Group stares in wonder as the mamenchiasaur stops and
	HONKS furtively, its long neck stretched out above them.

	Now a second mamenchiasaur neck cranes out of the
	surrounding forest trees and wraps around the first.  The
	first mamenchiasaur THUNDERS around in a semi-circle, getting
	into position behind the second.

	Nick swings his video camera straight up and the group
	suddenly finds itself in the middle of a mamenchiasaur mating.

	The mighty tails swing and SNAP around them as the two animals
	come together, and trees start snapping and falling, CRASHING
	to the jungle floor.

	The group panics and bolts for cover toward the only place
	where the trees are not falling -- which is directly underneath
	the animals!

	Amid HONKS and BLEATS, the swinging tails continue to deforest
	the jungle around them.

	The noise and chaos is deafening, drowning out the LAUGHTER
	and SCREAMS of the fascinated and terrified group.

	There is a momentary lull and the group dashes out from
	underneath the animals, disappearing into the thick forest.

	A SHORT DISTANCE AWAY,

	the Group collapses to the ground, breathless, chests heaving
	with wild, frightened laughter.  Sarah goes to Malcolm and
	throws her arms around him, exhilarated.

				SARAH
		Ian, you're not insane!  I'm so
		glad!

				JUTTSON
			(out of breath)
		Dr. Malcolm -- the world -- owes you
		an apology.

							CUT TO:

	EXT. JUNGLE TRAIL - DAY

	Suddenly, the Gathereres are taking their expedition a lot more
	seriously.  They march quickly back to base camp, their energy
	and excitement palpable.  NICK strikes a match and raises it
	to a cigarette with a shaking hand, but SARAH leans in and
	blows it out.

				SARAH
		No more smoking.  We leave no scent
		of any kind.  No hair tonics, no
		cologne, seal all our food in plastic
		bags.  We will observe and document,
		but we will not interact.

				MALCOLM
		That's a scientific impossibility,
		you know.  Heisenberg uncertainty
		principle.  Whatever you study, you
		also change.

	Nick ejects the used videotape from his camera and pulls out a
	sharpie, to label it.

				NICK
		What should I call this?  "Jurassic
		Pork?"

	Eddie, next to him, laughs.

				SARAH
			(still to Malcolm)
		And let's forget about the high hide.
		We can't do this kind of work up in a
		tower, we need to be out in the
		field, as close to the animals as
		possible.

				JUTTSON
		I'm not surprised stegosaur lived in
		a family group, but there's never
		been anything in the fossil record to
		prove the carnivores did.

				SARAH
		Why wouldn't they?  Look at hyenas,
		jackals, nearly all species of
		predator birds --

				JUTTSON
		That doesn't say a thing about T-rex,
		they could have been rogues.  Robert
		Burke certainly thinks they were.

				SARAH
		We've got to see one to find out.
		Is there any --

				MALCOLM
		No way.

				NICK
		Oh, my God.

				SARAH
		-- way we could safely --

				NICK
		Oh, no!

	He takes off, running as fast as he can, down the trail,
	toward base camp.  They look ahead, in the direction Nick is
	running.  A plume of black smoke is rising up over the trees.

				EDDIE
		Fire!

							CUT TO:

	EXT. BASE CAMP - DAY

	NICK bursts out of the trees and races toward the thick plume
	of smoke.  In the middle of the base camp, someone has neatly
	built a campfire surrounded by stones.  Flames burn in the
	middle.

	Nick races over to it and stomps it out as the OTHERS emerge
	from the trees behind him.

				MALCOLM
		A campfire?!

	Nick grabs a jug of water, but Sarah steps in.

				SARAH
		No!  Water mixes the smoke billow,
		use dirt!

	They start to kick and rake dirt onto the fire with their
	hands and feet.  Eddie and Dr. Juttson jump in and help out.

				MALCOLM
		Who the hell started a campfire?!

				VOICE (o.s.)
		It was just to make lunch.

	Malcolm turns toward the source of the voice.  KELLY stands in
	the doorway of the trailer, sheepish.

				KELLY (cont'd)
			I wanted it ready when you got back.

	The whole group stares, stunned, none more so than Malcolm
	himself.

				MALCOLM
		Oh ... man.

							CUT TO:

	EXT. BASE CAMP - LATER

	Later, and base camp is a blur of activity.  SARAH, JUTTSON,
	NICK, and EDDIE are hard at work, burying the remains of the
	fire, sealing their food in plastic bags, loading camera
	equipment, packing up specimen containers and other
	information-gathering equipment.

	MALCOLM, meanwhile, is lecturing Kelly.

				MALCOLM
		You know you were putting yourself in
		a potentially dangerous situation,
		but you didn't bother to find out
		how dangerous before you leapt in.
		You don't have the faintest idea
		what's going on on this island!

				SARAH
			(loading a backpack)
		What do you want to do, Ian, lock her
		up for curiosity?  Where do you think
		she gets it?

				JUTTSON
			(to Nick)
		Do you have chromium tapes?  The
		others fog in high-

				NICK
		-humidity, I know.
			(waving a tape)
		Highest lead density on the market.

				EDDIE
			(to Malcolm)
		We've got a lot of heavy marching
		ahead of us.  I'm not carrying 
		anybody.

				KELLY
		I can keep up.

				MALCOLM
		You're going home.  I'm sending a
		radio call for the boats.  We'll all
		go down to the lagoon and wait for
		them.

				SARAH
		Lighten up, Ian, you sound like a
		high school vice-principal.

				MALCOLM
		I'm her father.

				KELLY
		Sure, now.

	Nick leans over and whispers to Eddie, gesturing to Malcolm
	and Kelly.

				NICK
		Do you see any family resemblance
		here?

				MALCOLM
		You can't stay, Kelly, that's it.
		It's too dangerous.

				SARAH
		If it's so dangerous, why'd you bring
		any of us?

				KELLY
		You're wrong, Dad.  I do know
		what's going on on this island.

				MALCOLM
		How could you possibly?

				KELLY
		Because you said so.  Maybe nobody
		else believed you, but I always
		did.

	He looks at her, touched.  Nick mutters to Eddie again.

				NICK
		The kid scores with cheap sentiment.

				SARAH
		Ian, if we recall the boat now, we've
		made two invasive landings in one
		day.  That'll have to go in any paper
		I write, and it will leave room for
		people to say our findings were
		contaminated.  You know the academic
		world as well as I do, once they
		smell blood in the water, you're
		dead.  Our presence has got to be one
		hundred percent antiseptic.  That
		means if we bend a blade of grass, we
		bend it right back the way it-

	A low sound has been rising while she speaks, and now it comes
	BOOMING over the jungle around them, a THUNDEROUS racket that
	shakes the very ground beneath them.  Suddenly, three C-130
	military cargo planes THUNDER overhead and ROAR toward the
	island interior, flying very low.  The planes are enormous,
	fat-assed creatures, their rear cargo doors hanging open.

	AT A RIDGE,

	the members of the gatherer expedition hit the dirt and peer
	over a ledge, watching as the airplanes bank and circle over a
	specific spot.

	Eddie raises a pair of field glasses.

	DOWN BELOW,

	huge metal equipment containers are shoved out the back of the
	cargo bays.  They SNAP off trees like matchsticks, CRUSH flat
	anything foolish enough to exist where they want to land.

	Now MEN pour out the rear of the planes, their low-altitude
	parachutes billowing open behind them.

	UP ON THE RIDGE,

	Nick looks at Sarah.

				NICK
		You were saying something about
		antiseptic?

							CUT TO:

	EXT. HUNTERS' CAMP - DAY

	Metal container doors CLANG to the ground, jeep engines ROAR
	to life in a cloud of thick black diesel smoke, blue laser
	barriers SIZZLE and BURN through foliage as this group of
	HUNTERS establishes a perimeter around their new camp.

	PETER LUDLOW, dressed in brand new Banana Republic safari
	wear, steps into the center of the camp and surveys the
	surroundings.  He turns to DR. ROBERT BURKE, a ragged,
	pony-tailed man in wire-rimmed glasses.

				LUDLOW
		Welcome to your dream come true, Dr.
		Burke.

	Burke has a detailed set of satellite recon photographs that
	he spreads out on the hood of a jeep.

				BURKE
		I believe the large herbivores forage
		in open plains, like bison, which
		would explain the great variety of
		heat dots we're reading in the
		flatlands around this waterhole.
		Right -- here.

				LUDLOW
		Then that's where we're going.

	Burke flips open a manifest that he will carry with him at all
	times.  Inside, there are dozens of sketches of various kinds
	underneath.  As each vehicle ROARS out of the equipment
	container, Burke slips a waterproof eight by ten card with an
	icon of the various dinosaurs on the island into a slot in the
	dashboard.

				BURKE
			(calling them off)
		Hadrosaurus!  Carinthosaurus!
		Maiasaurus!

	As the procession goes on, Ludlow turns to DIETER STARK, the
	man we saw welding earlier.

				LUDLOW
		This is as good a place as any for
		base camp.  First priority is the
		laser barriers, I want them all up
		and running in thirty minutes.  Half
		an hour, understand?

	Dieter nods and turns to some of the HUNTERS, who number about
	twenty in all, that are working nearby.  But someone steps in
	front of Dieter, cutting him off.  It's ROLAND TEMBO, the
	hunter from the bar in Mombassa.

				ROLAND
		Cancel that, Dieter.

				LUDLOW
		What?  Why?

	Roland points to a stream running nearby.

				ROLAND
		Carnivores hunt near stream beds.  Do
		you want to set up base camp or an
		all-you-can-eat people bar?

				LUDLOW
			(thinks)
		You heard his, Dieter.  Find a new
		spot.  And remember, we're after
		herbivores only -- no unnecessary
		risks.

	Dieter SIGHS and goes to work.  Roland puts an arm around
	Ludlow and pulls him aside.

				ROLAND
		Peter, if you want me to run your
		little camping trip, there are two
		conditions.  First -- I'm in
		charge, and when I'm not around,
		Dieter is.  Your job is to sign the
		checks, tell us we're doing a good
		job, and open your case of scotch
		when we have a good day.  Second
		condition -- my fee.  You can keep
		it.  All I want in exchange for my
		services is the right to hunt one of
		the tyrannosaurs.  A male.  Buck
		only.  Why and how are my business.
		If you don't  like either of those
		conditions, you're on your own.  Go
		ahead and set up your camp right
		here, or in a swamp, or in the middle
		of a rex nest, for all I care.  But
		I've been on too many safaris with
		rich dentists to listen to any more
		suicidal ideas.  Okay?

				LUDLOW
			(what else can he say?)
		Okay.

				ROLAND
		Good lad.

							CUT TO:

	EXT. JUNGLE

	The jungle foliage shivers, quakes, and finally falls as the
	Hunters' convoy ROARS into the hart of the jungle.  DIETER
	STARK stands in the front of the lead vehicle, the
	"speedbird," waving the convoy forward, his Driver (CARTER) at
	the wheel beside him.

	LUDLOW is in the back seat of the speedbird next to DR. BURKE.
	ROLAND and AJAY, his tracker, are in the second jeep.  They
	look up as the brakelights on the speedbird flash and the car
	stops, forcing the rest of the convoy to halt as well.

	In the front, the speedbird flashes its lights at something in
	front of it.  Dieter climbs out, plainly irritated.  He walks
	around the front of the car and sees --

	-- four PACHYCEPHALOSAURS eating grass in the middle of the
	jungle trail.  They're about five feet tall, thick, heavy-set
	animals whose distinctive feature is an enormous skull casing,
	a tall, impressive crown that rises on the tops of their
	heads.  Dieter doesn't seem impressed.  He looks back at
	Ludlow, who look at Dr. Burke.

	Burke stands up in his seat, a look of wonder on his face.

				BURKE
		Pachycephalosaurus!

				LUDLOW
		Carnivore?

				BURKE
			(enchanted)
		Huh?  No!  No, herbivore, late
		Cretaceous.  Very unusual plant
		eater, see that distinctive domed
		skull?  That's nine inches of solid
		bone.

				LUDLOW
			(who cares?)
		Just get them out of the way, Dieter.

				DIETER
		COME ON, MOVE IT!!

	The pachys look up at him sluggishly, still eating, like cows
	chewing their cuds.  As unimpressive with him as he is with
	them, they go back to their grass.

				DIETER (cont'd)
		Oh, for God's --

	He slings his rifle off his  shoulder and aims it at the
	closest animal.  Behind him, Roland has climbed out of the
	second jeep.

				ROLAND
		Dieter.  This is a round-up, not a
		war.  Use your powers of persuasion.

	Dieter gestures to the speedbird to pull ahead, which it does,
	slowly, toward the animals.  The pachys look up, alert, but do
	not move.  Dieter walks toward them.

				DIETER
		Come on, come on, don't have all
		day!

				BURKE
			(going on to no one in
			 particular)
		See, the pachy's neck attaches at the
		bottom of its skull instead of the
		back of its head, as with reptiles.

	The speedbird draws closer.  The first pachy stares at it
	intently.  The lead vehicle gets closer, closer --

	-- and BANGS into the pachy, knocking it back a few feet, out
	of the way.

				BURKE (cont'd)
		So when it lowers its head, its neck
		lines up directly with its
		backbone --

	BEHIND DIETER,

	Ajay is staring at something on the ground at his feet.  He
	takes a few steps further into the foliage, then turns back
	toward Roland.

				AJAY
		Roland.

	UP AT THE FRONT,

	the pachys turn and hop away.  Dieter turns and heads back to
	the speedbird.  As he reaches for the door, a VOICE calls
	"look out!" from behind him.  Dieter spins around, just in
	time to see --

	-- the first pachy in full charge.  It SLAMS headfirst into
	the speedbird, SMASHING the headlights and denting the grill.

				BURKE
			(concluding his lecture)
		Which is perfect for absorbing
		impact.

	Dieter turns and runs around to the front of the car.  The
	pachy has backed up  for another run and is now CHARGING RIGHT
	AT HIM.

	Dieter retreats, quickly, and rips open the passenger door to
	protect himself.

	SLAM!  The pachy clobbers the door, sending Dieter flying
	against the car, knocking the wind out of him.

	In the other jeeps, the rest of the HUNTERS stand up or lean
	out the window for a better look, laughing.

	POW!!  The pachy head-butts the tire next to Dieter.  It
	bounces off, tumbles to the ground, and rolls to its feet as
	Dieter gets to his knees and crawls toward the back of the
	speedbird.

	But the pachy is quicker and lunges at Dieter again.  He's
	forced to hit the dirt and crawls quickly underneath the
	speedbird, just as the animal SLAMS into the rear of the
	vehicle.

	Now the other three animals join the jun.  Ludlow and the
	Driver have to cover their heads as the animals lunge at the
	car again and again, SMASHING the steel-meshed windows and
	MANGLING the quarter panels.  The rest of the group watches,
	vastly amused.

	A FEW STEPS INTO THE JUNGLE,

	Ajay and Roland are staring at something on the ground -- an
	animal footprint, three-toed, enormous.

				AJAY
		It matches the pictures.

				ROLAND
		It certainly does.

	Roland gets up and goes back to his vehicle, ignoring the
	pachy demolition derby that continues up at the speedbird.
	Roland opens a case in the back of the jeep, revealing --

	-- his gun.  It's an antique elephant gun, a double barreled
	.600 Nitro Express.  Nearly a hundred years old, it's still in
	immaculate condition, its rosewood stock buttery smooth,
	bisons delicately engraved along its silver breach.

	The barrels are twenty-four inches long, topped with an ivory
	bead foresight at the business end.  Roland scoops up the gun,
	breaks the breach, and pulls two rounds of ammunition from his
	shirt pocket.

	Four inches long and three-quarters of an inch in diameter,
	these are the largest full metal jacket cartridges ever made.
	He slips one into each barrel and heads back into the bush.

	Roland pauses before he goes, as if noticing the animals
	trashing the speedbird for the first time.

				ROLAND
		HEY!

	The pachys all freeze, staring at him.  Roland waves one hand,
	HISSES sharply between his teeth --

	-- and the pachys scatter, back into the jungle.  Takes care
	of that problem.  Roland turns and heads back into the jungle,
	calling out over his shoulder to Ludlow.

				ROLAND (cont'd)
		Don't worry about us.  We'll catch
		up.

				LUDLOW
		Where do you think you're going?!

				ROLAND
		To collect my fee.

	And with that he disappears into the foliage.

	The Driver of the Speedbird drops it into gear and the
	battered car GROANS forward.  As it moves ahead, it reveals
	DIETER, lying underneath it, ego bruised worse than body.

	IN THE JUNGLE,

	Ajay takes a step into the bush, but at a ninety degree
	angle away from the direction in which the animals tracks
	lead.

				ROLAND
		Ajay.

	Ajay turns.  Roland points in the direction in which the
	footprints lead.

				ROLAND (cont'd)
		I'm no tracker, but even I can read
		this spoor.

				AJAY
		Do you wish to go where the animal
		has been, or where the animal is?

	Roland smiles.  Ajay sets off in his direction and Roland
	follows.

							CUT TO:

	EXT. ISLAND RIDGE - DAY

	Seen from a ridge above them, the hunters' convoy continues to
	plow through the jungle.  But how the hunters themselves are
	being tracked, followed by the GATHERERS.  They scurry along
	as fast as they can, trying to keep pace with the moving
	vehicle below.

				EDDIE
		Why didn't you tell us about these
		guys, Ian?!

				MALCOLM
		Because I didn't know!  I don't have
		the faintest idea what they're doing
		here.

				NICK
			(angry)
		Ruining everything, that's what
		they're doing.  You could choke on
		the diesel smoke already!

				SARAH
		Ian, nothing we observe will be valid
		if we're trailing along in the wake
		of an army.

	Kelly has a pair of binoculars and is studying the vehicles as
	they move below.

				KELLY
		"InGen."  What's InGen?

				MALCOLM
		Where does it say that?

				KELLY
		On the side of that one truck.

	Malcolm takes the binoculars and stares down there himself.

				JUTTSON
		InGen is a genetics corporation,
		isn't it?

				NICK
			(to Malcolm)
		Is that who we're really working
		for?!  Gene splicers?!

				MALCOLM
		No!  We're an independently funded
		expedition.

				SARAH
		Funded by whom?

				MALCOLM
		John Hammond.

				JUTTSON
		But he's the head of InGen!

				NICK
		You gotta be kidding.
			(to Malcolm)
		You dragged me out of Greenpeace to
		be a corporate stooge?  You couldn't
		get anybody else?

				KELLY
		Yeah, what have you done, Dad?

				SARAH
		We'd better keep moving, or we'll
		lose them.

	The group moves on ahead, but Malcolm lingers, angry, staring
	through the binoculars.

				MALCOLM
		What are you doing to me, John?

							CUT TO:

	EXT. THE CAVES - DAY

	AJAY and ROLAND make their way through the foliage and come
	into a small clearing, where a cluster of caves is carved into
	the rock.  Ajay freezes, gesturing ahead, to the cave on the
	far left.

	Roland pulls up a handful of grass and releases it on the
	breeze.  It floats back between his legs.  That's good.

	He proceeds toward the cave, carefully, Ajay behind him.  They
	can see nothing beyond the yawning mouth of the cave, only a
	black interior.

	Roland pauses, looking down.  On the ground to his right he
	sees the partially eastern leg of a creature.  It's old,
	crawling with white maggots and flies.

	Roland continues on.  Closer to the cave, he now passes the
	skull of a large animal, some of the flesh and green skin
	still adhering to the bone.  It, too, is covered with flies.

	Still he continues on.  A short rise leads into the cave, and
	they edge up it.  From inside the cave, they can hear an odd
	SQUEAKING sound, very high-pitched.

	Crawling now, Roland and Ajay scale a four-foot circular
	rampart of dried mud, and peer into --

	-- the tyrannosaur nest.  It's flattered inside, about ten
	feet in diameter, completely encircled by earthen walls.

	A BABY TYRANNOSAUR, about four and a half feet long, is in the
	center of the nest.  It has a large head, very large eyes, and
	its body is covered with a fluffy red down, which gives it a
	scraggly appearance.

	It SQUEAKS repeatedly, tearing awkwardly at the remains of a
	chunk of animal flesh, biting decisively with tiny, sharp
	teeth.

	The cave itself is a foul boneyard.  ANIMAL CARCASSES litter
	the edges, flies BUZZ in the captive air.  Roland raises a
	bandana to his nose to cover the stench.  He  turns to Ajay and
	WHISPERS.

				ROLAND
		It's the rex nest.

	Ajay nods.  The baby tyrannosaur hears the whisper and looks
	up, cocking its head in curiosity.

				AJAY
		Make a blind here?  Wait for the buck
		to return?

				ROLAND
			(shakes his head no)
		If the nest is upwind, so are we.
		When he comes back, he'll know we're
		here before we have a chance.  The
		truck --

	In the nest below, the baby SQUEAKS angrily at the intruders.

				ROLAND (cont'd)
		-- is to get him to come where we
		want him.

	The baby SQUEAKS again, indignant.  Roland turns and looks
	down at it.  Thinking.

							CUT TO:

	EXT. RIDGE - DUSK

	As the sun glows bright orange on the horizon, NICK raises a
	pair of binoculars to his eyes and peers down at the vista
	below the ridge.

	In the lenses of the binoculars, we can clearly see a mixed
	herd of midsized herbivores -- HARDOSAURS, PACHYCEPHALOSAURS,
	and CALLIMIMUSES -- racing across the plain below.
	
	MALCOLM, also staring through binoculars, lies on the ridge
	beside him.  SARAH is several feet behind them, her back
	pressed against a tree, unwilling to go to the lip of the
	ridge.

	THROUGH NICK'S BINOCULARS

	We see a shaky point of view of the herd running.  The
	binoculars whip to the right --

	-- revealing a jeep chasing the herd  Not just one jeep, in
	fact, but a whole FLEET OF HUNTER PURSUIT VEHICLES!

	There are two herding jeeps, one motorcycle, as speedier
	mini-jeep, and, further behind, a container truck and a
	wrangler's pickup truck.

	Although there's a great deal of commotion below, up here it's
	almost eerily silent.

	ON THE RIDGE,

	Nick lowers the binoculars, angry.  When he raises them again,
	the sun FLARES off the lens --

	EXT. THE PLAIN - DUSK

	-- and when the brilliant flare clears, we're right down in
	the middle of the roundup.  Engines ROAR, wheels spin and dig
	in the dirt, men SHOUT and radios SQUAWK as the hunter
	vehicles pursue the fleeting herd they're flushed.

	The HUNTER SHOUT and SHRIEK with glee, incredulous and
	thrilled by the spectacular animals they're pursuing.

				HUNTER
		LOOK AT THESE THINGS!

				HUNTER 2
		THEY'RE BEAUTIFUL, MAN, THEY'RE
		BEAUTIFUL!!!

	One of the pursuit vehicles (a "snagger"), pulls ahead of the
	others.  DIETER STARK stands in the passenger seat, holding a
	long pole with a noose dangling from the end of it.

	He swings the pole out over the side of the jeep and SHOUTS to
	the driver.

				DIETER
		FASTER!

	The Driver hits the gas and the snagger leaps forward, gaining
	on the herd.  Aware of the danger behind them, the herd veers
	to the right, toward the cover of thick jungle --

	-- but the motorcycle ROARS in from the right side, cutting
	them off, herding them back out into the open.

	BACK IN THE CONTAINER TRUCK,

	PETER LUDLOW stands in a "conning tower," a command post in
	the heaviest pursuit vehicle.  He BARKS into a walkie-talkie.

				LUDLOW
		Alive, Dieter, and uninjured!

	BACK ON THE SNAGGER,

	the Driver can barely keep up with the twists and feints
	thrown by the herd ahead of him.  Dieter CURSES and throws the
	lasso pole into the back of the jeep.  Ludlow's voice
	continues over the radio in Dieter's jeep.

				LUDLOW (o.s.)
		Those are very expensive animals!
		Can you hear me?!

				DIETER
			(to the Driver)
		Turn that off!

	The Driver SNAPS off the radio as Dieter grabs a long-barreled
	rifle from the back of the vehicle.

	THE MOTORCYCLE

	guns it again, forcing the herd back into the middle of the 
	plain.  From the trees to the left, two heads on enormous
	necks rise up in alarm.  Two APATOSAURS are startled from the
	bush and lumber out across the middle of the plain.

	The herd doesn't even break stride, but keeps running,
	scampering after the giants and stampeding right between their
	massive legs.

	One smaller pachycephalosaur bolts loose, but the motorcycle
	cuts it off and herds it back into the middle, which now takes
	the motorcycle right through the rising and falling legs of
	the apotosaurs.

	The bike chases the pachy out the other side, and as the
	apatosaurs disappear into the distance, the cycle isolates the
	juvenile.

	Another truck, a "scissor rig," spots the isolated animal.
	High in the back of the truck, a HUNTER mans a tranquilizer
	cannon, drawing a bead on the pachy as the cycle runs it down.

	He FIRES and the tranquilizer dart hits the animal in the
	neck.  Its pace slows and another HUNTER from the truck tosses
	a lasso around its neck.

	They crank a winch, reeling in the animal.

	As the truck gain on it, two six-foot padded arms with what
	look like heavy airbags on the insides open up on the front of
	the truck.

	As the animal is pulled in, the scissors close with a
	hydraulic WHIR, trapping the animal between its airbags.

	Now a pick-up rig ROARS up and drops its back gate.  The
	scissor rig rolls forward, depositing the squirming pachy in
	this dino-contaiment vehicle.

	Two HUNTERS throw levers on the side of the scissor bars and
	the scissor rig backs away, leaving the animal, still pinched
	between the bars, imprisoned in the back of the pick-up rig.

	The Hunters quickly fit new scissor bars onto the scissor rig
	and it takes off, back into the hunt.

	BACK ON THE SNAGGER,

	Dieter, rifle in hand, drops down into the passenger seat,
	whips a harness over himself and CLICKS it into place.  He
	jabs his thumb into a flashing red button in the dashboard.

	Immediately, a motor underneath the seat HUMS to life and the
	seat itself telescopes, extending a good four feet out to

	Dieter raises the gun, picks a CARINTHOSAUR, a red-crested
	herbivore, from the rear of the fleeting herd, and takes aim.

	BANG!!

	The carinthosaur staggers as a tranquilizer dart sticks in
	its left hindquarter.

	UP ON THE RIDGE,

	there is utter quiet.  Nick and the others stare wordlessly at
	the spectacle below.

	DOWN ON THE PLAIN,

	the snagger SHUDDERS to a halt in the dirt, kicking up a huge
	cloud of dust and dirt.

	The motorcycle spins to a stop beside it, its DRIVER pushing
	his mask up to reveal his sweat and dirt-streaked face.

	The wrangler truck backs up and drops its rear door, which
	CLANGS heavily to the ground.

	FOUR WRANGLERS carrying wire noose poles and chains race down
	the ramp and out of the truck.

	Dieter jumps off the snagger.  He puts down his tranquilizer
	gun, picks up a long steel rod, and walks forward slowly.
	Ahead of him, the carinthosaur is still on its feet.

	The sedated animal staggers, fighting to retain its balance
	while it is surrounded by the wary Wranglers.

				DIETER
		Easy -- easy -- not too close!
		Full extension!

	The Wranglers adjust their poles, extending them another three
	feet, which allows them to stay further from the reeling, ten
	foot tall animal.

				DIETER (cont'd)
		Now!

	Almost as one, the Wranglers flip their noose over the
	stunned animal's neck.  It thrashes, but the Wranglers hold
	their poles tightly, surrounding and immobilizing it.

	UP ON THE RIDGE,

	Nick turns away.  He can't watch.

	DOWN ON THE PLAIN,

	a bolero-type device, a rope with a round weight at either
	end, whips around the carinthosaur's legs.  The animal THUDS
	to the dirt with a SNORT of a defeat.

	Ludlow steps up next to Dieter and both of them stare down at
	the helpless animal.  Ludlow's breathing heavily, eyes
	glowing.

	The animal is still thrashing, pumping its legs crazily.
	Dieter turns a knob on the side of the steel rod he's holding
	and thrusts it into the defenseless animal's neck.

	A blue arc of electricity CRACKS and dances over the
	carinthosaur's body.  The animal convulses in pain, a
	horrible, high-pitched SQUEALING rips the air.

	DR. BURKE, their paleontologist, hurries forward with a
	syringe.

	He draws a certain amount of tranquilizer from a bottle and
	injects it into the animal's thigh.

	CARTER, Dieter's Driver, steps up with a can of spray paint
	and quickly tags the animal with an ID number in day-glo
	orange.

	Dieter pulls the card with an icon of a carinthosaur from the
	dashboard of the jeep and marks a black X over the drawing of
	the animal.

				DIETER
		Next case.

							CUT TO:

	EXT. RIDGE - NIGHT

	Night has fallen over the island.  The hunters have
	established base camp in an area they have trampled and
	cleared just below the ridge.  Blue laser fences encircle the
	perimeter.  Inside, half a dozen tents are set up around a
	central campfire.

	The vehicles are all parked at one end, away from the tents.
	At the other end, there is a row of at least a dozen "capture
	containers," cages that hold the imprisoned dinosaurs they
	have already rounded up.

	SARAH, MALCOLM, and NICK stand at the edge of the ridge above,
	looking down at the scene.  Sarah stands a bit further back
	from the others, not wanting to get too close to the edge.
	VOICES waft up to them, raucous, LAUGHING, some even SINGING.

	DR. JUTTSON has a pair of night-vision binoculars trained on
	the cages.

				JUTTSON
		Carinthosaurus -- compsognathus --
		triceratops -- pachycephalosaurus --
		or small scavengers only.

	Malcolm, also with binoculars, furrows his brow, seeing
	something below.

	THROUGH MALCOLM'S BINOCULARS,

	he sees PETER LUDLOW, standing in the middle of the camp,
	pointing, giving orders.

	ON THE RIDGE,

	Malcolm drops the binoculars.

				MALCOLM
		Ludlow.  That's why Hammond was in
		such a hurry for me to get here.  He
		knew they were coming.

	He gives the binoculars to Sarah, who moves forward gingerly.

				MALCOLM (cont'd)
		You okay?

				SARAH
			(irritated)
		Heights, I can't help it.  Put your
		arm here, will you?

	She puts his arm around her waits, to steady her while she is
	close to the cliff edge.

				JUTTSON
		What do they want?

				MALCOLM
		They want their money back.  To
		InGen, this island is nothing more
		than a bed investment.

				JUTTSON
		We should get back to base camp.
		Eddie's waiting for us.

				MALCOLM
		I can't believe Peter Ludlow's
		running all this.

				SARAH
		He isn't.  Check out the guy walking
		past the fire.

	She hands the binoculars to Malcolm.

	THROUGH THE BINOCULARS,

	Malcolm sees ROLAND, who's walking with AJAY, weapons and
	equipment slung over their shoulders.

				SARAH (o.s.)
		I've seen him before.  In Brazil.  He
		and that guy with him were
		spearhunting jaguars.  Said it was
		immoral to go after them any other
		way.  He's not just a hunter, he's a
		philosopher.  Kind of guy who beats
		you up with your own argument.

	BACK ON THE RIDGE,

				SARAH (cont'd)
		He's the one in charge.

				MALCOLM
		Well, if that's true -- the man in
		charge just left camp.

	Nick, who has been quietly fuming next to them, now steps
	forward.

				NICK
		Then this is our chance.

				MALCOLM
		Our chance to do what?

				NICK
		I don't know these guys, but I know
		'em.  I've seen 'em on Japanese
		whalers, French barges trying to dump
		barrels of nuclear waste in the North
		Atlantic.  They're all the same.
		They spray us with water cannon when
		we try to stop 'em, sink our boats,
		and then call us crazy.

	He rummages through his pack, coming up with various tools.  A
	hunting knife.  A bolt cutter.

				NICK (cont'd)
		Nobody has to come with me.  I've
		done this before.

				SARAH
		Why, Nick.  You are a tree-hugger.

	He looks at her, hurt.

				NICK
		There' no reason for name calling.

				MALCOLM
		Dr. Juttson, please take Kelly back
		to camp right away.  Leave the other
		car for us and we'll meet you there
		in an hour or so.

				KELLY
		What are you guys gonna do?

				MALCOLM
			(signs)
		Exactly what John Hammond wanted us
		to do.

							CUT TO:

	INT. TENT - HUNTER'S CAMP - NIGHT

	In the hunters' supply tent, a case of twelve-year-old scotch
	sits open amid crate after crate of weapons and ammunition.
	PETER LUDLOW reaches in and pulls a bottle out.

	EXT. JUNGLE - NIGHT

	In the jungle, LUDLOW approaches a small clearing.  ROLAND is
	bent over a small stake in the ground, chaining something to
	it.  As Ludlow approaches and walks around him, he sees what
	protest.  Roland looks up.

				ROLAND
		Offering a little incentive.

	Ludlow laughs and shakes his head.  He takes a drink and
	offers Roland one.  Roland accepts.  Ludlow notices Roland's
	gun leaning against a tree.

				LUDLOW
		What kind of gun is that?

				ROLAND
		My father's .600 Nitro Express.  Made
		in 1904.  Karimojo Bell gave it to
		him after he took down his last
		elephant.  8700 foot pound striking
		force.

				LUDLOW
		How close do you have to be?

				ROLAND
		Forty yards.  Less, maybe.  I assume
		it'll take a slug in the brain case
		to bring him down.

				LUDLOW
		Why not just use a scope and a poison
		dart and snipe him from a hill?

	Roland just looks at him.

				ROLAND
		Or a laser beam from a satellite?

	Ludlow leans down, close to the baby rex, and examines it
	while it thrashes on its chain.  Its mouth has been bound shut
	with a leather strap.

				LUDLOW
		You rally think this'll draw the
		parent?

				ROLAND
		I once saw a bull elephant die
		charging a jeep.  All the jeep had
		done was startle the bull's calves.
		I saw a lioness carry wounded prey
		four and a half miles, all the way
		back to its den, just to teach its
		cubs how to finish off a kill.

				LUDLOW
		Killing lessons?  Heartwarming.

				ROLAND
		Rex won't be any different.  It'll
		come.

				LUDLOW
		You're kidding yourself.  An adult
		T-rex cares about one thing --
		filling its own belly.  It acts the
		way people wish they could, that's
		why everyone's fascinated by it.  If
		people had the chance to see one
		dinosaur and one only, ninety-nine
		percent would --

	He stops, an idea on his face.

				LUDLOW (cont'd)
		Wait.  Why not?  Sedatives...
		growth inhibitors...

				ROLAND
		What?

				LUDLOW
		I hadn't planned on bringing
		carnivores back because of the
		liability risk, but I only thought of
		adults, it never occurred to me --
			(close to the animal)
		You are a billion dollar idea, my
		little f-

	CRACK!  The tyrannosaur, even with its jaws clamped shut,
	lunges at Ludlow's face, head-butting him right across the
	bridge of the nose.  Ludlow staggers back, WAITING in pain,
	clutching his bleeding face.

	Roland laughs.  Ludlow, like an enraged child, snatches up
	Roland's gun and brings the butt down viciously on the rex's
	leg.  The bone breaks with a dry SNAP and the animal HOWLS in
	pain.

	Roland lunges and throws Ludlow to the ground, but the damage
	is done.

				ROLAND
		What the hell you do that for?!

	As his pain eases, Ludlow feels a bit foolish, but he attempts
	to cover.

				LUDLOW
		Had to.  To keep him still for the
		trip.

				ROLAND
		You've broken its leg!

				LUDLOW
		We've got to transport it seven
		thousand miles.  Would you prefer it
		bit off the leg of a crew member?

	He gets up, brushes himself off, and heads back to the camp,
	trying to salvage his dignity.  Roland watches him go.

							CUT TO:

	EXT. EDGE OF HUNTERS' CAMP - NIGHT

	At the edge of the hunters' camp, NICK, SARAH, and MALCOLM
	scramble down a hillside and stop at the edge of the laser
	barriers.  There are three beams, each about two feet apart,
	the tallest almost six feet off the ground.

	Nick reaches the edge and crouches.  Sarah, helped by Malcolm,
	steps up onto his back and jumps over the top, landing with a
	CRUNCH.  Nick is next, given a boost by Malcolm, who is then
	left alone on the other side.

	He backs up a few steps, jogs right at the lasers, then
	springs off his good leg --

	-- and does the Fosburry Flop right over the top.  He lands
	with a THUD, to the silent admiration of the other two.

	FURTHER IN THE CAMP,

	the three of them creep along, hiding behind a stack of fuel
	barrels.  They lean around the edge for a look.  They're
	directly behind the row of vehicle.

	They move, into the open, covering the ground between them and
	the jeeps.  Reaching them, Nick hits the dirt and wriggles
	under the first one.  Malcolm and Sarah stand lookout.

	UNDER THE JEEP,

	Nick pulls the bolt cutter from his back pocket.  He squirms
	along until he finds the jeep's fuel line --

	-- and he snips it.  He ducks out of the way just as the
	stream of fuel begins to pour into the dirt.

	MALCOLM AND SARAH

	move slowly down the line, standing watch as Nick crawls out
	from under the first jeep and proceeds to the second.  They
	hear another SNIP, then keep moving, to cover him as he moves
	to the third.

	From in the distance, Malcolm hears a sound, a faint,
	high-pitched SCREECHING.  He turns and looks to that
	direction.

	EXT. JUNGLE CLEARING - NIGHT

	It's the baby T-rex, still SCREENING.  Up in a nearby tree,
	ROLAND and AJAY have spread some broken branches crosswise to
	form a high hide of their own about ten feet off the ground.

	They wait.

	Roland raises his binoculars.  The light of the camp spills
	all the way out here, illuminating some of the jungle.  He
	scans it, searching for any sign of movement.

	EXT. HUNTERS' CAMP - NIGHT

	Back in the camp, Sarah, Malcolm, and Nick have finished with
	all of the vehicles except the badly battered one, which is
	parked some distance away, undergoing repairs.  The motor pool
	area is now a soggy lake of spilled gasoline.

	The saboteurs walk casually across the camp, unnoticed in the
	drunken revelry.  They pass several tents, the shadows of the
	partiers visible as they move inside.

	They continue across the camp and arrive at the other side --

	-- to face the caged animals.  The carinthosaur that was
	tranquilized earlier stands there dully, eyes heavy and
	glassy, still under the effects.  They pass a stegosaur, its
	row of fine bristling.

	And finally they reach the largest cage, which houses a
	triceratops the size of a pickup truck, Nick pulls out his
	trusty bolt cutters.  He looks at them, a glint in his eye.

				NICK
		Hang on.  We may encounter some
		turbulence.

	INT. HUNTERS' CAMP - NIGHT

	In one of the hunter tents, PETER LUDLOW leans over the
	satellite recon pictures of the island, planning the next
	day's assault with DIETER and DR. BURKE, their paleontologist.
	There are small wooden dinosaur models scattered around the
	photos, indicating where certain species can be found.

				BURKE
		If you're really interested in
		infants, we'll have better luck at
		the seaside, because the sands offer
		a cushioning surface where the egg
		clutches can -- can --

	He trails off.  A low RUMBLING sound can be heard outside, and
	the little wooden dinosaurs start shaking on the board.

	They look at each other.  The RUMBLING gets louder.  Outside,
	someone SHOUTS; on the board, the little dinosaurs start
	hopping and bouncing from the vibrations, the SHOUTS outside
	turn to SCREAMS, they turn and look at the back of the tent --

	-- and the triceratops bursts right through the canvas!

	EXT. CAMP - NIGHT

	HUNTERS go flying as the tent-covered triceratops, its horns
	tearing through the canvas, RUMBLES across the camp.  Men
	SHOUT in alarm, the triceratops BELLOWS in anger and
	confusion, chaos reigns.

	In the crush of PEOPLE running every which way, MALCOLM and
	SARAH are swept off in one direction while NICK is buffeted
	in another.  They SHOUT, but cannot be heard over the frey.

	The triceratops, blinded by the canvas shroud, stomps right
	through the fire in the middle of the camp AND THE TENT BURSTS
	INTO FLAME.

	Now really upset, the animal panics and lashes out in all
	directions, blasting through tents, demolishing and/or setting
	ablaze anything that gets in its way.  Its considerable
	hindquarters SLAM into a parked jeep, sending it rolling
	across the camp.

	The jeep flattens the largest tent and SLAMS down on its side.
	Its broken gas line SPRAYS gas over the ground, the gas hits
	one of the dozens of small blazes the triceratops has left in
	its wake, and the flame shoots up the ribbon of gas.

	The jeep explodes.

	OUT IN THE JUNGLE CLEARING,

	Roland and Ajay, up in the tree, leap to their feet as a
	fireball rises up from the camp in the distance.

				ROLAND
		What in God's -- !

	BACK IN THE CAMP,

	the rest of the newly-freed animals now storm through the
	camp.  The blue laser barriers bounce crazily and go out as
	the sending units are trampled underfoot by the fleeing
	animals.

	AT THE RIDGE OF CAMP,

	Nick takes advantage of the downed lasers to slip part the
	bordere of the camp and disappear into the jungle in one
	direction, while Malcolm and Sarah vanish in the other.

	The burning tent, which was the equipment tent, now detonates
	in a series of smaller EXPLOSIONS.

	Dieter and several others are knocked to the ground by the
	series of concessive blasts.  He drags himself up onto all
	fours, charred and bruised.  A burning tire rolls slowly past
	him, spinning to a stop --

	-- at ROLAND's feet.  Dieter looks up at him.

				ROLAND
		Last time I leave you in charge.

	OUT IN THE JUNGLE,

	Nick breaks out into the jungle clearing, the same one where
	Ajay and Roland had their blind.  He sees the baby tyrannosaur
	chained to the stake.

				NICK
		Sick bastards.

	He goes to the animal, which now BLEATS in pain, its broken
	leg hanging at an odd angle.  With one strong tug, Nick pulls
	the stake out of the ground.

	BACK IN THE CAMP,

	Roland surveys the destruction.  The fire has spread and
	several tents are now tongues of flame flapping in the air,
	the animals are gone or going, and their personnel are
	scattered and terrified.  PETER LUDLOW, breathless, face
	smeared with dirt, and smoke, staggers up to Roland.

				LUDLOW
		What in Christ's name is going on?!

				ROLAND
		Isn't it obvious?

	He holds up the sniped padlock from one of the animal cages.

				NICK (cont'd)
		We're not alone on this island.

							CUT TO:

	EXT. JUNGLE - NIGHT

	MALCOLM and SARAH race back up onto the ridge trail, where the
	green AAV is parked.  NICK bursts around from the other side
	of the car.

				SARAH
		Nick, thank God, we didn't know
		if --

	Malcolm opens the rear door.

				NICK
		Wait, don't ---

	With a piercing SHRIEK, the BABY TYRANNOSAUR, now in the back
	of the AAV, flings itself at the open doorway, jaws SNAPPING
	just short of Malcolm's nose.

				MALCOLM
		HOLY SHIT!!

	He SLAMS the door.

	DOWN IN THE HUNTERS' CAMP,

	Roland hears the commotion up on the ridge and looks up.

				ROLAND
		Do we have anyone up there?

	BACK UP ON THE RIDGE,

	Malcolm is confronting Nick.

				MALCOLM
		?!

 NICK 		It has a broken leg!

 MALCOLM 		So do it a favor and put it out of
		its misery!

 NICK 		No!  Get in the car before they hear 
		us!

	He runs around and leaps in the driver's seat.  Sarah slips
	into the passenger seat, quickly, leaving Malcolm no choice
	but the rear.

 CUT TO: 
 EXT. JUNGLE - NIGHT 
	The AAV SLAPS through the jungle foliage.  From inside the
	car, we can hear the baby tyrannosaur SCREAMING in anger.

 INT. AAV - NIGHT 
	The baby writhes on the base seat next to Malcolm, who has
	flattened himself against the door, as far away from the
	animal as possible.

 SARAH 		Ian, close the window, it's going to
		wake every predator in the jungle!

	Malcolm leans over the enraged animal and cranks up its
	window.  The tyrannosaur SLASHES with one of its powerful hind
	legs, ripping the flesh of his forearm.  He SHOUTS in pain.

	Outside, the listening jungle whizzes by.

 EXT. HIGH HIDE - NIGHT 
	Up in the high hide, EDDIE, DR. JUTTSON, and KELLY are
	standing watch, scanning the jungle for any sign of their
	returning comrades.

	Juttson yanks the night-vision binoculars away from his face
	as he spots the AAV, pulling up to the base camp a couple
	hundred yards away.

 JUTTSON 		There they are!

	They all turn and look, but Eddie furrows his brow, watching
	them pull the wounded animal from the back seat.

 EDDIE 		What is that they have with them?

 EXT. CAMP - NIGHT 
	SARAH and NICK carry the SCREECHING baby tyrannosaur in their
	arms, headed for the trailer.  MALCOLM, holding his bleeding
	arm, isn't far behind.

 INT. TRAILER - NIGHT 
	SARAH and NICK bring the SCREAMING infant to the metal dining
	table and hold it down.  MALCOLM is right behind them.

 MALCOLM 		This is exceedingly unwise.

	Sarah turns away from a drawer of medical supplies, holding a
	small syringe.  Her shirt is streaked with blood from the
	baby's injured leg.

 SARAH 		Too late to worry about that!  Hold
		him together, Nick!

	Nick tightens his grip on the animal and Sarah makes an
	injection into its thigh, over its loudly voiced objections.

 MALCOLM 		Just do whatever you have to do and
		get it out of here as quickly as
		possible.

	Sarah picks up a small ultrasound transducer and runs it over
	the animal's leg.  A green and white skeletal image appears on
	a monitor next to the table.

 SARAH 		Okay, there's the metatarsals --
		tibia, fibula -- there it is!  See
		it?  That's a fracture, just above
		the epiphysis.

	They peer closely at the monitor.

 NICK 		That little black line?

 SARAH 		That little black line means death
		for this infant.  The fibula won't
		heal straight, so the ankle joint
		can't pivot when he stands on his
		hind feet.  The baby won't be able to
		run, and probably can't even walk.
		It'll be crippled, and a predator
		will pick it off before it gets more
		than a few weeks old.

 MALCOLM 		Can you set up?

 SARAH 			(thinking)
		It has to be temporary, something
		that'll break apart and fall off as
		the animal grows...

 MALCOLM 		Think fast, Sarah.

	The tyrannosaur, still in pain, SHRIEKS again.

 EXT. HIGH HIDE - NIGHT 
	Through their binoculars, the rest of the group watches the
	trailer carefully.  Even inside, the animal's SCREECHES are
	clearly audible.  Kelly is getting scared.

 KELLY 		What are they doing?  Why don't
		they hurry?!

 EDDIE 		Give me the radio.

	From the trailer, the baby lets out a long, plaintive
 SHRIEK -- 
	One by one, Eddie, Kelly, and Juttson turn around and stare
	into the night jungle.

 INT. TRAILER - NIGHT 
	NICK holds the animal while SARAH fits an aluminum foil cuff
	around its injured leg and paints it with a coating of resin.
	MALCOLM, at the window, stares out anxiously.  The animal
	thrashes again.

 NICK 		Give it more morphine!

 SARAH 		We'll kill it with too much, we'll
		put it into respiratory arrest!  I'm
		almost done.  Damn it, I need
		another adhesive, something pliable I
		can --

	Her eyes fall on Nick.  She holds out her hand, urgently.

				SARAH (cont'd)
		Spit!

	He spits his bubblegum into the palm of her hand.  The baby
	rex CRIES OUT again.

 EXT. HIGH HIDE - NIGHT 
	From the swaying jungle, there is another answering ROAR.

	And this one's closer.

	In the high hide, the rest of the group stares, trembling.  In
	the distance, a flock of birds SHRIEKS and takes flight as the
	tops of some trees move, a whole section of forest suddenly
	coming alive, as if brushed by wind.

	But it's not the wind.

	They hear noises, THUDS in the jungle.  And then another
	section of forest trembles.  Closer.  Another flock of birds
	bursts out of the treetops and swarms past the high hide.

 KELLY 		What is it?

	Dr. Juttson puts an arm around Kelly, instinctively pulling
	her closer to him.  Eddie WHISPERS urgently into the
	walkie-talkie.

 EDDIE 		Sarah, come in!

 JUTTSON 		It's moving.  Fast.

 INT. TRAILER - NIGHT 
	There is a radio box mounted on the far wall of the trailer.
	The speaker BUZZES urgently with Eddie's VOICE.

				EDDIE (o.s.)
		Sarah, Malcolm, can you hear me?!

	On the table, Sarah is frantically molding Nick's bubblegum
	into place on the makeshift splint.  But the baby rex,
	regaining its strength, is thrashing again.

 SARAH 		Hold it down, Nick!

 NICK 		I'm trying!

				EDDIE (o.s.)
			(from the radio)
		Is anybody there?!

	Malcolm moves to answer the radio, but Sarah SHOUTS to him.

 SARAH 		Ian, get the bottle of amoxicillin
		and fill a syringe!  Quick injection
		of antibiotics and I can get it out
		of here!

	Forsaking the radio, Malcolm moves to the medicine drawer and
	comes up with what she wants.  Working fast, he draws twenty
	cc's of the pink liquid.

				EDDIE (o.s.)
			(still from the radio, now
			 desperate)
 SARAH OR IAN, ANSWER ME! 
	They ignore him as Sarah grabs the syringe and makes the
	injection.

				EDDIE (o.s.)
 WHATEVER YOU BROUGHT INTO THE TRAILER, GET IT OUT NOW! 
 EXT. HIGH HIDE - NIGHT 
	Eddie has given up on whispering as he clutches the radio
	desperately.

 EDDIE WE ESTIMATE TWO LARGE ADULTS HEADED IN YOUR DIRECTION! I REPEAT -- 
 INT. TRAILER - NIGHT 
	Nick, Sarah, and Malcolm spin around at hearing that terrible
	piece of information.

 MALCOLM 		Oh, Christ.

	He bolts over to the wall speaker and hits the button.

				MALCOLM (cont'd)
		Let me talk to Kelly, is she--

	A deafening ROAR sound from just outside the trailer,
	followed immediately by a CRASHING sound.  They whirl and look
	to the window, just in time to see --

	--  the AAV tumbling by, rolling on its side!

	There is another ROAR, and the baby, on the table, ROARS in
	response.  Outside the window, the head of a full-grown
	TYRANNOSAURUS REX lowers and peers inside.

	Malcolm, Sarah, and Nick all freeze in absolute terror.

	The rex outside GURGLES, making material cooing noises.  The
	baby rex, calm for the first time, GURGLES back.

	But across the trailer, in the opposite window, ANOTHER T-REX
 HEAD SUDDENLY APPEARS. 
	This one ROARS, deeply, a roar so low and loud it rattles
	anything in the trailer that isn't tied down.

 NICK 		What do they want?!

 MALCOLM 		What do you think they want?!

 SARAH 		That's impossible, they can't have
		the sensory equipment to track it all
		the way here!

 MALCOLM 		Current evidence seems to be to the
		contrary, wouldn't you say?!  GIVE IT
 TO THEM! 
	Nick, hands shaking, grabs the shoulder video camera he used
	earlier.  He whips out the cassette that's in there, hurls it
	into an open duffel bag with half a dozen others, SLAMS a
	fresh cassette in, and flicks the "ON" switch.

	Sarah and Malcolm, meanwhile, hurry to the other end of the
	trailer, carrying the baby rex.  Outside, the two adult rexes
	stay with them, walking in the same direction, watching them
	through the window.

 EXT. TRAILER - NIGHT 
	Seen from outside, the light inside the trailers clearly
	illuminates Sarah and Malcolm as they carry the bay rex.  The
	adult rexes tower over the trailer, twice as tall and nearly
	as long.  They walk slowly alongside it, hunched over,
	watching their infant.

 INT. TRAILER - NIGHT 
	At the door to the trailer, Sarah un-muzzles the frantic baby.

 SARAH 		Ready?

	Malcolm reaches for the door handle.

 NICK 		Wait!

	He dives down on the floor under them, pointing the video
	camera up at the door, getting the best shot.  Malcolm takes a
	breath, turns the knob, and throws open the door.

	Outside, the enormous rex heads pause for a moment, staring,
	surprised.

	Although terrified, Sarah actually starts to sing.

 SARAH 			(softly)
		Born free, as free as the wind blows.
		As free as the grass grows --

 MALCOLM 		Are you insane?!

 SARAH 		I swear to God, it works with lions
		sometimes!  There we are -- your baby
		is free --

	The baby, excited, wriggles free of them and lands on the
	ground outside.  Not wasting a second, Malcolm SLAMS the door
	shut.

	The three of them freeze, not daring to breath.  Outside, they
	can hear the SNUFFLING and COOING of the animals as they
	inspect their young --

	-- and then the soft THUD of their footsteps, growing fainter
	as they move away.

	From the wall, EDDIE'S VOICE comes over the radio, relieved.

 EDDIE 		They're going back into the jungle.

 CUT TO: 
 EXT. HIGH HIDE - NIGHT 
	EDDIE, JUTTSON, and KELLY sag back against the railings of the
	high hide.

 EDDIE 		Thank God.  Thank God.

	MALCOLM'S VOICE comes over the radio.

				MALCOLM (o.s.)
		Kelly?  Are you all right?

	She takes the radio, her voice shaky.

 KELLY 		Uh huh.

 CUT TO: 
 INT. TRAILER - NIGHT 
	MALCOLM is at the radio.

 MALCOLM 		Wait there.  I'll come up in a
		minute.  Don't move, understand?

				KELLY (o.s.)
		I understand.

	Malcolm slump against the wall of the trailer.  SARAH and
	NICK sit on the floor leaning against the opposite wall,
	completely drained.  Sarah pulls out her pocket recorder and
	speaks shakily into it.

 SARAH 		Note to Dr. Juttson -- Tyrannosaurus
		rex does nurture its young.

	They laugh weakly.

 NICK 		There's, uh -- there's an unwritten
		rule when a news crew is in a war
		zone.  You stop the van every two
		miles and decide whether or not to go
		on.  Whether or not you feel lucky.
		One "no" from anybody in the group
		and you turn around right there, no
		question asked, nobody embarrassed.
			(pause)
		Well?  Do we go on?
	Immediately:

 SARAH 		No.

 MALCOLM 		No.

 NICK 		No way.

	They all laugh.

 MALCOLM 		All right.  I'm satisfied with the
		evidence we have right now.
		I feel vindicated.  John Hammond will
		too.
			(to Sarah)
		Do you have enough to publish?

 SARAH 		They will come after me.  But I can
		collect some stool samples, for DNA
		with that, Nick's tapes, and the rest
		of you to back me up, it should stand
		when we get back.

 MALCOLM 			(getting up)
		Then the only thing left to do is
		make sure we do get back.  I'll
		call the mainland on the satellite
		phone and have them send the boat
		right now.  This expedition is over.

	He goes to the desk and picks up the heavy gray satellite
	phone that's resting in a battery pack.  The front panel
	lights up, a brilliant green.

	But from the wall speaker, the radio CRACKLES and EDDIE'S
	VOICE breaks through, soft and empty.

				EDDIE (o.s.)
		Oh, God.  I am so sorry.

	Malcolm and Sarah look at the speaker box.

 MALCOLM 		What the hell is he sorry f-

	A low RATTLE sneaks into the trailer.  Malcolm, Sarah, and
	Nick takes a step forward from the walls, looking around.  The
	RATTLE gets louder, the trailer shakes and vibrates,
	everything in it starts to BANG against the walls --

	-- and something huge SMASHES into the side of the trailer.

	They're all thrown against the far wall, there is an
	earsplitting CRACK of electricity, the entire trailer rocks
	and sparks a brilliant blue, and then everything goes black.

	The satellite phone flies out of Malcolm's hands and SMACKS
	against the wall.  It lands on the floor, its number pad still
	glowing green.

	Nick crawls over and looks out one of the windows.  Outside,
	the flank of one of the tyrannosaurs wipes past the window,
	revealing the second tyrannosaur, charging straight at the
	trailer!

 NICK HANG ON TO SOMETHING! 
	They hurl themselves at the nearest solid object and hang on
	for dear life.  The charging rex SLAM into the side of the
	trailer, which rocks up on one side, BANGS back  down, and is
	quickly RAMMED again by the furious animal.  This time the
	entire trailer rolls over, completely upside down.

	Sarah, Nick, and Malcolm let go of their precarious handholds
	and drop onto the ceiling.  The tables, chairs, lab equipment,
	everything that's bolted down clings to the floor above them;
	everything that isn't RAINS DOWN ON THEM.

	But the rexes aren't done.  The trailer JOLTS INTO MOTION,
	sliding forwards.

 SEEN FROM OUTSIDE, 
	the upside down trailer, which is the rear of the two
	trailers, slides along the muddy ground, pushing up earth in
	front of it.

 IN THE TRAILER, 
 SARAH 		They're pushing us!

	Malcolm, frantic, crawls up to a window to get a look outside.
	He looks down and sees a T-rex footprint in the earth outside
	as they move past it.

	He cranks his head to get a look at the direction in which
	they are being pushed.  His eyes widen at something he sees
	outside the window.

 MALCOLM 		Oh, God.

 SARAH 		What?!

 MALCOLM 		They're pushing us over the cliff.

	Sure enough, out the back window, we see a few more feet of
	muddy earth, and then nothing but inky black.  The three of
	them look at each other for a moment --

	-- and then crawl like hell toward the other end of the
	trailer.  The opposite end reaches the edge of the cliff and
	starts up to tip ever-so-slightly downward.  They reach the
	accordion-like connector and Malcolm crawls into it.

 THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD OF THE FRONT TRAILER, 
	which is right-side-up, Malcolm can see the two rexes hard at
	it, pushing the front end of the trailer.

 IN THE REAR TRAILER, 
	Nick has a pretty good grip at the top of the trailer, but
	Sarah can only cling to an air vent in the ceiling as stuff
	starts to roll and tumble past her, headed downhill.

	The angle increases, the trailer dips, and now stuff starts to
	freefall, right past her, some SMASHING her in the head.

	Malcolm, still in the connecting tube, grabs hold.  Sarah,
	starting to be pulled downward, paws at the refrigerator,
	getting a g rip on the handle.  The door, held by a safety
	latch, doesn't open.

	Below Sarah, debris falls to the rear window of the trailer.
	Through the CRACKING glass, we can see the surf, CRASHING five
	hundred feet below.

	The refrigerator bolts suddenly CRUNCH free of the wall.  The
	box strains on its power cord.

	Still clinging to the handle, Sarah swings wildly as it starts
	to come loose, swaying above her.

	The safety latch on the door gives, it swings open, and a
	shower of food BANGS off of her as gravity empties the
	contents.

	Sarah loses her grip and plummets through the now-vertical
	trailer.  She SCREAMS, covers her head, and SMASHES into the
	rear window.  The glass spiderwebs, but does not break.

 FIVE HUNDRED FEET BELOW, 
	an enormous wave POUNDS the rocky shore.  Above, Sarah is a
	tiny figure, sprawled out on the glass, held invisibly by the
	breaking window.

 IN THE TRAILER, 
	Nick SHOUTS to her.

 NICK SARAH! DON'T MOVE! 
	Sarah, stunned by the fall, blinks a few times, regaining her
	senses.  She looks down, at the crashing surf so far below.
	For a person with a fear of heights, this is a real drag.  As
	she stares, the rocks seem to move even farther away from her.
	She blanches; the world spins around her.

 SARAH 		OH... GOD ... please...

	Her breath fogs the cracked glass.  Slowly, she tries to get
	up, caaaaaarefully pulling herself up to her hands and knees.

	But as she puts pressures on her hands, the glass CRACKS even
	more, tiny spiderwebs shooting out around her fingers.  The
	whole glass panel sags, bowing out around the bottom of the
	trailer.

 UP ABOVE HER, 
	Malcolm looks down and sees the satellite phone precariously
	balanced on one leg of the kitchen table, its number pad still
	glowing green.  Nick is closest to it.

 MALCOLM 		Nick!  Grab the phone!

 SARAH 
	looks to her right, at a metal grating that runs along the
	wall of the trailer.  She shifts her weight, leaning on one
	hand to reach for the grating with the other.

 NICK 
	reaches for the satellite phone, its antenna just six inches
	from his outstretched fingers.

 SARAH 
	leans toward the metal grating, all hairline cracks shoot out
	around her pivot hand, shaking through the glass.  The
	splintered glass spread like a disease, it reaches the edge
	of the frame --

	-- and her hand CRACKS right through the glass.  She GASPS and
	pulls her hand out, but now she knees SMASH through the
	glass.

 NICK 
	has two fingers on the phone, but suddenly the whole trailer
	shudders and the heavy phone tips off the table leg and falls.

 NICK SARAH LOOK OUT! 
 SARAH 
	lunges for the metal grating and clings to it just as the
	heavy phone whizzes past her head and SMASHES into the glass,
	opening up a huge hole in the center of the back window.

 UNDERNEATH THE TRAILER, 
	glass, food, lab equipment, and the precious satellite phone
	fall out the broken window and SMASH on the rocks far below.

 IN THE CLEANING, 
	the trailers are split, like an L, the rear trailer hanging
	straight down, the forward one resting on the edge of the
	cliff.  Satisfied with their work, the T-rexes turn and lumber
	back into the jungle.

 IN THE TRAILER, 
	Sarah climbs carefully up the metal grating.  Above her, Nick
	lowers himself as far as he can, reaching for her.

 ON THE CLIFFSIDE, 
	we realize the hanging trailer halted its descent because one
	corner of it is wedged in the branches of a tree that grows
	out from the muddy cliff.

	But now those branches SPLINTER.

 IN THE TRAILER, 
	Malcolm sees the bellows, the connector between the trailers,
	stretch as the lower trailer JERKS and dips lower.

 BELOW HIM, 
	Sarah mountain-climbs through the trailer's kitchen,
	inadvertently kicking the faucet on as she struggles for
	purchase.

 OUTSIDE, 
	the tree branch SNAPS and the trailer jerks, stretching down
	again.  The bellows expands to its full length, stretching
	like a Slinky.

 INSIDE, 
	Nick knows he has to hurry.  He climbs down, bouncing off the
	built-in furniture, moving ever closer to Sarah.

	But Sarah slips and loses her grip, dropping a few feet.  She
	gabs hold of the sink, the flowing water spraying her face.

 EXT. JUNGLE - NIGHT 
	EDDIE CARR is in the driver's seat of the jeep, racing through
	the jungle as fast as he can.

 EDDIE 		Hang on -- hang on --

	The foliage SMACKS the windshield, then clears suddenly,
	revealing the endangered trailers on the cliffside ahead of
	him.  The jeep bounces through the deep footprints left by the
	rex and SKIDS to a halt.

 INT. TRAILER - NIGHT 
	Sarah loses her grip on the sink and falls, SMASHING into the
	frame of the half-broken rear window again.

 OUTSIDE, 
	Eddie bolts out of the car and runs to the front trailer.  He
	SHOUTS in through the broken front window.

 EDDIE HEY! HELLO?! 
 IN THE REAR TRAILER, 
	The three look up from their precarious positions.

 MALCOLM WE'RE IN HERE! GET SOME ROPE! 
 OUTSIDE, 
	Eddie turns and run back to the jeep.  He grabs a coil of
	rope, secures one end around a tree, and hurries back to the
	trailer.

 IN THE REAR TRAILER, 
	Eddie dashes over the mess in the front trailer and crawls out
	into the extended connector.  He peers over the edge, down
	into the second trailer, and tosses the rope.

 EDDIE 		Catch!

	The rope falls through the center of the trailer, its end
	dangling all the way out the smashed rear window.  But the
	trailer SHUDDERS, starting to move again.

 SARAH 		We're sliding!

 EDDIE 		Climbs up if you can!

 OUTSIDE, 
	Eddie runs out of the trailer in time to see the wheels
	dragging forward through the mud as the weight of the dangling
	trailer pulls the whole thing toward the edge of the cliff.

	He runs for the jeep and grabs hold of the power winch on the
	front grill.

	Behind him, the trailer rolls closer to the edge of the cliff.

	Eddie races back to the trailer, pulling out a length of cable
	behind him.  He runs up to the still-moving trailer, dives for
	its towing hook, the cable goes taut --

	-- and he falls short.  Just by six inches, but he's out of
	cable.

 EDDIE 		Damn it!

 INSIDE THE TRAILER, 
	Nick and Sarah are now together, clinging to the rope near the
	bottom of the trailer as it shifts around them.  Malcolm is
	further up, also clinging to the rope.

 OUTSIDE, 
	dirt and rocks pile up around the wheels and spill over the
	edge of the cliff.

	Eddie, back at the jeep, reels out more winch cable.  He turns
	and races back to the trailer just as gravity starts to LIFT
 THE FRONT END OFF THE GROUND! 
	Eddie dives again, and this time the cable hook CLICKS
	securely into the trailer's towing hook.  The trailer lurches
	toward the edge of the cliff and stops.

	But the jeep is jerked forward by the sudden pressure.

 IN THE TRAILER, 
	Malcolm clings to the rope in the middle of the trailer while
	Nick and Sarah try to struggle up it, but a sudden dig knocks
	them back, and their hands slide down the line.  SCREAMING,
	they slide through the trailer and their feet SMASH through
	the remains of the rear window.

	Regaining hold of the rope at the very end, the two of them
	now find themselves hanging out of the rear end of the trailer,
	dangling over the rocky shore below.

 IN THE JEEP, 
	Eddie hits the gas and the tires slosh in the mud, trying to
	get a grip.  The jeep pulls just enough to lower the front
	trailer back to earth.  But the tires spin, fighting to hold
	it there.

 ON THE CLIFFSIDE 
	Sarah and Nick dangle, desperate.

 IN THE JEEP 
	Eddie CHUNKS the shifter into four wheel drive and GUNS the
	engine.  As the motor ROARS, the sound is topped by another
	ROAR, in the distance.

	And this one's not a machine.  But Eddie doesn't hear it.  He
	GUNS the engine again.  There is another ROAR from the jungle.

	Eddie hears this one.  He darts a look at the side view
	mirror.  In it, he sees one of the TYRANNOSAURS bolt out of
	the jungle behind him.

	He GASPS and looks at the other side view.  In it, he sees the
	OTHER REX racing toward him.

	The tyrannosaurs STOMP forward to confront the ROARING jeep.
	The first rex bends over, CHOMPS down on the rear tire, and
	lifts the car to its teeth.

	But the spinning tire LINGS in the rex's mouth, burning it.
	Surprised by the fight in this foe, the rex loses its grip and
	the jeep BANGS back down onto the ground.

	Eddie, horrified, dives down under the steering wheel, to get
	away.  The gas pedal pops up --

	-- which makes the trailer pitch over the side of the cliff.

	But the rex STOMPS down on the jeep to prevent its escape.
	The trailers stop.

	Now the rexes lean down, over the jeep, and focus on Eddie,
	who still covers under the steering wheel.  The first rex
	SNAPS at him, hitting the steering column with it, leaving Eddie fully
	exposed.

	He SCREAMS and the second rex lashes in, seizing him in its
	teeth and tossing him out of the car.

	Eddie pops up into the air between the two rexes, both their
	heads flash at him at the same time, and in a split-second, he
	disappears between their teeth.

	Now completely ignored, the jeep rolls freely forward and the
	trailers drop over the edge of the cliff.

 INSIDE THE TRAILER, 
	Nick, Sarah and Malcolm cling to each other and the rope as
	the trailers fall around them.  The windows flash by as the
	trailers plummet, equipment BANGS and SCRAPES them, but they
	hold on to the rope, still tied to the tree, for dear life.

 ON THE CLIFFSIDE, 
	the trailers slide the rest of the way, exposing the three,
	who pop out the space where the front windshield was.
	Dangling from the rope, they look up and see the jeep, which
	is now rolling to the edge of the cliff.

	It falls, past them, and the whole mess EXPLODES on the rocks
	below.  Finally, it is silent, except for the sound of the
	surf.

 EXT. CLEARING - NIGHT 
	It's quiet up here too, the rexes nowhere to be seen.  At the
	cliff, a hand appears from over the edge.  Then another.
	SARAH pulls herself up, back onto solid ground, then comes
	NICK, then both of them reach over and help MALCOLM up over
	the edge.

	They collapse there, in the mud, completely exhausted.

 MALCOLM 			(softly)
		Eddie?

	He looks at the other two.  They glance around, then drop
	their heads.  Sarah hears a SOUND in the distance.

 SARAH 		Oh, God.  Now what?

	From the edge of the jungle, a cris-cross of flashlight beams
	moves toward them.  But rather than the three or four that
	would signify their own group, there are nearly twenty of
	them.

	The HUNTERS, PETER LUDLOW is in the lead, ROLAND and AJAY
	with him.  DIETER is there too, shepherding KELLY and DR.
	JUTTSON along in front of him.

	Malcolm sees Kelly, they call out to each other, and race
	together.  Malcolm falls to his knees and hugs her as tightly
	as he possibly can.

 MALCOLM 		Are you all right?!  Anything broken?

 KELLY 		I'm fine, I'm fine, I was scared, I
		thought you, are you okay?!

 MALCOLM 		I'm fine... I'm fine...

	Roland looks around, at the mess that was their base camp.

 ROLAND 			(mostly to himself)
		That's what you think.

 CUT TO: 
 EXT. RUINED BASE CAMP - NIGHT 
	In the ruins of the first team's base camp, the survivors of
	the night's two separate catastrophes stand face to face, in a
	heated argument.

	MALCOLM sits off to the side, still holding Kelly in his arms,
	just looking down at the ground and shaking his head.  There's
	something about his posture of defeat that is far more ominous
	than any of the hot tempers that are flaring.  LUDLOW rants to
	SARAH while DIETER looms menacingly over NICK.

 LUDLOW 		Trespassing, sabotage -- you could go
		to jail just for being here, did
		you know that?

 SARAH 		Don't start a legal argument with me,
		this island isn't your property, and
		neither are these animals!

	DR. JUTTSON has encountered DR. BURKE.

 JUTTSON 		What are you doing here, Burke?
		There's no TV cameras, what's the
		point?

 BURKE 		Dr. Juttson, you exist outside the
		classroom.  I am amazed.

	Dieter continues to get in Nick's face.

 NICK 		Are you looking for a problem?

 JUTTSON 			(an urgent whisper)
		Everyone, keep your voices down!

 ROLAND 		Back off, Dieter.

 JUTTSON 		Listen to me, by moving the baby
		rex into our camp, we changed the
		adults' perceived territory!

 LUDLOW 		Their what?

 SARAH 			(she understands)
		Oh, God.

 JUTTSON 		That's why they persisted in
		destroying the trailers, they now
		feel they have to defend this entire
		area!  We're not safe here.

 LUDLOW 			(of Sarah and Nick)
		Thanks to you people.

 SARAH 		Hey, we came here to observe, you
		came here to strip-mine the place!
		It's a looter mentality, all you care
		about is what you can take.

 ROLAND 		None of that matters.  Our
		communications equipment's been
		destroyed.  If your radio and
		satellite phone were in those
		trailers that went off the cliff, and
		I'm guessing by the look on his
		face --

	He points at Malcolm, who is still off to the side, sitting in
	stunned silence.  Malcolm looks up and nods, slowly.  The
	grimness of their situation sinks in.

				ROLAND (cont'd)
		We are stuck here, ladies and
		gentlemen.  And we're stuck together.

 CUT TO: 
 EXT. HUNTERS' CAMP - NIGHT 
	Back in the hunters' now-demolished camp, members of the two
	groups combine their diminished supplies.  They have half a
	dozen large plastic containers of water, thirty-seven
	containers of food, ranging from Ziploc bags to aluminum tins,
	a variety of weapons, mot of them borne on the hips or
	shoulders of the HUNTER team, the charred and scraggly
	remnants of several pieces of now-useless electrical
	equipment, a flare gun and several flares, somebody's tattered
	paperback ("Crime and Punishment"), a box of Hershey bars, and
	a cartoon of Marlboros.

	ROLAND supervises the assembling of the resources, which are
	displayed in front of him.  LUDLOW, NICK, SARAH, JUTTSON, and
	MALCOLM, who is still holding KELLY close to him, are with
	him.  They hold their discussion in quiet tones.

 ROLAND 		If we can't stay in the rex's
		territory, we have to move tonight.

 SARAH 		Move where?  Our boat's not coming
		for two days, your airlift is waiting
		for an order you have no way to
		send --

	Ludlow refers to the charred and trampled satellite
	photographs of the island, which are still mostly legible.

 LUDLOW 		There's a communication center, here,
		in the old worker village.  Hammond
		put in some kind of renewable power
		source replenishing.  It may still
		work.  If we could get there, we
		could send a radio call for the
		airlift.

 NICK 		How far is the village?

 LUDLOW 		I said if we could get there.

 NICK 		Well, how far is it?

 LUDLOW 		A day's walk, maybe more.  That's not
		the problem.

 ROLAND 		What is?

 LUDLOW 		The velociraptors.

	Malcolm looks up sharply.

				LUDLOW (cont'd)
		Our infrareds show their nesting
		sites are concentrated in the island
		interior.  That's why we planned on
		keeping to the outer rim.

	Malcolm shepherds Kelly away from the conversation and mutters
	something to her quietly in the background.

 DIETER 		What are velociraptors?

 JUTTSON 		Carnivores.  Pack hunters.  About six
		feet long, three or four hundred
		pounds, and very, very fast.

	Dieter brandishes his weapon.

 DIETER 		I think we can handle ourselves
		against them.

	Malcolm rejoins the conversation, alone.  He keeps his voice
	low.

 MALCOLM 		No.  I'm quite certain you can't.

 ROLAND 		Look, we have two choices.  We can
		hike back down to the lagoon, where
		we can sit for two days, in the open,
		next to a heavily used water source
		while we're waiting for your boat to
		arrive, or we can head for the
		village, where we might find some
		shelter and we can call for help.

 MALCOLM 		We'd never make it past the raptors.
		Trust me, I have some experience in
		this matter.

	Roland looks at him.

 ROLAND 		That may be.  But you weren't with
		me at the time.

	Malcolm just shakes his head, then turns and walks back to
	Kelly.  Roland turns to the others.

				ROLAND (cont'd)
		Load up.  Let's get this moveable
		feast underway.

 CUT TO: 
 EXT. ISLAND - NIGHT 
	The SURVIVORS set forth, marching through the jungle in a
	column.  Two HUNTERS strap on small shoulder-mounted
	servo-flashlights.  Wires run from the lights end in
	sensor pads which they stick to the skin of their necks.  Thus
	attached, when the hunters turn their heads, the servo-lights
	turn with them, illuminating whatever direction they look in.

	MALCOLM screws the barrel into the Lindstradt rifle and slings
	it over his shoulder as he marches, limping heavily.  He looks
	down at KELLY, who is marching alongside him.  His face shows
	the deepest of regret.  He shakes his head, cursing himself.

 MALCOLM 		Damn it.

	He looks away as Kelly looks up at him, questioning.  ROLAND
	falls into step with Malcolm and notices his limp.

 ROLAND 		You all right?

	Malcolm looks at him, then looks away without answering.

				ROLAND (cont'd)
		Wrong question?

 MALCOLM 		You ever heard of Gambler's Ruin?

 ROLAND 		What's that?

 MALCOLM 		A statistical phenomenon.  Says
		everything in the world goes in
		streaks.  It's real, you see it
		everywhere -- in weather, in river
		flooding, in baseball, in blackjack,
		in stock markets.  Once things go
		bad, they tend to stay bad.  Bad
		things cluster.  They go to hell
		together.

 ROLAND 		Feeling a bit blue, are we?

	Malcolm glances at Kelly, who has taken a slightly faster pace
	and is a few steps ahead of them now.

 MALCOLM 		Just -- flawed.  Very deeply flawed.

 ROLAND 		Why did you come here?

 MALCOLM 		So that others would know about this
		place?

 ROLAND 		Why should they?

 MALCOLM 		Because it exists.

 ROLAND 		It'll still exit if they go on not
		knowing, won't it?

 MALCOLM 		Yes.  And people will live in the
		absence of truth.

 ROLAND 		So the truth is more important to you
		than your life?

 MALCOLM 			(lowers is voice)
		I don't care about my life.  But if
		I'd ever thought for a second that
		she would be in danger --

	Roland follows his gaze forward, to Kelly, who's about ten
	yards ahead now.

 ROLAND 		She yours?

 AHEAD OF THEM, 
	Kelly can hear their voices, faint, but clear.  They are not
	as far away as they think they are.

				MALCOLM (o.s.)
		I'm afraid so.  I don't know what the
		hell I'm doing with kids.  I never
		should have had her.

	Kelly's face shows she heard that part.

 BEHIND HER, 
	Malcolm, unaware, continues with Roland.

				MALCOLM (cont'd)
		Why are you here?

 ROLAND 		Somewhere on this island, there
		exits the greatest predator that
		ever lived.  And the second greatest
		predator must take him down.

 MALCOLM 		But why?

 ROLAND 		You remember that guy, about twenty
		years ago, I forget his name, but he
		climbed Everest without any oxygen,
		came down almost dead.  And they
		asked him, "why did you go up there
		to die?"  And he said "I didn't.  I
		went up there to live."

 MALCOLM 			(nods)
		It's called self-testing.  But in
		your case, it sounds more like
		self-destruction.  A uniquely human
		characteristic.  In fact, human
		beings destroy things so well that I
		sometimes think that's our function.
		Maybe every few sons, some animal
		comes along that kills off the rest
		of the world, clears the decks, and
		lets evolution proceed to his next
		phase.  Maybe death and destruction
		are our job, maybe we're supposed
		to destroy ourselves and every other
		living thing that-

	Every person on the trail within earshot has stopped and is
	staring at Malcolm, shaken by his words.  Roland grabs Malcolm
	by the shirt collar and pulls him close, GROWLING in his ear.

 ROLAND 		Tell you what.  You can see whatever
		you want to, to me, but you will not
		spew any more nihilist rants at
		anyone else in the group.  I'm
		fighting panic, and you push the
		wrong buttons.  Understand?

	Malcolm just blinks.  This guy's in charge.

 CUT TO: 
 EXT. JUNGLE - DAWN 
	As a purple dawn dissolves the night sky, the SURVIVORS
	stagger on, exhausted.  Some are starting to tire, and there
	are spaces in the column.  MALCOLM's limp seems to be getting
	worse.  NICK reaches out, to take Malcolm's pack, but Malcolm
	swats his hand away.

	KELLY, still ahead of him, falls into step with SARAH.

 KELLY 		I don't think -- my dad doesn't
		think we're going to make it.

	Sarah looks at her.

 SARAH 		Your dad is wrong.  About a lot more
		than he knows.

	She puts an arm around her.  Kelly looks up at her, grateful.
	The long march continues.

 UP AT THE FRONT, 
	NICK catches up to ROLAND.

 NICK 		I think you should call a break.

 ROLAND 		Another half hour.

 NICK 		Some of them won't make another half
		hour.  We didn't come this far to
		start dropping in the middle of the
		jungle.  If you don't call it, I
		will.

	Roland looks at him, steely, then SHOUTS to the group.

 ROLAND FIVE MINUTES BREAK! 
	Immediately, the marchers drop where they stood, absolutely
	drained.

 AT THE REAR OF THE GROUP, 
	DRS. BURKE and JUTTSON are bickering.

 JUTTSON 		I can't believe you're still angry
		about that.

 BURKE 		You know, it's very easy to criticize
		the first person who studies
		something.

 JUTTSON 		No, it's easy to criticize sloppy
		research and hasty conclusions.

 NEARBY, 
	MALCOLM checks Nick's bag of videotapes, making sure they're
	still dry and undamaged.  Sarah comes up, watching him.

 SARAH 		You know, even if we do get those
		tapes back, people are going to say
		it's just another hoax.  Ian
		Malcolm's alien autopsy.

 MALCOLM 		Maybe.  Maybe not.

 SARAH 		Ian, they will misplace our evidence,
		shoot holes in our testimony, and say
		some special effects genius created
		the animals.  The only way people
		will ever believe that dinosaurs
		exist is if you dump a T-rex in the
		middle of times Square.

	He doesn't look at her.  She sits down beside her.

				SARAH (cont'd)
		There's something more important that
		you should be thinking about instead.

 BEHIND THEM, 
	Dr. Burke, furious, has stalked away from Juttson and sits
	down on a rock.  H does a double take, noticing something
	behind the rock.  He leans over and picks it up.

	It's an oval shape about eight inches long, with a pebbled
	exterior.  A dinosaur egg.

	Burke's face lights up, fascinated, and he carefully pieces
	the egg in a satchel he wears over one shoulder.

 AT THE REAR OF THE GROUP, 
	DIETER STARK pulls a wad of toilet paper from his pack, drops
	the pack on the ground, and turns to the Hunter nearest him --
	CARTER, his driver, who has his back turned.

 DIETER 		Wait here for me, would ya Carter?

	He steps off the path, into the jungle.  But as we come around
	the front of Carter, we see he's wearing a Walkman, the
	headphone BLARING tinnily in his ears.

	And he didn't hear a word.

 EXT. THICK OF THE JUNGLE - DAY 
	Only a few feet off the path, it's primary forest, the growth
	so thick that almost all sunlight is obscured.  DIETER claws
	forward until he finds a suitable spot to relieve himself.

	He clears away a bunch of leaves and debris and raises his
	hand to his belt buckle.  He freezes, hearing something we
	didn't.  He glances around, head darting, alert to any danger.

	Nothing there.  Just a few distant ANIMAL CALLS--

	-- and s SCURRYING around to his left.

	Dieter snaps his head in that direction.  At first, he sees
	nothing, but as he moves closer, gun extended in front of him,
	he sees a small dinosaur, a COMPSOGRATHUS, the same
	chicken-sized animal Cathy saw on the beach so long ago.

 DIETER 		It's not polite to --

	He pulls the steel rod out of a loop in his belt and touches
	it to the compy's back.  The blue bolt of electricity CRACKS
	and dances over the compy's body and it convulses in pain.

				DIETER (cont'd)
		-- sneak up on people.

	The wounded compsognathus scurries back into the jungle,
	whimpering.  Dieter clambers through the foliage ten or twelve
	paces, pushes aside two large palm fronds, and steps out
	into --

	-- more jungle.  He stops, puzzled, not sure if he went back
	or forward.

	He looks behind him.  He pauses, recalculating the path he
	took coming into the jungle, MUTTERING to himself, gesturing
	with his hands, retracing his steps.

	He adjusts his angle slightly to the right and heads off in
	that direction.  But after five or six hard-fought steps, he
	stops again.  Still nothing but jungle.

 DIETER HEY! CARTER! YELL OR SOMETHING, I GOT TURNED AROUND IN HERE! 
 ON THE TRAIL, 
	Dieter's cries are faint, but audible.  The only Marchers hear
	enough to hear him is CARTER, but the Walkman is blaring in
	his ears.

				DIETER (o.s.)
		...Carter... me?...

 IN THE JUNGLE, 
	Dieter hears that SCURRYING sound again, this time from his
	right.  He adjusts his angle again and SCRAPES through the
	foliage, moving faster and faster.

	Panicking, he ties to run, but the roots rise high out of the
	ground in the jungle, and he trips on one and falls flat on
	his face.

	He looks up.  The SCURRYING sound comes again, this time ten
	times louder than before, like a hundred feet coming at him.

	Dieter GASPS as something rushes in at him.

	He whirls to his right.  Whatever it is rushes in from that
	side as well.  And the left.  And behind him.  Dieter
	scrambles up into a sitting position --

	-- and laughs.  He is surrounded by at least forty compys now,
	the same as the one he wounded.

	For a long moment, they just stare at him.  Slowly, he brings
	his gun around, to point it at them.

 DIETER 		Easy -- wait -- one more sec-

	As one, the compys SHRIEK and hurl themselves forward,
	covering Dieter's body.  Their teeth and claws FLASH as they
	each try to grab a scrap of his flesh, tearing savagely.

	Dieter SCREAMS and flails, waving his arms and legs wildly.
	Some of the tiny animals lose their grip and sail off,
	SMASHING into trees or the ground.  But dozens of others hang
	on, and Dieter falls over backwards, now lying on his back on
	the ground.

	Hysterical, he fights like hell to get to his feet, SCREAMING,
	shaking, swatting the compys loose.  He spins, and that tactic
	seems to work, as the compys themselves begin to panic and
	drop off of him.  But he also loses his grip on his weapon,
	which goes flying, landing in the thick foliage five or six
	feet from him.

	Losing the attack, the compys turn and dart away en masse,
	stopping ten yards away from him.

	But they turn and regroup, facing him in a line, hopping up
	and down, CHIRPING and SHRIEKING.

	Dieter bounds into the foliage, looking for his gun.  But the
	compys follow him in and he's forced to flee, abandoning his
	lost weapon.

	Ten feet on, he stops, knowing he's screwed without the gun.
	He turns to face the pursuing compys.

	They stop.

	Dieter charges them, SHOUTING, waving his arms.

	The compys turn and run.  Dieter stops.

	The compys stop.  They stare back at him.  There is a moment
	of quiet, then they start to hop again, CHIRPING and
 SQUEALING. 
	Dieter, tired of this game, turns and runs away.

	The compys follow.

 EXT. JUNGLE - DAY 
	From the front of the convoy, ROLAND SHOUTS out.

 ROLAND 		Break's over, move on!

	The exhausted marchers drag themselves back to their feet and
	start to march again.  At the rear of the group, someone taps
	Carter, who is still listening to his music.  Carter gets up,
	hoists his backpack, and marches away.

	Behind him, Dieter's pack is left, forgotten, on the jungle
	trail.

 EXT. DEEP IN THE JUNGLE - DAY 
	DIETER stumbles along, exhausted.  He reaches the edge of a
	stream that runs under the foliage, and his feet slip on the
	stones.  He falls, into the rocky stream.

	Behind him, the army of compys pours over the little hill he
	just crested.  They disappear for a moment, down an incline --

	-- And then swarm over his body.  In a frenzy of splashing,
	Dieter shrugs them off and crawls away, through the stream.
	He gets to his feet but falls again, this time over a log.  A
	geyser of water splashes up in the air behind the log as
	Dieter drops out of sight.

	The compys leap over the log and disappear from view too,
	throwing up their own splashes of water.  SCREECHING,
	CHIRPING, and the sound of TEARING flesh mixes with Dieter's
 SCREAMS. 
	Now, as more compys leap over the log and splash into the
	water below, the geysers that shoot up into our field of view
	are pink.

	And then they're a deep, deep red.

 CUT TO: 
 EXT. JUNGLE - DAY 
	The group has stopped again.  Near the rear, SARAH, NICK,
	MALCOLM, LUDLOW, and ROLAND are in a tense conversation with
 CARTER. 
 ROLAND 		How long ago was this?

 CARTER 		Seven, eight minutes.

	Roland looks at them, thinking.  Finally:

 ROLAND 		Then he's dead.  Nobody tells the
		little girl.  Last thing we need is
		screaming hysterics.

	He turns and heads back to the front of the column.

 SARAH 		We have to send someone to look for
		him!

 ROLAND 		You go if you like, but we're not
		waiting for you.  MOVE IT OUT!!

	They look at each other, appalled, but the column starts to
	move.  Numbed, shocked, but left with no choice, they move on,
	one by one.

 CUT TO: 
 EXT. ISLAND RIDGE - DUSK 
	The column of MARCHERS has finally reached the island ridge,
	where they are silhouetted against the setting sun.  They're
	taking a break, sprawled out on rocks or over the ground.

	MALCOLM sits next to KELLY, who's sitting on a log.

 MALCOLM 		You okay?

	She doesn't look at him, just gets up and walks away, going to
	sit over next to SARAH.

	Malcolm watches, pained, but Sarah puts an arm around her and
	makes a "she's okay" gesture to Malcolm.

 AT THE RIDGE, 
	ROLAND steps up to the very edge and peers into the island
	interior.  From his vantage point, he's able to see all the
	way to the far side of the island, a rim of herd black cliff,
	miles away.  Between here and the cliffs there is nothing but
	gently undulating jungle.

	He refers to one of the satellite recon photos.

 ROLAND 		Looks like the worker village is down
		in there, about a mile and a half
		northeast from the base of these
		cliffs.

	MALCOLM is next to him.

 MALCOLM 		There must be a game trail, some kind
		of path that goes down there.

	Roland looks around at the exhausted MARCHERS.

 ROLAND 		They'll have to rest before we look
		for it.  Eat.  Sleep.  Two hours.
		Then we hit it.

 CUT TO: 
 EXT. CAMPSITE - NIGHT 
	The group has made camp in the jungle.  The mood is somber,
	most of the MARCHERS asleep already.  Three or four tents have
	been put up.

 IN ONE TENT, 
	KELLY sits quietly in a corner, her eyes wide, knees hugged up
	to his chest.  SARAH comes in.

 SARAH 		There you are.  Your dad's looking
		for you.

 KELLY 		I doubt that.

	Sarah takes off her outer shirt and hangs it over a bar to dry
	the broad red smear across its front.

 SARAH 		Oh, come on.  Go talk to him.

 KELLY 		Why?  He likes to be alone.  I can
		stay with you.

 IN THE CAMPSITE, 
	all is still.  The nocturnal jungle HOOTS and BUZZES around
	the sleeping marchers.

	In his tent, ROLAND abruptly sits up.  As if he heard
	something.  He looks out the open flap.  In the middle of the
	campsite, he sees AJAY stop in his tracks, head cocked.

	Roland gets up and goes outside, joining Ajay in the middle of
	the camp.

 ROLAND 		You hear something?

 AJAY 		No.  I feel something.

	Roland looks at him.  This isn't so good.  He looks out at the
	shifting jungle.  He notices a thin plume of smoke rising up
	over the trees just barely outside the edge of camp.

 ROLAND 		Oh, no.

 IN SARAH'S TENT, 
	Kelly and Sarah have laid down on top of sleeping bags, trying
	to get a few minutes' rest.  Sarah's shirt hangs over them,
	swaying in the gentle breeze coming through the open flap.

	As the shirt dangles there, swinging softly from side to side,
	we notice the broad red smear across the front.  Oh, that's
	right -- it's blood.

	The baby T-rex's blood.

 AT THE RIDGE OF CAMP, 
	the thin plume of smoke leads down to a tiny cooking fire
	that's been lit by DR. BURKE.

	He's set a small frying pan on top of it, and now he CRACKS
	the dinosaur egg he picked up earlier into the pan.

	Roland and Ajay run up behind him.

 ROLAND 			(hisses)
 ARE YOU OUT OF YOUR MIND?! 
	Burke leaps out of the way as Roland kicks dirt on the fire.

 BMBB! 
	Roland, Ajay, and Burke all freeze.  What was that?

 IN SARAH'S TENT, 
	Sarah and Kelly sit up.  They felt it too.

 BMBB! 
 AT THE COCKING FIRE, 
 ROLAND 		Get my weapon.

	Ajay turns and trots away a few steps, then stops cold,
	staring down at the ground.

 BMBB! 
	A recent rain has all left puddles scattered around the camp, and
	impact tremors now create ripples in the puddles -- concentric
	circles spreading to the outer edges.

 BMBB! 
 IN SARAH'S TENT, 
	Sarah and Kelly are frantically sealing up any opened food
	into Ziploc bags.

 BMBB! 
	Now they leap into Sarah's sleeping bag, to seal themselves,
	and draw the zipper up, all the way around.

	Outside, the silhouette of the rex's head passes by the tent.
	Sarah works faster, her fingers struggling to close the last
	few inches, but --

	-- the rex head pokes through the flap of the tent.  It
	sniffs, SNORTING the air in and out.  It looks around the
	tent.

	It sniffs Sarah's hanging shirt, the one that is stained with
	the blood of the baby tyrannosaur.  The adult tyrannosaur
	GURGLES again, COOING and cocking its head curiously.

	In the sleeping bag, Sarah and Kelly's eyes are barely
	visible, wide in panic.  The rex sniffs and nudges the bag,
	trying to figure out what this thing is.

	It rolls the bag over once, decides it's uninteresting, and
	then rises, straights up --

	-- taking the whole tent with it!  The stakes pop out of the
	ground as the tent rises high up into the air and flutters
	away, leaving the sleeping bag fully exposed on the ground
	beneath it.

 IN THE CAMPSITE, 
	the SECOND TYRANNOSAUR now steps out of the jungle, joining
	the first.  Panic hits the camp as the sleeping HUNTERS wake
	up.  Many of them start to run.

	Roland scrambles toward his tent, where he can see his weapon
	lying near the open flap.  As he draws close, an enormous
	T-rex foot stomps down on the tent, driving the rifle deep
	into the mud.

	Roland, weaponless, stands frozen, watching as the panicked
	Hunters flee in all directions.

 ROLAND FOR CHRIST'S SAKE, DON'T RUN! 
	But they ignore him, sweeping him up in the wave of flushed
	prey that pours across the campsite.  Some toss random and
	ill-aimed GUNSHOTS back at the rexes.

 ACROSS THE CAMPSITE, 
	NICK bursts out of the crowd, sees Kelly and Sarah struggling
	to get out of the sleeping bag, and grabs each by an arm.  He
	rips them to their feet and sweeps them off ahead of him, into
	the jungle.

 IN THE MIDDLE OF THE CROWD, 
	MALCOLM, blinking back sleep, stands a good head above the
	rest of the panicking crowd.  Frantically, he scans the group.

 MALCOLM KELLY? KEEEEELLLY?! 
	But he can't see her.

 AT THE EDGE OF CAMP, 
	the two rexes join forces, herding the fleeing Hunters into a
	narrow ravine.

 UP ON A ROCK RACE, 
	Roland scrambles up a steep rock face.  No way in hell he's
	going down  that ravine.  He sees Malcolm, still in the middle
	of the camp, start to head for the ravine.

 ROLAND MALCOLM! OVER HERE! 
	Malcolm runs over and hurls himself at the rock face,
	scrambling to climb up the smooth, steep boulders.

	Behind him, one of the rexes spots him and lunges across the
	camp toward him.

				ROLAND (cont'd)
 FASTER!! 
	Malcolm gives it everything he's got, clawing his way up the
	rock face --

	-- and rex draws closer and pounces at his legs --

	-- and Roland reaches down, grabs Malcolm by the hair and
	pulls him up, out of the rex's grasp.

	The rex falls short, but he's close enough that we can hear
	his teeth SNAP together, closing around nothing but air.  It
	turns, sees easier prey in the fleeing Hunters, and takes off
	after them.

	Malcolm lands on top of the rock ledge with a CRUNCH.  Roland
	unceremoniously dumps a fistful of hair in his lap.

 IN THE RAVINE, 
	Kelly, in the middle of the fleeing crowd with Sarah and Nick,
	hears her father screaming her name and looks up.  Malcolm and
	Roland are on the rock ridge above them, keeping pace.

 MALCOLM 			(shouting)
 KELLY, UP HERE! 
	But Kelly continues to flee, as the rexes are in the ravine
	now, and drawing closer to the group.

	Some Hunters try to leap up and scale the rocks, but the
	ravine is deepening, there's no way out.  One rex grabs hold
	of a Hunter in its teeth and hurls him against the rock face.

	The second rex picks up another Hunter and snaps its massive
	head left and right quickly, to break its victim's neck.  The
	Hunter goes flying forward and crashes into --

	-- CARTER, Dieter's driver, who stumbles and falls.  The rest
	of the fleeing humans run around or over him, but when the
	rex lifts its foot, we see Carter is actually stuck to the
	bottom of it --

	-- and when the animal takes its next step it CRUSHES him into
	the earth.

 UP ON TH ROCK FACE, 
	Malcolm is frantic.

 MALCOLM 		I gotta get down there!

 DOWN IN THE RAVINE, 
	it's obvious no one is going to outrun the rexes, and Nick
	knows it.  He bursts ahead of Sarah and Kelly and spots
	something off to his left.

	It's a waterfall, apparently right in front of a sheer rock
	face.  But there's something about the way the water is
	falling that tells him something.

 NICK SARAH KELLY COME HERE! 
	He grabs each of them and hauls them forward, running straight
	at the waterfall.  Apparently, he intends to jump right into
	the rock, and he's dragging them along with him.

 SARAH WHAT ARE YOU- 
 NICK JUMP! 
	The three of them spring right at the waterfall and disappear
	THROUGH the water.

	DR. BURKE, fleeing along with everyone else, is watching as
	they vanish.

 BEHIND THE WATERFALL, 
	there is a small recess, which is what Nick had hoped for.
	It's small, only four or five feet deep, but it's just enough
	for him, Sarah, and Kelly to cover behind the flowing water.
	Breathless, terrified, they can hear the mayhem outside.

 NICK 		Shhhh... shhhh...

	With an enormous SPLASH, something bursts through the
	cascading water and crashes into them.

	Dr. Burke.

 BURKE 		Get out of the way!

	He pulls his way up against the far wall, as far away from the
	water as he can.

	FOOOOM!  Now another shape bursts through the watery curtain.

	A Tyrannosaur head.  Burke gave away the hiding spot.

	The four SCREAM as the rex's jaws SNAP left and right,
	searching for them, falling just inches short.  They squeeze
	as far back against the wall as they can get.

	The rex can't quite get its head all the way through the
	opening --

	-- so it uses its tongue.  A long, dark blue shape slithers
	out of its mouth and touches the humans, trying to wrap around
	them, to pull them out of the cave.

	Burke, blind with panic, forces himself even further into the
	cave, which pushes Kelly further out.

 SARAH STOP IT YOU'RE PUSHED HER OUT STOP IT! 
	But Burke doesn't listen, throwing elbows to make room for
	himself.  His movements dislodge a portion of muddy earth, and
	a flurry of enormous cockroaches, eight or nine inches long
	each, pour out of the wall and swarm over his face and neck.

	Burke SCREAMS and instinctively leaps away, toward the flowing
	water.

	And that's all the leverage the rex needs.  It curls its
	tongue, wrapping Burke up in it and pulling him between its
	teeth.  SCREAMING hideously, he is dragged out, through the
	waterfall, and disappears.

	Sarah, Nick, and Kelly stare in horror as the white screen of
	water turn pink.

 UP ON THE ROCK FACE, 
	Malcolm and Roland see the rex walk away from the waterfall
	with Burke, leaving the hiding place unmolested.  Malcolm is
	nearly hysterical.

 ROLAND 		She's okay!  They'll stay in there,
		she's okay!

 IN A JUNGLE CLEARING, 
	routed Hunters emerge from the gully at the edge of he
	jungle.  Ahead of them, there is a large open plain covered by
	long "elephant" grass.

	AJAY, running along with them, stops abruptly at the edge of
	the grass, SHOUTING to the others.

 AWAY NO! DON'T GO INTO THE LONG GRASS! 
	Not in the frenzy, they ignore him.  Behind Ajay, the enormous
	shadows of the two pursuing tyrannosaurs stop as well, holding
	up at the edge of the jungle.

	Ajay, torn between a sense of responsibility and his better
	judgement, opts for the former and races into the grass after
	the other Hunters, waving his arms.

 UP ABOVE THEM, 
	Roland and Malcolm come out onto a rocky ledge that has a view
	of the plain below.  Roland can see the Hunters leaving trails
	as they plow through the grass.

 ROLAND 		Elephant grass!

 ON THE PLAIN, 
	the groups of Hunters wades into the middle of the long grass.
	One of them stops and turns, looking back at the jungle trees.

 HUNTER 		They gave up!  They're not chasing
		us!

	There are CHEERS, SIGHS OF relief.  In the distance, AJAY'S
	VOICE can be heard, faintly calling to them to come back.  Up
	on the rock in the distance, they can see Roland, waving his
	arms madly.

	But in the giddiness of their escape, they pay it no mind.
	They continue plowing into the high grass, anything to get
	further away from the tyrannosaurs.

 ABOUT FIFTY YARDS AWAY, 
	the tops of three animal heads rise up slowly, backlit by
	the full moon.  In the distance, the heads can seethe Hunter
	party.  The heads descend, back into the grass.

 BACK WITH THE HUNTERS, 
	they continue forward, oblivious.  Now behind them, four
	more heads rise up in the grass.  As then descend.

	On all sides of the Hunters, the grass ripples as animals move
	forward toward them, undetected, inexorable as torpedoes.

	And these torpedoes are on target.  One Hunter is suddenly
	dragged down, yanked silently below the surface of the tall
	grass.

	In his place, a long, lizard-like tail rises up as the animal
	drops its head to make the kill.

	Behind him, two more Hunters are taken down, and two more
	animal tails rise up in their place.  A Hunter ahead hears the
	RUSTLING and turns.  His face turns white as, behind him --

	-- a VELOCIRAPTOR springs out of the grass.

	Velociraptor runs upright on its powerfully muscled hind legs,
	the second tow of each foot bearing an extra-large curved
	claw, carried in a retracted position, with which it slashes
	on attack.

	Like now.  This raptor SNARLS and SLAMS into the body of the
	Hunter, taking him down.  A feeding frenzy ensues.  The
	Hunters run in all directions, but are pulled down and vanish
	into the twitching long grass.

	Another raptor enters from the right, leaps high into the air,
	past the full moon, SLAMS into the chest of more human prey,
	and takes him down, into the grass.

	Behind them, Ajay's face falls, defeated.  He looks around,
	realizing he too is now stranded in the middle of the long
	grass.

	Around him, four torpedo trails head straight for him.

	Ajay simply closes his eyes.

 UP ON THE ROCK, 
	Roland turns away from the carnage, pained.

 CUT TO: 
 EXT. RUINED CAMPSITE - NIGHT 
	SARAH, MALCOLM, KELLY, NICK, ROLAND, DR. JUTTSON, and PETER
	LUDLOW stand in the ruins of their campsite, their ranks
	decimated, spirits shattered.

	Roland is at the hole in the ground where his tent once was.
	He has pulled his .800 Nitro Express from the mud and more or
	less cleaned it, now he's checking the loads.

	Kelly, nearly catatonic with fear, clings to Sarah, and it
	doesn't look as if she'll ever let go.  Malcolm, who is on his
	knees picking through the wreckage of a tent, looks over at
	them, but Sarah waves him off -- "she's okay."

	Roland appears, standing over the group.  He looks at Malcolm,
	who has found the Lindstradt rifle, intact.

 ROLAND 		How many rounds did you find for that
		weapon?

 MALCOLM 		Four, counting the one in the
		chamber.

 ROLAND 		Don't let it out of your hands again.
			(to Sara, but looking at
			 Kelly)
		Can the kid walk?

 SARAH 		Ask her.

 ROLAND 		Can the kid walk?

 KELLY 		I can.  I can walk.

	While he addresses the group, Roland straps on one of the
	servo-lights, the shoulder-mounted flashlights that follow
	your gaze.

 ROLAND 		We're going to find a path down into
		the interior of the island.  Load up
		whatever you think you need, and I
		mean need.  If you can't carry it
		indefinitely, don't bring it.  We'll
		hit the worker village in a couple
		hours and be out of here before dawn.

 AT THE EDGE OF CAMP, 
	Roland bends over one of the three-toed footprints left by the
	rex.  Behind him, the rest of the group is packing up,
	slinging the remnants of their equipment over their shoulders.

	Roland bends over and SNIFFS the footprint.  It's filled with
	a liquid of some kind.

	He takes his canteen, dumps the remaining water into the
	ground, and plunges the canteen into the footprint, filling
	it.  Ludlow hovers over his shoulder.

 LUDLOW 		What is that?

 ROLAND 		Piss.

	Ludlow doesn't ask.

 NOW AT THE FIRE, 
	Roland stares down at the ashes of the cooking fire that led
	to such disaster.  He grabs a handful of the ash and shoves it
	in his pants pocket.

 CUT TO: 
 EXT. VALLEY OF DEATH - NIGHT 
	ROLAND and LUDLOW (who, along with Sarah and Malcolm, is also
	wearing a servo-light now) maneuver down a rugged hillside and
	come out in a flattened area.  Ludlow GASPS, looking ahead in
	wonderment.  MALCOLM breaks through the hillside's foliage a
	moment later.  He too stares in amazement.

	SARAH and KELLY come next, then NICK, then JUTTSON.  One by
	one, they all stop and stare.

 SARAH 		God help us.

	They're standing in a flat, sandy area lined with boulders at
	the sides.  The flat area stretches fifty yards from side to
	side and as far as they can see ahead.  But that's not what
	amazes them so.

	Everywhere, the sand is dotted with dinosaur skeletons.  Some
	are huge, apatosaurs, sixty feet from head to tail tip.
	Others are smaller, herbivores of many different kinds.  The
	more intact skeletons lie on their sides, their ribcages arcs
	of pale bone.  but just as many have been ripped apart, bits
	of carcass tossed in every direction.

 NICK 		I do not feel lucky.

 ROLAND 		Keep moving.

	They march on, tiny figures moving among the mountainous
	skeletons by the light of the full moon.  Roland notices one
	carcass in particular, a recent kill.  It's an enormous
	HADROSAUR with fresh bites taken out of it.

	He bends down, studying the soft earth around it for
	footprints.

 FURTHER ON, 
	Malcolm looks up, noticing the bony shapes around them, which
	fall in heavy shadows like cell bars, seem to be changing.

	He turns, and his servo-light shines on the bones.  But
	they're not bones any more at all, they're pipes, the animal
	graveyard now given over to the lifeless skeletons of manmade
	objects -- twisted, rotting machinery.

 LUDLOW 		We made it!

	They hurry over a small rise --

 EXT. WORKER VILLAGE - NIGHT 
	-- and find themselves at the edge of what was once Isla
	Sorna's worker village.  The size of a football field, the
	town is divided by a main street that's dotted on both sides
	by stores, residences, cafes, a gas station.  All the way at
	the far end is a large, blocky, four-story building.

	But the town is a mess.  The hurricane that hit here must have
	been ferocious, for everywhere things are smashed, broken,
	upended.  And the jungle has stepped into the breath, growing
	up, around, and over everything.  Huge root systems snake
	through the street, making it almost impassable.

 MALCOLM 		The jungle.  It's always ready to
		return.

	Roland catches up and looks at Ludlow.

 ROLAND 		Where's the power and radio setup?

 LUDLOW 		Operations building.  Far end of the
		street.

	A light rain falls as they start down the street, carefully,
	silently, Roland and Malcolm with their weapons at the ready.

	They pass the skeleton of a fallen water tower.  An empty gas
	station, its vine-snarled pumps now useless.  The only sound
	is the low mechanical HUM of the servo-lights as they follow
	the group's gazes obediently.

	Every few feet, the group encounters strange, grayish lumps
	that lies in random places in the middle of the street.
	Malcolm, curious, stops and taps one of them.  It's a rock-hard.
	Nick looks over his shoulder.

 NICK 		Lava?

 MALCOLM 		No.

 NICK 		What are they?

 MALCOLM 		I don't know.

	Finally, they reach the operation building, at the far end of
	the town.

 LUDLOW 		The radio rig is inside.  It runs
		directly from the geothermal
		generator, so power shouldn't be a
		problem.

 ROLAND 		Good.

	He pulls out his canteen.  Ludlow watches as he screws the top
	off, moves toward the building, and starts splashing the
	contents on the outside of it.

	The rest of the group just stares at him.

 MALCOLM 		What's he got in there?

 LUDLOW 		Piss.

 SARAH 		What?

 LUDLOW 		Don't ask me.  The guy's completely
		out to lunch.

 NICK 		What in God's name would he want
		with-

	Roland rejoins them.

 ROLAND 		Tyrannosaur urine.  I don't want
		anything to do with it, and neither
		does any other animal on this island.
		This building is now demarcated as
		the rex's territory.  As long as you 
		stay in that building, you'll all be
		safe until the helicopter comes.

	He drops his pack, swings his gun off his shoulder, and checks
	the load.  Dr. Juttson looks fearful.

 JUTTSON 		Where are you going?

 ROLAND 		After the rex.  I saw a fresh kill
		back in the valley with tyrannosaur
		tracks all around it.  If I'm not
		back in time, don't wait for me.

 SARAH 		You've got to be kidding.

 ROLAND 		Runs against my nature to hole up in
		a cave and wait.

 LUDLOW 		Do you think the rex might have the
		infant with it?

 ROLAND 		Possible.

	Ludlow takes off his hat and turns to Nick.

 LUDLOW 		You know how to work a radio, don't
		you?

 SARAH 		You're going too?

 LUDLOW 		I lost everything I came after on
		this trip, but one T-rex in one theme
		park could single-handedly bail
		InGen out of Chapter 11.

	He takes a slip of paper from the brim of his hat and hands it
	to Nick.

				LUDLOW (cont'd)
		This is the broadcast frequency.  ID
		yourself as "Harvest Leader."  You
		know what to tell 'em.

 MALCOLM 		You gentlemen feel you have to do
		this now?

 ROLAND 		Now's the perfect time.  The animal
		just fed, so it won't stalk us for
		food.  Predators don't hurt when
		they're not hungry.

	Ludlow double checks the clip on his semi-automatic rifle --

 NICK 		No.

	-- and SMACKS it back into the belly of the gun.

				NICK (cont'd)
		Only humans do.

 CUT TO: 
 INT. COMMUNICATIONS ROOM - NIGHT 
	The console of a sophisticated radio set-up glows brightly,
	all green, red, and yellow.  NICK tunes the dial to a specific
	frequency.  The radio WHINES and HISSES tuning in.

 NICK 			(into microphone)
		CQ, CQ.  This is InGen Operation
		Harvest Leader to Harvest Base.  Come
		in, please.

	The remaining SURVIVORS, minus Ludlow and Roland, shine their
	flashlights around the dusty, vine-hung interior of the
	communications room.  On the wall a row of chrome letters says
	"We Make The Future,"  but the words are obscured by a tangle
	of vines.  Mushrooms and fungi sprout from the carpet.

	On one wall, there is a mural of what the completed Jurassic
	Park would have looked like.  Big hotels, Ford Explorers with
	tourists leaning out the windows taking pictures, big crowds
	at the fences around the animal exhibits.  But none of it came
	true, and now even the mural is runny and dust-covered.

	There is a pause, filed only with radio static.  Sarah looks
	at Nick tensely, waiting.  Finally, a VOICE comes over the
	radio, clean as can be.

				VOICE (o.s.)
		Go ahead, Harvest Leader.

	They all breath a sign of relief.

 CUT TO: 
 EXT. MAIN STREET - NIGHT 
	With Roland and Ludlow gone on the hunt and the rest of the
	group inside the operations building, main street stands
	deserted and silent.

	Nearly deserted, anyway.  Moonlight shadows lengthen at one
	end of the street --

	-- and FIVE VELOCIRAPTORS STROLL INTO TOWN.

 CUT TO: 
 EXT. VALLEY OF DEATH - NIGHT 
	ROLAND AND LUDLOW are back in the valley of death, standing
	amid the giant skeletons of long-dead animals.  Roland bends
	down, checking the carcass of the freshly-chewed HADROSAUR he
	saw earlier.

	A set of giant three-toed rex tracks leads away from the
	carcass, down the stream bed.  Roland follows them.  Ludlow
	follows Roland.

	As they near a bend in the stream, Roland looks down, at the
	surface of the water.  A pattern of ripples moves toward them,
	washing over their ankles.  Roland follows the ripples with
	his eyes.  From up head, around the bend, he can hear the
	sound of an animal eating and drinking.  A very large animal.

	He reaches into his pocket and pulls out a  pinch of the ashes
	from the cooking fire that he scooped up earlier and releases
	that on the wind.  They float there for a second, suspended,
	then blow back at him.

 LUDLOW 		We're downwind.  Good.

	Roland darts a contemptuous look at him.  He puts a finger to
	his lips, gesturing for silence, then steps up, onto the
	shore.  Ludlow follows.

	They creep forward, toward the sounds.  They round the bend
	and Roland hits his belly, edging up over a small rise.

	Over the rise, he sees the TYRANNOSAUR, about a hundred yards
	ahead.  It's stooped over the stream bed, drinking.  Like a
	bird, it dips its head in the water and then straightens up,
	to let the water fall down its throat.  A dozen COMPYS are at
	the water as well, drinking.

	Roland gently FLICKS the safety on his gun to "off."

	Ludlow edges toward the cover of a low-hanging branch.  As he
	puts his weight on one knee, it presses down hard on the
	middle of a small stick, which CRACKS in half.  Roland turns,
	eyes blazing.

	Out in the open, the tyrannosaur snaps its head sharply as
	well, staring in the direction of the sound.  But since
	Roland's own head is turned, he doesn't see the dinosaur's
	reaction.  Roland holds a warning finger out to Ludlow.

	Roland turns his head back.  The tyrannosaur is gone.

 FURTHER ON, 
	the trail of three-toed tyrannosaur footprints stops abruptly.
	Roland stops too, gesturing for Ludlow to freeze behind him.
	Roland glances both ways, looking for any sign of the track.

	To the right, the ground gives way to hard black volcanic rock.
	A short distance behind them, the rock is solid, a massive,
	green, pebbled boulder ten feet high.  Roland frowns and
	WHISPERS in Ludlow's ear again.

 ROLAND 		We took to the rock.

 LUDLOW 		Why?

	In front of Roland, a palm frond sways gently in the night
	breeze.  Roland's eyes widen.  He pulls out another pinch of
	campfire ash and releases it on the wind.

	This time, the ash blows off, straight away from him.

 ROLAND 		Wind shift.

	They freeze, terrified.  Behind them, the enormous green
	pebbled boulder --

	-- opens an eye.

	That's no boulder, that's the MALE TYRANNOSAUR, standing
	rock-solid still, its natural camouflage blending into the
	surrounding foliage perfectly.  Very slowly and almost
	silently, the rex brings its head all the way around until it
	is staring directly down at them from about ten feet away.

	Roland and Ludlow stand frozen, their back to the rex,
	unaware of its presence.

	Until it exhales.  The soft SNORT of its breath isn't quite
	audible, but it brushes the hair on the backs of their necks
	ever so slightly.

	Their hearts drop into their stomachs.  Ludlow speaks, his
	voice a queasy HISS.

 LUDLOW 		It's... behind... us.

 ROLAND 			(the very softest whisper)
		It's just fed.  It won't attack unless
		it's threatened.  Don't move.

	As the rex silently cocks its head, sizing up the danger from
	these intruders, it breathes again.  A few strands of Ludlow's
	hair flap in the exhalation.  He closes his eyes, near tears.

	He can't take it.  His eyes dart, glancing down at the weapon
	he holds in his hands.  Unfortunately, it's extended in front
	of him, away from the rex.

	He risks another HISS.

 LUDLOW 		If I don't move, I can't shoot it.

 ROLAND 		Let it go, Peter.  The animal won.

	Behind them, the rex appears satisfied.  It starts to swing
	its massive head around, back toward the jungle.  It lifts one
	great leg and takes a step into the trees.

	Roland signs and closes his eyes, relieved.

	But Ludlow seizes the opportunity.  He whips his weapon around
	and drops to one knee.

				ROLAND (cont'd)
 NO! 
	The rex is infinitely quicker.  Ludlow just has time to
	squeeze off a short burst of semi-automatic gunfire when the
	animal whirls, takes one elegant step forward, and POUNCES.

	Ludlow's bullets rip harmlessly through the foliage between
	the rex's legs as its big head snaps forward and comes down,
	jaws wide.  They close around Ludlow's body, lift his straight
	up into the air, and toss him once, readjusting their grip so
	it is firmly around his midsection.

	The whole combination of movements takes but half a second.
	By the time Roland turns around, the animal has pivoted and
	darted back into the jungle, carrying Ludlow, still SCREAMING
	and writhing in its mouth.

	Roland raises his gun, to draw a bead on the animal, but
	through the shivering trees, he can only see that the
	tyrannosaur is gone.

 CUT TO: 
 INT. COMMUNICATIONS ROOM - NIGHT 
	MALCOLM SARAH, NICK, KELLY, and DR. JUTTSON wait nervously in
	the communications room.  An empty can of Dr. Pepper sitting
	on one of the countertops begins to RATTLE.  They look over at
	it, confused, as the lightweight aluminum can CHATTERS on the
	formica counter.

	Other objects in the lab begin to rattle too.  Glass jars
	CLANK against one another, books start to drop off the
	shelves, a stool shudders across the floor.

 KELLY 		What's going on?!

	Above them, the rotting wooden roof of the building starts to
	actually tear away, chunks of moldy timber flying up into
	the night.  They look up, a deafening ROAR fills the room --

	-- and a helicopter's searchlight floods in!

	As the chopper dips lower, looking for a place to land, the
	violent prop wash rips away huge chunks of the roof over their
	heads.

 INT. HELICOPTER - NIGHT 
	Up above the operations building, the helicopter circles.  The
	roof of the building is all arches and rotten timber,
	impossible to land open.

	Below, the PILOTS see the SURVIVORS through the torn roof of
	the building.  They wave frantically, their flashlight beams
	piercing the night sky.

 PILOT 		There they are!

	The Co-Pilot scans the street below, but it's choked with
	overturned cars and fallen trees.

 CO-PILOT 		No LZ in the street, too much debris!

 PILOT 		Check the other buildings!

	The Co-Pilot nods and they peel off, swooping over the rest of
	the village.

	At the far end of the street, the Co-Pilot brings the
	searchlight to bear on the large, flat roof of a three story
	building.

	The Pilot gives him a thumbs-up.

 EXT. MAIN STREET - NIGHT 
	MALCOLM, SARAH, KELLY, NICK and finally DR. JUTTSON run out
	the front of the operations building.  At the end of the
	street, they can see the helicopter as it descends slowly over
	the building, to land on its roof.

 MALCOLM 		There it is!

	Happily, the group double-times it down the street, headed for
	the chopper.  Again, those strange rock formations are
	everywhere.  Some seem to be on the sides of buildings, as if
	they once dripped there and then turned to stone.

	This time Sarah pauses at one that is dripping over to the side
	of a car like solidified lava.  Her face falls as a thought
	occurs to her.

 SARAH 		Ian.  It's guano.

 MALCOLM 		What?

 SARAH 		These formations.  They're dried --

 MALCOLM 		Birdshit?

	A VELOCIRAPTORS jumps onto a fallen tree trunk behind them.

	They don't see it.

 NICK 		Who cares?  Let's go!

	Unaware of the raptor's presence, they resume their trot
	toward the helicopter.  Behind them, the raptor crouches and
	SNARLS, but the sound is lost under the WHINE of the
	helicopter's engines.  It springs, covering the distance
	between them quickly.

	The animal SLAMS into JUTTSON, the last person in the group,
	and takes him down.  Juttson is thrown forward, into the
	others, who fall like dominoes.

	Juttson SCREAMS, his voice an unnatural, high-pitched SQUEAL,
	as the raptor flips him over and lowers its jaws into him.

	Sarah looks up, panicked.  Her eyes widen at the sight of a
	SECOND RAPTOR, this one running straight at hr at top speed.
	She buries her face in the dirt, covering her head with her
	hands --

	-- and the raptor's foot SLAMS into the ground between her
	legs as it bounds over her and dives onto Juttson, joining the
	first raptor in the kill.

	Panicked, the group scatters in all directions.  Kelly jumps
	up and scrambles into the middle of the street, where she hits
	the dirt and crawls under a fallen shed in the middle of the
	road.

	Malcolm rolls over to the space where Kelly was, but she's
	gone now.  He looks around frantically.

 MALCOLM 		Kelly?!  KELLY?!

	Sarah rolls onto her feet and sprints toward the building
	nearest her.

	Behind her, a THIRD RAPTOR gives chase, bounding after her
	with horrifying speed.  Sarah runs flat-out, but her speed is
	nothing compared to the raptor's, and it gains on her rapidly.

	The walls of a structure of some kind close in around Sarah,
	and as she leaps across a leather seat and SLAMS a door behind
	her, we realize she's crawled into the back seat of an
	abandoned car.

	But the car door is thin protection against the charging
	raptor, which SLAMS into the window, head first.  The window
	spinderwebs, but does not yield.  The raptor crumples to the
	ground.

	Sarah looks up, through a three inch hole in the middle of the
	web.  The raptor leaps back to its feet and plunges its nose
	into the tiny hole, thrashing, widening it.

	Sarah SCREAMS and the animal forces its entire head through
	the hole, SNAPPING its jaws just short of her face.

	She hurls herself over the seat and into the front as the
	animal penetrates even further into the car, but its torso
	will not fit through the window opening.  It pulls away.

	In the front seat, Sarah gets some very bad news.

	There's no windshield.

	The raptor springs up onto the hood, its claws CLATTERING on
	the sheet metal, and tosses its body through the opening --

	-- just as Sarah hurls herself out the door.  While the raptor
	struggles to right itself in the front seat, Sarah runs to the
	nearest building, ducks inside, and SLAMS the heavy wooden
	door.

 CUT TO: 
 EXT. GAS STATION - NIGHT 
	MALCOLM races between the idled gas pumps and into the gas
	station building, closing the door behind him.  A moment
	later, a raptor bounds after him, SLAMMING into the door.

	Meeting resistance, it bounces off, notices the plate glass
	window next to the door, and pounces at that.  The window
	SHATTERS and the raptor clings to the ledge, staring inside,
	its tail hanging out.

	Just as it gets inside, Malcolm opens the door and comes back
	out, keeping the place of wall between them.  He pulls the
	Lindstradt rifle off his back and tries to take aim --

	-- but the raptor whirls and springs, forcing him back inside,
	through the door again.

	Willing to play along, the raptor turns and jumps through the
	window again.

 INT. GAS STATION - NIGHT 
	Balancing on the window frame, the raptor HISSES and crouches,
	ready to spring at Malcolm.

	Malcolm takes cover behind the door, which is hanging open
	between them.  He raises the rifle.

	Th raptor springs into the door, BLASTING it off its hinges,
	knocking Malcolm right through a window behind him.

	But the door SMACKS up against the wall, covering the window,
	preventing the raptor from following Malcolm out that way.

	For the moment.

 EXT. GAS STATION - NIGHT 
	Malcolm flies through the window and CRUNCHES to the ground.
	He GROANS  in agony and rolls off his bad leg, which is twisted
	unnaturally beneath him, and claws in the mud for the gun.

	ROUGH HANDS reach down, grab him by the shirt, and haul him to
	his feet.  It's NICK.  He drags Malcolm away, but in the
	commotion Nick's duffel slips off his shoulder and lands in
	the street, spilling some of the precious videotapes.

	Malcolm scoops them up.

 NICK 		Come on!

 MALCOLM 		Where's Kelly?

 NICK 		She's with Sarah!

	They race off, down the street.

 CUT TO: 
 INT. KILN HOUSE - NIGHT 
	High above SARAH, we see she is standing alone in a three
	story kiln house, a windowless shed used for firing pottery
	and other construction projects.  Catwalks lined with heavy
	chains hang above her, and onto the floor below, she turns in
	circles, wondering what to do now.

	From outside the kiln house, she hears SCRATCHING, digging
	sounds.  From the other side of the door comes an animal
	SNORT, and a small puff of dust and dirt billows up through
	the crack along the ground.

 ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE DOOR, 
	the claws of one of the raptors dig furiously, trying to
	tunnel underneath.

 INSIDE, 
	Sarah runs to the opposite wall, falls to her knees, and
	starts digging a tunnel of her own, clawing frantically at the
	ganging tools always and CLANKS as it tears at the earth below
	it.

	Sarah digs faster.  So does the raptor.

	With about eight inches of space under the wall, Sarah grabs
	hold of the bottom of one of the plans and pries it up as
	hard as she can.  It snaps off with a loud CRACK.

	At the door, the raptor stops digging.  It's silent for a
	moment.

	Sarah has a good foot and a half of space under her wall now.
	She starts to lower her body into it --

 -- JUST AS THE RAPTOR'S CLAWS FLASH THROUGH FROM THE OTHER SIDE! 
	Sarah falls back, SCREAMING, leaps to her feet, and jumps up,
	grabbing hold of one of the catwalks above.  She starts to
	climb, up, anywhere up, as the RAPTOR now squirms and thrashes
	its way inside, coming in through her hole.

	Sarah climbs, hauling herself up, leaping from one catwalk to
	another.

	The raptor leaps up onto a catwalk as well and follows her.

 EXT. KILM HOUSE - NIGHT 
	A window in the slanted roof of the kiln house EXPLODES in a
	shower of glass as SARAH kicks through it and climbs outside.

 CUT TO: 
 EXT. MAIN STREET - NIGHT 
	Nick drags a badly limping MALCOLM down the main street.  They
	can see helicopter at the far end, engine ROARING and
	searchlight playing over them as they draw closer.  They
	approach a rusted, abandoned pickup in the middle of the
	street --

	-- and a RAPTOR leaps on top of it.  Its claws CLACK on the
	roof as it goes into its pre-attack crouch.

	They don't stick around to negotiate.  Nick hauls Malcolm off
	into the nearest building.

 INT. WORKER HOTEL - NIGHT 
	NICK and MALCOLM hurry inside and SLAM the door behind them.
	They're standing in the lobby of a hotel of some kind,
	probably used for overnight guests and day workers who had to
	spend the night.  The room and staircase wind around a large,
	open-aired central area four stories tall.  They SHOUT at each
	other, frantic.

 MALCOLM 		We can't stay in here!

 NICK 		We're sure as hell not going back out
		there"

 MALCOLM 		This is single-wall construction!
		It's just a shack!

 NICK 		It'll hold!

 MALCOLM 		For sixty seconds, maybe!  Look at
		this!
			(RAPS on the door with his
			 knuckles)
		You could-

	With a CRASH, the wood SPRINTERS around the lock and the door
	swings open violently.  Malcolm is thrown aside, landing hard
	on the floor.

	A VELOCIRAPTOR stands HISSING in the doorway.  Nick throws his
	weight against the door.  SLAMMING it hard against the raptor.

	Malcolm rolls over and paws the gun off his back.

	SLAM!  The raptor charges the door again, this time BLASTING
	it off its hinges, knocking Nick to the floor beneath it.  The
	raptor turns and SNARLS at Malcolm.

	Malcolm swings the gun around --

	-- the raptor lunges at him --

	-- Malcolm's finger closes on the trigger --

	-- and the raptor lands on top of him.

	The weight of the animal CRUSHES him into the floor, but the
	gun barrel now stands between them.  The raptor CHOMPS down
	hard on the barrel, its teeth GRINDING on the metal, and SNAPS
	its head, to tear it from Malcolm's hands.

	Malcolm pulls the trigger.

	The raptor's eyes pop wide as the dart SLAMS into the back of
	its throat.  It makes a GURGLING sound, then convulses
	violently and rolls off of Malcolm, yanking the gun from his
	hands as it falls and dies.

	Nick scrambles out from under the door.  Malcolm tries to
	wrench the gun from the raptor's clenched jaws, but it won't
	budge.

 NICK 			(helping him out)
		Head for the roof!

 MALCOLM 		I have to find Kelly!

 NICK 		I think she's with Sarah!

 MALCOLM DAMN IT, BE SURE!! 
 CUT TO: 
 EXT. MAIN STREET - NIGHT 
	KELLY remains huddled under the fallen shed, trembling with
	fear.  She holds her breath and freezes, as just outside, only
	two feet from where she's hiding --

	-- a RAPTOR'S FEET pick their way past her, down the middle of
	the street.

	Kelly closes her eyes and suppresses a scream.

 CUT TO: 
 EXT. ROOFTOP - NIGHT 
	NICK and MALCOLM burst onto the roof of the now-burning
	hotel and SLAM the door behind them.  The helicopter is now
	only three rooftops away.  They turn and head for it, Nick in
	the lead, but there's an eight foot gap between the buildings.

 MALCOLM 		It's too wide!

	Nick looks around, desperate.  A fallen power pole leans
	against the building they're standing on, its lines gone
	slack.

 NICK 		Help me push this!

	Malcolm understands.  He and Nick throw a shoulder into the
	pole and give it a mighty push, tipping it over in the other
	direction.  One good hard shove and it falls to the far
	building, THUDDING against it solidly.

	Its power lines are not taut, a lifeline from this rooftop to
	the next.  Nick grabs hold and starts to pull himself across
	the gap, hand over hand.

	Behind them, the door of the building SPLINTERS and CRASHES
	open as a raptor throws all its weight into it.  Malcolm leaps
	onto the power line without hesitation and starts pulling
	himself across.

	But even with the door wide open, the raptor on the other side
	hesitates.  It SNARLS and backs away, refusing to come out
	onto the roof.

 ON THE OTHER ROOFTOP, 
	Malcolm lands next to Nick on the second rooftop.  They look
	back at the frightened animal, which takes tow steps out onto
	the roof, SNARLS, and backs into the doorway again.

 NICK 		It's afraid to come onto the roof!

	Malcolm looks around, at the rooftop.  Strange bits of scrap
	and debris seem to have been arranged there, in an odd,
	concentric pattern.

 MALCOLM 		Something's wrong.

 NICK 		Look!  Sarah!

	He points to the roof of the kilm house, in the distance.
	Malcolm turns, and sees SARAH crawling across the tile.  His
	face turns white.

 MALCOLM SHE'S ALONE!! 
 CUT TO: 
 EXT. KILM HOUSE ROOF - NIGHT 
	SARAH has problems.  Still on top of the kilm house, she
	reaches the edge and pushes off the roof, leaping to the roof
	of the next building.

	She lands at the peak of the intersection of the two sides of
	sloping roof.  As she pulls herself up --

	-- a RAPTOR appears on the rooftop behind her.  In full
	stride, it leaps, sails over her, and lands on the roof
	ahead of her.

	Sarah swings to her left and starts to crawl down the slope,
	away from the raptor.  Suddenly the roof board under her
	SPRINTERS and CRACKS under her weight.  The whole section
	pulls up and starts to slide off the roof.  Sarah, clinging to
	it, rides the roof  planks down, away from the raptor.

	She looks over her shoulder, down --

	-- and sees ANOTHER RAPTOR, waiting for her on the roof of the
	building below.

	Sarah quickly rolls off the sliding section of roof, which
	keeps sliding, falling.  The raptor below jumps up, just in
	time to get WHACKED in the head by the falling roof section.

	Sarah tries to cling to the Spanish tile roof, fingers and
	nails slipping on the slick ceramic surface.  She slides all
	the way to the edge, grabs hold of the gutter, and dangles
	there, suspended above one raptor and trapped below another.

	The raptor above works its way down.  The one below leaps up,
	at her dangling legs.  She has left them in time with its
	jumps, to avoid losing her feet.  This can't go on for long.

	Desperate, she pulls one of the Spanish tiles up from the roof
	and hurls it at the raptor below.  It hits the animal in the
	head, for all the good that does.

	But Sarah keeps on, pulling and throwing more tiles.  She
	edges to the right, toward a fresh supply.

	The raptor above edges even closer, claws CLICKING on the
	slick roof.

	Something interesting is happening.  As Sarah pulls the loose
	tiles free, the ones above slide down, to take their place.
	Sarah sees this and pulls more free, knocking them out of the
	way as fast as she can.

	Suddenly an avalanche of loose tiles breaks loose and the
	footing underneath the raptor above disintegrates.  The
	animal's feet flail and grasp, it slides towards the edge amid
	the tumbling tiles.

	Sarah, seeing it coming, swings in close to the building,
	hugging it as closely as she can.  The raptor falls off the
	roof, right past her --

	-- and CRUNCHES into the raptor below.  Both animals SNARK and
	attack one another.

	Now Sarah, her grip exhausted, falls too, landing right next
	to the enraged animals.  They fight and roll, RIGHT OVER HER.
	She GROANS and hugs the wood below her, the raptors continue
	to thrash and bite, they roll back, toward her, she rolls out
	of their way --

	-- and plunges through a hole in the roof.

 INT. LAB - NIGHT 
	Sarah falls through the roof of a deserted laboratory and
	lands in the tray of an old-fashioned hanging fluorescent
	light fixture.

	One end of the fixture's support SNAPS, it drops at a 45
	degree angle, Sarah slides out the other end and CRASHES
	through a window.

 EXT. STREET - NIGHT 
	Sarah lands in the mud in the street below.

 CUT TO: 
EXT. BETWEEN TWO BUILDING - NIGHT 
	With a THUD, MALCOLM lands in the mud between two other
	building, one of which he has just climbed off of.  Panicked,
	he leaps to his feet and starts to SHOUT.

 MALCOLM 		Kelly!  KELLY!

 CUT TO: 
 EXT. MAIN STREET - NIGHT 
	SARAH sprints down the main street as fast as she can, toward
	the building on which sits the helicopter.  Above her, she can
	see NICK has now reached the helicopter and is waving to her.

	Sarah reaches the fallen water tower, which is next to the
	helicopter building, and starts to climb it.

 ELSEWHERE IN THE STREET, 
	KELLY is still covering underneath the fallen shed.  In the
	distance, she can see the helicopter.  But she is trembling
	with fear, unable to move.

	The whole shed suddenly RATTLES as something heavy hits it
	outside.  Kelly's mouth drops open to scream, but her terror
	is so complex that no sound comes out.  She raises her hands
	in self-defense, whatever's outside ROARS with effort, the
	entire shed is suddenly RIPPED right up off of her, and she
	looks up --

	-- into her father's eyes.

 KELLY 		Dad!

 MALCOLM 		Come on!

	He grabs her by the hand and they take off down the street.

 ON THE ROOFTOP, 
	Sarah emerges at the top of the water tower structure and
	leaps onto the roof, into Nick's arms.

 NICK 		Where's Kelly?

 SARAH 		Where's Ian?

	Eyes wide with panic, they both turn and look down at the
	street below, where they see KELLY and MALCOLM, racing at top
	speed down the middle of the street --

 -- WITH A VELOCIRAPTOR CHASING THEM. 
 DOWN IN THE STREET, 
	Malcolm and Kelly have a twenty yard advantage on the animal.
	They're pretty fast, but it's faster.

	Above them, Nick and Sarah are at the edge of the roof,
	SHOUTING and urging them on.  They push it, faster.

	They reach the base of the fallen water tower, the jumble of
	struts and metal poles that Sarah climbed.

 MALCOLM CLIMB! 
	Kelly leaps ahead of him and grabs hold of one of the poles,
	pulling herself neatly up to her feet and reaching for the
	next one.

	Malcolm stretches and makes the same effort, but for him it's
	much harder.

	Below them, the raptor springs and SLAMS into the struts,
	shaking the whole structure.  It pulls itself up.

	Higher up, Kelly climbs fast, hands gliding over the poles.
	She breaks out into the open, where a long, narrow pole runs
	on a slight incline up to the roof.  She scampers across it,
	running the balance beam.

	She reaches the other side, on a ledge below the roofline, and
	looks back.  Malcolm is at the other end, hesitating, drained,
	breathing hard.

 KELLY DAD, COME ON! 
	Below him, the raptor closes in.  Malcolm sets out across the
	beam, his legs shaking.  He places his feet carefully, he
	doesn't have nearly the balance Kelly did.

	The raptor draws closer.

				KELLY (cont'd)
 FASTER! 
	Malcolm slips.

	One foot twists right off the bar and he spins, arms flailing,
	trying to regain his tenuous balance.

	But he overcompensates and his whole body, wrenches out from
	under him.  He falls, the bar SMACKS him hard in the chest,
	knocking the wind out of him, and he drops, flipping right off
	the bar and bouncing painfully through the maze of bars below.

	He drops right past the pursuing velociraptor, CRUNCHING to
	a halt in a nest of bars ten feet off the ground, probably
	cracking a rib.  Kelly SCREAMS from above him.

				KELLY (cont'd)
 DAD! 
	She stares down in horror at her father.  Wrenched in among
	the bars, Malcolm is helpless as the animal crouches only six
	feet above him now, with an open attack route.

	The animal SNARKS and goes into its pre-attack crouch.

	Up above, Kelly wipes the palms of her hands on her jeans
	and leaps out into space, grabbing hold of one of the bars.

	The raptor springs.

	Kelly spins around, over the top of the bar, and, at the very
	peak of her trajectory, she lets go.

	The raptor sails through down from above, feet first, SLAMMING
	both of them squarely into the raptor's side, sending it
	hurtling into space.

	She lands hard and awkwardly, CLANGING into the spidery
	scaffolding next to Malcolm as the raptor SMASHES to the
	ground below.  But Kelly manages to hold on.

 KELLY GET UP! 
	She grabs hold of Malcolm and pulls him to his feet.

 ON THE ROOF, 
	Kelly and Malcolm appear over the roofline.  The PILOTS SHOUTS
	from inside.

 PILOT LET'S GO LET'S GO LET'S GO!! 
	Malcolm and Kelly scramble toward the helicopter.  But at the
	opposite side of the roof, a RAPTOR claws its way over the
	edge as well.

	Malcolm sees it and they lunge for the helicopter, but the
	animal is far faster.  It's only ten feet away, then five,
	they're surely done for this time, when --

 -- KA-BOOM! 
	There comes the loudest single gunshot anyone has ever heard,
	and the raptor flies off its feet and lands ten feet across
	the roof, dead.  They look up, to the source of the
	gunshot.

	It's ROLAND, standing at the edge of the roof, holding his
	smoking .600 Nitro Express.

	But there's no time for celebration, as suddenly the
	helicopter's left skid CRACKS right through the surface of the
	roof.

 PILOT HURRY! THE ROOF'S GIVING WAY! 
	The skid dips even further, ripping right through the
	thatch-and-wood construction.  Kelly, who had one foot in the
	helicopter, loses her balance --

	-- as the roof caves in beneath her.

 MALCOLM KELLY! 
	She falls,  SCREAMING, through the hole and down, into the
	building below.

 ONE FLOOR DOWN, 
	Kelly lands with a CRUNCH on the floor immediately below the
	roof, about nine feet down.  But her landing is cushioned by
	an inordinate amount of straw and leaves that have been
	arranged there.  She lifts one hand, and a yellowy, viscous
	substance drips off of it.

	It's yolk.  She looks around, noticing half a dozen large,
	oblong shapes.  Eggs.

	Above her, Malcolm is scrambling, climbing down to her through
	the wreckage of the CREAKING, crumbling roof.

 MALCOLM 		Kelly!  I'm coming!

	Kelly climbs to her knees, but behind her, a large, dark shape
	is moving.  Rising.  Unfolding, in a way.

 IT'S A PTERANODON. 
	Yep, flying dinosaur.  The enormous animal raises its head, a
	brilliant blue crest extending two feet behind its long,
	saber-like beak.  It SQUAWKS at Kelly in fury.  She can only
	stare, spellbound.

	Malcolm reaches her and grabs hold as the angry animal unfurls
	its massive twenty-two foot wingspread.

 ON THE ROOF, 
	the helicopter lurches as it sinks further into the crumbling
	roof, and now the skids are getting tangled in the debris.
	Roland races over to the hole, climbs in a few feet, and
	starts kicking at it, making it larger.

 ROLAND 		Give me a ladder!

 IN THE PTERANODON NEST, 
	Malcolm tries to haul Kelly back up the way he came, but a
	SECOND PTERANODON now appears from the depths of the building,
	SCREECHING in fury at these invaders who have landed in the
	middle of their clutch of eggs.

	An emergency rescue ladder drops through the hole in the roof.
	Malcolm grabs Kelly with one arm and the ladder with the other
	and they start to climb out of the nest.

 ON THE ROOF, 
	Malcolm and Kelly climb the ladder and are pulled into the
	belly of the chopper just as two enormous beaks break
	through the surface of the roof around them.

	The pteranodons are emerging.

 MALCOLM GO GO GO GO GOG GO! 
	The helicopter lurches up a few feet, but it yanked to an
	abrupt stop.  The engines WHINE, the chopper just hovers
	there.

 PILOT 		We're snagged on something!

	They loos down. BOTH PTERANODONS have come out through the
	hole in the roof and are clinging to the skids of the
	helicopter.  They flap their gigantic wings in unison, and
	drag the helicopter off, into the air, away from the nest --

	-- and let go.  Freed, the helicopter gains altitude quickly.

 IN THE HELICOPTER, 
	the PILOTS gape as the pteranodons coast along, right next to
	the helicopter.

 PILOT 		Hang on!  If I tip it hard, I can cut
		'em with the rotors!

 SARAH 		NO!  Don't!  They're not attacking!

	They look out the windows, where, indeed, the magnificent
	animals are merely accompanying them, flying escort as the
	chopper gains altitude.

				SARAH (cont'd)
		They're protecting their nest.
		That's all.  That's all they're
		doing.

	Kelly, completely drained, sits between Sarah and Malcolm,
	each of whom has a protective arm around her.  She sags
	against her father's chest, nothing left.

	He holds her tight and WHISPERS in her ear.

 MALCOLM 		Thank you.  Kelly, thank God.  Thank
		God for you...

 IN THE NIGHT SKY, 
	over the island, the helicopter steadily gains altitude.  A
	hundred feet.  Three hundred.  A thousand.

	As the helicopter is clearly leaving the island, the
	pteranodons now peel off, their job done.  One of them banks
	sharply, right in front of the moon.  The moonlight
	silhouettes it, shining right through its membranous wings,
	lighting it up like a Halloween skeleton.

	Below, the tiny green island melts away into the vastness of
	the wine-dark sea.

 CUT TO: 
 EXT. TYRANNOSAUR NEST - NIGHT 
	Elsewhere in the forest, it's not such a happy story.  PETER
	LUDLOW, still alive, drops through the air and CRUNCHES to the
	muddy ground.  Dizzy, bleeding, the breath knocked out of him,
	he opens his eyes and sees a sloping bank of dried mud.

	From behind him, he hears a CHIRPING sound.  He turns.

	He's in the tyrannosaur nest.

	The BABY TYRANNOSAUR faces him, still with a strange
	aluminum-foil cast on its leg.  The baby SQUEAKS with
	excitement as it toddles toward him.

	Ludlow scrambles to his feet, unsure what to do.  Both ADULT
	TYRANNOSAURS stand outside the nest, staring down at him.

	The baby runs toward Ludlow, so he turns and runs away.

	But in an instant, the male brings its head down, knocking
	Ludlow to the ground.  Then it raises its head again.
	Watching.  Waiting.

	Ludlow gets up again and tries to run, but now the female rex
	strikes, knocking him over again.

	Ludlow tries to crawl away, on all fours.  The male bends down
	and closes its jaws around one of his legs, holding it
	tightly.  Ludlow SCREAMS --

	-- and the rex bits down decisively.  The bone breaks with a
	dry SNAP.  Ludlow HOWLS in pain, unable to move, and the baby
	toddles forward eagerly.  Ludlow can only stare as it leaps
	up, onto his chest, and opens its jaws wide.

	Peter Ludlow SCREAMS.

 CUT TO: 
 EXT. CEMETERY - DAY 
	Snow falls in a gray midwinter sky.  In a cemetery, a group of
	fifty MOURNERS is grouped around a gravesite next to a coffin
	that is festooned with cascades of flowers.  On a table, there
	is an array of framed photographs --

	-- of JOHN HAMMOND.  A MINISTER reads from the Bible while the
	Mourners wipe away tears.  IAN MALCOLM stands a respectful
	distance from the group, KELLY right beside him.  Malcolm's
	face is blank, tired, his sunburn out of place with the white
	winter setting around him.

	At gravesite, a Young Woman turns, looking back over her
	shoulder.  About sixteen, she's lovely, with long blonde hair
	and an honest, open face.  She notices Malcolm, recognizes
	him.

	She nudges a Young Man next to her, about thirteen years old.
	The Young Man turns and breaks into a smile just as welcoming.

	As the ceremony breaks up, they walk over to him.

 MALCOLM 		Hello, Lex.  Tim.

	LEX stands on her tiptoes and kisses Malcolm on the cheek.
	TIM extends a hand and Malcolm shakes it.

				MALCOLM (cont'd)
		This is Kelly.  My daughter.

	They nod their hellos.

 LEX 		I'm glad you came, Dr. Malcolm

 MALCOLM 		I'm sorry about your grandfather.

 TIM 		Thank you.

 LEX 		We were going to call you, in a few
		days.  Tim and I have been thinking,
		and we've decided we want people to
		know about the island.  About what we
		all saw.

 TIM 		We think it's something our
		grandfather would want us to do.

 MALCOLM 			(pause)
		Why?

 LEX 		Because it's true.

	Malcolm looks at her for a long moment.

 MALCOLM 		I know, Lex.  But even if we're the
		only ones who ever know, it'll still
		be true.  You see, I've decided
		that if the world found out about
		what your grandfather created, it
		wouldn't be around for very long.

 LEX 		But -- it was real.  You can't let
		people go on saying it's not.

 MALCOLM 		That's the thing about reality.

	He looks down at Kelly.

				MALCOLM (cont'd)
		Even when people stop believing in
		it, it doesn't go away.

	Kelly smiles and takes his hand, her slender fingers
	interlocking with his.

 EXT. JUNGLE - DAY 
	Back on Isla Sorna, we float over the deserted worker village,
	moving lightly, as in a dream.

 MALCOLM (V.O.) 		Do you feel the cold wind blowing on
		your face?  That's real.

	We sweep low, landing on the roof the helicopter took off
	from, the nest below now careful rebuilt with straw and
	scrap, a dozen unblemished eggs in the middle of it.

 MALCOLM (V.O.) 		Do you see the four of us, standing
		here together, alive?  That's real.

	A PTERANODON land gently on the nest.  Ever so carefully, it
	positions itself over the eggs, lowers itself to roosting
	position, and folds its giant wings around its body.

 MALCOLM (V.O.) 		And maybe that's still that matters.

	The animal raises its head, opens its beak, and SQUAWKS
	approvingly up at the heavens.

 FADE OUT
THE LOST WORLD
			 JURASSIC PARK

			Screenplay by
			  David Koepp
	
		     based on the novel by
			Michael Crichton

	EXT. TROPICAL LAGOON - DAY

	A 135-foot-luxury yacht is anchored just offshore in a 
	tropical lagoon.  The beach is a stunning crescent of white
	sand at the jungle fringe, utterly deserted.

				ISLA SORNA
		87 miles southeast of Nublar

	Two SHIP HANDS, dressed in white uniforms, have set up a
	picnic table with three chairs on the sand and are carefully
	laying out luncheon service -- fine china, silver, crystal
	decanters with red and white wine.

	PAUL BOWMAN, fortyish, sits in a chair off to the side,
	reading.  MRS. BOWMAN, painfully thin, with the perpetually
	surprised look of a woman who's had her eyes done more than
	once, supervises the settings of the table.

	She looks up and sees a little girl, CATHY, seven or eight
	years old, wandering off down the beach.

				MRS. BOWMAN
		Cathy!  Don't wander off!

	Cathy keeps wandering.

				MRS. BOWMAN (cont'd)
		Cathy, come back!  You can look for
		shells right here!

	Cathy gestures, pretending she can't hear.

				BOWMAN
			(eyes still in his book)
		Leave her alone.

				MRS. BOWMAN
		What about snakes?

				BOWMAN
		There's no snakes on a beach.  Let
		her have fun, for once.

	FURTHER DOWN THE BEACH,

	Cathy keeps wandering away, MUTTERING to herself as her
	parents' quarreling voices fade in the distance.

				CATHY
		Please be quiet, please be quiet
		please be quiet...

	Rounding a curve in the beach, her parents disappear from view
	behind her.  A RUSTLING sound draws her attention, and she
	turns, toward where the thick jungle foliage gives way to the
	sand.

	A large bush, maybe twelve feet tall, is moving, its branches
	swaying and shaking.  Curious, Cathy walks up to the bush,
	which abruptly stops moving.

	A small, lizard-like animal, dark green with brown stripes
	along its back, steps out from the bush.  Only about a foot
	tall, it stands on its hind legs, balancing on its thick tail.
	It walks upright, bobbing its head like a chicken.

				CATHY
		Well, hello there!

	The animal (a COMPSOGNATHUS) just stares at her.  Cathy squats
	down on her haunches.

				CATHY (cont'd)
		What are you?  A little bird or
		something?

	She opens her hand.  She's got a handful of goldfish crackers.

				CATHY (cont'd)
		Are you hungry?  You want a goldfish?

	The compy bobs forward a few steps, cautiously.

				CATHY (cont'd)
		Come on.  I won't hurt you.

	The compy draws closer.  Cathy holds the cracker in the palm
	of her hand.  The compy gets closer still --

	-- and hops numbly up onto Cathy's palm.  Her arm dips a bit
	under the weight, but it's not that heavy, and she holds it up
	easily.  It bobs its head, scarfs up the goldfish, and eats
	it.

	Enchanted, Cathy breaks into an enormous grin and returns her
	hand, calling back over her shoulder.

				CATHY (cont'd)
		Mom!  Dad!  You gotta come see this!
		I found something!

	She turns back.

	Thirty more compys have come out onto the sand.  They're
	standing there, bobbing anxiously, staring at her from a few
	feet away.  Cathy's smile fades.

	She turns her head slowly to the right.  TWENTY MORE COMPYS
	have come in from that side, forming a semi-circle, bobbing
	and CHIPPING as they surround her.

				CATHY (cont'd)
			(terrified)
		What do you guys want?

	BACK ON THE BEACH,

	the table is set.  Mrs. Bowman calls out.

				MRS. BOWMAN
		Cathy, sweetheart!  Lunch is ready!

	From around the curve of the beach, a flock of birds bolts
	from the jungle trees as Cathy's shrill SCREAMS suddenly
	pierce the air.

				MRS. BOWMAN
		PAUL!

	She takes off, running down the beach, Mr. Bowman leaps out of
	his chair and follows, and all available deck hands race off
	to help, kicking up geysers of sand behind them.

	DOWN THE BEACH,

	Mrs. Bowman stops dead in her tracks when she rounds the bend
	in the beach.  We don't see what she sees, but we hear the
	frenzied SQUEAKING of the strange compys.  Mr. Bowman and the
	Hands race past her to help Cathy as Mrs. Bowman lets loose a
	horrified, slack-jawed SCREAM, her mouth a perfect oval.

							DISSOLVE TO:

	INT. BOARD ROOM - DAY

	Mrs. Bowman's screaming face dissolves slowly over the
	YAWNING face of a bored CORPORATE EXECUTIVE, TWENTY OTHER
	EXECUTIVES sit around a conference table in the boardroom of a
	monied corporation.  All are in expensive suits, most are over
	sixty.  There are rows of BACKBENCHERS too, whispering in their
	lawyers who sit behind their clients, whispering in their
	ears.  Empty coffee cups and fast food containers on the table
	hint that everyone's been here a long time.

	A familiar VOICE resounds through the boardroom as we move
	down the long table, pat the grim faces of the board members.

				VOICE (O.S.)
		The hurricane seemed like a disaster
		at the time, but now I think it was a
		blessing, nature's way of freeing
		those animals from their human
		confines.  Of giving them another
		chance to survive, but this time as
		they were meant to, without man's
		interference.

	The source of the voice is JOHN HAMMOND, the founder of InGen
	and creator of Jurassic Park.  But he's not in the room.  His
	image is on a closed circuit TV screen, which has been wheeled
	up to the end of the table.

	And he doesn't look good.  He's terribly infirmed, propped up
	in bed, his face pale and drawn, medical equipment BEEPING
	around him.

				HAMMOND (cont'd)
		There are some corporate issues that
		are not about the bottom line.  We
		have so much still to learn about
		those creatures.  A whole world of
		intricate, interlocking behaviors,
		vanished everywhere -- except for
		Site B. Please.  Let's not do what
		is good for more men at the expense
		at what is best for all mankind.

	The CHAIRMAN, seventyish, nods awkwardly to the television.

				CHAIRMAN
		Thank you, John.  Mr. Ludlow?

	He turns to PETER LUDLOW, late thirties, a man with the
	anxious look of someone who insists the buck stop on his desk.
	Ludlow flips open a file, pulls out a stack of black and white
	eight by tens, and tosses them on the table.

				LUDLOW
			(an accent similar to
			 Hammond's)
		These pictures were taken in a
		hospital in Costa Rica forty-eight
		hours ago, after an American family
		on a yacht cruise stumbled onto Site
		B.  The little girl will be fine, but
		her parents are wealthy, angry, and
		very fond of lawsuits.  But that's
		hardly new to us, is it?
			(takes a paper from the
			 file)
		Wrongful death settlements, partial
		list:  family of Donald Gennaro, 36.5
		million dollars; family of Robert
		Muldoon, 12.6 million.  Damaged or
		destroyed equipment, 17.3 million.
		Demolition, de-construction, and
		disposal of Isla Nublar facilities,
		organic and inorganic, one hundred
		and twenty-six million dollars.  The
		list goes on, gentlemen -- research
		funding, media payoffs.  Silence is
		expensive.

	He's warming up.  Not a bad performer.

				LUDLOW (cont'd)
		This corporation has been bleeding
		from the throat for four years.  You,
		our board of directors, have set
		patiently and listened to ecology
		lectures while Mr. Hammond signed
		your checks and spent your money.
		You have watched your stock drop from
		seventy-eight and a quarter to
		nineteen flat with no good and in
		sight.  And all along, we have held a
		significant product asset that we
		could have safely harvested and
		displayed for profit.  Enormous
		profit.

	He reaches out to a model on the table and gives it a shove,
	sending it sliding down the length of the table in front of
	them.  It's a mini-mall version of a zoo.  Cages hold tiny
	replicas of various kinds of dinosaurs while Boy Scout troops
	and Tourists look on in wonder.

				LUDLOW (cont'd)
		Enough money to wipe out four years
		of lawsuits and damage control and
		unpleasant infighting, enough to not
		only send our stock back to where it
		was but to double it.  And the one
		thing, the only thing standing
		between us and this asset is a
		born-again naturalist who happens to
		be our own CEO.  Well, I don't work
		for Mother Nature.  I work for you.

	Two of his Backbenchers distribute documents from a stack.
	Ludlow takes one and reads from it.

				LUDLOW (cont'd)
		"Whereas the Chief Executive
		Officer has engaged in wasteful and
		negligent business practices to
		further his own personal
		environmental beliefs --
		Whereas these practices have 
		affected the financial performance
		of the company by incurring
		significant losses --
		Whereas the shareholders have been
		materially harmed by these losses --
		Thereby, be it resolved that John
		Parker Hammond should be resolved from
		the office of Chief Executive
		Officer, affective immediately."  Mr.
		Chairman, I move the resolution be
		put to an immediate vote.  Do I have
		a second?

				BOARD MEMBER
		I second the motion,  Mr. Chairman,
		Please poll the members by a show of
		hands.

	The CHAIRMAN signs heavily, feeling like a traitor.  He can't
	bear to look at Hammond on the TV monitor.

				CHAIRMAN
		All those in favor of InGen Corporate
		Resolution 213C, please signify your
		approval by raising your right hand.

	It starts slowly, guiltily, but every hand in the room goes
	up.  Ludlow sits back, victorious.  Hammond, furious, raises
	his right hand, which holds a remote control, and points it at
	the TV screen.  It goes blank.

	EXT. WELDER'S YARD - NIGHT

	Sparks fly out the windows and doors of a shed in the middle
	of a welder's yard.  Scrap iron and steel lies everywhere.
	Somewhere inside the shed, a phone RINGS.

	The WHOOSH of the arc welder shuts off.  DIETER STARK, a big
	barrel-chested man of forty or so, his face streaked with soot
	and grime, steps outside with a cordless phone, a cigarette
	dangling from his lips.

				DIETER
		Yeah.

	He takes a deep drag while someone talks on the other end.  He
	smiles and blows out a cloud of smoke.

							CUT TO:
	INT. NEW YORK SUBWAY - NIGHT

	Smoke turns into steam as a subway THUNDER into a station
	underneath Manhattan.  The door WHOOSH open, spit out some
	COMMUTERS and suck up a few more.

	A tall man hurries down the platform, limping heavily, moving
	as fast as he can.  The subway doors begin to close, but just
	before they meet --

	-- the man jams a cane in between, stopping them.  The man
	is IAN MALCOLM, fortyish, dressed in black from head to toe.
	There's a hard wisdom in Malcolm's eyes that may not have been
	there's a few years ago -- he know what you think, and he
	doesn't care.

	INT. SUBWAY CAR - NIGHT

	MALCOLM finds a seat on the crowded subway car and sits down.
	He looks awful.  Tired.  Weathered.  He notices a CURIOUS MAN
	across from his is staring at his.  Malcolm looks away.  The
	Curious Man still stares.  Nervy, the Curious Man gets up and
	approaches.

				MALCOLM
			(under his breath)
		Shit.

	The Curious Man sits down next to Malcolm, grinning.

				MAN
		You're him, aren't you?

				MALCOLM
		Excuse me?

				MAN
		The guy.  The scientist.  I saw you
		on TV.
			(conspiratorially)
		I believed you.

	No response from Malcolm.  The guy leans in even closer.

				MAN (cont'd)
		Roooooarr.

				MALCOLM
			(a withering look)
		I was misquoted.  I was merely
		speculating on the evolutionary
		scenario of a Lost World.  I never
		said I was in any such place.

	He gets up and moves to another seat on the car, away from the
	Curious Man.  As he sits down, he notices two other COMMUTERS
	across from him are staring at him.

	He looks at them.  They looks away.

	He pulls the collar of his coat up tight around him.  Nowhere
	to hide.

	INT. JOHN HAMMOND'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

	A UNIFORMED BUTLER has a question:

				BUTLER
		Whom shall I tell Mr. Hammond is
		calling?

	MALCOLM stands in the foyer of an expensively decorated Park
	Avenue apartment.

				MALCOLM
		Ian Malcolm

	A door opens and a little dog comes YAPPING out of the back.
	It bounds straight at Malcolm, GROWLING, jaws SNAPPING.  It
	lunges --

	-- and Malcolm BATS it away with one swift swing of his cane.
	The dog rolls across the floor and slinks away, WHINING.  The
	Butler looks at Malcolm disapprovingly.
	
				BUTLER
		Not an animal lover?

				MALCOLM
		Not really.

	INT. HAMMOND'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

	MALCOLM enters a darkened bedroom.  JOHN HAMMOND lies in the
	bed we saw earlier, on the other side of the room;

	Medical equipment has been disguised as well as possible among
	the furniture and flowers, but the sheer abundance of it tells
	us that whatever has stricken him is going to win this battle.

				HAMMOND
		Ian!  Don't linger in the doorway
		like an ingenue, come in, come in!

	Malcolm steps further into the room.

				HAMMOND (cont'd)
		It's good to see you.  It really is.
		How's the leg?

				MALCOLM
		Resentful.

				HAMMOND
		When you have a lot of time to think,
		it's funny who you remember.  It's
		the people who challenged you.  It is
		the quality of our opponents that
		gives our accomplishments meaning.  I
		never told you how sorry I was about
		what happened after we returned.
	
	Noticing Hammond's deteriorated condition, Malcolm finds it
	hard to sustain anger.
	
				MALCOLM
		I didn't know you -- weren't well.
		
				HAMMOND
		It's the lawyers.  The lawyers are
		finally killing me.
		
				MALCOLM
		They do have motives.  Why did you
		want to see me?  Your message said it
		was urgent.
		
				HAMMOND
		You were right -- and I was wrong.
		There!  Did you ever think you'd hear
		me say that?  Spectacularly wrong.
		Instead of observing those animals, I
		tried to control them.  I squandered
		an opportunity and we still know next
		to nothing about their lives.  Not
		their lives as man would have them,
		behind electric fences, but in the
		wild.  Behavior in their natural
		habitat, the impossible dream of any
		paleontologist.  I could have had it,
		but I let it slip away.
			(pause)
		Thank God for Site B.
		
	Malcolm just looks at him for a long moment.
	
				MALCOLM
		What?
		
				HAMMOND
			(a spark in his eye)
		Well?  Didn't it all seem a trifle
		compact to you?
		
				MALCOLM
		What are you talking about?
	
				HAMMOND
		The hatchery, in particular?  You
		know my initial yields had to be low,
		far less than one percent, that's a
		thousand embryos for every single
		live birth.  Genetic engineering on
		that scale implies a giant operation,
		not the spotless little laboratory I
		showed you.

				MALCOLM
		I don't believe you.

				HAMMOND
		Isla Nublar was just a showroom, Ian,
		something for the tourists, Site B
		was the factory floor.  We built it
		first, on Isla Sorna, eight-some
		miles from Nublar.

				MALCOLM
		No, no, no, no, no, no . . .

				HAMMOND
		After the accident at the park, a
		hurricane wiped out our facility on
		Site B.  We had to evacuate and leave
		the animals to fend for themselves.
		And they did.  For four years I've
		fought to keep them safe from human
		meddling, now I want you to go there
		and document them.

				MALCOLM
		Are you out of your mind?  I still
		have nightmares, my reputation's a
		joke, my leg is shot -- you think I
		need more of that?

				HAMMOND
		It would be the most extraordinary
		living fossil record the world has
		ever seen.

				MALCOLM
		So what?

	Hammonnd picks up a thick file folder from the night table near
	to him and open it on his lap.  Inside, there are memos,
	charts, maps and photographs.

				HAMMOND
		I've been putting this together for
		over a year.
			(MORE)
		I have personal suggestions for your
		entire team, phone numbers, contact
		people.  They won't believe you about
		what they're going to see, so don't
		bother trying to convince them.  Just
		use my checkbook to get them there.
		I'll fund your expedition through my
		personal accounts, as such money and
		equipment as you need, but only if
		you leave immediately.  If we
		hesitate, all will be lost.

				MALCOLM
		John . . .

				HAMMOND
		You'll need an animal behaviorist,
		someone with unimpeachable
		credentials.  I believe you already
		know Sarah Harding.  She's got
		theories about parenting and
		nurturing among hunter/scavengers I
		bet she'd be dying to prove on a
		scale like this.  If you convince her
		to go, it'll be a major coup.  When
		she publishes, the scientific
		community must take it seriously.

	Malcolm just shakes his head, flipping through the file sadly.

				HAMMOND
		Your documentation, you should use
		forensic photographic methods,
		Hasselbladt still cameras, high
		definition video.  When the trick
		photography analysts take your
		evidence apart, make it impossible
		for them to say there was enhancement
		or computer graphic imaging.  Oh,
		this is very important -- avoid the
		island interior at all costs.  Stick
		to the outer rim.  Everything you
		need to know can be found there.
		Vindication lies on the outer rim.

	Malcolm gently closes the file and pushes it back to Hammond.

				MALCOLM
		I'm not going, John.

				HAMMOND
			(fatigue returning)
		Ian, you are my last chance to give
		something of real value to the world.
		I can't walk so far and leave no
		footprints; die and leave nothing
		with my name on it.  I will not  be
		known only for my failures.  And you
		will not allow yourself to go down in
		history as a lunatic.  You're too
		smart.  You'e too proud.  Dr.
		Malcolm.  Please.  This is a chance
		at redemption.  For both of us.
		There's no time to equivocate, we
		must seize it now, before --

	He stops, staring over Malcom's shoulder.  Malcom turns.
	PETER LUDLOW, still in his overcoat, is standing in the
	doorway to the bedroom.  He looks back and forth from Hammond
	to Malcolm suspiciously.

				LUDLOW
		Hello, Uncle John.  Dr. Malcolm.

	Malcolm doesn't answer.  He seems to know Ludlow, and dislikes
	him.

				LUDLOW (cont'd)
		Did I interrupt something?

	Malcolm turns back to Hammond.

				MALCOLM
		Find someone else.

							CUT TO:

	INT. HAMMOND'S APARTMENT/FOYER - NIGHT

	In the foyer, LUDLOW hands MALCOLM his coat, just a trifle
	rudely, and shepherds him to the door.

				LUDLOW
		So, you two were just, uh, telling
		old campfire stories, were you?

				MALCOLM
		Do me a favor.  Don't pretend for a
		second that you and I don't know the
		truth.  You can convince Time
		magazine and the Skeptical Inquirer
		of whatever you want, but I was 
		there.

				LUDLOW
		You signed a non-disclosure agreement
		before you went to the island that
		expressly forbade you from discussing
		anything you saw.  You violated that
		agreement.

				MALCOLM
		You cost me my livelihood.  That on
		which I relied to support my
		children.

				LUDLOW
		If your university felt you were
		causing it embarrassment by selling
		wild stories to Hard Copy, I hardly
		see how I am to--

				MALCOLM
		I didn't tell anything, I told the
		truth.

				LUDLOW
		You version of it.

				MALCOLM
		There are no versions of the truth!
		This isn't a corporate maneuver, it's
		my life.

				LUDLOW
		We made a generous compensatory offer
		for your injuries.

				MALCOLM
		It was a payoff and an insult.  InGen
		never--

				LUDLOW
		InGen is my livelihood, Dr.
		Malcolm, and I will jealously defend
		its interests.  People will know what
		I want them to know when I want them
		to know it.

	Ludlow tosses something to Malcolm, hard.  It sails across the
	foyer, upright, and Malcolm reaches out and catches it with
	one hand.  It's his cane.

				LUDLOW (cont'd)
		Don't forget that.

	Malcolm stares at him for a long moment.  Finally, he turns
	and walks away.

	But he does not out of the apartment.  Instead, he
	walks directly past Ludlow, crosses the living room, and steps
	back into Hammond's bedroom, closing the door behind him with
	a determined CLICK.

	INT. HAMMOND'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

	HAMMOND looks up, hopeful, as MALCOLM comes back into the room
	and walks over to his bed.  He reaches down --

	-- and picks up the file folder.

				MALCOLM
		Do you have a satellite phone?

							CUT TO:

	INT. MOMBASSA BAR - DAY

	ROLAND TEMBO, late sixties, skin like leather and the diamond
	hard look of a cobra, sits at a table in the middle of an
	African cafe/bar in Mombassa.

	It's daytime and the place is half full, mostly with locals,
	but there are a few obnoxious TOURISTS too, Americans on
	safari who somehow found the local handout.

	They're a noisy bunch, but Roland tunes them out, calmly
	eating his lunch and drinking a beer while he reads a book,
	eyeglasses hanging low on his nose.

	Roland suddenly stops reading and furrows his brow.  He looks
	up.  He SNIFFS the air once, then smiles and calls out a
	person's name.

				ROLAND
		Ajay?

	He turns around.  AJAY (AH-jay) SIDHU, a wiry East Indian in
	his late forties, is standing behind him, caught trying to
	sneak up.

				AJAY
			(delighted)
		How did you know?

				ROLAND
			(taps his nose)
		That cheap aftershave I send you
		every Christmas, you actually wear
		it.  I'm touched.  Sit down, sit
		down, what brings you to Mombassa?

				AJAY
		You.  Tell me, Roland, when was the
		last time you answered your phone?

				ROLAND
		Last time I plugged it in, I suppose.
		Why?

	Behind them, the group of TOURISTS, all men, laughs loudly.
	One of them, the MOST OBNOXIOUS TOURISTS, berates the WAITRESS.

				AJAY
		I got a call from a gentleman who's
		going to Costa Rica, or thereabouts.
		If he's to be believed, it's a most,
		uh, unique expedition.  And very
		well-funded.

				ROLAND
		Well, I'm a very well-funded old son
		of a bitch.  You go.

	The Most Obnoxious Tourist bellows for the Waitress.  His
	buddies LAUGHS.  Roland throws a glance, annoyed.

				AJAY
		But alone?  We always had great
		success together, you and I.

				ROLAND
		Just a little bit too much, I
		think.

				AJAY
		How do you mean?

				ROLAND
		A true hunter doesn't mind if the
		animal wins.  If it escapes.  But
		there weren't enough escapes from you
		and me, Ajay.  I've decided to spend
		a bit less time in the company of
		death.  Maybe I just feel too close
		to it my--

	The Waitress comes to the Tourists' table and the Most
	Obnoxious Tourist actually paws her ass.  Roland is out of his
	chair in a second.

				ROLAND (cont'd)
			(to Ajay)
		Excuse me.

	Romand walks over to the Tourists' table, says something to
	the Waitress in the local dialect, and she walks away, behind
	him.  He stares down at the Most Obnoxious Tourist.

				ROLAND (cont'd)
		You, sir -- are no gentleman.

				TOURIST
		Is that supposed to be an insult?

				ROLAND
		I can think of none greater.

	The Tourist looks at his Buddies and laughs.

				TOURIST
		Buzz off, you silly old bastard.

				ROLAND
		What do I have to do to pick a fight
		with you, bring your mother into it?

				TOURIST
		Are you kidding?  I could take you
		with one arm tied down.

				ROLAND
		Really?

	IN THE MIDDLE OF THE FLOOR,

	the Waiter finishes tying a man's wrist to his belt in the
	back of his pants with a napkin.  He pulls the knot tight and
	the man turns around.

	It's Roland, with his arm tied down.  The Tourist stands
	across from him.

				TOURIST
		I mean my arm.

	POW!  Roland punches him square in the jaw.  The Tourist
	reels, stunned.  Enraged, he lunges at Roland, swinging with
	both arms.

	Roland bobs, neatly ducking the punches, waits for the Tourist
	to turn around, and POPS him thrice in the face.  The Tourist
	spins and goes down to the floor, face first.  A cloud of
	sawdust and a loud CHEER from the locals rise up in the bar.

	BACK AT HIS TABLE,

	Roland drops the napkin on the table and sits back down with
	Ajay.  In the background, the Tourist's Buddies hurriedly
	carry their fallen cohort out of the bar.

				ROLAND
		Sorry.  We were saying?

				AJAY
		You broke that idiot's jaw for no
		reason other than your boredom.  Tell
		the truth, Roland.  Aren't you even
		interested in knowing this
		expedition's quarry?

				ROLAND
		Ajay.  Go on up to my ranch, take a
		look around the trophy room, and tell
		me what kind of quarry you think
		could possibly be of any interest
		to me.

	Ajay just smiles.

							CUT TO:

	EXT. AFRICAN SAVANNAH - NIGHT

	The African savannah appears in shades of fluorescent green,
	seen through night-vision goggles.  An ANIMAL YELP comes from
	the left and the green vista sweeps abruptly toward it.  The
	world blurs momentarily, then comes into focus on a field of
	long grass.

	The grass ripples in a complex pattern as animals move
	stealthily through it.  One animal head pops up above the
	grass for a split-second, teeth bared, a white stripe between
	its eyes.  SARAH HARDING pulls the goggles away from her face.

				SARAH
		Hyenas.  Ace Face is the striped
		snout.

	Sarah is thirty, with a compact, athletic body built for the
	outdoors.  She loos through the goggles again, sweeping ahead
	of the hyenas to their prey.

	It's a herd of African buffalo, standing belly-deep in the
	grass, agitated, bellowing and stamping their feet.

	Sarah turns to MAKENA, her African assistant.

				SARAH (cont'd)
		They'll try to take down a calf.
		Come on.

				MAKENA
		Closer?

	Sarah scurries up and over a rock face.  Makena follows.
	Closer now, they watch as the hyenas rush the herd, running
	through it, trying to break it up.

				MAKENA (cont'd)
		You know, we could see everything
		from up on the edge of that cliff.

				SARAH
		No way.

				MAKENA
		But the view would --

				SARAH
		No cliffs.
			(into a pocket recorder)
		F1 headed sough, F2 and F5 flanking,
		twenty yards.  F3 center.  F6
		circling wide east.  Can't see F7.

	While she talks, breathless, fascinated by the drama before
	her, Sarah continues to creep closer and closer to the action.
	Makena follows, with growing unease.

				MAKENA
		Sarah.

				SARAH
		F8 circling north.  F1 straight
		through, disrupting.  Herd moving,
		stamping.  There's F7.  Straight
		through.  F8 angling through from the
		north.

	She's practically on top of the animals now.

				MAKENA
		Dr. Harding.

	Makena has a hold of Sarah's sweatshirt and is tugging her
	back, at least trying to slow down her progress as Sarah,
	wide-eyed with fascination, creeps even closer.

	Suddenly there is a tremendous BELLOWING and the grass right
	in front of them rips apart, trampled under the feet of the
	hyenas as they cluster around a fallen buffalo calf.  They
	yelp and jump, their muzzles bloody.

	The adults move aside, making room as the hyena pups come
	forward, squealing to get at the kill.  Sarah's eyes shine
	with excitement and she moves even closer, whispering into the
	tape recorder.

				SARAH
		Brooding behavior in evidence at the
		kill site, pups are ushered forward
		and adults help them eat, pulling
		flesh away from the carcass and--

	A telephone rings.

	Sarah stops in mid-sentence, unsure if she heard what she
	thought she heard.  It rings again, the unmistakable CHIRPING
	of a cellular phone.  Sarah and Makena both move at once,
	pawing at a backpack.

				SARAH (cont'd)
			(a frantic whisper)
		I thought you turned it off!

	Two hyenas look inquisitively in the direction of the phone.
	Sarah comes up with it and jabs at a button in irritation.

				SARAH (cont'd)
		Yes?!

	Someone speaks on the other end.  Sarah rolls her eyes.

				SARAH (cont'd)
		Ian.  This better be important.

	Sarah doesn't say anything for a long moment, just listens as
	the voice on the other end talks.  And talks.

				SARAH (cont'd)
		When?

	INT. MOBILE FIELD SYSTEMS - DAY

	Ian Malcolm's leg, badly scarred, is bared and draped over the
	end of a bench.  Two sandbags are fastened to his ankle and
	MALCOLM is lifting them, painfully rehabbing his injury while
	talking on a satellite phone.

				MALCOLM
		We leave in twenty-four hours.  Five
		member team.

	Behind them, the SPARKS of a acetylene torch fly as WORKMEN
	make modifications on several vehicles, including a dark-green
	Mercedes Benz AAV (all-activity vehicle).  The hood of the AAV
	is up and the V-6 engine has been pulled out; a new, smaller
	engine is lowered in its place.  To one side are two long
	trailers, connected by an accordion-like passageway, like on a
	subway car, allowing one to be towed behind the other.

				MALCOLM
		Eddie Carr's handling all our
		equipment and he'll be there to

	EDDIE CARR, fortyish, is barking out orders to the Workmen.

				EDDIE
		No, no, look at the plans, Henry,
		you can't place that strut laterally,
		it has to be crosswise, LOOK AT THE
		PLANS!

	From the ceiling, a large metal age CRASHES down, landing
	next to them on the floor with a deafening CLANG.  They leap
	back and look up.  A WORKMAN waves from a scaffolding.

				WORKMAN
		Sorry, Eddie!  Specs say it can't
		deform at 12,000 PSI, we had to test
		it

	Eddie bends down to inspect the cage, which is rectangular,
	constructed of inch-thick titanium-alloy bars.  Malcolm hangs
	up the phone and walks up, joining him.

				MALCOLM
		Any damage?

				EDDIE
		Minimal.

				MALCOLM
		"Minimal" is too much.   It has to be
		light, it has to be strong --

				EDDIE
		Light and strong, light and strong,
		sure, why not, it's only impossible.
		God save me from academics.

				MALCOLM
		You are an academic.

				EDDIE
		Former academic.  Now I actually make
		things.  I don't just talk.

				MALCOLM
		You think I'm all talk, Eddie?

				EDDIE

		It doesn't matter what I think.

				MALCOLM
		Is there anything we've forgotten?
		Anything at all?

	Behind them, someone CLEARS THEIR THROAT.  Eddie and Malcolm
	turn around.  KELLY MALCOLM, an African-American girl around
	twelve years old, stands in the doorway to the garage, a
	duffel bag slung over one shoulder.  She looks at Malcolm and
	breaks into a wide grin.

				KELLY
		Hi, Dad.

				MALCOLM
		Kelly!  What are you doing here?

	She drops the bag on the floor, and wraps her arms around him
	in a warm embrace.  He responds stiffly.

				KELLY
		Vacation.  I'm all yours.  You didn't

		to a movie if you play your cards
		right.  You're going to have a
		fantastic time.

				KELLY
		Stop saying fantastic.  Where are you
		going?

				MALCOLM
		I can't tell you.  But I'll be back
		within a week.

				KELLY
		My vacation is over in a week.

				MALCOLM
		I'll make it up to you this summer.
		I promise.

				KELLY
		I'm your daughter all the time, you
		know.  Not just when it's convenient.

				MALCOLM
		Very hurtful.  Your mother tell you
		to say that?

				KELLY
		No, Dad.  I have thoughts of my own
		once in a while.

	From the construction floor, EDDIE calls out.

				EDDIE (o.s.)
		Dr. Malcolm!

	Malcolm looks at her, trying to make peace.  Quickly.

				MALCOLM
		Is that kid still bothering you?

				KELLY
		Which one?

				MALCOLM
		You know, at the bus stop.  With the
		hair?

				KELLY
		That was about a year ago.

				MALCOLM
		Well, is he?

				KELLY
		No.  Richard talked to his parents.

				MALCOLM
		That Richard.

				EDDIE (o.s.)
		Ian, come here a minute!

				KELLY
			(to Malcolm)
		I could come with you.

				MALCOLM
		Out of the question.  You'd miss the
		gymnastics trials.  You've been
		training for that for a year.

				KELLY
		I don't care about the trials, I
		want to be with you.  I could be your
		research assistant, like I was in
		Austin.

				MALCOLM
		This is nothing like Austin.  Forget
		about it.

				KELLY
		You like to have kids, you just
		don't want to be with them, do you?

	He looks at her, hurt.  Eddie calls out a third time,
	impatient now.  Grateful for the escape, Malcolm gets up and
	heads for the door.  He pauses guiltily.

				MALCOLM
		I'm not like you wan me to be.  I've
		what I can be.

	He leaves.

	INT. MAIN FLOOR - DAY

	While MALCOLM and EDDIE argue over something in the
	background, KELLY circles around the trailers and looks up at
	the windows.  They're all made of tempered glass, fine wire
	mesh inside it.  She looks around, to see if anybody's
	watching.  They're not, so she quickly slips inside the front
	trailer.

	INT. TRAILER - DAY

	Inside, the trailer is a miracle of planning and design.  It's
	divided into sections, for different laboratory functions.
	The main area is a biological lab, with specimen trays,
	dissecting pans, and microscopes that connect to video
	monitors.

	Next to it there's an extensive computer section, a bank of
	processors, and a communications section.  All the lab
	equipment is miniaturized and built into small tables that
	slides into the walls.  Everything is bolted down.

	She notices a large map on the wall.  Off the coat of Costa
	Rica, there is an area that has been circled in heavy black
	ink.

	Kelly puts a finger on the map, crossing westward, through the
	Pacific Ocean.  Thegre are dozen s of islands out here, but in
	the highlighted region, there is a semi-circle of five.
	Matanceros.  Muerte.  Tacano.  Pena.  And Sorna.  Underneath
	the whole island chain, there is a bold legend.

	"The Five Deaths," it says.

	Slowly, an ocean barge starts to chug its way across the
	face of the map, leaving a wake that rolls the printed letters
	of those three ominous words.

							DISSOLVE TO:

	EXT. OPEN SEA - DAY

	The map dissolves slowly away as the barge SPALASEHS through
	five foot ocean swells in the open sea.  The barge is crammed
	with equipment, the AAV, trailers, a jeep, and the members of
	Malcolm's team.

	ON THE BOAT,

	MALCOLM stands in the bow, riding the choppy seas.  Next to
	him, DR. JUTTSON, fortyish, holds onto the railing,
	seasick.  He SHOUTS over the DRONE of the boat's engines.

				JUTTISON
			(as the waves pound the
			 boat)
		Couldn't -- we just -- airlift --
		into the -- island?

				MALCOLM
		Dr. Harding insisted we go by sea!
		Helicopters are too disruptive.
		These aren't piles of bones you'll be
		studying this time, Dr. Juttson, they
		live, they breathe, and they react!

	Juttson looks at him skeptically --

	-- and throws up.

	AT THE BACK OF THE BOAT,

	NICK VAN OWEN, a good-looking American in his late
	twenties, is sitting amid a pile of video cameras and other
	photographic equipment, playing with a Game Bow.  SARAH
	HARDING, dressed in field gear, sits down next to him.

				SARAH
		So what's your story, Nick?

				NICK
		I was a cameraman for Nightline for
		six years, been freelance since '91.
		Do a lot of work for Greenpeace.

				SARAH
		That must be interesting.  What drew
		you there?

				NICK
		Women.  'Bout eighty percent female
		in Greenpeace.

				SARAH
		Very noble of you.
			(of the noisy Game Boy)
		You don't think you're bringing that
		thing onto the island, do you?

	Nick grins and shuts it off.

				NICK
		Hey, I wouldn't want to spook the
		woolly mammoths.

				SARAH
		You think this is all a joke?

				NICK
		Oh, please.  How am I supposed to
		keep a straight face when --
			(gestures to the
			 black-clad Malcolm)
		-- Johnny Cash here tells me I'm
		going to Skull Island?

				SARAH
			(not amused)
		Ian's a very good friend of mine.

				NICK
		He doesn't need a friend, he needs a
		shrink.

				SARAH
		I believe in him.

	But her face says even she has her doubts.

				NICK
		Come on, there's only one reason any
		of us are here.  His check cleared.

	She looks at him.

				SARAH
		Drop the cynical pose.  You can't
		pull it off while playing Donkey
		Kong.

	The boat's CAPTAIN, a Costa Rican, points ahead and SHOUTS to
	them.

				CAPTAIN
		There it is!

	They all turn and look out over the bow.  Up ahead, shear,
	reddish-gray cliffs of volcanic rock rise dramatically out of
	the fog-heavy ocean.

				CAPTAIN (cont'd)
		Isla Sorna!

	The boat ROARS ahead, plowing into a heavy wreath of fog.  The
	mist swirls and encircles it.

	EXT. ISLAND FIORD - DAY

	A narrow inlet cuts through the steep cliffs, leading to the
	island interior.  The barge bursts through the fog at the
	mouth of the fiord and heads deeper into the island.

	EXT. LAGOON - DAY

	Lush green plants drip everywhere in this verdant lagoon.
	Sulfurous yellow steam issues from the ground, bleaching the
	nearby foliage white.  In the distance one can hear the cries
	of JUNGLE BIRDS.

	The boat is now beached and the CREW flips the tarps off the
	AAV, the jeep, and the trailers.  The trucks back down a
	narrow ramp and onto the soft clay shore at the edge of the
	lagoon.  There is a large three-toad animal imprint in the
	clay at the water's edge, and the AAV backs right over it,
	swapping its track for the animal's.

	MALCOLM is at the edge of the water with the CAPTAIN.

				MALCOLM
		Be back in three days, but keep the
		satellite phone on and your radio
		tuned to the frequency I specified in
		case we need you sooner.

				CAPTAIN
		Don't worry.  I've lived around here
		all my life, these islands are
		completely --

	In the distance, they hear the faint, strange ROAR of a very
	large animal.  The Captain looks at Malcolm, eyes wide.

				CAPTAIN (cont'd)
		-- safe.

							CUT TO:

	EXT. GRASSY PLAIN - DAY

	The jeep tows the double trailer to the edge of a grassy plain
	just beyond the lagoon, overlooking the interior of the
	island.  The noon sun is high overhead; below, the valley
	shimmers in midday heat.

	EDDIE connects a flexible cable to the jeep's power winch and
	flicks it on.  The cable turns slowly in the sunlight.  Moving
	along the length of it, we see the cable leads to a pile of
	aluminum, some kind of strut assembly painted a camouflage
	color.

	As the winch pulls the cable tight, the jumble of thin struts
	begins to move, slowly rising into the air.  The emerging
	structure climbs, spidery, struts unfolding, fifteen feet into
	the air.  The light house at the top (the cage that was
	tested back at Eddie's workshop) is now just beneath the
	lowest branches of the nearby trees, which almost conceal it
	from view.

	NICK lights a cigarette and carelessly tosses the match on the
	ground.  Malcolm notices.

				MALCOLM
		Listen.  I know you all have probably
		concluded that I'm out of my mind.

	Is it our imagination, or did the trees behind Malcolm just
	sway slightly?

				MALCOLM (cont'd)
		That's all right, for now.  But just
		humor me and be careful.

	No, it's not our imagination, there they go again.  Whole
	trees shivering and swaying from left to right and back
	again.

				MALCOLM (cont'd)
		Even if you think I'm harmless and
		deluded, I promise --

	Now the trees CREAKS and GROAN as they sway.  Everyone has seen
	it, and now Malcolm turns around too.

				MALCOLM (cont'd)
		-- this place is for real.

							CUT TO:

	INT. DOUBLE TRAILERS - DAY

	It's quiet inside the trailers that serve as their command
	post/living quarters.  The books are lined up neatly on the
	shelves.  The computers sit, booted up and awaiting data
	input.

	All the way in the back, past the spare tires and life
	preservers and canned food and bottled water, up in one
	storage bin all the way on top, there's a RUSTLING SOUND.

	A plastic student ID card pops out in the cracks under the
	bin's door.  A photograph in the lower right hand corner of
	the card is visible -- it's Kelly, Malcolm's twelve-year-old
	daughter.

	The card wriggles against the lock and, with a soft CLICK, the
	door pops open.  KELLY herself tumbles out, wrapped in several
	blankets and carrying a mason jar half full of a yellowish
	liquid.  We can guess.

	She leaps to her feet, blinks the light out of her eyes, and
	bolts to the back of the trailer as fast as she possibly can.
	She races through a narrow door and SLAMS it shut.

	A sign on the door says "RESTROOM."  Inside, a SIGH of relief
	is heard.

							CUT TO:

	EXT. JUNGLE TRAIL - DAY

	Along a stream bed, the jungle trees still shiver.  NICK loads
	a three quarter inch tape into his heavy video camera and
	chews anxiously on a piece of gum.  SARAH and DR. JUTTSON are
	beside him as the group nervously follows the GROANING forest
	trees to their right.

	At the rear, EDDIE and MALCOLM walk side by side.  Eddie is
	carrying a heavy silver rifle, an aluminum canister hanging
	beneath the barrel.  He shows it to Malcolm, his voice low and
	urgent.

				EDDIE
		Lindstradt air rifle.  Fires a
		subsonic Fluger impact-delivery dart.

	He cracks open the cartridge bank, revealing a row of plastic
	containers filled with straw-colored liquid.  Each is tipped
	with a three inch needle and carries a bright yellow warning
	tag -- "EXTREME DANGER!  LETHAL TOXICITY!"

				EDDIE (cont'd)
		I loaded the enhanced venom of Conus
		purpurascens, the South Sea cone
		shell.  Most powerful neurotoxin in
		the world.  Acts within a
		two-thousandth of a second.  Faster
		than the nerve-conduction velocity.
		The animal's down before it feels the
		prick of the dart.

	From their right, the shaking trees seen closer now.  By
	walking down the stream bed, the humans are tracking right
	along with the animals as they move in the foliage.

				MALCOLM
			(to Eddie)
		Is there an antidote?

				EDDIE
		Like if you shoot yourself in the
		foot?  Wouldn't matter.  You'd be
		dead  before you realized you'd
		accidentally pulled the trigger.

	Ahead of them, thick foliage blocks the path of the dried up
	stream bed to the height of about fifteen feet.  But around
	them, the CRASHING sounds get louder and closer, the swaying
	trees shiver right beside them.  Eddie raises the rifle in
	defense as the trees right at the edge of the stream bed sway
	and part.  Above the foliage, they see the sudden
	movement --

	-- of a row of STEGOSAUR fins.  The spade-shaped fins run
	along a ridge down the middle of the animal's back, about
	three feet tall each.  The group freezes, amazed, and as the
	stegosaur continues on, they get a good look at it through a
	break in the foliage.

	It's a large dinosaur with a small head, a thick neck, and a
	huge lumbering body.

	A double row of plates runs along the crest of its back, and
	it has a dragging trail with long spikes in it.

	The gum drops out of Nick's mouth, FLOPS onto his shirt, and
	sticks there.

				NICK
		Oh --

				JUTTSON
		-- my --

				EDDIE
		-- God!

				SARAH
		It's beautiful!

	A second stegosaur, a baby about a quarter the size of the
	first animal, breaks through the foliage, following the adult.

	While the group is reaching to that, the earth vibrates and
	a third stego, by far the biggest of the three, walks out of
	the foliage right behind them, crossing within ten feet.

	Apparently unconcerned about these little creatures in their
	environment, the stegos continue on across the stream bed.

	Sarah raises a still camera and shoots pictures.  Her shutter
	is muted, so that a muffled CLICK is all that's audible.

	Juttson raises a pocket recorder to his lips and whispers into
	it breathlessly.

				JUTTSON
		Stegosaurus, family Stegosauridae,
		infraorder Stegosauria, suborder
		Thyreophora.  Length, adult male,
		estimate twenty-five to thirty feet.

	His breathy words turn into almost helpless laughter, of all
	things, as he can't contain his astonishment.  Eddie covers
	his mouth, trying to keep him quiet.

				SARAH
			(to Juttsn)
		That was a pair bond!  A family
		group, even, long after that infant
		was nestbound!

				JUTTSON
		I want to see the nesting ground!

	Nick turns to Malcolm, eyes like saucers, and makes a futile,
	wordless, boy-was-I-wrong-on-this-one gesture.  Malcolm
	smiles, leans over, and TAPS softly on Nick's video camera.
	Nick raises it to his shoulder and flicks it on as the group
	continues on into the bush after the animals.

	IN THE BUSH,

	the baby wanders away from the group and ambles over near
	where Sarah crouches in the bushes.  Sarah raises her camera
	again and silently SNAPS a picture.  She WHISPERS to Juttson,
	who is beside her.

				SARAH
		Lone nest -- not colonial.  I don't
		see an egg clutch...

	She gestures and Juttson peers through a pair of field
	glasses.

				JUTTSON
			(whispering back)
		The empty shells are crushed and
		trampled.  The young stay in the
		birth environment, that's conclusive!

				SARAH
		Not without a shot of the nest.

	She sees an opportunity.  As the baby heads back to its
	parents, Sarah scoots right along with it, moving behind it,
	using its body as a shield to block her from the view of the
	other two.

	Nick and Eddie's faces whiten in alarm.  Nick reaches out to
	stop her, but he barely gets hold of the sole of her boot
	before she pulls away from him and duckwalks out into the
	clearing.

	IN THE CLEARING,

	Sarah slinks along behind the baby stego as it walks back,
	toward the nest, chewing the branches it carries in its south.
	She raises up sightly, squeezing off pictures of the herd,
	ever better as she gets closer.

	BACK AT THE HILL,

	the others can only watch her, aghast.

				NICK
		She's gutty.

				MALCOLM
		She's nuts.

	IN THE CLEARING,

	Sarah keeps moving closer.  The baby passes a small grouping
	of rocks and Sarah ducks behind them.  She's now in a perfect
	position to photograph the nest, and she squeezes off picture
	after picture from this ideal vantage point.

	She shoots the last picture on the roll --

	-- and the camera's autowinder WHIRS to life.  Sarah looks
	down in horror as the camera's motor WHINES loudly in her
	hands.

	Th noise startles the animals.  The male turns toward her
	the plates on its back bristling.  Sarah gets to her feet and
	starts to move away, slowly.

	The male turns away from her and swings its tail, spikes
	extended.  It WHIZZES through the air, right at her, but Sarah
	leaps back at the last second --

	-- and the tail's spikes THUD into the dirt where she was.

	Sarah CRUNCHES to the ground and the three stegosaurs dart
	away, disappearing into the bush, moving surprisingly quickly
	for animals their size.

	The others run to Sarah, help her to her feet, and pull her
	back, against a massive tree trunk.  But the tree trunk lifts
	right up off the ground.

	It's no tree, it's a DINOSAUR'S LEG, a massive one, six feet
	across, God knows how many feet high.  The Group gasps and
	looks up as a MAKENCHIASAURUS, an enormous saurupod over a
	hundred feet from nose to tail,  lumbers away from them.

	The Group stares in wonder as the mamenchiasaur stops and
	HONKS furtively, its long neck stretched out above them.

	Now a second mamenchiasaur neck cranes out of the
	surrounding forest trees and wraps around the first.  The
	first mamenchiasaur THUNDERS around in a semi-circle, getting
	into position behind the second.

	Nick swings his video camera straight up and the group
	suddenly finds itself in the middle of a mamenchiasaur mating.

	The mighty tails swing and SNAP around them as the two animals
	come together, and trees start snapping and falling, CRASHING
	to the jungle floor.

	The group panics and bolts for cover toward the only place
	where the trees are not falling -- which is directly underneath
	the animals!

	Amid HONKS and BLEATS, the swinging tails continue to deforest
	the jungle around them.

	The noise and chaos is deafening, drowning out the LAUGHTER
	and SCREAMS of the fascinated and terrified group.

	There is a momentary lull and the group dashes out from
	underneath the animals, disappearing into the thick forest.

	A SHORT DISTANCE AWAY,

	the Group collapses to the ground, breathless, chests heaving
	with wild, frightened laughter.  Sarah goes to Malcolm and
	throws her arms around him, exhilarated.

				SARAH
		Ian, you're not insane!  I'm so
		glad!

				JUTTSON
			(out of breath)
		Dr. Malcolm -- the world -- owes you
		an apology.

							CUT TO:

	EXT. JUNGLE TRAIL - DAY

	Suddenly, the Gathereres are taking their expedition a lot more
	seriously.  They march quickly back to base camp, their energy
	and excitement palpable.  NICK strikes a match and raises it
	to a cigarette with a shaking hand, but SARAH leans in and
	blows it out.

				SARAH
		No more smoking.  We leave no scent
		of any kind.  No hair tonics, no
		cologne, seal all our food in plastic
		bags.  We will observe and document,
		but we will not interact.

				MALCOLM
		That's a scientific impossibility,
		you know.  Heisenberg uncertainty
		principle.  Whatever you study, you
		also change.

	Nick ejects the used videotape from his camera and pulls out a
	sharpie, to label it.

				NICK
		What should I call this?  "Jurassic
		Pork?"

	Eddie, next to him, laughs.

				SARAH
			(still to Malcolm)
		And let's forget about the high hide.
		We can't do this kind of work up in a
		tower, we need to be out in the
		field, as close to the animals as
		possible.

				JUTTSON
		I'm not surprised stegosaur lived in
		a family group, but there's never
		been anything in the fossil record to
		prove the carnivores did.

				SARAH
		Why wouldn't they?  Look at hyenas,
		jackals, nearly all species of
		predator birds --

				JUTTSON
		That doesn't say a thing about T-rex,
		they could have been rogues.  Robert
		Burke certainly thinks they were.

				SARAH
		We've got to see one to find out.
		Is there any --

				MALCOLM
		No way.

				NICK
		Oh, my God.

				SARAH
		-- way we could safely --

				NICK
		Oh, no!

	He takes off, running as fast as he can, down the trail,
	toward base camp.  They look ahead, in the direction Nick is
	running.  A plume of black smoke is rising up over the trees.

				EDDIE
		Fire!

							CUT TO:

	EXT. BASE CAMP - DAY

	NICK bursts out of the trees and races toward the thick plume
	of smoke.  In the middle of the base camp, someone has neatly
	built a campfire surrounded by stones.  Flames burn in the
	middle.

	Nick races over to it and stomps it out as the OTHERS emerge
	from the trees behind him.

				MALCOLM
		A campfire?!

	Nick grabs a jug of water, but Sarah steps in.

				SARAH
		No!  Water mixes the smoke billow,
		use dirt!

	They start to kick and rake dirt onto the fire with their
	hands and feet.  Eddie and Dr. Juttson jump in and help out.

				MALCOLM
		Who the hell started a campfire?!

				VOICE (o.s.)
		It was just to make lunch.

	Malcolm turns toward the source of the voice.  KELLY stands in
	the doorway of the trailer, sheepish.

				KELLY (cont'd)
			I wanted it ready when you got back.

	The whole group stares, stunned, none more so than Malcolm
	himself.

				MALCOLM
		Oh ... man.

							CUT TO:

	EXT. BASE CAMP - LATER

	Later, and base camp is a blur of activity.  SARAH, JUTTSON,
	NICK, and EDDIE are hard at work, burying the remains of the
	fire, sealing their food in plastic bags, loading camera
	equipment, packing up specimen containers and other
	information-gathering equipment.

	MALCOLM, meanwhile, is lecturing Kelly.

				MALCOLM
		You know you were putting yourself in
		a potentially dangerous situation,
		but you didn't bother to find out
		how dangerous before you leapt in.
		You don't have the faintest idea
		what's going on on this island!

				SARAH
			(loading a backpack)
		What do you want to do, Ian, lock her
		up for curiosity?  Where do you think
		she gets it?

				JUTTSON
			(to Nick)
		Do you have chromium tapes?  The
		others fog in high-

				NICK
		-humidity, I know.
			(waving a tape)
		Highest lead density on the market.

				EDDIE
			(to Malcolm)
		We've got a lot of heavy marching
		ahead of us.  I'm not carrying 
		anybody.

				KELLY
		I can keep up.

				MALCOLM
		You're going home.  I'm sending a
		radio call for the boats.  We'll all
		go down to the lagoon and wait for
		them.

				SARAH
		Lighten up, Ian, you sound like a
		high school vice-principal.

				MALCOLM
		I'm her father.

				KELLY
		Sure, now.

	Nick leans over and whispers to Eddie, gesturing to Malcolm
	and Kelly.

				NICK
		Do you see any family resemblance
		here?

				MALCOLM
		You can't stay, Kelly, that's it.
		It's too dangerous.

				SARAH
		If it's so dangerous, why'd you bring
		any of us?

				KELLY
		You're wrong, Dad.  I do know
		what's going on on this island.

				MALCOLM
		How could you possibly?

				KELLY
		Because you said so.  Maybe nobody
		else believed you, but I always
		did.

	He looks at her, touched.  Nick mutters to Eddie again.

				NICK
		The kid scores with cheap sentiment.

				SARAH
		Ian, if we recall the boat now, we've
		made two invasive landings in one
		day.  That'll have to go in any paper
		I write, and it will leave room for
		people to say our findings were
		contaminated.  You know the academic
		world as well as I do, once they
		smell blood in the water, you're
		dead.  Our presence has got to be one
		hundred percent antiseptic.  That
		means if we bend a blade of grass, we
		bend it right back the way it-

	A low sound has been rising while she speaks, and now it comes
	BOOMING over the jungle around them, a THUNDEROUS racket that
	shakes the very ground beneath them.  Suddenly, three C-130
	military cargo planes THUNDER overhead and ROAR toward the
	island interior, flying very low.  The planes are enormous,
	fat-assed creatures, their rear cargo doors hanging open.

	AT A RIDGE,

	the members of the gatherer expedition hit the dirt and peer
	over a ledge, watching as the airplanes bank and circle over a
	specific spot.

	Eddie raises a pair of field glasses.

	DOWN BELOW,

	huge metal equipment containers are shoved out the back of the
	cargo bays.  They SNAP off trees like matchsticks, CRUSH flat
	anything foolish enough to exist where they want to land.

	Now MEN pour out the rear of the planes, their low-altitude
	parachutes billowing open behind them.

	UP ON THE RIDGE,

	Nick looks at Sarah.

				NICK
		You were saying something about
		antiseptic?

							CUT TO:

	EXT. HUNTERS' CAMP - DAY

	Metal container doors CLANG to the ground, jeep engines ROAR
	to life in a cloud of thick black diesel smoke, blue laser
	barriers SIZZLE and BURN through foliage as this group of
	HUNTERS establishes a perimeter around their new camp.

	PETER LUDLOW, dressed in brand new Banana Republic safari
	wear, steps into the center of the camp and surveys the
	surroundings.  He turns to DR. ROBERT BURKE, a ragged,
	pony-tailed man in wire-rimmed glasses.

				LUDLOW
		Welcome to your dream come true, Dr.
		Burke.

	Burke has a detailed set of satellite recon photographs that
	he spreads out on the hood of a jeep.

				BURKE
		I believe the large herbivores forage
		in open plains, like bison, which
		would explain the great variety of
		heat dots we're reading in the
		flatlands around this waterhole.
		Right -- here.

				LUDLOW
		Then that's where we're going.

	Burke flips open a manifest that he will carry with him at all
	times.  Inside, there are dozens of sketches of various kinds
	underneath.  As each vehicle ROARS out of the equipment
	container, Burke slips a waterproof eight by ten card with an
	icon of the various dinosaurs on the island into a slot in the
	dashboard.

				BURKE
			(calling them off)
		Hadrosaurus!  Carinthosaurus!
		Maiasaurus!

	As the procession goes on, Ludlow turns to DIETER STARK, the
	man we saw welding earlier.

				LUDLOW
		This is as good a place as any for
		base camp.  First priority is the
		laser barriers, I want them all up
		and running in thirty minutes.  Half
		an hour, understand?

	Dieter nods and turns to some of the HUNTERS, who number about
	twenty in all, that are working nearby.  But someone steps in
	front of Dieter, cutting him off.  It's ROLAND TEMBO, the
	hunter from the bar in Mombassa.

				ROLAND
		Cancel that, Dieter.

				LUDLOW
		What?  Why?

	Roland points to a stream running nearby.

				ROLAND
		Carnivores hunt near stream beds.  Do
		you want to set up base camp or an
		all-you-can-eat people bar?

				LUDLOW
			(thinks)
		You heard his, Dieter.  Find a new
		spot.  And remember, we're after
		herbivores only -- no unnecessary
		risks.

	Dieter SIGHS and goes to work.  Roland puts an arm around
	Ludlow and pulls him aside.

				ROLAND
		Peter, if you want me to run your
		little camping trip, there are two
		conditions.  First -- I'm in
		charge, and when I'm not around,
		Dieter is.  Your job is to sign the
		checks, tell us we're doing a good
		job, and open your case of scotch
		when we have a good day.  Second
		condition -- my fee.  You can keep
		it.  All I want in exchange for my
		services is the right to hunt one of
		the tyrannosaurs.  A male.  Buck
		only.  Why and how are my business.
		If you don't  like either of those
		conditions, you're on your own.  Go
		ahead and set up your camp right
		here, or in a swamp, or in the middle
		of a rex nest, for all I care.  But
		I've been on too many safaris with
		rich dentists to listen to any more
		suicidal ideas.  Okay?

				LUDLOW
			(what else can he say?)
		Okay.

				ROLAND
		Good lad.

							CUT TO:

	EXT. JUNGLE

	The jungle foliage shivers, quakes, and finally falls as the
	Hunters' convoy ROARS into the hart of the jungle.  DIETER
	STARK stands in the front of the lead vehicle, the
	"speedbird," waving the convoy forward, his Driver (CARTER) at
	the wheel beside him.

	LUDLOW is in the back seat of the speedbird next to DR. BURKE.
	ROLAND and AJAY, his tracker, are in the second jeep.  They
	look up as the brakelights on the speedbird flash and the car
	stops, forcing the rest of the convoy to halt as well.

	In the front, the speedbird flashes its lights at something in
	front of it.  Dieter climbs out, plainly irritated.  He walks
	around the front of the car and sees --

	-- four PACHYCEPHALOSAURS eating grass in the middle of the
	jungle trail.  They're about five feet tall, thick, heavy-set
	animals whose distinctive feature is an enormous skull casing,
	a tall, impressive crown that rises on the tops of their
	heads.  Dieter doesn't seem impressed.  He looks back at
	Ludlow, who look at Dr. Burke.

	Burke stands up in his seat, a look of wonder on his face.

				BURKE
		Pachycephalosaurus!

				LUDLOW
		Carnivore?

				BURKE
			(enchanted)
		Huh?  No!  No, herbivore, late
		Cretaceous.  Very unusual plant
		eater, see that distinctive domed
		skull?  That's nine inches of solid
		bone.

				LUDLOW
			(who cares?)
		Just get them out of the way, Dieter.

				DIETER
		COME ON, MOVE IT!!

	The pachys look up at him sluggishly, still eating, like cows
	chewing their cuds.  As unimpressive with him as he is with
	them, they go back to their grass.

				DIETER (cont'd)
		Oh, for God's --

	He slings his rifle off his  shoulder and aims it at the
	closest animal.  Behind him, Roland has climbed out of the
	second jeep.

				ROLAND
		Dieter.  This is a round-up, not a
		war.  Use your powers of persuasion.

	Dieter gestures to the speedbird to pull ahead, which it does,
	slowly, toward the animals.  The pachys look up, alert, but do
	not move.  Dieter walks toward them.

				DIETER
		Come on, come on, don't have all
		day!

				BURKE
			(going on to no one in
			 particular)
		See, the pachy's neck attaches at the
		bottom of its skull instead of the
		back of its head, as with reptiles.

	The speedbird draws closer.  The first pachy stares at it
	intently.  The lead vehicle gets closer, closer --

	-- and BANGS into the pachy, knocking it back a few feet, out
	of the way.

				BURKE (cont'd)
		So when it lowers its head, its neck
		lines up directly with its
		backbone --

	BEHIND DIETER,

	Ajay is staring at something on the ground at his feet.  He
	takes a few steps further into the foliage, then turns back
	toward Roland.

				AJAY
		Roland.

	UP AT THE FRONT,

	the pachys turn and hop away.  Dieter turns and heads back to
	the speedbird.  As he reaches for the door, a VOICE calls
	"look out!" from behind him.  Dieter spins around, just in
	time to see --

	-- the first pachy in full charge.  It SLAMS headfirst into
	the speedbird, SMASHING the headlights and denting the grill.

				BURKE
			(concluding his lecture)
		Which is perfect for absorbing
		impact.

	Dieter turns and runs around to the front of the car.  The
	pachy has backed up  for another run and is now CHARGING RIGHT
	AT HIM.

	Dieter retreats, quickly, and rips open the passenger door to
	protect himself.

	SLAM!  The pachy clobbers the door, sending Dieter flying
	against the car, knocking the wind out of him.

	In the other jeeps, the rest of the HUNTERS stand up or lean
	out the window for a better look, laughing.

	POW!!  The pachy head-butts the tire next to Dieter.  It
	bounces off, tumbles to the ground, and rolls to its feet as
	Dieter gets to his knees and crawls toward the back of the
	speedbird.

	But the pachy is quicker and lunges at Dieter again.  He's
	forced to hit the dirt and crawls quickly underneath the
	speedbird, just as the animal SLAMS into the rear of the
	vehicle.

	Now the other three animals join the jun.  Ludlow and the
	Driver have to cover their heads as the animals lunge at the
	car again and again, SMASHING the steel-meshed windows and
	MANGLING the quarter panels.  The rest of the group watches,
	vastly amused.

	A FEW STEPS INTO THE JUNGLE,

	Ajay and Roland are staring at something on the ground -- an
	animal footprint, three-toed, enormous.

				AJAY
		It matches the pictures.

				ROLAND
		It certainly does.

	Roland gets up and goes back to his vehicle, ignoring the
	pachy demolition derby that continues up at the speedbird.
	Roland opens a case in the back of the jeep, revealing --

	-- his gun.  It's an antique elephant gun, a double barreled
	.600 Nitro Express.  Nearly a hundred years old, it's still in
	immaculate condition, its rosewood stock buttery smooth,
	bisons delicately engraved along its silver breach.

	The barrels are twenty-four inches long, topped with an ivory
	bead foresight at the business end.  Roland scoops up the gun,
	breaks the breach, and pulls two rounds of ammunition from his
	shirt pocket.

	Four inches long and three-quarters of an inch in diameter,
	these are the largest full metal jacket cartridges ever made.
	He slips one into each barrel and heads back into the bush.

	Roland pauses before he goes, as if noticing the animals
	trashing the speedbird for the first time.

				ROLAND
		HEY!

	The pachys all freeze, staring at him.  Roland waves one hand,
	HISSES sharply between his teeth --

	-- and the pachys scatter, back into the jungle.  Takes care
	of that problem.  Roland turns and heads back into the jungle,
	calling out over his shoulder to Ludlow.

				ROLAND (cont'd)
		Don't worry about us.  We'll catch
		up.

				LUDLOW
		Where do you think you're going?!

				ROLAND
		To collect my fee.

	And with that he disappears into the foliage.

	The Driver of the Speedbird drops it into gear and the
	battered car GROANS forward.  As it moves ahead, it reveals
	DIETER, lying underneath it, ego bruised worse than body.

	IN THE JUNGLE,

	Ajay takes a step into the bush, but at a ninety degree
	angle away from the direction in which the animals tracks
	lead.

				ROLAND
		Ajay.

	Ajay turns.  Roland points in the direction in which the
	footprints lead.

				ROLAND (cont'd)
		I'm no tracker, but even I can read
		this spoor.

				AJAY
		Do you wish to go where the animal
		has been, or where the animal is?

	Roland smiles.  Ajay sets off in his direction and Roland
	follows.

							CUT TO:

	EXT. ISLAND RIDGE - DAY

	Seen from a ridge above them, the hunters' convoy continues to
	plow through the jungle.  But how the hunters themselves are
	being tracked, followed by the GATHERERS.  They scurry along
	as fast as they can, trying to keep pace with the moving
	vehicle below.

				EDDIE
		Why didn't you tell us about these
		guys, Ian?!

				MALCOLM
		Because I didn't know!  I don't have
		the faintest idea what they're doing
		here.

				NICK
			(angry)
		Ruining everything, that's what
		they're doing.  You could choke on
		the diesel smoke already!

				SARAH
		Ian, nothing we observe will be valid
		if we're trailing along in the wake
		of an army.

	Kelly has a pair of binoculars and is studying the vehicles as
	they move below.

				KELLY
		"InGen."  What's InGen?

				MALCOLM
		Where does it say that?

				KELLY
		On the side of that one truck.

	Malcolm takes the binoculars and stares down there himself.

				JUTTSON
		InGen is a genetics corporation,
		isn't it?

				NICK
			(to Malcolm)
		Is that who we're really working
		for?!  Gene splicers?!

				MALCOLM
		No!  We're an independently funded
		expedition.

				SARAH
		Funded by whom?

				MALCOLM
		John Hammond.

				JUTTSON
		But he's the head of InGen!

				NICK
		You gotta be kidding.
			(to Malcolm)
		You dragged me out of Greenpeace to
		be a corporate stooge?  You couldn't
		get anybody else?

				KELLY
		Yeah, what have you done, Dad?

				SARAH
		We'd better keep moving, or we'll
		lose them.

	The group moves on ahead, but Malcolm lingers, angry, staring
	through the binoculars.

				MALCOLM
		What are you doing to me, John?

							CUT TO:

	EXT. THE CAVES - DAY

	AJAY and ROLAND make their way through the foliage and come
	into a small clearing, where a cluster of caves is carved into
	the rock.  Ajay freezes, gesturing ahead, to the cave on the
	far left.

	Roland pulls up a handful of grass and releases it on the
	breeze.  It floats back between his legs.  That's good.

	He proceeds toward the cave, carefully, Ajay behind him.  They
	can see nothing beyond the yawning mouth of the cave, only a
	black interior.

	Roland pauses, looking down.  On the ground to his right he
	sees the partially eastern leg of a creature.  It's old,
	crawling with white maggots and flies.

	Roland continues on.  Closer to the cave, he now passes the
	skull of a large animal, some of the flesh and green skin
	still adhering to the bone.  It, too, is covered with flies.

	Still he continues on.  A short rise leads into the cave, and
	they edge up it.  From inside the cave, they can hear an odd
	SQUEAKING sound, very high-pitched.

	Crawling now, Roland and Ajay scale a four-foot circular
	rampart of dried mud, and peer into --

	-- the tyrannosaur nest.  It's flattered inside, about ten
	feet in diameter, completely encircled by earthen walls.

	A BABY TYRANNOSAUR, about four and a half feet long, is in the
	center of the nest.  It has a large head, very large eyes, and
	its body is covered with a fluffy red down, which gives it a
	scraggly appearance.

	It SQUEAKS repeatedly, tearing awkwardly at the remains of a
	chunk of animal flesh, biting decisively with tiny, sharp
	teeth.

	The cave itself is a foul boneyard.  ANIMAL CARCASSES litter
	the edges, flies BUZZ in the captive air.  Roland raises a
	bandana to his nose to cover the stench.  He  turns to Ajay and
	WHISPERS.

				ROLAND
		It's the rex nest.

	Ajay nods.  The baby tyrannosaur hears the whisper and looks
	up, cocking its head in curiosity.

				AJAY
		Make a blind here?  Wait for the buck
		to return?

				ROLAND
			(shakes his head no)
		If the nest is upwind, so are we.
		When he comes back, he'll know we're
		here before we have a chance.  The
		truck --

	In the nest below, the baby SQUEAKS angrily at the intruders.

				ROLAND (cont'd)
		-- is to get him to come where we
		want him.

	The baby SQUEAKS again, indignant.  Roland turns and looks
	down at it.  Thinking.

							CUT TO:

	EXT. RIDGE - DUSK

	As the sun glows bright orange on the horizon, NICK raises a
	pair of binoculars to his eyes and peers down at the vista
	below the ridge.

	In the lenses of the binoculars, we can clearly see a mixed
	herd of midsized herbivores -- HARDOSAURS, PACHYCEPHALOSAURS,
	and CALLIMIMUSES -- racing across the plain below.
	
	MALCOLM, also staring through binoculars, lies on the ridge
	beside him.  SARAH is several feet behind them, her back
	pressed against a tree, unwilling to go to the lip of the
	ridge.

	THROUGH NICK'S BINOCULARS

	We see a shaky point of view of the herd running.  The
	binoculars whip to the right --

	-- revealing a jeep chasing the herd  Not just one jeep, in
	fact, but a whole FLEET OF HUNTER PURSUIT VEHICLES!

	There are two herding jeeps, one motorcycle, as speedier
	mini-jeep, and, further behind, a container truck and a
	wrangler's pickup truck.

	Although there's a great deal of commotion below, up here it's
	almost eerily silent.

	ON THE RIDGE,

	Nick lowers the binoculars, angry.  When he raises them again,
	the sun FLARES off the lens --

	EXT. THE PLAIN - DUSK

	-- and when the brilliant flare clears, we're right down in
	the middle of the roundup.  Engines ROAR, wheels spin and dig
	in the dirt, men SHOUT and radios SQUAWK as the hunter
	vehicles pursue the fleeting herd they're flushed.

	The HUNTER SHOUT and SHRIEK with glee, incredulous and
	thrilled by the spectacular animals they're pursuing.

				HUNTER
		LOOK AT THESE THINGS!

				HUNTER 2
		THEY'RE BEAUTIFUL, MAN, THEY'RE
		BEAUTIFUL!!!

	One of the pursuit vehicles (a "snagger"), pulls ahead of the
	others.  DIETER STARK stands in the passenger seat, holding a
	long pole with a noose dangling from the end of it.

	He swings the pole out over the side of the jeep and SHOUTS to
	the driver.

				DIETER
		FASTER!

	The Driver hits the gas and the snagger leaps forward, gaining
	on the herd.  Aware of the danger behind them, the herd veers
	to the right, toward the cover of thick jungle --

	-- but the motorcycle ROARS in from the right side, cutting
	them off, herding them back out into the open.

	BACK IN THE CONTAINER TRUCK,

	PETER LUDLOW stands in a "conning tower," a command post in
	the heaviest pursuit vehicle.  He BARKS into a walkie-talkie.

				LUDLOW
		Alive, Dieter, and uninjured!

	BACK ON THE SNAGGER,

	the Driver can barely keep up with the twists and feints
	thrown by the herd ahead of him.  Dieter CURSES and throws the
	lasso pole into the back of the jeep.  Ludlow's voice
	continues over the radio in Dieter's jeep.

				LUDLOW (o.s.)
		Those are very expensive animals!
		Can you hear me?!

				DIETER
			(to the Driver)
		Turn that off!

	The Driver SNAPS off the radio as Dieter grabs a long-barreled
	rifle from the back of the vehicle.

	THE MOTORCYCLE

	guns it again, forcing the herd back into the middle of the 
	plain.  From the trees to the left, two heads on enormous
	necks rise up in alarm.  Two APATOSAURS are startled from the
	bush and lumber out across the middle of the plain.

	The herd doesn't even break stride, but keeps running,
	scampering after the giants and stampeding right between their
	massive legs.

	One smaller pachycephalosaur bolts loose, but the motorcycle
	cuts it off and herds it back into the middle, which now takes
	the motorcycle right through the rising and falling legs of
	the apotosaurs.

	The bike chases the pachy out the other side, and as the
	apatosaurs disappear into the distance, the cycle isolates the
	juvenile.

	Another truck, a "scissor rig," spots the isolated animal.
	High in the back of the truck, a HUNTER mans a tranquilizer
	cannon, drawing a bead on the pachy as the cycle runs it down.

	He FIRES and the tranquilizer dart hits the animal in the
	neck.  Its pace slows and another HUNTER from the truck tosses
	a lasso around its neck.

	They crank a winch, reeling in the animal.

	As the truck gain on it, two six-foot padded arms with what
	look like heavy airbags on the insides open up on the front of
	the truck.

	As the animal is pulled in, the scissors close with a
	hydraulic WHIR, trapping the animal between its airbags.

	Now a pick-up rig ROARS up and drops its back gate.  The
	scissor rig rolls forward, depositing the squirming pachy in
	this dino-contaiment vehicle.

	Two HUNTERS throw levers on the side of the scissor bars and
	the scissor rig backs away, leaving the animal, still pinched
	between the bars, imprisoned in the back of the pick-up rig.

	The Hunters quickly fit new scissor bars onto the scissor rig
	and it takes off, back into the hunt.

	BACK ON THE SNAGGER,

	Dieter, rifle in hand, drops down into the passenger seat,
	whips a harness over himself and CLICKS it into place.  He
	jabs his thumb into a flashing red button in the dashboard.

	Immediately, a motor underneath the seat HUMS to life and the
	seat itself telescopes, extending a good four feet out to

	Dieter raises the gun, picks a CARINTHOSAUR, a red-crested
	herbivore, from the rear of the fleeting herd, and takes aim.

	BANG!!

	The carinthosaur staggers as a tranquilizer dart sticks in
	its left hindquarter.

	UP ON THE RIDGE,

	there is utter quiet.  Nick and the others stare wordlessly at
	the spectacle below.

	DOWN ON THE PLAIN,

	the snagger SHUDDERS to a halt in the dirt, kicking up a huge
	cloud of dust and dirt.

	The motorcycle spins to a stop beside it, its DRIVER pushing
	his mask up to reveal his sweat and dirt-streaked face.

	The wrangler truck backs up and drops its rear door, which
	CLANGS heavily to the ground.

	FOUR WRANGLERS carrying wire noose poles and chains race down
	the ramp and out of the truck.

	Dieter jumps off the snagger.  He puts down his tranquilizer
	gun, picks up a long steel rod, and walks forward slowly.
	Ahead of him, the carinthosaur is still on its feet.

	The sedated animal staggers, fighting to retain its balance
	while it is surrounded by the wary Wranglers.

				DIETER
		Easy -- easy -- not too close!
		Full extension!

	The Wranglers adjust their poles, extending them another three
	feet, which allows them to stay further from the reeling, ten
	foot tall animal.

				DIETER (cont'd)
		Now!

	Almost as one, the Wranglers flip their noose over the
	stunned animal's neck.  It thrashes, but the Wranglers hold
	their poles tightly, surrounding and immobilizing it.

	UP ON THE RIDGE,

	Nick turns away.  He can't watch.

	DOWN ON THE PLAIN,

	a bolero-type device, a rope with a round weight at either
	end, whips around the carinthosaur's legs.  The animal THUDS
	to the dirt with a SNORT of a defeat.

	Ludlow steps up next to Dieter and both of them stare down at
	the helpless animal.  Ludlow's breathing heavily, eyes
	glowing.

	The animal is still thrashing, pumping its legs crazily.
	Dieter turns a knob on the side of the steel rod he's holding
	and thrusts it into the defenseless animal's neck.

	A blue arc of electricity CRACKS and dances over the
	carinthosaur's body.  The animal convulses in pain, a
	horrible, high-pitched SQUEALING rips the air.

	DR. BURKE, their paleontologist, hurries forward with a
	syringe.

	He draws a certain amount of tranquilizer from a bottle and
	injects it into the animal's thigh.

	CARTER, Dieter's Driver, steps up with a can of spray paint
	and quickly tags the animal with an ID number in day-glo
	orange.

	Dieter pulls the card with an icon of a carinthosaur from the
	dashboard of the jeep and marks a black X over the drawing of
	the animal.

				DIETER
		Next case.

							CUT TO:

	EXT. RIDGE - NIGHT

	Night has fallen over the island.  The hunters have
	established base camp in an area they have trampled and
	cleared just below the ridge.  Blue laser fences encircle the
	perimeter.  Inside, half a dozen tents are set up around a
	central campfire.

	The vehicles are all parked at one end, away from the tents.
	At the other end, there is a row of at least a dozen "capture
	containers," cages that hold the imprisoned dinosaurs they
	have already rounded up.

	SARAH, MALCOLM, and NICK stand at the edge of the ridge above,
	looking down at the scene.  Sarah stands a bit further back
	from the others, not wanting to get too close to the edge.
	VOICES waft up to them, raucous, LAUGHING, some even SINGING.

	DR. JUTTSON has a pair of night-vision binoculars trained on
	the cages.

				JUTTSON
		Carinthosaurus -- compsognathus --
		triceratops -- pachycephalosaurus --
		or small scavengers only.

	Malcolm, also with binoculars, furrows his brow, seeing
	something below.

	THROUGH MALCOLM'S BINOCULARS,

	he sees PETER LUDLOW, standing in the middle of the camp,
	pointing, giving orders.

	ON THE RIDGE,

	Malcolm drops the binoculars.

				MALCOLM
		Ludlow.  That's why Hammond was in
		such a hurry for me to get here.  He
		knew they were coming.

	He gives the binoculars to Sarah, who moves forward gingerly.

				MALCOLM (cont'd)
		You okay?

				SARAH
			(irritated)
		Heights, I can't help it.  Put your
		arm here, will you?

	She puts his arm around her waits, to steady her while she is
	close to the cliff edge.

				JUTTSON
		What do they want?

				MALCOLM
		They want their money back.  To
		InGen, this island is nothing more
		than a bed investment.

				JUTTSON
		We should get back to base camp.
		Eddie's waiting for us.

				MALCOLM
		I can't believe Peter Ludlow's
		running all this.

				SARAH
		He isn't.  Check out the guy walking
		past the fire.

	She hands the binoculars to Malcolm.

	THROUGH THE BINOCULARS,

	Malcolm sees ROLAND, who's walking with AJAY, weapons and
	equipment slung over their shoulders.

				SARAH (o.s.)
		I've seen him before.  In Brazil.  He
		and that guy with him were
		spearhunting jaguars.  Said it was
		immoral to go after them any other
		way.  He's not just a hunter, he's a
		philosopher.  Kind of guy who beats
		you up with your own argument.

	BACK ON THE RIDGE,

				SARAH (cont'd)
		He's the one in charge.

				MALCOLM
		Well, if that's true -- the man in
		charge just left camp.

	Nick, who has been quietly fuming next to them, now steps
	forward.

				NICK
		Then this is our chance.

				MALCOLM
		Our chance to do what?

				NICK
		I don't know these guys, but I know
		'em.  I've seen 'em on Japanese
		whalers, French barges trying to dump
		barrels of nuclear waste in the North
		Atlantic.  They're all the same.
		They spray us with water cannon when
		we try to stop 'em, sink our boats,
		and then call us crazy.

	He rummages through his pack, coming up with various tools.  A
	hunting knife.  A bolt cutter.

				NICK (cont'd)
		Nobody has to come with me.  I've
		done this before.

				SARAH
		Why, Nick.  You are a tree-hugger.

	He looks at her, hurt.

				NICK
		There' no reason for name calling.

				MALCOLM
		Dr. Juttson, please take Kelly back
		to camp right away.  Leave the other
		car for us and we'll meet you there
		in an hour or so.

				KELLY
		What are you guys gonna do?

				MALCOLM
			(signs)
		Exactly what John Hammond wanted us
		to do.

							CUT TO:

	INT. TENT - HUNTER'S CAMP - NIGHT

	In the hunters' supply tent, a case of twelve-year-old scotch
	sits open amid crate after crate of weapons and ammunition.
	PETER LUDLOW reaches in and pulls a bottle out.

	EXT. JUNGLE - NIGHT

	In the jungle, LUDLOW approaches a small clearing.  ROLAND is
	bent over a small stake in the ground, chaining something to
	it.  As Ludlow approaches and walks around him, he sees what
	protest.  Roland looks up.

				ROLAND
		Offering a little incentive.

	Ludlow laughs and shakes his head.  He takes a drink and
	offers Roland one.  Roland accepts.  Ludlow notices Roland's
	gun leaning against a tree.

				LUDLOW
		What kind of gun is that?

				ROLAND
		My father's .600 Nitro Express.  Made
		in 1904.  Karimojo Bell gave it to
		him after he took down his last
		elephant.  8700 foot pound striking
		force.

				LUDLOW
		How close do you have to be?

				ROLAND
		Forty yards.  Less, maybe.  I assume
		it'll take a slug in the brain case
		to bring him down.

				LUDLOW
		Why not just use a scope and a poison
		dart and snipe him from a hill?

	Roland just looks at him.

				ROLAND
		Or a laser beam from a satellite?

	Ludlow leans down, close to the baby rex, and examines it
	while it thrashes on its chain.  Its mouth has been bound shut
	with a leather strap.

				LUDLOW
		You rally think this'll draw the
		parent?

				ROLAND
		I once saw a bull elephant die
		charging a jeep.  All the jeep had
		done was startle the bull's calves.
		I saw a lioness carry wounded prey
		four and a half miles, all the way
		back to its den, just to teach its
		cubs how to finish off a kill.

				LUDLOW
		Killing lessons?  Heartwarming.

				ROLAND
		Rex won't be any different.  It'll
		come.

				LUDLOW
		You're kidding yourself.  An adult
		T-rex cares about one thing --
		filling its own belly.  It acts the
		way people wish they could, that's
		why everyone's fascinated by it.  If
		people had the chance to see one
		dinosaur and one only, ninety-nine
		percent would --

	He stops, an idea on his face.

				LUDLOW (cont'd)
		Wait.  Why not?  Sedatives...
		growth inhibitors...

				ROLAND
		What?

				LUDLOW
		I hadn't planned on bringing
		carnivores back because of the
		liability risk, but I only thought of
		adults, it never occurred to me --
			(close to the animal)
		You are a billion dollar idea, my
		little f-

	CRACK!  The tyrannosaur, even with its jaws clamped shut,
	lunges at Ludlow's face, head-butting him right across the
	bridge of the nose.  Ludlow staggers back, WAITING in pain,
	clutching his bleeding face.

	Roland laughs.  Ludlow, like an enraged child, snatches up
	Roland's gun and brings the butt down viciously on the rex's
	leg.  The bone breaks with a dry SNAP and the animal HOWLS in
	pain.

	Roland lunges and throws Ludlow to the ground, but the damage
	is done.

				ROLAND
		What the hell you do that for?!

	As his pain eases, Ludlow feels a bit foolish, but he attempts
	to cover.

				LUDLOW
		Had to.  To keep him still for the
		trip.

				ROLAND
		You've broken its leg!

				LUDLOW
		We've got to transport it seven
		thousand miles.  Would you prefer it
		bit off the leg of a crew member?

	He gets up, brushes himself off, and heads back to the camp,
	trying to salvage his dignity.  Roland watches him go.

							CUT TO:

	EXT. EDGE OF HUNTERS' CAMP - NIGHT

	At the edge of the hunters' camp, NICK, SARAH, and MALCOLM
	scramble down a hillside and stop at the edge of the laser
	barriers.  There are three beams, each about two feet apart,
	the tallest almost six feet off the ground.

	Nick reaches the edge and crouches.  Sarah, helped by Malcolm,
	steps up onto his back and jumps over the top, landing with a
	CRUNCH.  Nick is next, given a boost by Malcolm, who is then
	left alone on the other side.

	He backs up a few steps, jogs right at the lasers, then
	springs off his good leg --

	-- and does the Fosburry Flop right over the top.  He lands
	with a THUD, to the silent admiration of the other two.

	FURTHER IN THE CAMP,

	the three of them creep along, hiding behind a stack of fuel
	barrels.  They lean around the edge for a look.  They're
	directly behind the row of vehicle.

	They move, into the open, covering the ground between them and
	the jeeps.  Reaching them, Nick hits the dirt and wriggles
	under the first one.  Malcolm and Sarah stand lookout.

	UNDER THE JEEP,

	Nick pulls the bolt cutter from his back pocket.  He squirms
	along until he finds the jeep's fuel line --

	-- and he snips it.  He ducks out of the way just as the
	stream of fuel begins to pour into the dirt.

	MALCOLM AND SARAH

	move slowly down the line, standing watch as Nick crawls out
	from under the first jeep and proceeds to the second.  They
	hear another SNIP, then keep moving, to cover him as he moves
	to the third.

	From in the distance, Malcolm hears a sound, a faint,
	high-pitched SCREECHING.  He turns and looks to that
	direction.

	EXT. JUNGLE CLEARING - NIGHT

	It's the baby T-rex, still SCREENING.  Up in a nearby tree,
	ROLAND and AJAY have spread some broken branches crosswise to
	form a high hide of their own about ten feet off the ground.

	They wait.

	Roland raises his binoculars.  The light of the camp spills
	all the way out here, illuminating some of the jungle.  He
	scans it, searching for any sign of movement.

	EXT. HUNTERS' CAMP - NIGHT

	Back in the camp, Sarah, Malcolm, and Nick have finished with
	all of the vehicles except the badly battered one, which is
	parked some distance away, undergoing repairs.  The motor pool
	area is now a soggy lake of spilled gasoline.

	The saboteurs walk casually across the camp, unnoticed in the
	drunken revelry.  They pass several tents, the shadows of the
	partiers visible as they move inside.

	They continue across the camp and arrive at the other side --

	-- to face the caged animals.  The carinthosaur that was
	tranquilized earlier stands there dully, eyes heavy and
	glassy, still under the effects.  They pass a stegosaur, its
	row of fine bristling.

	And finally they reach the largest cage, which houses a
	triceratops the size of a pickup truck, Nick pulls out his
	trusty bolt cutters.  He looks at them, a glint in his eye.

				NICK
		Hang on.  We may encounter some
		turbulence.

	INT. HUNTERS' CAMP - NIGHT

	In one of the hunter tents, PETER LUDLOW leans over the
	satellite recon pictures of the island, planning the next
	day's assault with DIETER and DR. BURKE, their paleontologist.
	There are small wooden dinosaur models scattered around the
	photos, indicating where certain species can be found.

				BURKE
		If you're really interested in
		infants, we'll have better luck at
		the seaside, because the sands offer
		a cushioning surface where the egg
		clutches can -- can --

	He trails off.  A low RUMBLING sound can be heard outside, and
	the little wooden dinosaurs start shaking on the board.

	They look at each other.  The RUMBLING gets louder.  Outside,
	someone SHOUTS; on the board, the little dinosaurs start
	hopping and bouncing from the vibrations, the SHOUTS outside
	turn to SCREAMS, they turn and look at the back of the tent --

	-- and the triceratops bursts right through the canvas!

	EXT. CAMP - NIGHT

	HUNTERS go flying as the tent-covered triceratops, its horns
	tearing through the canvas, RUMBLES across the camp.  Men
	SHOUT in alarm, the triceratops BELLOWS in anger and
	confusion, chaos reigns.

	In the crush of PEOPLE running every which way, MALCOLM and
	SARAH are swept off in one direction while NICK is buffeted
	in another.  They SHOUT, but cannot be heard over the frey.

	The triceratops, blinded by the canvas shroud, stomps right
	through the fire in the middle of the camp AND THE TENT BURSTS
	INTO FLAME.

	Now really upset, the animal panics and lashes out in all
	directions, blasting through tents, demolishing and/or setting
	ablaze anything that gets in its way.  Its considerable
	hindquarters SLAM into a parked jeep, sending it rolling
	across the camp.

	The jeep flattens the largest tent and SLAMS down on its side.
	Its broken gas line SPRAYS gas over the ground, the gas hits
	one of the dozens of small blazes the triceratops has left in
	its wake, and the flame shoots up the ribbon of gas.

	The jeep explodes.

	OUT IN THE JUNGLE CLEARING,

	Roland and Ajay, up in the tree, leap to their feet as a
	fireball rises up from the camp in the distance.

				ROLAND
		What in God's -- !

	BACK IN THE CAMP,

	the rest of the newly-freed animals now storm through the
	camp.  The blue laser barriers bounce crazily and go out as
	the sending units are trampled underfoot by the fleeing
	animals.

	AT THE RIDGE OF CAMP,

	Nick takes advantage of the downed lasers to slip part the
	bordere of the camp and disappear into the jungle in one
	direction, while Malcolm and Sarah vanish in the other.

	The burning tent, which was the equipment tent, now detonates
	in a series of smaller EXPLOSIONS.

	Dieter and several others are knocked to the ground by the
	series of concessive blasts.  He drags himself up onto all
	fours, charred and bruised.  A burning tire rolls slowly past
	him, spinning to a stop --

	-- at ROLAND's feet.  Dieter looks up at him.

				ROLAND
		Last time I leave you in charge.

	OUT IN THE JUNGLE,

	Nick breaks out into the jungle clearing, the same one where
	Ajay and Roland had their blind.  He sees the baby tyrannosaur
	chained to the stake.

				NICK
		Sick bastards.

	He goes to the animal, which now BLEATS in pain, its broken
	leg hanging at an odd angle.  With one strong tug, Nick pulls
	the stake out of the ground.

	BACK IN THE CAMP,

	Roland surveys the destruction.  The fire has spread and
	several tents are now tongues of flame flapping in the air,
	the animals are gone or going, and their personnel are
	scattered and terrified.  PETER LUDLOW, breathless, face
	smeared with dirt, and smoke, staggers up to Roland.

				LUDLOW
		What in Christ's name is going on?!

				ROLAND
		Isn't it obvious?

	He holds up the sniped padlock from one of the animal cages.

				NICK (cont'd)
		We're not alone on this island.

							CUT TO:

	EXT. JUNGLE - NIGHT

	MALCOLM and SARAH race back up onto the ridge trail, where the
	green AAV is parked.  NICK bursts around from the other side
	of the car.

				SARAH
		Nick, thank God, we didn't know
		if --

	Malcolm opens the rear door.

				NICK
		Wait, don't ---

	With a piercing SHRIEK, the BABY TYRANNOSAUR, now in the back
	of the AAV, flings itself at the open doorway, jaws SNAPPING
	just short of Malcolm's nose.

				MALCOLM
		HOLY SHIT!!

	He SLAMS the door.

	DOWN IN THE HUNTERS' CAMP,

	Roland hears the commotion up on the ridge and looks up.

				ROLAND
		Do we have anyone up there?

	BACK UP ON THE RIDGE,

	Malcolm is confronting Nick.

				MALCOLM
		?!

 NICK 		It has a broken leg!

 MALCOLM 		So do it a favor and put it out of
		its misery!

 NICK 		No!  Get in the car before they hear 
		us!

	He runs around and leaps in the driver's seat.  Sarah slips
	into the passenger seat, quickly, leaving Malcolm no choice
	but the rear.

 CUT TO: 
 EXT. JUNGLE - NIGHT 
	The AAV SLAPS through the jungle foliage.  From inside the
	car, we can hear the baby tyrannosaur SCREAMING in anger.

 INT. AAV - NIGHT 
	The baby writhes on the base seat next to Malcolm, who has
	flattened himself against the door, as far away from the
	animal as possible.

 SARAH 		Ian, close the window, it's going to
		wake every predator in the jungle!

	Malcolm leans over the enraged animal and cranks up its
	window.  The tyrannosaur SLASHES with one of its powerful hind
	legs, ripping the flesh of his forearm.  He SHOUTS in pain.

	Outside, the listening jungle whizzes by.

 EXT. HIGH HIDE - NIGHT 
	Up in the high hide, EDDIE, DR. JUTTSON, and KELLY are
	standing watch, scanning the jungle for any sign of their
	returning comrades.

	Juttson yanks the night-vision binoculars away from his face
	as he spots the AAV, pulling up to the base camp a couple
	hundred yards away.

 JUTTSON 		There they are!

	They all turn and look, but Eddie furrows his brow, watching
	them pull the wounded animal from the back seat.

 EDDIE 		What is that they have with them?

 EXT. CAMP - NIGHT 
	SARAH and NICK carry the SCREECHING baby tyrannosaur in their
	arms, headed for the trailer.  MALCOLM, holding his bleeding
	arm, isn't far behind.

 INT. TRAILER - NIGHT 
	SARAH and NICK bring the SCREAMING infant to the metal dining
	table and hold it down.  MALCOLM is right behind them.

 MALCOLM 		This is exceedingly unwise.

	Sarah turns away from a drawer of medical supplies, holding a
	small syringe.  Her shirt is streaked with blood from the
	baby's injured leg.

 SARAH 		Too late to worry about that!  Hold
		him together, Nick!

	Nick tightens his grip on the animal and Sarah makes an
	injection into its thigh, over its loudly voiced objections.

 MALCOLM 		Just do whatever you have to do and
		get it out of here as quickly as
		possible.

	Sarah picks up a small ultrasound transducer and runs it over
	the animal's leg.  A green and white skeletal image appears on
	a monitor next to the table.

 SARAH 		Okay, there's the metatarsals --
		tibia, fibula -- there it is!  See
		it?  That's a fracture, just above
		the epiphysis.

	They peer closely at the monitor.

 NICK 		That little black line?

 SARAH 		That little black line means death
		for this infant.  The fibula won't
		heal straight, so the ankle joint
		can't pivot when he stands on his
		hind feet.  The baby won't be able to
		run, and probably can't even walk.
		It'll be crippled, and a predator
		will pick it off before it gets more
		than a few weeks old.

 MALCOLM 		Can you set up?

 SARAH 			(thinking)
		It has to be temporary, something
		that'll break apart and fall off as
		the animal grows...

 MALCOLM 		Think fast, Sarah.

	The tyrannosaur, still in pain, SHRIEKS again.

 EXT. HIGH HIDE - NIGHT 
	Through their binoculars, the rest of the group watches the
	trailer carefully.  Even inside, the animal's SCREECHES are
	clearly audible.  Kelly is getting scared.

 KELLY 		What are they doing?  Why don't
		they hurry?!

 EDDIE 		Give me the radio.

	From the trailer, the baby lets out a long, plaintive
 SHRIEK -- 
	One by one, Eddie, Kelly, and Juttson turn around and stare
	into the night jungle.

 INT. TRAILER - NIGHT 
	NICK holds the animal while SARAH fits an aluminum foil cuff
	around its injured leg and paints it with a coating of resin.
	MALCOLM, at the window, stares out anxiously.  The animal
	thrashes again.

 NICK 		Give it more morphine!

 SARAH 		We'll kill it with too much, we'll
		put it into respiratory arrest!  I'm
		almost done.  Damn it, I need
		another adhesive, something pliable I
		can --

	Her eyes fall on Nick.  She holds out her hand, urgently.

				SARAH (cont'd)
		Spit!

	He spits his bubblegum into the palm of her hand.  The baby
	rex CRIES OUT again.

 EXT. HIGH HIDE - NIGHT 
	From the swaying jungle, there is another answering ROAR.

	And this one's closer.

	In the high hide, the rest of the group stares, trembling.  In
	the distance, a flock of birds SHRIEKS and takes flight as the
	tops of some trees move, a whole section of forest suddenly
	coming alive, as if brushed by wind.

	But it's not the wind.

	They hear noises, THUDS in the jungle.  And then another
	section of forest trembles.  Closer.  Another flock of birds
	bursts out of the treetops and swarms past the high hide.

 KELLY 		What is it?

	Dr. Juttson puts an arm around Kelly, instinctively pulling
	her closer to him.  Eddie WHISPERS urgently into the
	walkie-talkie.

 EDDIE 		Sarah, come in!

 JUTTSON 		It's moving.  Fast.

 INT. TRAILER - NIGHT 
	There is a radio box mounted on the far wall of the trailer.
	The speaker BUZZES urgently with Eddie's VOICE.

				EDDIE (o.s.)
		Sarah, Malcolm, can you hear me?!

	On the table, Sarah is frantically molding Nick's bubblegum
	into place on the makeshift splint.  But the baby rex,
	regaining its strength, is thrashing again.

 SARAH 		Hold it down, Nick!

 NICK 		I'm trying!

				EDDIE (o.s.)
			(from the radio)
		Is anybody there?!

	Malcolm moves to answer the radio, but Sarah SHOUTS to him.

 SARAH 		Ian, get the bottle of amoxicillin
		and fill a syringe!  Quick injection
		of antibiotics and I can get it out
		of here!

	Forsaking the radio, Malcolm moves to the medicine drawer and
	comes up with what she wants.  Working fast, he draws twenty
	cc's of the pink liquid.

				EDDIE (o.s.)
			(still from the radio, now
			 desperate)
 SARAH OR IAN, ANSWER ME! 
	They ignore him as Sarah grabs the syringe and makes the
	injection.

				EDDIE (o.s.)
 WHATEVER YOU BROUGHT INTO THE TRAILER, GET IT OUT NOW! 
 EXT. HIGH HIDE - NIGHT 
	Eddie has given up on whispering as he clutches the radio
	desperately.

 EDDIE WE ESTIMATE TWO LARGE ADULTS HEADED IN YOUR DIRECTION! I REPEAT -- 
 INT. TRAILER - NIGHT 
	Nick, Sarah, and Malcolm spin around at hearing that terrible
	piece of information.

 MALCOLM 		Oh, Christ.

	He bolts over to the wall speaker and hits the button.

				MALCOLM (cont'd)
		Let me talk to Kelly, is she--

	A deafening ROAR sound from just outside the trailer,
	followed immediately by a CRASHING sound.  They whirl and look
	to the window, just in time to see --

	--  the AAV tumbling by, rolling on its side!

	There is another ROAR, and the baby, on the table, ROARS in
	response.  Outside the window, the head of a full-grown
	TYRANNOSAURUS REX lowers and peers inside.

	Malcolm, Sarah, and Nick all freeze in absolute terror.

	The rex outside GURGLES, making material cooing noises.  The
	baby rex, calm for the first time, GURGLES back.

	But across the trailer, in the opposite window, ANOTHER T-REX
 HEAD SUDDENLY APPEARS. 
	This one ROARS, deeply, a roar so low and loud it rattles
	anything in the trailer that isn't tied down.

 NICK 		What do they want?!

 MALCOLM 		What do you think they want?!

 SARAH 		That's impossible, they can't have
		the sensory equipment to track it all
		the way here!

 MALCOLM 		Current evidence seems to be to the
		contrary, wouldn't you say?!  GIVE IT
 TO THEM! 
	Nick, hands shaking, grabs the shoulder video camera he used
	earlier.  He whips out the cassette that's in there, hurls it
	into an open duffel bag with half a dozen others, SLAMS a
	fresh cassette in, and flicks the "ON" switch.

	Sarah and Malcolm, meanwhile, hurry to the other end of the
	trailer, carrying the baby rex.  Outside, the two adult rexes
	stay with them, walking in the same direction, watching them
	through the window.

 EXT. TRAILER - NIGHT 
	Seen from outside, the light inside the trailers clearly
	illuminates Sarah and Malcolm as they carry the bay rex.  The
	adult rexes tower over the trailer, twice as tall and nearly
	as long.  They walk slowly alongside it, hunched over,
	watching their infant.

 INT. TRAILER - NIGHT 
	At the door to the trailer, Sarah un-muzzles the frantic baby.

 SARAH 		Ready?

	Malcolm reaches for the door handle.

 NICK 		Wait!

	He dives down on the floor under them, pointing the video
	camera up at the door, getting the best shot.  Malcolm takes a
	breath, turns the knob, and throws open the door.

	Outside, the enormous rex heads pause for a moment, staring,
	surprised.

	Although terrified, Sarah actually starts to sing.

 SARAH 			(softly)
		Born free, as free as the wind blows.
		As free as the grass grows --

 MALCOLM 		Are you insane?!

 SARAH 		I swear to God, it works with lions
		sometimes!  There we are -- your baby
		is free --

	The baby, excited, wriggles free of them and lands on the
	ground outside.  Not wasting a second, Malcolm SLAMS the door
	shut.

	The three of them freeze, not daring to breath.  Outside, they
	can hear the SNUFFLING and COOING of the animals as they
	inspect their young --

	-- and then the soft THUD of their footsteps, growing fainter
	as they move away.

	From the wall, EDDIE'S VOICE comes over the radio, relieved.

 EDDIE 		They're going back into the jungle.

 CUT TO: 
 EXT. HIGH HIDE - NIGHT 
	EDDIE, JUTTSON, and KELLY sag back against the railings of the
	high hide.

 EDDIE 		Thank God.  Thank God.

	MALCOLM'S VOICE comes over the radio.

				MALCOLM (o.s.)
		Kelly?  Are you all right?

	She takes the radio, her voice shaky.

 KELLY 		Uh huh.

 CUT TO: 
 INT. TRAILER - NIGHT 
	MALCOLM is at the radio.

 MALCOLM 		Wait there.  I'll come up in a
		minute.  Don't move, understand?

				KELLY (o.s.)
		I understand.

	Malcolm slump against the wall of the trailer.  SARAH and
	NICK sit on the floor leaning against the opposite wall,
	completely drained.  Sarah pulls out her pocket recorder and
	speaks shakily into it.

 SARAH 		Note to Dr. Juttson -- Tyrannosaurus
		rex does nurture its young.

	They laugh weakly.

 NICK 		There's, uh -- there's an unwritten
		rule when a news crew is in a war
		zone.  You stop the van every two
		miles and decide whether or not to go
		on.  Whether or not you feel lucky.
		One "no" from anybody in the group
		and you turn around right there, no
		question asked, nobody embarrassed.
			(pause)
		Well?  Do we go on?
	Immediately:

 SARAH 		No.

 MALCOLM 		No.

 NICK 		No way.

	They all laugh.

 MALCOLM 		All right.  I'm satisfied with the
		evidence we have right now.
		I feel vindicated.  John Hammond will
		too.
			(to Sarah)
		Do you have enough to publish?

 SARAH 		They will come after me.  But I can
		collect some stool samples, for DNA
		with that, Nick's tapes, and the rest
		of you to back me up, it should stand
		when we get back.

 MALCOLM 			(getting up)
		Then the only thing left to do is
		make sure we do get back.  I'll
		call the mainland on the satellite
		phone and have them send the boat
		right now.  This expedition is over.

	He goes to the desk and picks up the heavy gray satellite
	phone that's resting in a battery pack.  The front panel
	lights up, a brilliant green.

	But from the wall speaker, the radio CRACKLES and EDDIE'S
	VOICE breaks through, soft and empty.

				EDDIE (o.s.)
		Oh, God.  I am so sorry.

	Malcolm and Sarah look at the speaker box.

 MALCOLM 		What the hell is he sorry f-

	A low RATTLE sneaks into the trailer.  Malcolm, Sarah, and
	Nick takes a step forward from the walls, looking around.  The
	RATTLE gets louder, the trailer shakes and vibrates,
	everything in it starts to BANG against the walls --

	-- and something huge SMASHES into the side of the trailer.

	They're all thrown against the far wall, there is an
	earsplitting CRACK of electricity, the entire trailer rocks
	and sparks a brilliant blue, and then everything goes black.

	The satellite phone flies out of Malcolm's hands and SMACKS
	against the wall.  It lands on the floor, its number pad still
	glowing green.

	Nick crawls over and looks out one of the windows.  Outside,
	the flank of one of the tyrannosaurs wipes past the window,
	revealing the second tyrannosaur, charging straight at the
	trailer!

 NICK HANG ON TO SOMETHING! 
	They hurl themselves at the nearest solid object and hang on
	for dear life.  The charging rex SLAM into the side of the
	trailer, which rocks up on one side, BANGS back  down, and is
	quickly RAMMED again by the furious animal.  This time the
	entire trailer rolls over, completely upside down.

	Sarah, Nick, and Malcolm let go of their precarious handholds
	and drop onto the ceiling.  The tables, chairs, lab equipment,
	everything that's bolted down clings to the floor above them;
	everything that isn't RAINS DOWN ON THEM.

	But the rexes aren't done.  The trailer JOLTS INTO MOTION,
	sliding forwards.

 SEEN FROM OUTSIDE, 
	the upside down trailer, which is the rear of the two
	trailers, slides along the muddy ground, pushing up earth in
	front of it.

 IN THE TRAILER, 
 SARAH 		They're pushing us!

	Malcolm, frantic, crawls up to a window to get a look outside.
	He looks down and sees a T-rex footprint in the earth outside
	as they move past it.

	He cranks his head to get a look at the direction in which
	they are being pushed.  His eyes widen at something he sees
	outside the window.

 MALCOLM 		Oh, God.

 SARAH 		What?!

 MALCOLM 		They're pushing us over the cliff.

	Sure enough, out the back window, we see a few more feet of
	muddy earth, and then nothing but inky black.  The three of
	them look at each other for a moment --

	-- and then crawl like hell toward the other end of the
	trailer.  The opposite end reaches the edge of the cliff and
	starts up to tip ever-so-slightly downward.  They reach the
	accordion-like connector and Malcolm crawls into it.

 THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD OF THE FRONT TRAILER, 
	which is right-side-up, Malcolm can see the two rexes hard at
	it, pushing the front end of the trailer.

 IN THE REAR TRAILER, 
	Nick has a pretty good grip at the top of the trailer, but
	Sarah can only cling to an air vent in the ceiling as stuff
	starts to roll and tumble past her, headed downhill.

	The angle increases, the trailer dips, and now stuff starts to
	freefall, right past her, some SMASHING her in the head.

	Malcolm, still in the connecting tube, grabs hold.  Sarah,
	starting to be pulled downward, paws at the refrigerator,
	getting a g rip on the handle.  The door, held by a safety
	latch, doesn't open.

	Below Sarah, debris falls to the rear window of the trailer.
	Through the CRACKING glass, we can see the surf, CRASHING five
	hundred feet below.

	The refrigerator bolts suddenly CRUNCH free of the wall.  The
	box strains on its power cord.

	Still clinging to the handle, Sarah swings wildly as it starts
	to come loose, swaying above her.

	The safety latch on the door gives, it swings open, and a
	shower of food BANGS off of her as gravity empties the
	contents.

	Sarah loses her grip and plummets through the now-vertical
	trailer.  She SCREAMS, covers her head, and SMASHES into the
	rear window.  The glass spiderwebs, but does not break.

 FIVE HUNDRED FEET BELOW, 
	an enormous wave POUNDS the rocky shore.  Above, Sarah is a
	tiny figure, sprawled out on the glass, held invisibly by the
	breaking window.

 IN THE TRAILER, 
	Nick SHOUTS to her.

 NICK SARAH! DON'T MOVE! 
	Sarah, stunned by the fall, blinks a few times, regaining her
	senses.  She looks down, at the crashing surf so far below.
	For a person with a fear of heights, this is a real drag.  As
	she stares, the rocks seem to move even farther away from her.
	She blanches; the world spins around her.

 SARAH 		OH... GOD ... please...

	Her breath fogs the cracked glass.  Slowly, she tries to get
	up, caaaaaarefully pulling herself up to her hands and knees.

	But as she puts pressures on her hands, the glass CRACKS even
	more, tiny spiderwebs shooting out around her fingers.  The
	whole glass panel sags, bowing out around the bottom of the
	trailer.

 UP ABOVE HER, 
	Malcolm looks down and sees the satellite phone precariously
	balanced on one leg of the kitchen table, its number pad still
	glowing green.  Nick is closest to it.

 MALCOLM 		Nick!  Grab the phone!

 SARAH 
	looks to her right, at a metal grating that runs along the
	wall of the trailer.  She shifts her weight, leaning on one
	hand to reach for the grating with the other.

 NICK 
	reaches for the satellite phone, its antenna just six inches
	from his outstretched fingers.

 SARAH 
	leans toward the metal grating, all hairline cracks shoot out
	around her pivot hand, shaking through the glass.  The
	splintered glass spread like a disease, it reaches the edge
	of the frame --

	-- and her hand CRACKS right through the glass.  She GASPS and
	pulls her hand out, but now she knees SMASH through the
	glass.

 NICK 
	has two fingers on the phone, but suddenly the whole trailer
	shudders and the heavy phone tips off the table leg and falls.

 NICK SARAH LOOK OUT! 
 SARAH 
	lunges for the metal grating and clings to it just as the
	heavy phone whizzes past her head and SMASHES into the glass,
	opening up a huge hole in the center of the back window.

 UNDERNEATH THE TRAILER, 
	glass, food, lab equipment, and the precious satellite phone
	fall out the broken window and SMASH on the rocks far below.

 IN THE CLEANING, 
	the trailers are split, like an L, the rear trailer hanging
	straight down, the forward one resting on the edge of the
	cliff.  Satisfied with their work, the T-rexes turn and lumber
	back into the jungle.

 IN THE TRAILER, 
	Sarah climbs carefully up the metal grating.  Above her, Nick
	lowers himself as far as he can, reaching for her.

 ON THE CLIFFSIDE, 
	we realize the hanging trailer halted its descent because one
	corner of it is wedged in the branches of a tree that grows
	out from the muddy cliff.

	But now those branches SPLINTER.

 IN THE TRAILER, 
	Malcolm sees the bellows, the connector between the trailers,
	stretch as the lower trailer JERKS and dips lower.

 BELOW HIM, 
	Sarah mountain-climbs through the trailer's kitchen,
	inadvertently kicking the faucet on as she struggles for
	purchase.

 OUTSIDE, 
	the tree branch SNAPS and the trailer jerks, stretching down
	again.  The bellows expands to its full length, stretching
	like a Slinky.

 INSIDE, 
	Nick knows he has to hurry.  He climbs down, bouncing off the
	built-in furniture, moving ever closer to Sarah.

	But Sarah slips and loses her grip, dropping a few feet.  She
	gabs hold of the sink, the flowing water spraying her face.

 EXT. JUNGLE - NIGHT 
	EDDIE CARR is in the driver's seat of the jeep, racing through
	the jungle as fast as he can.

 EDDIE 		Hang on -- hang on --

	The foliage SMACKS the windshield, then clears suddenly,
	revealing the endangered trailers on the cliffside ahead of
	him.  The jeep bounces through the deep footprints left by the
	rex and SKIDS to a halt.

 INT. TRAILER - NIGHT 
	Sarah loses her grip on the sink and falls, SMASHING into the
	frame of the half-broken rear window again.

 OUTSIDE, 
	Eddie bolts out of the car and runs to the front trailer.  He
	SHOUTS in through the broken front window.

 EDDIE HEY! HELLO?! 
 IN THE REAR TRAILER, 
	The three look up from their precarious positions.

 MALCOLM WE'RE IN HERE! GET SOME ROPE! 
 OUTSIDE, 
	Eddie turns and run back to the jeep.  He grabs a coil of
	rope, secures one end around a tree, and hurries back to the
	trailer.

 IN THE REAR TRAILER, 
	Eddie dashes over the mess in the front trailer and crawls out
	into the extended connector.  He peers over the edge, down
	into the second trailer, and tosses the rope.

 EDDIE 		Catch!

	The rope falls through the center of the trailer, its end
	dangling all the way out the smashed rear window.  But the
	trailer SHUDDERS, starting to move again.

 SARAH 		We're sliding!

 EDDIE 		Climbs up if you can!

 OUTSIDE, 
	Eddie runs out of the trailer in time to see the wheels
	dragging forward through the mud as the weight of the dangling
	trailer pulls the whole thing toward the edge of the cliff.

	He runs for the jeep and grabs hold of the power winch on the
	front grill.

	Behind him, the trailer rolls closer to the edge of the cliff.

	Eddie races back to the trailer, pulling out a length of cable
	behind him.  He runs up to the still-moving trailer, dives for
	its towing hook, the cable goes taut --

	-- and he falls short.  Just by six inches, but he's out of
	cable.

 EDDIE 		Damn it!

 INSIDE THE TRAILER, 
	Nick and Sarah are now together, clinging to the rope near the
	bottom of the trailer as it shifts around them.  Malcolm is
	further up, also clinging to the rope.

 OUTSIDE, 
	dirt and rocks pile up around the wheels and spill over the
	edge of the cliff.

	Eddie, back at the jeep, reels out more winch cable.  He turns
	and races back to the trailer just as gravity starts to LIFT
 THE FRONT END OFF THE GROUND! 
	Eddie dives again, and this time the cable hook CLICKS
	securely into the trailer's towing hook.  The trailer lurches
	toward the edge of the cliff and stops.

	But the jeep is jerked forward by the sudden pressure.

 IN THE TRAILER, 
	Malcolm clings to the rope in the middle of the trailer while
	Nick and Sarah try to struggle up it, but a sudden dig knocks
	them back, and their hands slide down the line.  SCREAMING,
	they slide through the trailer and their feet SMASH through
	the remains of the rear window.

	Regaining hold of the rope at the very end, the two of them
	now find themselves hanging out of the rear end of the trailer,
	dangling over the rocky shore below.

 IN THE JEEP, 
	Eddie hits the gas and the tires slosh in the mud, trying to
	get a grip.  The jeep pulls just enough to lower the front
	trailer back to earth.  But the tires spin, fighting to hold
	it there.

 ON THE CLIFFSIDE 
	Sarah and Nick dangle, desperate.

 IN THE JEEP 
	Eddie CHUNKS the shifter into four wheel drive and GUNS the
	engine.  As the motor ROARS, the sound is topped by another
	ROAR, in the distance.

	And this one's not a machine.  But Eddie doesn't hear it.  He
	GUNS the engine again.  There is another ROAR from the jungle.

	Eddie hears this one.  He darts a look at the side view
	mirror.  In it, he sees one of the TYRANNOSAURS bolt out of
	the jungle behind him.

	He GASPS and looks at the other side view.  In it, he sees the
	OTHER REX racing toward him.

	The tyrannosaurs STOMP forward to confront the ROARING jeep.
	The first rex bends over, CHOMPS down on the rear tire, and
	lifts the car to its teeth.

	But the spinning tire LINGS in the rex's mouth, burning it.
	Surprised by the fight in this foe, the rex loses its grip and
	the jeep BANGS back down onto the ground.

	Eddie, horrified, dives down under the steering wheel, to get
	away.  The gas pedal pops up --

	-- which makes the trailer pitch over the side of the cliff.

	But the rex STOMPS down on the jeep to prevent its escape.
	The trailers stop.

	Now the rexes lean down, over the jeep, and focus on Eddie,
	who still covers under the steering wheel.  The first rex
	SNAPS at him, hitting the steering column with it, leaving Eddie fully
	exposed.

	He SCREAMS and the second rex lashes in, seizing him in its
	teeth and tossing him out of the car.

	Eddie pops up into the air between the two rexes, both their
	heads flash at him at the same time, and in a split-second, he
	disappears between their teeth.

	Now completely ignored, the jeep rolls freely forward and the
	trailers drop over the edge of the cliff.

 INSIDE THE TRAILER, 
	Nick, Sarah and Malcolm cling to each other and the rope as
	the trailers fall around them.  The windows flash by as the
	trailers plummet, equipment BANGS and SCRAPES them, but they
	hold on to the rope, still tied to the tree, for dear life.

 ON THE CLIFFSIDE, 
	the trailers slide the rest of the way, exposing the three,
	who pop out the space where the front windshield was.
	Dangling from the rope, they look up and see the jeep, which
	is now rolling to the edge of the cliff.

	It falls, past them, and the whole mess EXPLODES on the rocks
	below.  Finally, it is silent, except for the sound of the
	surf.

 EXT. CLEARING - NIGHT 
	It's quiet up here too, the rexes nowhere to be seen.  At the
	cliff, a hand appears from over the edge.  Then another.
	SARAH pulls herself up, back onto solid ground, then comes
	NICK, then both of them reach over and help MALCOLM up over
	the edge.

	They collapse there, in the mud, completely exhausted.

 MALCOLM 			(softly)
		Eddie?

	He looks at the other two.  They glance around, then drop
	their heads.  Sarah hears a SOUND in the distance.

 SARAH 		Oh, God.  Now what?

	From the edge of the jungle, a cris-cross of flashlight beams
	moves toward them.  But rather than the three or four that
	would signify their own group, there are nearly twenty of
	them.

	The HUNTERS, PETER LUDLOW is in the lead, ROLAND and AJAY
	with him.  DIETER is there too, shepherding KELLY and DR.
	JUTTSON along in front of him.

	Malcolm sees Kelly, they call out to each other, and race
	together.  Malcolm falls to his knees and hugs her as tightly
	as he possibly can.

 MALCOLM 		Are you all right?!  Anything broken?

 KELLY 		I'm fine, I'm fine, I was scared, I
		thought you, are you okay?!

 MALCOLM 		I'm fine... I'm fine...

	Roland looks around, at the mess that was their base camp.

 ROLAND 			(mostly to himself)
		That's what you think.

 CUT TO: 
 EXT. RUINED BASE CAMP - NIGHT 
	In the ruins of the first team's base camp, the survivors of
	the night's two separate catastrophes stand face to face, in a
	heated argument.

	MALCOLM sits off to the side, still holding Kelly in his arms,
	just looking down at the ground and shaking his head.  There's
	something about his posture of defeat that is far more ominous
	than any of the hot tempers that are flaring.  LUDLOW rants to
	SARAH while DIETER looms menacingly over NICK.

 LUDLOW 		Trespassing, sabotage -- you could go
		to jail just for being here, did
		you know that?

 SARAH 		Don't start a legal argument with me,
		this island isn't your property, and
		neither are these animals!

	DR. JUTTSON has encountered DR. BURKE.

 JUTTSON 		What are you doing here, Burke?
		There's no TV cameras, what's the
		point?

 BURKE 		Dr. Juttson, you exist outside the
		classroom.  I am amazed.

	Dieter continues to get in Nick's face.

 NICK 		Are you looking for a problem?

 JUTTSON 			(an urgent whisper)
		Everyone, keep your voices down!

 ROLAND 		Back off, Dieter.

 JUTTSON 		Listen to me, by moving the baby
		rex into our camp, we changed the
		adults' perceived territory!

 LUDLOW 		Their what?

 SARAH 			(she understands)
		Oh, God.

 JUTTSON 		That's why they persisted in
		destroying the trailers, they now
		feel they have to defend this entire
		area!  We're not safe here.

 LUDLOW 			(of Sarah and Nick)
		Thanks to you people.

 SARAH 		Hey, we came here to observe, you
		came here to strip-mine the place!
		It's a looter mentality, all you care
		about is what you can take.

 ROLAND 		None of that matters.  Our
		communications equipment's been
		destroyed.  If your radio and
		satellite phone were in those
		trailers that went off the cliff, and
		I'm guessing by the look on his
		face --

	He points at Malcolm, who is still off to the side, sitting in
	stunned silence.  Malcolm looks up and nods, slowly.  The
	grimness of their situation sinks in.

				ROLAND (cont'd)
		We are stuck here, ladies and
		gentlemen.  And we're stuck together.

 CUT TO: 
 EXT. HUNTERS' CAMP - NIGHT 
	Back in the hunters' now-demolished camp, members of the two
	groups combine their diminished supplies.  They have half a
	dozen large plastic containers of water, thirty-seven
	containers of food, ranging from Ziploc bags to aluminum tins,
	a variety of weapons, mot of them borne on the hips or
	shoulders of the HUNTER team, the charred and scraggly
	remnants of several pieces of now-useless electrical
	equipment, a flare gun and several flares, somebody's tattered
	paperback ("Crime and Punishment"), a box of Hershey bars, and
	a cartoon of Marlboros.

	ROLAND supervises the assembling of the resources, which are
	displayed in front of him.  LUDLOW, NICK, SARAH, JUTTSON, and
	MALCOLM, who is still holding KELLY close to him, are with
	him.  They hold their discussion in quiet tones.

 ROLAND 		If we can't stay in the rex's
		territory, we have to move tonight.

 SARAH 		Move where?  Our boat's not coming
		for two days, your airlift is waiting
		for an order you have no way to
		send --

	Ludlow refers to the charred and trampled satellite
	photographs of the island, which are still mostly legible.

 LUDLOW 		There's a communication center, here,
		in the old worker village.  Hammond
		put in some kind of renewable power
		source replenishing.  It may still
		work.  If we could get there, we
		could send a radio call for the
		airlift.

 NICK 		How far is the village?

 LUDLOW 		I said if we could get there.

 NICK 		Well, how far is it?

 LUDLOW 		A day's walk, maybe more.  That's not
		the problem.

 ROLAND 		What is?

 LUDLOW 		The velociraptors.

	Malcolm looks up sharply.

				LUDLOW (cont'd)
		Our infrareds show their nesting
		sites are concentrated in the island
		interior.  That's why we planned on
		keeping to the outer rim.

	Malcolm shepherds Kelly away from the conversation and mutters
	something to her quietly in the background.

 DIETER 		What are velociraptors?

 JUTTSON 		Carnivores.  Pack hunters.  About six
		feet long, three or four hundred
		pounds, and very, very fast.

	Dieter brandishes his weapon.

 DIETER 		I think we can handle ourselves
		against them.

	Malcolm rejoins the conversation, alone.  He keeps his voice
	low.

 MALCOLM 		No.  I'm quite certain you can't.

 ROLAND 		Look, we have two choices.  We can
		hike back down to the lagoon, where
		we can sit for two days, in the open,
		next to a heavily used water source
		while we're waiting for your boat to
		arrive, or we can head for the
		village, where we might find some
		shelter and we can call for help.

 MALCOLM 		We'd never make it past the raptors.
		Trust me, I have some experience in
		this matter.

	Roland looks at him.

 ROLAND 		That may be.  But you weren't with
		me at the time.

	Malcolm just shakes his head, then turns and walks back to
	Kelly.  Roland turns to the others.

				ROLAND (cont'd)
		Load up.  Let's get this moveable
		feast underway.

 CUT TO: 
 EXT. ISLAND - NIGHT 
	The SURVIVORS set forth, marching through the jungle in a
	column.  Two HUNTERS strap on small shoulder-mounted
	servo-flashlights.  Wires run from the lights end in
	sensor pads which they stick to the skin of their necks.  Thus
	attached, when the hunters turn their heads, the servo-lights
	turn with them, illuminating whatever direction they look in.

	MALCOLM screws the barrel into the Lindstradt rifle and slings
	it over his shoulder as he marches, limping heavily.  He looks
	down at KELLY, who is marching alongside him.  His face shows
	the deepest of regret.  He shakes his head, cursing himself.

 MALCOLM 		Damn it.

	He looks away as Kelly looks up at him, questioning.  ROLAND
	falls into step with Malcolm and notices his limp.

 ROLAND 		You all right?

	Malcolm looks at him, then looks away without answering.

				ROLAND (cont'd)
		Wrong question?

 MALCOLM 		You ever heard of Gambler's Ruin?

 ROLAND 		What's that?

 MALCOLM 		A statistical phenomenon.  Says
		everything in the world goes in
		streaks.  It's real, you see it
		everywhere -- in weather, in river
		flooding, in baseball, in blackjack,
		in stock markets.  Once things go
		bad, they tend to stay bad.  Bad
		things cluster.  They go to hell
		together.

 ROLAND 		Feeling a bit blue, are we?

	Malcolm glances at Kelly, who has taken a slightly faster pace
	and is a few steps ahead of them now.

 MALCOLM 		Just -- flawed.  Very deeply flawed.

 ROLAND 		Why did you come here?

 MALCOLM 		So that others would know about this
		place?

 ROLAND 		Why should they?

 MALCOLM 		Because it exists.

 ROLAND 		It'll still exit if they go on not
		knowing, won't it?

 MALCOLM 		Yes.  And people will live in the
		absence of truth.

 ROLAND 		So the truth is more important to you
		than your life?

 MALCOLM 			(lowers is voice)
		I don't care about my life.  But if
		I'd ever thought for a second that
		she would be in danger --

	Roland follows his gaze forward, to Kelly, who's about ten
	yards ahead now.

 ROLAND 		She yours?

 AHEAD OF THEM, 
	Kelly can hear their voices, faint, but clear.  They are not
	as far away as they think they are.

				MALCOLM (o.s.)
		I'm afraid so.  I don't know what the
		hell I'm doing with kids.  I never
		should have had her.

	Kelly's face shows she heard that part.

 BEHIND HER, 
	Malcolm, unaware, continues with Roland.

				MALCOLM (cont'd)
		Why are you here?

 ROLAND 		Somewhere on this island, there
		exits the greatest predator that
		ever lived.  And the second greatest
		predator must take him down.

 MALCOLM 		But why?

 ROLAND 		You remember that guy, about twenty
		years ago, I forget his name, but he
		climbed Everest without any oxygen,
		came down almost dead.  And they
		asked him, "why did you go up there
		to die?"  And he said "I didn't.  I
		went up there to live."

 MALCOLM 			(nods)
		It's called self-testing.  But in
		your case, it sounds more like
		self-destruction.  A uniquely human
		characteristic.  In fact, human
		beings destroy things so well that I
		sometimes think that's our function.
		Maybe every few sons, some animal
		comes along that kills off the rest
		of the world, clears the decks, and
		lets evolution proceed to his next
		phase.  Maybe death and destruction
		are our job, maybe we're supposed
		to destroy ourselves and every other
		living thing that-

	Every person on the trail within earshot has stopped and is
	staring at Malcolm, shaken by his words.  Roland grabs Malcolm
	by the shirt collar and pulls him close, GROWLING in his ear.

 ROLAND 		Tell you what.  You can see whatever
		you want to, to me, but you will not
		spew any more nihilist rants at
		anyone else in the group.  I'm
		fighting panic, and you push the
		wrong buttons.  Understand?

	Malcolm just blinks.  This guy's in charge.

 CUT TO: 
 EXT. JUNGLE - DAWN 
	As a purple dawn dissolves the night sky, the SURVIVORS
	stagger on, exhausted.  Some are starting to tire, and there
	are spaces in the column.  MALCOLM's limp seems to be getting
	worse.  NICK reaches out, to take Malcolm's pack, but Malcolm
	swats his hand away.

	KELLY, still ahead of him, falls into step with SARAH.

 KELLY 		I don't think -- my dad doesn't
		think we're going to make it.

	Sarah looks at her.

 SARAH 		Your dad is wrong.  About a lot more
		than he knows.

	She puts an arm around her.  Kelly looks up at her, grateful.
	The long march continues.

 UP AT THE FRONT, 
	NICK catches up to ROLAND.

 NICK 		I think you should call a break.

 ROLAND 		Another half hour.

 NICK 		Some of them won't make another half
		hour.  We didn't come this far to
		start dropping in the middle of the
		jungle.  If you don't call it, I
		will.

	Roland looks at him, steely, then SHOUTS to the group.

 ROLAND FIVE MINUTES BREAK! 
	Immediately, the marchers drop where they stood, absolutely
	drained.

 AT THE REAR OF THE GROUP, 
	DRS. BURKE and JUTTSON are bickering.

 JUTTSON 		I can't believe you're still angry
		about that.

 BURKE 		You know, it's very easy to criticize
		the first person who studies
		something.

 JUTTSON 		No, it's easy to criticize sloppy
		research and hasty conclusions.

 NEARBY, 
	MALCOLM checks Nick's bag of videotapes, making sure they're
	still dry and undamaged.  Sarah comes up, watching him.

 SARAH 		You know, even if we do get those
		tapes back, people are going to say
		it's just another hoax.  Ian
		Malcolm's alien autopsy.

 MALCOLM 		Maybe.  Maybe not.

 SARAH 		Ian, they will misplace our evidence,
		shoot holes in our testimony, and say
		some special effects genius created
		the animals.  The only way people
		will ever believe that dinosaurs
		exist is if you dump a T-rex in the
		middle of times Square.

	He doesn't look at her.  She sits down beside her.

				SARAH (cont'd)
		There's something more important that
		you should be thinking about instead.

 BEHIND THEM, 
	Dr. Burke, furious, has stalked away from Juttson and sits
	down on a rock.  H does a double take, noticing something
	behind the rock.  He leans over and picks it up.

	It's an oval shape about eight inches long, with a pebbled
	exterior.  A dinosaur egg.

	Burke's face lights up, fascinated, and he carefully pieces
	the egg in a satchel he wears over one shoulder.

 AT THE REAR OF THE GROUP, 
	DIETER STARK pulls a wad of toilet paper from his pack, drops
	the pack on the ground, and turns to the Hunter nearest him --
	CARTER, his driver, who has his back turned.

 DIETER 		Wait here for me, would ya Carter?

	He steps off the path, into the jungle.  But as we come around
	the front of Carter, we see he's wearing a Walkman, the
	headphone BLARING tinnily in his ears.

	And he didn't hear a word.

 EXT. THICK OF THE JUNGLE - DAY 
	Only a few feet off the path, it's primary forest, the growth
	so thick that almost all sunlight is obscured.  DIETER claws
	forward until he finds a suitable spot to relieve himself.

	He clears away a bunch of leaves and debris and raises his
	hand to his belt buckle.  He freezes, hearing something we
	didn't.  He glances around, head darting, alert to any danger.

	Nothing there.  Just a few distant ANIMAL CALLS--

	-- and s SCURRYING around to his left.

	Dieter snaps his head in that direction.  At first, he sees
	nothing, but as he moves closer, gun extended in front of him,
	he sees a small dinosaur, a COMPSOGRATHUS, the same
	chicken-sized animal Cathy saw on the beach so long ago.

 DIETER 		It's not polite to --

	He pulls the steel rod out of a loop in his belt and touches
	it to the compy's back.  The blue bolt of electricity CRACKS
	and dances over the compy's body and it convulses in pain.

				DIETER (cont'd)
		-- sneak up on people.

	The wounded compsognathus scurries back into the jungle,
	whimpering.  Dieter clambers through the foliage ten or twelve
	paces, pushes aside two large palm fronds, and steps out
	into --

	-- more jungle.  He stops, puzzled, not sure if he went back
	or forward.

	He looks behind him.  He pauses, recalculating the path he
	took coming into the jungle, MUTTERING to himself, gesturing
	with his hands, retracing his steps.

	He adjusts his angle slightly to the right and heads off in
	that direction.  But after five or six hard-fought steps, he
	stops again.  Still nothing but jungle.

 DIETER HEY! CARTER! YELL OR SOMETHING, I GOT TURNED AROUND IN HERE! 
 ON THE TRAIL, 
	Dieter's cries are faint, but audible.  The only Marchers hear
	enough to hear him is CARTER, but the Walkman is blaring in
	his ears.

				DIETER (o.s.)
		...Carter... me?...

 IN THE JUNGLE, 
	Dieter hears that SCURRYING sound again, this time from his
	right.  He adjusts his angle again and SCRAPES through the
	foliage, moving faster and faster.

	Panicking, he ties to run, but the roots rise high out of the
	ground in the jungle, and he trips on one and falls flat on
	his face.

	He looks up.  The SCURRYING sound comes again, this time ten
	times louder than before, like a hundred feet coming at him.

	Dieter GASPS as something rushes in at him.

	He whirls to his right.  Whatever it is rushes in from that
	side as well.  And the left.  And behind him.  Dieter
	scrambles up into a sitting position --

	-- and laughs.  He is surrounded by at least forty compys now,
	the same as the one he wounded.

	For a long moment, they just stare at him.  Slowly, he brings
	his gun around, to point it at them.

 DIETER 		Easy -- wait -- one more sec-

	As one, the compys SHRIEK and hurl themselves forward,
	covering Dieter's body.  Their teeth and claws FLASH as they
	each try to grab a scrap of his flesh, tearing savagely.

	Dieter SCREAMS and flails, waving his arms and legs wildly.
	Some of the tiny animals lose their grip and sail off,
	SMASHING into trees or the ground.  But dozens of others hang
	on, and Dieter falls over backwards, now lying on his back on
	the ground.

	Hysterical, he fights like hell to get to his feet, SCREAMING,
	shaking, swatting the compys loose.  He spins, and that tactic
	seems to work, as the compys themselves begin to panic and
	drop off of him.  But he also loses his grip on his weapon,
	which goes flying, landing in the thick foliage five or six
	feet from him.

	Losing the attack, the compys turn and dart away en masse,
	stopping ten yards away from him.

	But they turn and regroup, facing him in a line, hopping up
	and down, CHIRPING and SHRIEKING.

	Dieter bounds into the foliage, looking for his gun.  But the
	compys follow him in and he's forced to flee, abandoning his
	lost weapon.

	Ten feet on, he stops, knowing he's screwed without the gun.
	He turns to face the pursuing compys.

	They stop.

	Dieter charges them, SHOUTING, waving his arms.

	The compys turn and run.  Dieter stops.

	The compys stop.  They stare back at him.  There is a moment
	of quiet, then they start to hop again, CHIRPING and
 SQUEALING. 
	Dieter, tired of this game, turns and runs away.

	The compys follow.

 EXT. JUNGLE - DAY 
	From the front of the convoy, ROLAND SHOUTS out.

 ROLAND 		Break's over, move on!

	The exhausted marchers drag themselves back to their feet and
	start to march again.  At the rear of the group, someone taps
	Carter, who is still listening to his music.  Carter gets up,
	hoists his backpack, and marches away.

	Behind him, Dieter's pack is left, forgotten, on the jungle
	trail.

 EXT. DEEP IN THE JUNGLE - DAY 
	DIETER stumbles along, exhausted.  He reaches the edge of a
	stream that runs under the foliage, and his feet slip on the
	stones.  He falls, into the rocky stream.

	Behind him, the army of compys pours over the little hill he
	just crested.  They disappear for a moment, down an incline --

	-- And then swarm over his body.  In a frenzy of splashing,
	Dieter shrugs them off and crawls away, through the stream.
	He gets to his feet but falls again, this time over a log.  A
	geyser of water splashes up in the air behind the log as
	Dieter drops out of sight.

	The compys leap over the log and disappear from view too,
	throwing up their own splashes of water.  SCREECHING,
	CHIRPING, and the sound of TEARING flesh mixes with Dieter's
 SCREAMS. 
	Now, as more compys leap over the log and splash into the
	water below, the geysers that shoot up into our field of view
	are pink.

	And then they're a deep, deep red.

 CUT TO: 
 EXT. JUNGLE - DAY 
	The group has stopped again.  Near the rear, SARAH, NICK,
	MALCOLM, LUDLOW, and ROLAND are in a tense conversation with
 CARTER. 
 ROLAND 		How long ago was this?

 CARTER 		Seven, eight minutes.

	Roland looks at them, thinking.  Finally:

 ROLAND 		Then he's dead.  Nobody tells the
		little girl.  Last thing we need is
		screaming hysterics.

	He turns and heads back to the front of the column.

 SARAH 		We have to send someone to look for
		him!

 ROLAND 		You go if you like, but we're not
		waiting for you.  MOVE IT OUT!!

	They look at each other, appalled, but the column starts to
	move.  Numbed, shocked, but left with no choice, they move on,
	one by one.

 CUT TO: 
 EXT. ISLAND RIDGE - DUSK 
	The column of MARCHERS has finally reached the island ridge,
	where they are silhouetted against the setting sun.  They're
	taking a break, sprawled out on rocks or over the ground.

	MALCOLM sits next to KELLY, who's sitting on a log.

 MALCOLM 		You okay?

	She doesn't look at him, just gets up and walks away, going to
	sit over next to SARAH.

	Malcolm watches, pained, but Sarah puts an arm around her and
	makes a "she's okay" gesture to Malcolm.

 AT THE RIDGE, 
	ROLAND steps up to the very edge and peers into the island
	interior.  From his vantage point, he's able to see all the
	way to the far side of the island, a rim of herd black cliff,
	miles away.  Between here and the cliffs there is nothing but
	gently undulating jungle.

	He refers to one of the satellite recon photos.

 ROLAND 		Looks like the worker village is down
		in there, about a mile and a half
		northeast from the base of these
		cliffs.

	MALCOLM is next to him.

 MALCOLM 		There must be a game trail, some kind
		of path that goes down there.

	Roland looks around at the exhausted MARCHERS.

 ROLAND 		They'll have to rest before we look
		for it.  Eat.  Sleep.  Two hours.
		Then we hit it.

 CUT TO: 
 EXT. CAMPSITE - NIGHT 
	The group has made camp in the jungle.  The mood is somber,
	most of the MARCHERS asleep already.  Three or four tents have
	been put up.

 IN ONE TENT, 
	KELLY sits quietly in a corner, her eyes wide, knees hugged up
	to his chest.  SARAH comes in.

 SARAH 		There you are.  Your dad's looking
		for you.

 KELLY 		I doubt that.

	Sarah takes off her outer shirt and hangs it over a bar to dry
	the broad red smear across its front.

 SARAH 		Oh, come on.  Go talk to him.

 KELLY 		Why?  He likes to be alone.  I can
		stay with you.

 IN THE CAMPSITE, 
	all is still.  The nocturnal jungle HOOTS and BUZZES around
	the sleeping marchers.

	In his tent, ROLAND abruptly sits up.  As if he heard
	something.  He looks out the open flap.  In the middle of the
	campsite, he sees AJAY stop in his tracks, head cocked.

	Roland gets up and goes outside, joining Ajay in the middle of
	the camp.

 ROLAND 		You hear something?

 AJAY 		No.  I feel something.

	Roland looks at him.  This isn't so good.  He looks out at the
	shifting jungle.  He notices a thin plume of smoke rising up
	over the trees just barely outside the edge of camp.

 ROLAND 		Oh, no.

 IN SARAH'S TENT, 
	Kelly and Sarah have laid down on top of sleeping bags, trying
	to get a few minutes' rest.  Sarah's shirt hangs over them,
	swaying in the gentle breeze coming through the open flap.

	As the shirt dangles there, swinging softly from side to side,
	we notice the broad red smear across the front.  Oh, that's
	right -- it's blood.

	The baby T-rex's blood.

 AT THE RIDGE OF CAMP, 
	the thin plume of smoke leads down to a tiny cooking fire
	that's been lit by DR. BURKE.

	He's set a small frying pan on top of it, and now he CRACKS
	the dinosaur egg he picked up earlier into the pan.

	Roland and Ajay run up behind him.

 ROLAND 			(hisses)
 ARE YOU OUT OF YOUR MIND?! 
	Burke leaps out of the way as Roland kicks dirt on the fire.

 BMBB! 
	Roland, Ajay, and Burke all freeze.  What was that?

 IN SARAH'S TENT, 
	Sarah and Kelly sit up.  They felt it too.

 BMBB! 
 AT THE COCKING FIRE, 
 ROLAND 		Get my weapon.

	Ajay turns and trots away a few steps, then stops cold,
	staring down at the ground.

 BMBB! 
	A recent rain has all left puddles scattered around the camp, and
	impact tremors now create ripples in the puddles -- concentric
	circles spreading to the outer edges.

 BMBB! 
 IN SARAH'S TENT, 
	Sarah and Kelly are frantically sealing up any opened food
	into Ziploc bags.

 BMBB! 
	Now they leap into Sarah's sleeping bag, to seal themselves,
	and draw the zipper up, all the way around.

	Outside, the silhouette of the rex's head passes by the tent.
	Sarah works faster, her fingers struggling to close the last
	few inches, but --

	-- the rex head pokes through the flap of the tent.  It
	sniffs, SNORTING the air in and out.  It looks around the
	tent.

	It sniffs Sarah's hanging shirt, the one that is stained with
	the blood of the baby tyrannosaur.  The adult tyrannosaur
	GURGLES again, COOING and cocking its head curiously.

	In the sleeping bag, Sarah and Kelly's eyes are barely
	visible, wide in panic.  The rex sniffs and nudges the bag,
	trying to figure out what this thing is.

	It rolls the bag over once, decides it's uninteresting, and
	then rises, straights up --

	-- taking the whole tent with it!  The stakes pop out of the
	ground as the tent rises high up into the air and flutters
	away, leaving the sleeping bag fully exposed on the ground
	beneath it.

 IN THE CAMPSITE, 
	the SECOND TYRANNOSAUR now steps out of the jungle, joining
	the first.  Panic hits the camp as the sleeping HUNTERS wake
	up.  Many of them start to run.

	Roland scrambles toward his tent, where he can see his weapon
	lying near the open flap.  As he draws close, an enormous
	T-rex foot stomps down on the tent, driving the rifle deep
	into the mud.

	Roland, weaponless, stands frozen, watching as the panicked
	Hunters flee in all directions.

 ROLAND FOR CHRIST'S SAKE, DON'T RUN! 
	But they ignore him, sweeping him up in the wave of flushed
	prey that pours across the campsite.  Some toss random and
	ill-aimed GUNSHOTS back at the rexes.

 ACROSS THE CAMPSITE, 
	NICK bursts out of the crowd, sees Kelly and Sarah struggling
	to get out of the sleeping bag, and grabs each by an arm.  He
	rips them to their feet and sweeps them off ahead of him, into
	the jungle.

 IN THE MIDDLE OF THE CROWD, 
	MALCOLM, blinking back sleep, stands a good head above the
	rest of the panicking crowd.  Frantically, he scans the group.

 MALCOLM KELLY? KEEEEELLLY?! 
	But he can't see her.

 AT THE EDGE OF CAMP, 
	the two rexes join forces, herding the fleeing Hunters into a
	narrow ravine.

 UP ON A ROCK RACE, 
	Roland scrambles up a steep rock face.  No way in hell he's
	going down  that ravine.  He sees Malcolm, still in the middle
	of the camp, start to head for the ravine.

 ROLAND MALCOLM! OVER HERE! 
	Malcolm runs over and hurls himself at the rock face,
	scrambling to climb up the smooth, steep boulders.

	Behind him, one of the rexes spots him and lunges across the
	camp toward him.

				ROLAND (cont'd)
 FASTER!! 
	Malcolm gives it everything he's got, clawing his way up the
	rock face --

	-- and rex draws closer and pounces at his legs --

	-- and Roland reaches down, grabs Malcolm by the hair and
	pulls him up, out of the rex's grasp.

	The rex falls short, but he's close enough that we can hear
	his teeth SNAP together, closing around nothing but air.  It
	turns, sees easier prey in the fleeing Hunters, and takes off
	after them.

	Malcolm lands on top of the rock ledge with a CRUNCH.  Roland
	unceremoniously dumps a fistful of hair in his lap.

 IN THE RAVINE, 
	Kelly, in the middle of the fleeing crowd with Sarah and Nick,
	hears her father screaming her name and looks up.  Malcolm and
	Roland are on the rock ridge above them, keeping pace.

 MALCOLM 			(shouting)
 KELLY, UP HERE! 
	But Kelly continues to flee, as the rexes are in the ravine
	now, and drawing closer to the group.

	Some Hunters try to leap up and scale the rocks, but the
	ravine is deepening, there's no way out.  One rex grabs hold
	of a Hunter in its teeth and hurls him against the rock face.

	The second rex picks up another Hunter and snaps its massive
	head left and right quickly, to break its victim's neck.  The
	Hunter goes flying forward and crashes into --

	-- CARTER, Dieter's driver, who stumbles and falls.  The rest
	of the fleeing humans run around or over him, but when the
	rex lifts its foot, we see Carter is actually stuck to the
	bottom of it --

	-- and when the animal takes its next step it CRUSHES him into
	the earth.

 UP ON TH ROCK FACE, 
	Malcolm is frantic.

 MALCOLM 		I gotta get down there!

 DOWN IN THE RAVINE, 
	it's obvious no one is going to outrun the rexes, and Nick
	knows it.  He bursts ahead of Sarah and Kelly and spots
	something off to his left.

	It's a waterfall, apparently right in front of a sheer rock
	face.  But there's something about the way the water is
	falling that tells him something.

 NICK SARAH KELLY COME HERE! 
	He grabs each of them and hauls them forward, running straight
	at the waterfall.  Apparently, he intends to jump right into
	the rock, and he's dragging them along with him.

 SARAH WHAT ARE YOU- 
 NICK JUMP! 
	The three of them spring right at the waterfall and disappear
	THROUGH the water.

	DR. BURKE, fleeing along with everyone else, is watching as
	they vanish.

 BEHIND THE WATERFALL, 
	there is a small recess, which is what Nick had hoped for.
	It's small, only four or five feet deep, but it's just enough
	for him, Sarah, and Kelly to cover behind the flowing water.
	Breathless, terrified, they can hear the mayhem outside.

 NICK 		Shhhh... shhhh...

	With an enormous SPLASH, something bursts through the
	cascading water and crashes into them.

	Dr. Burke.

 BURKE 		Get out of the way!

	He pulls his way up against the far wall, as far away from the
	water as he can.

	FOOOOM!  Now another shape bursts through the watery curtain.

	A Tyrannosaur head.  Burke gave away the hiding spot.

	The four SCREAM as the rex's jaws SNAP left and right,
	searching for them, falling just inches short.  They squeeze
	as far back against the wall as they can get.

	The rex can't quite get its head all the way through the
	opening --

	-- so it uses its tongue.  A long, dark blue shape slithers
	out of its mouth and touches the humans, trying to wrap around
	them, to pull them out of the cave.

	Burke, blind with panic, forces himself even further into the
	cave, which pushes Kelly further out.

 SARAH STOP IT YOU'RE PUSHED HER OUT STOP IT! 
	But Burke doesn't listen, throwing elbows to make room for
	himself.  His movements dislodge a portion of muddy earth, and
	a flurry of enormous cockroaches, eight or nine inches long
	each, pour out of the wall and swarm over his face and neck.

	Burke SCREAMS and instinctively leaps away, toward the flowing
	water.

	And that's all the leverage the rex needs.  It curls its
	tongue, wrapping Burke up in it and pulling him between its
	teeth.  SCREAMING hideously, he is dragged out, through the
	waterfall, and disappears.

	Sarah, Nick, and Kelly stare in horror as the white screen of
	water turn pink.

 UP ON THE ROCK FACE, 
	Malcolm and Roland see the rex walk away from the waterfall
	with Burke, leaving the hiding place unmolested.  Malcolm is
	nearly hysterical.

 ROLAND 		She's okay!  They'll stay in there,
		she's okay!

 IN A JUNGLE CLEARING, 
	routed Hunters emerge from the gully at the edge of he
	jungle.  Ahead of them, there is a large open plain covered by
	long "elephant" grass.

	AJAY, running along with them, stops abruptly at the edge of
	the grass, SHOUTING to the others.

 AWAY NO! DON'T GO INTO THE LONG GRASS! 
	Not in the frenzy, they ignore him.  Behind Ajay, the enormous
	shadows of the two pursuing tyrannosaurs stop as well, holding
	up at the edge of the jungle.

	Ajay, torn between a sense of responsibility and his better
	judgement, opts for the former and races into the grass after
	the other Hunters, waving his arms.

 UP ABOVE THEM, 
	Roland and Malcolm come out onto a rocky ledge that has a view
	of the plain below.  Roland can see the Hunters leaving trails
	as they plow through the grass.

 ROLAND 		Elephant grass!

 ON THE PLAIN, 
	the groups of Hunters wades into the middle of the long grass.
	One of them stops and turns, looking back at the jungle trees.

 HUNTER 		They gave up!  They're not chasing
		us!

	There are CHEERS, SIGHS OF relief.  In the distance, AJAY'S
	VOICE can be heard, faintly calling to them to come back.  Up
	on the rock in the distance, they can see Roland, waving his
	arms madly.

	But in the giddiness of their escape, they pay it no mind.
	They continue plowing into the high grass, anything to get
	further away from the tyrannosaurs.

 ABOUT FIFTY YARDS AWAY, 
	the tops of three animal heads rise up slowly, backlit by
	the full moon.  In the distance, the heads can seethe Hunter
	party.  The heads descend, back into the grass.

 BACK WITH THE HUNTERS, 
	they continue forward, oblivious.  Now behind them, four
	more heads rise up in the grass.  As then descend.

	On all sides of the Hunters, the grass ripples as animals move
	forward toward them, undetected, inexorable as torpedoes.

	And these torpedoes are on target.  One Hunter is suddenly
	dragged down, yanked silently below the surface of the tall
	grass.

	In his place, a long, lizard-like tail rises up as the animal
	drops its head to make the kill.

	Behind him, two more Hunters are taken down, and two more
	animal tails rise up in their place.  A Hunter ahead hears the
	RUSTLING and turns.  His face turns white as, behind him --

	-- a VELOCIRAPTOR springs out of the grass.

	Velociraptor runs upright on its powerfully muscled hind legs,
	the second tow of each foot bearing an extra-large curved
	claw, carried in a retracted position, with which it slashes
	on attack.

	Like now.  This raptor SNARLS and SLAMS into the body of the
	Hunter, taking him down.  A feeding frenzy ensues.  The
	Hunters run in all directions, but are pulled down and vanish
	into the twitching long grass.

	Another raptor enters from the right, leaps high into the air,
	past the full moon, SLAMS into the chest of more human prey,
	and takes him down, into the grass.

	Behind them, Ajay's face falls, defeated.  He looks around,
	realizing he too is now stranded in the middle of the long
	grass.

	Around him, four torpedo trails head straight for him.

	Ajay simply closes his eyes.

 UP ON THE ROCK, 
	Roland turns away from the carnage, pained.

 CUT TO: 
 EXT. RUINED CAMPSITE - NIGHT 
	SARAH, MALCOLM, KELLY, NICK, ROLAND, DR. JUTTSON, and PETER
	LUDLOW stand in the ruins of their campsite, their ranks
	decimated, spirits shattered.

	Roland is at the hole in the ground where his tent once was.
	He has pulled his .800 Nitro Express from the mud and more or
	less cleaned it, now he's checking the loads.

	Kelly, nearly catatonic with fear, clings to Sarah, and it
	doesn't look as if she'll ever let go.  Malcolm, who is on his
	knees picking through the wreckage of a tent, looks over at
	them, but Sarah waves him off -- "she's okay."

	Roland appears, standing over the group.  He looks at Malcolm,
	who has found the Lindstradt rifle, intact.

 ROLAND 		How many rounds did you find for that
		weapon?

 MALCOLM 		Four, counting the one in the
		chamber.

 ROLAND 		Don't let it out of your hands again.
			(to Sara, but looking at
			 Kelly)
		Can the kid walk?

 SARAH 		Ask her.

 ROLAND 		Can the kid walk?

 KELLY 		I can.  I can walk.

	While he addresses the group, Roland straps on one of the
	servo-lights, the shoulder-mounted flashlights that follow
	your gaze.

 ROLAND 		We're going to find a path down into
		the interior of the island.  Load up
		whatever you think you need, and I
		mean need.  If you can't carry it
		indefinitely, don't bring it.  We'll
		hit the worker village in a couple
		hours and be out of here before dawn.

 AT THE EDGE OF CAMP, 
	Roland bends over one of the three-toed footprints left by the
	rex.  Behind him, the rest of the group is packing up,
	slinging the remnants of their equipment over their shoulders.

	Roland bends over and SNIFFS the footprint.  It's filled with
	a liquid of some kind.

	He takes his canteen, dumps the remaining water into the
	ground, and plunges the canteen into the footprint, filling
	it.  Ludlow hovers over his shoulder.

 LUDLOW 		What is that?

 ROLAND 		Piss.

	Ludlow doesn't ask.

 NOW AT THE FIRE, 
	Roland stares down at the ashes of the cooking fire that led
	to such disaster.  He grabs a handful of the ash and shoves it
	in his pants pocket.

 CUT TO: 
 EXT. VALLEY OF DEATH - NIGHT 
	ROLAND and LUDLOW (who, along with Sarah and Malcolm, is also
	wearing a servo-light now) maneuver down a rugged hillside and
	come out in a flattened area.  Ludlow GASPS, looking ahead in
	wonderment.  MALCOLM breaks through the hillside's foliage a
	moment later.  He too stares in amazement.

	SARAH and KELLY come next, then NICK, then JUTTSON.  One by
	one, they all stop and stare.

 SARAH 		God help us.

	They're standing in a flat, sandy area lined with boulders at
	the sides.  The flat area stretches fifty yards from side to
	side and as far as they can see ahead.  But that's not what
	amazes them so.

	Everywhere, the sand is dotted with dinosaur skeletons.  Some
	are huge, apatosaurs, sixty feet from head to tail tip.
	Others are smaller, herbivores of many different kinds.  The
	more intact skeletons lie on their sides, their ribcages arcs
	of pale bone.  but just as many have been ripped apart, bits
	of carcass tossed in every direction.

 NICK 		I do not feel lucky.

 ROLAND 		Keep moving.

	They march on, tiny figures moving among the mountainous
	skeletons by the light of the full moon.  Roland notices one
	carcass in particular, a recent kill.  It's an enormous
	HADROSAUR with fresh bites taken out of it.

	He bends down, studying the soft earth around it for
	footprints.

 FURTHER ON, 
	Malcolm looks up, noticing the bony shapes around them, which
	fall in heavy shadows like cell bars, seem to be changing.

	He turns, and his servo-light shines on the bones.  But
	they're not bones any more at all, they're pipes, the animal
	graveyard now given over to the lifeless skeletons of manmade
	objects -- twisted, rotting machinery.

 LUDLOW 		We made it!

	They hurry over a small rise --

 EXT. WORKER VILLAGE - NIGHT 
	-- and find themselves at the edge of what was once Isla
	Sorna's worker village.  The size of a football field, the
	town is divided by a main street that's dotted on both sides
	by stores, residences, cafes, a gas station.  All the way at
	the far end is a large, blocky, four-story building.

	But the town is a mess.  The hurricane that hit here must have
	been ferocious, for everywhere things are smashed, broken,
	upended.  And the jungle has stepped into the breath, growing
	up, around, and over everything.  Huge root systems snake
	through the street, making it almost impassable.

 MALCOLM 		The jungle.  It's always ready to
		return.

	Roland catches up and looks at Ludlow.

 ROLAND 		Where's the power and radio setup?

 LUDLOW 		Operations building.  Far end of the
		street.

	A light rain falls as they start down the street, carefully,
	silently, Roland and Malcolm with their weapons at the ready.

	They pass the skeleton of a fallen water tower.  An empty gas
	station, its vine-snarled pumps now useless.  The only sound
	is the low mechanical HUM of the servo-lights as they follow
	the group's gazes obediently.

	Every few feet, the group encounters strange, grayish lumps
	that lies in random places in the middle of the street.
	Malcolm, curious, stops and taps one of them.  It's a rock-hard.
	Nick looks over his shoulder.

 NICK 		Lava?

 MALCOLM 		No.

 NICK 		What are they?

 MALCOLM 		I don't know.

	Finally, they reach the operation building, at the far end of
	the town.

 LUDLOW 		The radio rig is inside.  It runs
		directly from the geothermal
		generator, so power shouldn't be a
		problem.

 ROLAND 		Good.

	He pulls out his canteen.  Ludlow watches as he screws the top
	off, moves toward the building, and starts splashing the
	contents on the outside of it.

	The rest of the group just stares at him.

 MALCOLM 		What's he got in there?

 LUDLOW 		Piss.

 SARAH 		What?

 LUDLOW 		Don't ask me.  The guy's completely
		out to lunch.

 NICK 		What in God's name would he want
		with-

	Roland rejoins them.

 ROLAND 		Tyrannosaur urine.  I don't want
		anything to do with it, and neither
		does any other animal on this island.
		This building is now demarcated as
		the rex's territory.  As long as you 
		stay in that building, you'll all be
		safe until the helicopter comes.

	He drops his pack, swings his gun off his shoulder, and checks
	the load.  Dr. Juttson looks fearful.

 JUTTSON 		Where are you going?

 ROLAND 		After the rex.  I saw a fresh kill
		back in the valley with tyrannosaur
		tracks all around it.  If I'm not
		back in time, don't wait for me.

 SARAH 		You've got to be kidding.

 ROLAND 		Runs against my nature to hole up in
		a cave and wait.

 LUDLOW 		Do you think the rex might have the
		infant with it?

 ROLAND 		Possible.

	Ludlow takes off his hat and turns to Nick.

 LUDLOW 		You know how to work a radio, don't
		you?

 SARAH 		You're going too?

 LUDLOW 		I lost everything I came after on
		this trip, but one T-rex in one theme
		park could single-handedly bail
		InGen out of Chapter 11.

	He takes a slip of paper from the brim of his hat and hands it
	to Nick.

				LUDLOW (cont'd)
		This is the broadcast frequency.  ID
		yourself as "Harvest Leader."  You
		know what to tell 'em.

 MALCOLM 		You gentlemen feel you have to do
		this now?

 ROLAND 		Now's the perfect time.  The animal
		just fed, so it won't stalk us for
		food.  Predators don't hurt when
		they're not hungry.

	Ludlow double checks the clip on his semi-automatic rifle --

 NICK 		No.

	-- and SMACKS it back into the belly of the gun.

				NICK (cont'd)
		Only humans do.

 CUT TO: 
 INT. COMMUNICATIONS ROOM - NIGHT 
	The console of a sophisticated radio set-up glows brightly,
	all green, red, and yellow.  NICK tunes the dial to a specific
	frequency.  The radio WHINES and HISSES tuning in.

 NICK 			(into microphone)
		CQ, CQ.  This is InGen Operation
		Harvest Leader to Harvest Base.  Come
		in, please.

	The remaining SURVIVORS, minus Ludlow and Roland, shine their
	flashlights around the dusty, vine-hung interior of the
	communications room.  On the wall a row of chrome letters says
	"We Make The Future,"  but the words are obscured by a tangle
	of vines.  Mushrooms and fungi sprout from the carpet.

	On one wall, there is a mural of what the completed Jurassic
	Park would have looked like.  Big hotels, Ford Explorers with
	tourists leaning out the windows taking pictures, big crowds
	at the fences around the animal exhibits.  But none of it came
	true, and now even the mural is runny and dust-covered.

	There is a pause, filed only with radio static.  Sarah looks
	at Nick tensely, waiting.  Finally, a VOICE comes over the
	radio, clean as can be.

				VOICE (o.s.)
		Go ahead, Harvest Leader.

	They all breath a sign of relief.

 CUT TO: 
 EXT. MAIN STREET - NIGHT 
	With Roland and Ludlow gone on the hunt and the rest of the
	group inside the operations building, main street stands
	deserted and silent.

	Nearly deserted, anyway.  Moonlight shadows lengthen at one
	end of the street --

	-- and FIVE VELOCIRAPTORS STROLL INTO TOWN.

 CUT TO: 
 EXT. VALLEY OF DEATH - NIGHT 
	ROLAND AND LUDLOW are back in the valley of death, standing
	amid the giant skeletons of long-dead animals.  Roland bends
	down, checking the carcass of the freshly-chewed HADROSAUR he
	saw earlier.

	A set of giant three-toed rex tracks leads away from the
	carcass, down the stream bed.  Roland follows them.  Ludlow
	follows Roland.

	As they near a bend in the stream, Roland looks down, at the
	surface of the water.  A pattern of ripples moves toward them,
	washing over their ankles.  Roland follows the ripples with
	his eyes.  From up head, around the bend, he can hear the
	sound of an animal eating and drinking.  A very large animal.

	He reaches into his pocket and pulls out a  pinch of the ashes
	from the cooking fire that he scooped up earlier and releases
	that on the wind.  They float there for a second, suspended,
	then blow back at him.

 LUDLOW 		We're downwind.  Good.

	Roland darts a contemptuous look at him.  He puts a finger to
	his lips, gesturing for silence, then steps up, onto the
	shore.  Ludlow follows.

	They creep forward, toward the sounds.  They round the bend
	and Roland hits his belly, edging up over a small rise.

	Over the rise, he sees the TYRANNOSAUR, about a hundred yards
	ahead.  It's stooped over the stream bed, drinking.  Like a
	bird, it dips its head in the water and then straightens up,
	to let the water fall down its throat.  A dozen COMPYS are at
	the water as well, drinking.

	Roland gently FLICKS the safety on his gun to "off."

	Ludlow edges toward the cover of a low-hanging branch.  As he
	puts his weight on one knee, it presses down hard on the
	middle of a small stick, which CRACKS in half.  Roland turns,
	eyes blazing.

	Out in the open, the tyrannosaur snaps its head sharply as
	well, staring in the direction of the sound.  But since
	Roland's own head is turned, he doesn't see the dinosaur's
	reaction.  Roland holds a warning finger out to Ludlow.

	Roland turns his head back.  The tyrannosaur is gone.

 FURTHER ON, 
	the trail of three-toed tyrannosaur footprints stops abruptly.
	Roland stops too, gesturing for Ludlow to freeze behind him.
	Roland glances both ways, looking for any sign of the track.

	To the right, the ground gives way to hard black volcanic rock.
	A short distance behind them, the rock is solid, a massive,
	green, pebbled boulder ten feet high.  Roland frowns and
	WHISPERS in Ludlow's ear again.

 ROLAND 		We took to the rock.

 LUDLOW 		Why?

	In front of Roland, a palm frond sways gently in the night
	breeze.  Roland's eyes widen.  He pulls out another pinch of
	campfire ash and releases it on the wind.

	This time, the ash blows off, straight away from him.

 ROLAND 		Wind shift.

	They freeze, terrified.  Behind them, the enormous green
	pebbled boulder --

	-- opens an eye.

	That's no boulder, that's the MALE TYRANNOSAUR, standing
	rock-solid still, its natural camouflage blending into the
	surrounding foliage perfectly.  Very slowly and almost
	silently, the rex brings its head all the way around until it
	is staring directly down at them from about ten feet away.

	Roland and Ludlow stand frozen, their back to the rex,
	unaware of its presence.

	Until it exhales.  The soft SNORT of its breath isn't quite
	audible, but it brushes the hair on the backs of their necks
	ever so slightly.

	Their hearts drop into their stomachs.  Ludlow speaks, his
	voice a queasy HISS.

 LUDLOW 		It's... behind... us.

 ROLAND 			(the very softest whisper)
		It's just fed.  It won't attack unless
		it's threatened.  Don't move.

	As the rex silently cocks its head, sizing up the danger from
	these intruders, it breathes again.  A few strands of Ludlow's
	hair flap in the exhalation.  He closes his eyes, near tears.

	He can't take it.  His eyes dart, glancing down at the weapon
	he holds in his hands.  Unfortunately, it's extended in front
	of him, away from the rex.

	He risks another HISS.

 LUDLOW 		If I don't move, I can't shoot it.

 ROLAND 		Let it go, Peter.  The animal won.

	Behind them, the rex appears satisfied.  It starts to swing
	its massive head around, back toward the jungle.  It lifts one
	great leg and takes a step into the trees.

	Roland signs and closes his eyes, relieved.

	But Ludlow seizes the opportunity.  He whips his weapon around
	and drops to one knee.

				ROLAND (cont'd)
 NO! 
	The rex is infinitely quicker.  Ludlow just has time to
	squeeze off a short burst of semi-automatic gunfire when the
	animal whirls, takes one elegant step forward, and POUNCES.

	Ludlow's bullets rip harmlessly through the foliage between
	the rex's legs as its big head snaps forward and comes down,
	jaws wide.  They close around Ludlow's body, lift his straight
	up into the air, and toss him once, readjusting their grip so
	it is firmly around his midsection.

	The whole combination of movements takes but half a second.
	By the time Roland turns around, the animal has pivoted and
	darted back into the jungle, carrying Ludlow, still SCREAMING
	and writhing in its mouth.

	Roland raises his gun, to draw a bead on the animal, but
	through the shivering trees, he can only see that the
	tyrannosaur is gone.

 CUT TO: 
 INT. COMMUNICATIONS ROOM - NIGHT 
	MALCOLM SARAH, NICK, KELLY, and DR. JUTTSON wait nervously in
	the communications room.  An empty can of Dr. Pepper sitting
	on one of the countertops begins to RATTLE.  They look over at
	it, confused, as the lightweight aluminum can CHATTERS on the
	formica counter.

	Other objects in the lab begin to rattle too.  Glass jars
	CLANK against one another, books start to drop off the
	shelves, a stool shudders across the floor.

 KELLY 		What's going on?!

	Above them, the rotting wooden roof of the building starts to
	actually tear away, chunks of moldy timber flying up into
	the night.  They look up, a deafening ROAR fills the room --

	-- and a helicopter's searchlight floods in!

	As the chopper dips lower, looking for a place to land, the
	violent prop wash rips away huge chunks of the roof over their
	heads.

 INT. HELICOPTER - NIGHT 
	Up above the operations building, the helicopter circles.  The
	roof of the building is all arches and rotten timber,
	impossible to land open.

	Below, the PILOTS see the SURVIVORS through the torn roof of
	the building.  They wave frantically, their flashlight beams
	piercing the night sky.

 PILOT 		There they are!

	The Co-Pilot scans the street below, but it's choked with
	overturned cars and fallen trees.

 CO-PILOT 		No LZ in the street, too much debris!

 PILOT 		Check the other buildings!

	The Co-Pilot nods and they peel off, swooping over the rest of
	the village.

	At the far end of the street, the Co-Pilot brings the
	searchlight to bear on the large, flat roof of a three story
	building.

	The Pilot gives him a thumbs-up.

 EXT. MAIN STREET - NIGHT 
	MALCOLM, SARAH, KELLY, NICK and finally DR. JUTTSON run out
	the front of the operations building.  At the end of the
	street, they can see the helicopter as it descends slowly over
	the building, to land on its roof.

 MALCOLM 		There it is!

	Happily, the group double-times it down the street, headed for
	the chopper.  Again, those strange rock formations are
	everywhere.  Some seem to be on the sides of buildings, as if
	they once dripped there and then turned to stone.

	This time Sarah pauses at one that is dripping over to the side
	of a car like solidified lava.  Her face falls as a thought
	occurs to her.

 SARAH 		Ian.  It's guano.

 MALCOLM 		What?

 SARAH 		These formations.  They're dried --

 MALCOLM 		Birdshit?

	A VELOCIRAPTORS jumps onto a fallen tree trunk behind them.

	They don't see it.

 NICK 		Who cares?  Let's go!

	Unaware of the raptor's presence, they resume their trot
	toward the helicopter.  Behind them, the raptor crouches and
	SNARLS, but the sound is lost under the WHINE of the
	helicopter's engines.  It springs, covering the distance
	between them quickly.

	The animal SLAMS into JUTTSON, the last person in the group,
	and takes him down.  Juttson is thrown forward, into the
	others, who fall like dominoes.

	Juttson SCREAMS, his voice an unnatural, high-pitched SQUEAL,
	as the raptor flips him over and lowers its jaws into him.

	Sarah looks up, panicked.  Her eyes widen at the sight of a
	SECOND RAPTOR, this one running straight at hr at top speed.
	She buries her face in the dirt, covering her head with her
	hands --

	-- and the raptor's foot SLAMS into the ground between her
	legs as it bounds over her and dives onto Juttson, joining the
	first raptor in the kill.

	Panicked, the group scatters in all directions.  Kelly jumps
	up and scrambles into the middle of the street, where she hits
	the dirt and crawls under a fallen shed in the middle of the
	road.

	Malcolm rolls over to the space where Kelly was, but she's
	gone now.  He looks around frantically.

 MALCOLM 		Kelly?!  KELLY?!

	Sarah rolls onto her feet and sprints toward the building
	nearest her.

	Behind her, a THIRD RAPTOR gives chase, bounding after her
	with horrifying speed.  Sarah runs flat-out, but her speed is
	nothing compared to the raptor's, and it gains on her rapidly.

	The walls of a structure of some kind close in around Sarah,
	and as she leaps across a leather seat and SLAMS a door behind
	her, we realize she's crawled into the back seat of an
	abandoned car.

	But the car door is thin protection against the charging
	raptor, which SLAMS into the window, head first.  The window
	spinderwebs, but does not yield.  The raptor crumples to the
	ground.

	Sarah looks up, through a three inch hole in the middle of the
	web.  The raptor leaps back to its feet and plunges its nose
	into the tiny hole, thrashing, widening it.

	Sarah SCREAMS and the animal forces its entire head through
	the hole, SNAPPING its jaws just short of her face.

	She hurls herself over the seat and into the front as the
	animal penetrates even further into the car, but its torso
	will not fit through the window opening.  It pulls away.

	In the front seat, Sarah gets some very bad news.

	There's no windshield.

	The raptor springs up onto the hood, its claws CLATTERING on
	the sheet metal, and tosses its body through the opening --

	-- just as Sarah hurls herself out the door.  While the raptor
	struggles to right itself in the front seat, Sarah runs to the
	nearest building, ducks inside, and SLAMS the heavy wooden
	door.

 CUT TO: 
 EXT. GAS STATION - NIGHT 
	MALCOLM races between the idled gas pumps and into the gas
	station building, closing the door behind him.  A moment
	later, a raptor bounds after him, SLAMMING into the door.

	Meeting resistance, it bounces off, notices the plate glass
	window next to the door, and pounces at that.  The window
	SHATTERS and the raptor clings to the ledge, staring inside,
	its tail hanging out.

	Just as it gets inside, Malcolm opens the door and comes back
	out, keeping the place of wall between them.  He pulls the
	Lindstradt rifle off his back and tries to take aim --

	-- but the raptor whirls and springs, forcing him back inside,
	through the door again.

	Willing to play along, the raptor turns and jumps through the
	window again.

 INT. GAS STATION - NIGHT 
	Balancing on the window frame, the raptor HISSES and crouches,
	ready to spring at Malcolm.

	Malcolm takes cover behind the door, which is hanging open
	between them.  He raises the rifle.

	Th raptor springs into the door, BLASTING it off its hinges,
	knocking Malcolm right through a window behind him.

	But the door SMACKS up against the wall, covering the window,
	preventing the raptor from following Malcolm out that way.

	For the moment.

 EXT. GAS STATION - NIGHT 
	Malcolm flies through the window and CRUNCHES to the ground.
	He GROANS  in agony and rolls off his bad leg, which is twisted
	unnaturally beneath him, and claws in the mud for the gun.

	ROUGH HANDS reach down, grab him by the shirt, and haul him to
	his feet.  It's NICK.  He drags Malcolm away, but in the
	commotion Nick's duffel slips off his shoulder and lands in
	the street, spilling some of the precious videotapes.

	Malcolm scoops them up.

 NICK 		Come on!

 MALCOLM 		Where's Kelly?

 NICK 		She's with Sarah!

	They race off, down the street.

 CUT TO: 
 INT. KILN HOUSE - NIGHT 
	High above SARAH, we see she is standing alone in a three
	story kiln house, a windowless shed used for firing pottery
	and other construction projects.  Catwalks lined with heavy
	chains hang above her, and onto the floor below, she turns in
	circles, wondering what to do now.

	From outside the kiln house, she hears SCRATCHING, digging
	sounds.  From the other side of the door comes an animal
	SNORT, and a small puff of dust and dirt billows up through
	the crack along the ground.

 ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE DOOR, 
	the claws of one of the raptors dig furiously, trying to
	tunnel underneath.

 INSIDE, 
	Sarah runs to the opposite wall, falls to her knees, and
	starts digging a tunnel of her own, clawing frantically at the
	ganging tools always and CLANKS as it tears at the earth below
	it.

	Sarah digs faster.  So does the raptor.

	With about eight inches of space under the wall, Sarah grabs
	hold of the bottom of one of the plans and pries it up as
	hard as she can.  It snaps off with a loud CRACK.

	At the door, the raptor stops digging.  It's silent for a
	moment.

	Sarah has a good foot and a half of space under her wall now.
	She starts to lower her body into it --

 -- JUST AS THE RAPTOR'S CLAWS FLASH THROUGH FROM THE OTHER SIDE! 
	Sarah falls back, SCREAMING, leaps to her feet, and jumps up,
	grabbing hold of one of the catwalks above.  She starts to
	climb, up, anywhere up, as the RAPTOR now squirms and thrashes
	its way inside, coming in through her hole.

	Sarah climbs, hauling herself up, leaping from one catwalk to
	another.

	The raptor leaps up onto a catwalk as well and follows her.

 EXT. KILM HOUSE - NIGHT 
	A window in the slanted roof of the kiln house EXPLODES in a
	shower of glass as SARAH kicks through it and climbs outside.

 CUT TO: 
 EXT. MAIN STREET - NIGHT 
	Nick drags a badly limping MALCOLM down the main street.  They
	can see helicopter at the far end, engine ROARING and
	searchlight playing over them as they draw closer.  They
	approach a rusted, abandoned pickup in the middle of the
	street --

	-- and a RAPTOR leaps on top of it.  Its claws CLACK on the
	roof as it goes into its pre-attack crouch.

	They don't stick around to negotiate.  Nick hauls Malcolm off
	into the nearest building.

 INT. WORKER HOTEL - NIGHT 
	NICK and MALCOLM hurry inside and SLAM the door behind them.
	They're standing in the lobby of a hotel of some kind,
	probably used for overnight guests and day workers who had to
	spend the night.  The room and staircase wind around a large,
	open-aired central area four stories tall.  They SHOUT at each
	other, frantic.

 MALCOLM 		We can't stay in here!

 NICK 		We're sure as hell not going back out
		there"

 MALCOLM 		This is single-wall construction!
		It's just a shack!

 NICK 		It'll hold!

 MALCOLM 		For sixty seconds, maybe!  Look at
		this!
			(RAPS on the door with his
			 knuckles)
		You could-

	With a CRASH, the wood SPRINTERS around the lock and the door
	swings open violently.  Malcolm is thrown aside, landing hard
	on the floor.

	A VELOCIRAPTOR stands HISSING in the doorway.  Nick throws his
	weight against the door.  SLAMMING it hard against the raptor.

	Malcolm rolls over and paws the gun off his back.

	SLAM!  The raptor charges the door again, this time BLASTING
	it off its hinges, knocking Nick to the floor beneath it.  The
	raptor turns and SNARLS at Malcolm.

	Malcolm swings the gun around --

	-- the raptor lunges at him --

	-- Malcolm's finger closes on the trigger --

	-- and the raptor lands on top of him.

	The weight of the animal CRUSHES him into the floor, but the
	gun barrel now stands between them.  The raptor CHOMPS down
	hard on the barrel, its teeth GRINDING on the metal, and SNAPS
	its head, to tear it from Malcolm's hands.

	Malcolm pulls the trigger.

	The raptor's eyes pop wide as the dart SLAMS into the back of
	its throat.  It makes a GURGLING sound, then convulses
	violently and rolls off of Malcolm, yanking the gun from his
	hands as it falls and dies.

	Nick scrambles out from under the door.  Malcolm tries to
	wrench the gun from the raptor's clenched jaws, but it won't
	budge.

 NICK 			(helping him out)
		Head for the roof!

 MALCOLM 		I have to find Kelly!

 NICK 		I think she's with Sarah!

 MALCOLM DAMN IT, BE SURE!! 
 CUT TO: 
 EXT. MAIN STREET - NIGHT 
	KELLY remains huddled under the fallen shed, trembling with
	fear.  She holds her breath and freezes, as just outside, only
	two feet from where she's hiding --

	-- a RAPTOR'S FEET pick their way past her, down the middle of
	the street.

	Kelly closes her eyes and suppresses a scream.

 CUT TO: 
 EXT. ROOFTOP - NIGHT 
	NICK and MALCOLM burst onto the roof of the now-burning
	hotel and SLAM the door behind them.  The helicopter is now
	only three rooftops away.  They turn and head for it, Nick in
	the lead, but there's an eight foot gap between the buildings.

 MALCOLM 		It's too wide!

	Nick looks around, desperate.  A fallen power pole leans
	against the building they're standing on, its lines gone
	slack.

 NICK 		Help me push this!

	Malcolm understands.  He and Nick throw a shoulder into the
	pole and give it a mighty push, tipping it over in the other
	direction.  One good hard shove and it falls to the far
	building, THUDDING against it solidly.

	Its power lines are not taut, a lifeline from this rooftop to
	the next.  Nick grabs hold and starts to pull himself across
	the gap, hand over hand.

	Behind them, the door of the building SPLINTERS and CRASHES
	open as a raptor throws all its weight into it.  Malcolm leaps
	onto the power line without hesitation and starts pulling
	himself across.

	But even with the door wide open, the raptor on the other side
	hesitates.  It SNARLS and backs away, refusing to come out
	onto the roof.

 ON THE OTHER ROOFTOP, 
	Malcolm lands next to Nick on the second rooftop.  They look
	back at the frightened animal, which takes tow steps out onto
	the roof, SNARLS, and backs into the doorway again.

 NICK 		It's afraid to come onto the roof!

	Malcolm looks around, at the rooftop.  Strange bits of scrap
	and debris seem to have been arranged there, in an odd,
	concentric pattern.

 MALCOLM 		Something's wrong.

 NICK 		Look!  Sarah!

	He points to the roof of the kilm house, in the distance.
	Malcolm turns, and sees SARAH crawling across the tile.  His
	face turns white.

 MALCOLM SHE'S ALONE!! 
 CUT TO: 
 EXT. KILM HOUSE ROOF - NIGHT 
	SARAH has problems.  Still on top of the kilm house, she
	reaches the edge and pushes off the roof, leaping to the roof
	of the next building.

	She lands at the peak of the intersection of the two sides of
	sloping roof.  As she pulls herself up --

	-- a RAPTOR appears on the rooftop behind her.  In full
	stride, it leaps, sails over her, and lands on the roof
	ahead of her.

	Sarah swings to her left and starts to crawl down the slope,
	away from the raptor.  Suddenly the roof board under her
	SPRINTERS and CRACKS under her weight.  The whole section
	pulls up and starts to slide off the roof.  Sarah, clinging to
	it, rides the roof  planks down, away from the raptor.

	She looks over her shoulder, down --

	-- and sees ANOTHER RAPTOR, waiting for her on the roof of the
	building below.

	Sarah quickly rolls off the sliding section of roof, which
	keeps sliding, falling.  The raptor below jumps up, just in
	time to get WHACKED in the head by the falling roof section.

	Sarah tries to cling to the Spanish tile roof, fingers and
	nails slipping on the slick ceramic surface.  She slides all
	the way to the edge, grabs hold of the gutter, and dangles
	there, suspended above one raptor and trapped below another.

	The raptor above works its way down.  The one below leaps up,
	at her dangling legs.  She has left them in time with its
	jumps, to avoid losing her feet.  This can't go on for long.

	Desperate, she pulls one of the Spanish tiles up from the roof
	and hurls it at the raptor below.  It hits the animal in the
	head, for all the good that does.

	But Sarah keeps on, pulling and throwing more tiles.  She
	edges to the right, toward a fresh supply.

	The raptor above edges even closer, claws CLICKING on the
	slick roof.

	Something interesting is happening.  As Sarah pulls the loose
	tiles free, the ones above slide down, to take their place.
	Sarah sees this and pulls more free, knocking them out of the
	way as fast as she can.

	Suddenly an avalanche of loose tiles breaks loose and the
	footing underneath the raptor above disintegrates.  The
	animal's feet flail and grasp, it slides towards the edge amid
	the tumbling tiles.

	Sarah, seeing it coming, swings in close to the building,
	hugging it as closely as she can.  The raptor falls off the
	roof, right past her --

	-- and CRUNCHES into the raptor below.  Both animals SNARK and
	attack one another.

	Now Sarah, her grip exhausted, falls too, landing right next
	to the enraged animals.  They fight and roll, RIGHT OVER HER.
	She GROANS and hugs the wood below her, the raptors continue
	to thrash and bite, they roll back, toward her, she rolls out
	of their way --

	-- and plunges through a hole in the roof.

 INT. LAB - NIGHT 
	Sarah falls through the roof of a deserted laboratory and
	lands in the tray of an old-fashioned hanging fluorescent
	light fixture.

	One end of the fixture's support SNAPS, it drops at a 45
	degree angle, Sarah slides out the other end and CRASHES
	through a window.

 EXT. STREET - NIGHT 
	Sarah lands in the mud in the street below.

 CUT TO: 
EXT. BETWEEN TWO BUILDING - NIGHT 
	With a THUD, MALCOLM lands in the mud between two other
	building, one of which he has just climbed off of.  Panicked,
	he leaps to his feet and starts to SHOUT.

 MALCOLM 		Kelly!  KELLY!

 CUT TO: 
 EXT. MAIN STREET - NIGHT 
	SARAH sprints down the main street as fast as she can, toward
	the building on which sits the helicopter.  Above her, she can
	see NICK has now reached the helicopter and is waving to her.

	Sarah reaches the fallen water tower, which is next to the
	helicopter building, and starts to climb it.

 ELSEWHERE IN THE STREET, 
	KELLY is still covering underneath the fallen shed.  In the
	distance, she can see the helicopter.  But she is trembling
	with fear, unable to move.

	The whole shed suddenly RATTLES as something heavy hits it
	outside.  Kelly's mouth drops open to scream, but her terror
	is so complex that no sound comes out.  She raises her hands
	in self-defense, whatever's outside ROARS with effort, the
	entire shed is suddenly RIPPED right up off of her, and she
	looks up --

	-- into her father's eyes.

 KELLY 		Dad!

 MALCOLM 		Come on!

	He grabs her by the hand and they take off down the street.

 ON THE ROOFTOP, 
	Sarah emerges at the top of the water tower structure and
	leaps onto the roof, into Nick's arms.

 NICK 		Where's Kelly?

 SARAH 		Where's Ian?

	Eyes wide with panic, they both turn and look down at the
	street below, where they see KELLY and MALCOLM, racing at top
	speed down the middle of the street --

 -- WITH A VELOCIRAPTOR CHASING THEM. 
 DOWN IN THE STREET, 
	Malcolm and Kelly have a twenty yard advantage on the animal.
	They're pretty fast, but it's faster.

	Above them, Nick and Sarah are at the edge of the roof,
	SHOUTING and urging them on.  They push it, faster.

	They reach the base of the fallen water tower, the jumble of
	struts and metal poles that Sarah climbed.

 MALCOLM CLIMB! 
	Kelly leaps ahead of him and grabs hold of one of the poles,
	pulling herself neatly up to her feet and reaching for the
	next one.

	Malcolm stretches and makes the same effort, but for him it's
	much harder.

	Below them, the raptor springs and SLAMS into the struts,
	shaking the whole structure.  It pulls itself up.

	Higher up, Kelly climbs fast, hands gliding over the poles.
	She breaks out into the open, where a long, narrow pole runs
	on a slight incline up to the roof.  She scampers across it,
	running the balance beam.

	She reaches the other side, on a ledge below the roofline, and
	looks back.  Malcolm is at the other end, hesitating, drained,
	breathing hard.

 KELLY DAD, COME ON! 
	Below him, the raptor closes in.  Malcolm sets out across the
	beam, his legs shaking.  He places his feet carefully, he
	doesn't have nearly the balance Kelly did.

	The raptor draws closer.

				KELLY (cont'd)
 FASTER! 
	Malcolm slips.

	One foot twists right off the bar and he spins, arms flailing,
	trying to regain his tenuous balance.

	But he overcompensates and his whole body, wrenches out from
	under him.  He falls, the bar SMACKS him hard in the chest,
	knocking the wind out of him, and he drops, flipping right off
	the bar and bouncing painfully through the maze of bars below.

	He drops right past the pursuing velociraptor, CRUNCHING to
	a halt in a nest of bars ten feet off the ground, probably
	cracking a rib.  Kelly SCREAMS from above him.

				KELLY (cont'd)
 DAD! 
	She stares down in horror at her father.  Wrenched in among
	the bars, Malcolm is helpless as the animal crouches only six
	feet above him now, with an open attack route.

	The animal SNARKS and goes into its pre-attack crouch.

	Up above, Kelly wipes the palms of her hands on her jeans
	and leaps out into space, grabbing hold of one of the bars.

	The raptor springs.

	Kelly spins around, over the top of the bar, and, at the very
	peak of her trajectory, she lets go.

	The raptor sails through down from above, feet first, SLAMMING
	both of them squarely into the raptor's side, sending it
	hurtling into space.

	She lands hard and awkwardly, CLANGING into the spidery
	scaffolding next to Malcolm as the raptor SMASHES to the
	ground below.  But Kelly manages to hold on.

 KELLY GET UP! 
	She grabs hold of Malcolm and pulls him to his feet.

 ON THE ROOF, 
	Kelly and Malcolm appear over the roofline.  The PILOTS SHOUTS
	from inside.

 PILOT LET'S GO LET'S GO LET'S GO!! 
	Malcolm and Kelly scramble toward the helicopter.  But at the
	opposite side of the roof, a RAPTOR claws its way over the
	edge as well.

	Malcolm sees it and they lunge for the helicopter, but the
	animal is far faster.  It's only ten feet away, then five,
	they're surely done for this time, when --

 -- KA-BOOM! 
	There comes the loudest single gunshot anyone has ever heard,
	and the raptor flies off its feet and lands ten feet across
	the roof, dead.  They look up, to the source of the
	gunshot.

	It's ROLAND, standing at the edge of the roof, holding his
	smoking .600 Nitro Express.

	But there's no time for celebration, as suddenly the
	helicopter's left skid CRACKS right through the surface of the
	roof.

 PILOT HURRY! THE ROOF'S GIVING WAY! 
	The skid dips even further, ripping right through the
	thatch-and-wood construction.  Kelly, who had one foot in the
	helicopter, loses her balance --

	-- as the roof caves in beneath her.

 MALCOLM KELLY! 
	She falls,  SCREAMING, through the hole and down, into the
	building below.

 ONE FLOOR DOWN, 
	Kelly lands with a CRUNCH on the floor immediately below the
	roof, about nine feet down.  But her landing is cushioned by
	an inordinate amount of straw and leaves that have been
	arranged there.  She lifts one hand, and a yellowy, viscous
	substance drips off of it.

	It's yolk.  She looks around, noticing half a dozen large,
	oblong shapes.  Eggs.

	Above her, Malcolm is scrambling, climbing down to her through
	the wreckage of the CREAKING, crumbling roof.

 MALCOLM 		Kelly!  I'm coming!

	Kelly climbs to her knees, but behind her, a large, dark shape
	is moving.  Rising.  Unfolding, in a way.

 IT'S A PTERANODON. 
	Yep, flying dinosaur.  The enormous animal raises its head, a
	brilliant blue crest extending two feet behind its long,
	saber-like beak.  It SQUAWKS at Kelly in fury.  She can only
	stare, spellbound.

	Malcolm reaches her and grabs hold as the angry animal unfurls
	its massive twenty-two foot wingspread.

 ON THE ROOF, 
	the helicopter lurches as it sinks further into the crumbling
	roof, and now the skids are getting tangled in the debris.
	Roland races over to the hole, climbs in a few feet, and
	starts kicking at it, making it larger.

 ROLAND 		Give me a ladder!

 IN THE PTERANODON NEST, 
	Malcolm tries to haul Kelly back up the way he came, but a
	SECOND PTERANODON now appears from the depths of the building,
	SCREECHING in fury at these invaders who have landed in the
	middle of their clutch of eggs.

	An emergency rescue ladder drops through the hole in the roof.
	Malcolm grabs Kelly with one arm and the ladder with the other
	and they start to climb out of the nest.

 ON THE ROOF, 
	Malcolm and Kelly climb the ladder and are pulled into the
	belly of the chopper just as two enormous beaks break
	through the surface of the roof around them.

	The pteranodons are emerging.

 MALCOLM GO GO GO GO GOG GO! 
	The helicopter lurches up a few feet, but it yanked to an
	abrupt stop.  The engines WHINE, the chopper just hovers
	there.

 PILOT 		We're snagged on something!

	They loos down. BOTH PTERANODONS have come out through the
	hole in the roof and are clinging to the skids of the
	helicopter.  They flap their gigantic wings in unison, and
	drag the helicopter off, into the air, away from the nest --

	-- and let go.  Freed, the helicopter gains altitude quickly.

 IN THE HELICOPTER, 
	the PILOTS gape as the pteranodons coast along, right next to
	the helicopter.

 PILOT 		Hang on!  If I tip it hard, I can cut
		'em with the rotors!

 SARAH 		NO!  Don't!  They're not attacking!

	They look out the windows, where, indeed, the magnificent
	animals are merely accompanying them, flying escort as the
	chopper gains altitude.

				SARAH (cont'd)
		They're protecting their nest.
		That's all.  That's all they're
		doing.

	Kelly, completely drained, sits between Sarah and Malcolm,
	each of whom has a protective arm around her.  She sags
	against her father's chest, nothing left.

	He holds her tight and WHISPERS in her ear.

 MALCOLM 		Thank you.  Kelly, thank God.  Thank
		God for you...

 IN THE NIGHT SKY, 
	over the island, the helicopter steadily gains altitude.  A
	hundred feet.  Three hundred.  A thousand.

	As the helicopter is clearly leaving the island, the
	pteranodons now peel off, their job done.  One of them banks
	sharply, right in front of the moon.  The moonlight
	silhouettes it, shining right through its membranous wings,
	lighting it up like a Halloween skeleton.

	Below, the tiny green island melts away into the vastness of
	the wine-dark sea.

 CUT TO: 
 EXT. TYRANNOSAUR NEST - NIGHT 
	Elsewhere in the forest, it's not such a happy story.  PETER
	LUDLOW, still alive, drops through the air and CRUNCHES to the
	muddy ground.  Dizzy, bleeding, the breath knocked out of him,
	he opens his eyes and sees a sloping bank of dried mud.

	From behind him, he hears a CHIRPING sound.  He turns.

	He's in the tyrannosaur nest.

	The BABY TYRANNOSAUR faces him, still with a strange
	aluminum-foil cast on its leg.  The baby SQUEAKS with
	excitement as it toddles toward him.

	Ludlow scrambles to his feet, unsure what to do.  Both ADULT
	TYRANNOSAURS stand outside the nest, staring down at him.

	The baby runs toward Ludlow, so he turns and runs away.

	But in an instant, the male brings its head down, knocking
	Ludlow to the ground.  Then it raises its head again.
	Watching.  Waiting.

	Ludlow gets up again and tries to run, but now the female rex
	strikes, knocking him over again.

	Ludlow tries to crawl away, on all fours.  The male bends down
	and closes its jaws around one of his legs, holding it
	tightly.  Ludlow SCREAMS --

	-- and the rex bits down decisively.  The bone breaks with a
	dry SNAP.  Ludlow HOWLS in pain, unable to move, and the baby
	toddles forward eagerly.  Ludlow can only stare as it leaps
	up, onto his chest, and opens its jaws wide.

	Peter Ludlow SCREAMS.

 CUT TO: 
 EXT. CEMETERY - DAY 
	Snow falls in a gray midwinter sky.  In a cemetery, a group of
	fifty MOURNERS is grouped around a gravesite next to a coffin
	that is festooned with cascades of flowers.  On a table, there
	is an array of framed photographs --

	-- of JOHN HAMMOND.  A MINISTER reads from the Bible while the
	Mourners wipe away tears.  IAN MALCOLM stands a respectful
	distance from the group, KELLY right beside him.  Malcolm's
	face is blank, tired, his sunburn out of place with the white
	winter setting around him.

	At gravesite, a Young Woman turns, looking back over her
	shoulder.  About sixteen, she's lovely, with long blonde hair
	and an honest, open face.  She notices Malcolm, recognizes
	him.

	She nudges a Young Man next to her, about thirteen years old.
	The Young Man turns and breaks into a smile just as welcoming.

	As the ceremony breaks up, they walk over to him.

 MALCOLM 		Hello, Lex.  Tim.

	LEX stands on her tiptoes and kisses Malcolm on the cheek.
	TIM extends a hand and Malcolm shakes it.

				MALCOLM (cont'd)
		This is Kelly.  My daughter.

	They nod their hellos.

 LEX 		I'm glad you came, Dr. Malcolm

 MALCOLM 		I'm sorry about your grandfather.

 TIM 		Thank you.

 LEX 		We were going to call you, in a few
		days.  Tim and I have been thinking,
		and we've decided we want people to
		know about the island.  About what we
		all saw.

 TIM 		We think it's something our
		grandfather would want us to do.

 MALCOLM 			(pause)
		Why?

 LEX 		Because it's true.

	Malcolm looks at her for a long moment.

 MALCOLM 		I know, Lex.  But even if we're the
		only ones who ever know, it'll still
		be true.  You see, I've decided
		that if the world found out about
		what your grandfather created, it
		wouldn't be around for very long.

 LEX 		But -- it was real.  You can't let
		people go on saying it's not.

 MALCOLM 		That's the thing about reality.

	He looks down at Kelly.

				MALCOLM (cont'd)
		Even when people stop believing in
		it, it doesn't go away.

	Kelly smiles and takes his hand, her slender fingers
	interlocking with his.

 EXT. JUNGLE - DAY 
	Back on Isla Sorna, we float over the deserted worker village,
	moving lightly, as in a dream.

 MALCOLM (V.O.) 		Do you feel the cold wind blowing on
		your face?  That's real.

	We sweep low, landing on the roof the helicopter took off
	from, the nest below now careful rebuilt with straw and
	scrap, a dozen unblemished eggs in the middle of it.

 MALCOLM (V.O.) 		Do you see the four of us, standing
		here together, alive?  That's real.

	A PTERANODON land gently on the nest.  Ever so carefully, it
	positions itself over the eggs, lowers itself to roosting
	position, and folds its giant wings around its body.

 MALCOLM (V.O.) 		And maybe that's still that matters.

	The animal raises its head, opens its beak, and SQUAWKS
	approvingly up at the heavens.

          The HUNGRY search through RUBBISH BINS for FOOD. SKYSCRAPERS rise

                    The show it's over - it's done.
                     'm done. I'm leaving, Annie ... I'm
                    going back to Chicago. I'm sorry ...

                    I'm sorry, Ann. Ever since you were
                    small people have been letting you
                    down. But you gotta think of yourself
                    now. You should try out for that part.
          
          ANN looks at him warily ...
          
                              MANNY (cont'd)
                    It's what you've always wanted. Oh, I
                    know what you're thinking - every time
                    you reach out for something you care
                    about ... fate comes along and
                    snatches it away.

                    time.

                    Look, Miss ... I told you already;
                    call my office - leave your resume
                    with my secretary.

                    Why would I want to do that when we
                    can talk about it in person?
          
                              WESTON
                    Because that's what a smart girl would
                    do.

                               ESTON
                     ell, that's too bad - because we just
                    gave the part to someone else. Sorry,
                    kid - the play is cast.
          
          They are standing outside an ITALIAN RESTAURANT ... WESTON goes to
          enter ...
          
          ANN catches a glimpse of PLATES of FOOD and GLASSES of WINE. She
          quickly looks away. WESTON catches the glance and stops.

                    Look - I know times are tough. You
                    want my advice? Use what you got.
                    You're not bad looking - a girl like
                    you doesn't have to starve.
          
          HOPE flickers in ANN'S EYES as WESTON fishes into his POCKET
          for a PEN and BUSINESS CARD. He scribbles down an address.
          
                              WESTON (cont'd)
                    There's a new place, just opened.

                    Listen, princess - this gig ain't the
                    Palace, you understand? Ask for Kenny
                    K. Tell him I sent you.
          
          WESTON hands her the BUSINESS CARD ... ANN looks down at the
          address, not recognizing it. She looks at him questioningly.

                              DENHAM
                    Come on, fellas - you know the deal -
                    we agreed to push Maureen's start date
                    so she could get her teeth fixed.
          
                              THUGGISH INVESTOR
                    It's not the principle of the thing -
                    it's the money.

          DENHAM hurriedly pulls himself up - as ZELMAN turns on him.

                    we're not making that film anymore -
                    and I'll tell you why.
          
          DENHAM gets out of his SEAT and moves to the FRONT of the ROOM.
          
                              DENHAM (cont'd)
                    The story has changed, the script has
                    been rewritten.
          
          DENHAM turns to face the room, whipping a TATTERED MAP out of his
          pocket.

                    I'm talking about a primitive world
                    ... never before seen by man! The

          DENHAM is momentarily SPEECHLESS.
          
                              DENHAM
                    Excuse me, boobies?

                    In my experience people only go to
                    these films to observe the ...
                    undraped form of the native girls.
          
                              DENHAM
                    What are you - an idiot? You think
                    they asked De Mille to waste his time
                    on nudie shots? No - they respected
                    the film maker, they showed some
                    class! Not that you'd know what that
                    means - you cheap low-life!
          
          ZELMAN shifts uncomfortably in his seat as THUGGISH shoots him an
          ANGRY LOOK.
          
                              ZELMAN
                    Would you step outside for a moment,
                    Carl?
          
          DENHAM looks at them ... the INVESTORS avoid EYE CONTACT.

          AS DENHAM STEPS INTO THE LOBBY, PRESTON, HIS LONG SUFFERING
          ASSISTANT WAITS ON A SOFA.
          
          DENHAM points suddenly to the GLASS OF WATER on the TABLE next to
          PRESTON.
          
                              DENHAM
                    Gimme that - quick!
          
          PRESTON hands him the WATER.

                    You won't like it, it's non-alcoholic!
          
          DENHAM empties the GLASS into a POT PLANT.
          
                              DENHAM
                    Preston, you have a lot to learn about
                    the motion picture business.

                    Don't write him off fellas. He's hot-
                    headed sure, but Carl Denham's made

          struggling under the weight of 8 FILM CANS! DENHAM is glancing
          back over his shoulder.
          
                              DENHAM
                    I want the cast and crew on the ship
                    within the hour.

                    Tell `em the studio's pressured us
                    into an early departure.
          
                              PRESTON
                    It's not ethical!
          
                              DENHAM
                     hat are they gonna do - sue me? They
                    can get in line! I'm not going to let

          flags a CAB down. He cuts across the BUSY ROAD, PRESTON hurrying
          behind.

                    currency of any kind -
          
          ANGLE ON: DENHAM looks back across the STREET and notices an angry
          INVESTOR heading towards him.
          
                              DENHAM
                    Get in there!
          
          PRESTON suddenly finds himself BUNDLED into the back of a CAB.
          
                              PRESTON
                     ho's gonna pay for the ship?
          
          QUICK MOMENT: The SLEAZY INVESTOR grabs at the PARTIALLY OPEN BACK
          WINDOW of the CAB.

          DENHAM hurriedly WINDS the WINDOW SHUT ... the SLEAZY INVESTOR
          yelps with PAIN, as he yanks his JAMMED FINGERS away from the CAB!
          
                                DENHAM

          as the CAB speeds away!
          
                                DENHAM
                       on't worry Preston - I've had a lot
                      of practice at this: I'm real good at
                      crapping the crappers.

                                DENHAM
                      You got it ... and tell Maureen - she
                      doesn't have six hours to put on her
                      face. If she wants to be in this

                    You said we were shooting in

                    is look her in the eye and lie.
          
          DENHAM turns away, his brain whirring ... thinking hard ...

                              PRESTON
                    We gotta delay the shoot - shut

          DENHAM turns and looks at PRESTON briefly.
          
                              DENHAM (cont'd)
                    For Godsake, Preston - think like a

                    Defeat is always momentary.
          
          DENHAM bangs the CAB ROOF with his hand, and then strides off
          confidently along the street.
          
          
          EXT. BURLESQUE THEATRE - EVENING
          
          CLOSE ON: A series of PHOTOS of SEMI NAKED WOMEN, with feather

          ... Delaware Du Boise ... Velvet Cushions ...
          W
           IDER: DENHAM is standing outside a tacky BURLESQUE THEATRE. He
          straightens his tie and heads towards the DOOR.
          
          ANGLE ON: A couple of LARGE GIRLS, followed by a SMALLER GIRL,
          arrive for work and enter the BURLESQUE THEATRE ... DENHAM eyes
          the BIGGER GIRLS, then chooses to follow the SMALLER ONE.
          
          ANGLE ON: DENHAM is reaching for the DOOR HANDLE to go inside,
          when he suddenly pauses, his eye caught by the REFLECTION in the
          GLASS DOOR ...
          
           LOSE ON: ANN ... standing in the MIDDLE of the SIDEWALK. She is
          unaware of DENHAM watching her. ANN stares grimly at the BURLESQUE
          HOARDINGS, the FLYER clutched in her hands, a small knot of anger
          forming in her stomach.
          
           LOSE ON: DENHAM's HAND lets go of the DOOR. His eyes lock on ANN
          through the sea of PEDESTRIANS.

          ANN angrily CRUMPLES the FLYER, drops it in the GUTTER and walks
          C
          away from the THEATRE.
          
           LOSE ON: DENHAM ... watching her leave.
          
          
          EXT. FRUIT STALL - EVENING
          
          A BUSY FRUIT STALL on the SIDEWALK. The VENDOR is hurriedly
          handing out APPLES and pocketing NICKELS.
          
          ANGLE ON: ANN walks slowly by ... her eyes on the FRUIT. She
          glances at the VENDOR, SWIPES an APPLE from the TRAY, and quickly
          moves on, slipping the APPLE into her POCKET.
          
          ANN'S arm is suddenly GRABBED! The ANGRY VENDOR pulls her     hand
          out of her pocket, which is still clutching the stolen apple.
          
                              VENDOR

          ANN tries to pull away. The VENDOR's grip on her arm tightens.

                    compelling her down a road from which
                    she cannot draw back. It's as if her

                    So you are ready for this voyage, Miss
                    Darrow?
          
                               ANN
                    Sure...

                    Nervous?
          
                              ANN
                    Nervous - no. Why? Should I be?
          
          ANN looks taken aback ...
          
                              ENGLEHORN
                    It isn't every woman who would take
                    such a risk.
          
          DENHAM throws PRESTON a look!
          
                              PRESTON
                             (hurriedly)
                    Why don't I show Miss Darrow to her
                    cabin?
          
                              DENHAM
                    Wonderful idea, thank you, Preston.
          
                             

          
                                                                    21.
          
                                 PRESTON
                       Miss Darrow, if you'd just - Hi, my
                       name is Preston, Carl's assistant.
          
          DENHAM pulls his CHEQUE BOOK from his JACKET POCKET.
          
                                 DENHAM
                       Two thousand - it's a deal ... Will
                       you take a cheque?
          
                                 ENGLEHORN
                       Do I have a choice?

            EXT. VENTURE/NY DOCKS - NIGHT
          
          ANGLE ON: PRESTON goes to lead ANN up the GANG WAY past some rough-
          looking sailors, onto the SHIP - "THE VENTURE".
          
                                 PRESTON
                       Please, follow me. If there's anything
                       that you need ... `excuse me fellas,
                       if there's anything that you need
                       please don't hesitate to ... ask ...
          
          PRESTON turns back to see ANN hesitating at the bottom of the GANG
          WAY ... an unnerved expression on her face ...
          
          ANN steps forward ... Deep breath, she follows PRESTON.
          
          
          INT. ENGINE ROOM - NIGHT
          
          BEEFY SAILORS shovel COAL into the SHIP'S FURNACE ... another
          cranks a valve on the pistons.
          
          
          INT. DENHAM'S CABIN - NIGHT
          
          ANGLE ON: DENHAM enters his CABIN looking FLUSTERED. He is
          STARTLED to find JACK DRISCOLL waiting for him. DRISCOLL is a
          WRITER, well dressed in a SHABBY sort of way.
          
                                 DENHAM
                       Jesus, Jack - you scared me!
          
          DENHAM crosses to a cabinet and breaks into a CRATE OF JOHNNY
          WALKER.
          
                                 DENHAM (cont'd)
                       Listen, if anyone comes to the door,
                       don't open it. You haven't seen me ...
                       say I got depressed and committed
                       suicide. Say I stuck my head down a
                       toilet!
                                 holding up a bottle)
                       You want one?
          
        

          
                                                                  22.
          
                              JACK
                    No! I can't stay, Carl. I have a
                    rehearsal for which I am now ...
                              checks WATCH)
                    ... three hours late.
          
          JACK throws a FEW SCRIPT PAGES across the TABLE.
          
                              DENHAM
                    What's this?
          
                              JACK
                    It's the script.
          
                              DENHAM
                    This is a script? Jack ... this is
                    fifteen pages.
          
                               ACK
                    I know - but they're good! You've got
                    fifteen good pages there, Carl!
          
                              DENHAM
                    I'm supposed to be making a feature
                    length picture.
          
                              JACK
                    You told me I had more time. I'm
                    sorry. Look I gotta go.
          
                              DENHAM
                    Jack - No - you can't do this to me! I
                    have a beginning but I need a middle
                    and an end! I gotta have something to
                    shoot.
          
          The SHIP'S ENGINES roar into life ... JACK stands to leave.
          
                              JACK
                    You got my notes - I gotta go. See
                    you.
          
          CLOSE ON: DENHAM looking DISMAYED. He stares blankly at the RUSH
          of ACTIVITY through the PORTHOLE WINDOW behind JACK.
          
           OV: The VENTURE'S CREW hurriedly RELEASE ROPES in preparation for
          the ship's imminent departure.
          
          DENHAM'S expression slowly CHANGES ...
          
                              DENHAM
                    Alright, fine. We might as well settle
                    up.
          
          JACK looks ASTONISHED as DENHAM pulls out his CHEQUE BOOK.
          
                              JACK
                    You're going to pay me?
          
         

          
                                                                  23.
          
                              DENHAM
                    I'm not going to stiff a friend.
          
                               ACK
                    I've never known you to volunteer cash
                    before ...
          
                              DENHAM
                    How does two grand sound?
          
                              JACK
                    Sounds great!
          
                              DENHAM
                    Thought it might.
          
          DENHAM'S eyes flick to the WINDOW ... sees SAILORS are hauling up
          the GANGPLANK.
          
           NGLE ON: A SAILOR CRANKS a series of VALVES as the SHIP'S PISTONS
          crank in to life.
          
          DENHAM signs the CHEQUE, and hands it over with a FLOURISH ...
                               D
                                 DENHAM (cont'd)
                                (signing with a flourish)
                    Voila!
          
          JACK snatches the CHEQUE and turns to leave.
          
                                 JACK
                    Thanks...
          
          JACK glances at it.
          
                              JACK (cont'd)
                    Carl ... you've written "Two Grand".
          
          DENHAM takes the CHEQUE back ...
          
                              DENHAM
                    So I did ... Sorry about that
                             (screwing it up)
                    Let's start from the beginning.
          
                              DENHAM (cont'd)
                             (writing)
                    "Two Thousand Dollars" ...
          
          ANGLE ON: The ship's PISTONS PUMP faster.
          
          DENHAM looks up at JACK, a confused look on his face.
          
                              DENHAM (cont'd)
                    It is the 29th, isn't it?
          
                              JACK
                             (anxious)
                    Come on - it's the 25th, Carl, the
                    25th!
          
         

          
                                                                  24.
          
          ANGLE ON: JACK suddenly realises the SHIP is about to leave.
          
                              DENHAM
                    I'm sorry. Let me just ... It'll just
                    take a second.
          
          DENHAM screws up the CHEQUE again! The VIBRATION of the ENGINES
          picks up. JACK heads for the DOOR!
          
                              JACK
                    Never mind, pay me when you get back!
          
                              DENHAM
                             (knowing)
                    Alright ... okay ...
          
          
          INT. ENGINE ROOM - NIGHT
          
          CLOSE ON: THE SHIPS GAUGES SPRING INTO ACTION.
          
          
          EXT. VENTURE STERN
          
          CRANE DOWN the stern of the ship as the PROPELLER kicks into
          action.
          
          
          INT. SHIP'S CORRIDOR - NIGHT
          
           NGLE ON: BRUCE BAXTER walking along the CORRIDOR, with PRESTON
          following behind laden with LUGGAGE. BRUCE is in his early
          thirties ... He is QUICK WITTED, SOPHISTICATED and CHARMING...
          but his career as a SCREEN ACTOR has badly stalled.
          
                              PRESTON
                    Your cabin's just down here,
                    Mr. Baxter. May I say how excited we
                    are to have you back with us, Sir.
          
          ANGLE ON: JACK is hurrying down the corridor towards the DOOR. He
          feels the SHIP MOVING! He suddenly collides with BRUCE, who
          thrusts a SUITCASE at him.
          
                              BRUCE
                    Be a sport and lend us a hand.
          
                              JACK
                    Oh, Christ!
          
          JACK looks desperately out of the PORTHOLE, doubles back and BOLTS
          AWAY.
          
                              BRUCE
                             (dryly)
                    Appreciate the help, fella.
          
                              PRESTON
                    Let me get the door for you - welcome
                    to your state room sir.
          
                              

          
                                                                  25.
          
          
          INT. BRUCE'S CABIN - NIGHT
          
          ANGLE ON: BRUCE is clearly unimpressed with the TINY CABIN. He
          reacts to the SMELL.
          
                               RESTON
                      know, that's not a nice smell is it?
                    I'm sure it'll disperse in a day or
                    two. Did I ever mention how much I
                    love your work, Mr. Baxter? I've seen
                    every one of your pictures ... even
                    the silent ones.
          
                               RUCE
                    I haven't made any silent ones.
          
          BRUCE gently closes the DOOR in PRESTON'S FACE - leaving him
          silently CURSING to himself in the CORRIDOR.
          
          
          EXT. VENTURE WHEELHOUSE - NIGHT
          
          ANGLE ON: The PROPELLER CHURNS through the WATER ...
          
          ENGLEHORN watches the VENTURE pull away from the dock ...
          Satisfied, he enters the WHEELHOUSE ...
          
                              ENGLEHORN
                    Dead slow ahead both, Mr Hayes.
          
                              HAYES
                    Dead slow ahead both, Captain.
          
          
          EXT. VENTURE/NY DOCKS - NIGHT
          
          ANGLE ON: JACK emerges from the labyrinthine SHIP INTERIOR and
          rushes to the RAIL of the SHIP ... he freezes in HORROR!
          
                                 JACK
                    Oh Christ!
          
          ANGLE ON: The SHIP is PULLING AWAY from the DOCK ... 6 feet ...
          7 feet ... JACK contemplates JUMPING for a MOMENT:
          
                                 JACK (cont'd)
                    Goddammit!
          
          
          EXT. NY DOCKS
          
          POLICE CARS race along the docks towards the VENTURE, SIRENS
          wailing.
          
          
          EXT. VENTURE DECK - NIGHT

          JACK SLUMPS on the DECK in DESPAIR. He's missed his chance to
          get off the ship.

          DENHAM steps up behind JACK, just as a POLICE CAR, followed by
          ZELMAN and the INVESTORS, pull up on the DOCKS in the DISTANCE.
          
                              DENHAM
                    I keep telling you, Jack, there's no
                    money in theatre.
          
                                                               CUT TO:
          
          
          EXT. NY DOCKS - NIGHT
          
          The INVESTORS leap out of the car.
          
                              SLEAZY INVESTOR
                    No, no, no!
          
          
          EXT. VENTURE DECK - NIGHT
          
          The VENTURE steams past the LIGHTS of MANHATTAN.
          
                              DENHAM
                    You're much better off sticking with
                    film.
          
                              JACK
                    I don't do it for the money, Carl. I
                    happen to love the theatre.
          
                              DENHAM
                     o, you don't.
          
          JACK looks at him exasperated as DENHAM casually taps his PIPE
          on the RAIL of the BOAT.
          
                              DENHAM (cont'd)
                    If you really loved it, you would have
                    jumped.
          
          
          EXT. NY DOCKS - NIGHT
          
          WIDE ON: ZELMAN throws his hat to the ground in anger as THE
          VENTURE pulls away from the docks.
          
          
          EXT. NEW YORK HARBOUR - NIGHT
          
          WIDE ON: The VENTURE steams away from the DOCKS, passing under the

          INT. ANN'S CABIN - NIGHT
          
          CLOSE ON: ANN tests her mattress with her hands. ANN straightens &
          turns, perching on the edge of the BUNK.

                    I hope you find it to your liking...
                    it's quite comfortable. Your towels
                    and linens are underneath the bed.
                    That is the wash basin. I know, that's
                    not a pleasant smell - is it? I'm sure
                    it'll disperse in a day or two.
          
           RESTON dances over to the WARDROBE.
          
                              PRESTON (cont'd)
                    The closet ... your costumes - I hope
                    you'll find everything is in order. If
                    there is anything that you need,
                    please do not hesitate to ask...fresh
                    water, perhaps? I can bring it to you
                    personally.
          
          PRESTON is interrupted by a knock on the CABIN DOOR...
          
          ANGLE ON: The DOOR opens and DENHAM enters. He thrusts a bottle of
          JOHNNY WALKER SCOTCH into ANN'S HANDS ...
          
                              DENHAM
                    Knock knock! We can't have our leading
                    lady deprived of the necessities of
                    life.
                              to PRESTON)
                    Do me a favour - run a bottle down to
                    Jack. It'll fend off his migraine.
          
                              PRESTON
                    They're still trying to find a place
                    for him to sleep.
          
                              DENHAM
                             (to PRESTON)
                    You told him my typewriter is
                    available for hire?
          
                               RESTON
                    Yes - he didn't take it well.
          
          PRESTON departs down the corridor.
          
                              ANN
                             (confused)
                    Mr. Driscoll ...?
          
          DENHAM turns and looks at ANN.
          
                              ANN (cont'd)
                    He's on board?
          
                              DENHAM
                    Jack has his heart set on coming. Call
                    me a softie - I couldn't say no.
          
                                                                  28.
          
          
          INT. SHIPS HOLD - NIGHT
          
          ANGLE ON: CHOY is showing JACK to his sleeping QUARTERS, carrying
          BLANKETS.
          
          JACK stares in DISBELIEF at the DINGY HOLD strewn with STRAW
          BALES and EMPTY ANIMAL CAGES. He reacts to the SMELL.
          
                              CHOY
                    This room very comfortable, plenty dim
                    light ... fresh straw.
          
                              JACK
                    What'd you keep down here?
          
                              CHOY
                    Lion, tiger, hippo - you name it.
          
                              Jack
                    What, do you sell them to Zoos?
          
                              CHOY
                    Zoos ... circus ...
                             (lowers voice)
                    Skipper get big money for rare animal.
                             (alarmed)
                    Careful! Camel have bad accident on
                    floor. Stain unremovable ...
          
          JACK looks down. He's standing in a dark, viscous PUDDLE OF GUNGE.
          
                              CHOY (cont'd)
                             (lowers voice)
                    Skipper catch any animal you want. He
                    do you real good price on rhite wino.

                    Choy!
          
          ANGLE ON: CHOY clams up as ENGLEHORN strolls into the hold.
          
                              ENGLEHORN (cont'd)
                    My apologies for not being able to
                    offer you a cabin. Have you found an
                    enclosure to your taste?
          
                              JACK
                             (dryly)
                    Spoilt for choice.
          
          ENGLEHORN surveys a COUPLE OF LARGE CAGES.
          
                              ENGLEHORN
                    What are you, Mr. Driscoll, a lion or
                    a chimpanzee?
          
          JACK opens a CAGE large enough to sleep in.
          
         

          
                                                                  29.
          
                              JACK
                    Maybe, I'll take this one.
          
          He steps back with SURPRISE as a WOODEN CRATE TOPPLES, spilling
          out a LARGE MEDICAL BOTTLE. CHOY looks up in SHOCK as the BOTTLE
          ROLLS towards ENGLEHORN who coolly TRAPS it with his FOOT.
                               E
                              ENGLEHORN
                    I told you to lock it up.
          
                              CHOY
                             (scared)
                    Sorry, Skipper! Lumpy said -
          
                              ENGLEHORN
                             (interrupts)
                    Lumpy doesn't give the orders. What
                    are you trying to do? Put the whole
                    ship to sleep? Get them out of here!
          
          ENGLEHORN hands the BOTTLE to a nervous CHOY. JACK stares at the
          CRATES stacked in the CAGE.
          
          CLOSE ON: Piles of BOTTLES, all marked "Chloroform".

           NGLE ON: BRUCE pins movie posters from some of his previous films
          on his cabin wall ... He steps back, admiring them.
          
          
          INT. SHIPS HOLD - DAY
          
          ANGLE ON: JACK, sitting in the hold, TAPPING on an OLD TYPEWRITER
          propped up on BOXES. He is clearly very QUEASY, as he tries to
          stay focussed on the TYPEWRITER KEYS.
          
          He sees JIMMY carrying a TRAY come into view, he COUGHS and CLAMS
          UP.
          
                              JIMMY
                    Compliments of the chef -
          
          ANGLE ON: JIMMY unloading the BOWLS of GREY looking STEW from the
          TRAY.
          
           LOSE ON: JIMMY puts the BOWL next to JACK ... who takes one look
          at it, and SQUEEZES his eyes closed.
          
                              JACK (O.S.)
                    Oh Christ - oh God!
          
                              JIMMY
                    Lambs brains in walnut sauce.

          The CAGES and ROPES SWAY with each roll of the WAVES ... JIMMY
          walks away.
          
          ANGLE ON: JACK looking very nauseated ...
          
                              HAYES (O.S.)
                    Jimmy!
          
          JIMMY spins round, a guilty look on his face.
          
                              HAYES (cont'd)
                    You run those ropes up on deck like I
                    told you?
          
                              JIMMY
                    Doing it now, Mr. Hayes.
          
          ANGLE ON: JIMMY tries to slip past, but HAYES grabs his WRIST.
          
                               HAYES
                    How about you return Mr. Driscoll's
                    pen first?
          
          CLOSE ON: An expensive FOUNTAIN PEN drops from JIMMY'S HAND and
          clatters to the floor. QUICK as an eel, JIMMY scampers AWAY.
          
          HAYES shakes his head, and picks up the PEN ... hands it back.
          
                               HAYES (cont'd)
                    He doesn't mean any harm. I'll keep
                    him out of Jyour way.
          
                               ACK
                    No, it's okay.
          
                              HAYES
                    It's just he likes it down here, it's
                    where I found him ... four years ago
                    ... stowed away in one of them cages.
                    His arm was broken in two places, he
                    was wilder than half the animals in
                    here. Still won't tell me where he
                    came from - all I know, it wasn't any
                    place good.
          
          
          EXT. VENTURE DECK - DAY
          
          ANGLE ON: JIMMY is sorting NETS up on DECK. Nearby HAYES rests
          against the railing.
          
                              HAYES
                    You gotta straighten up. You don't
                    want to be on this ship for the rest
                    of your life.
          
                              JIMMY
                    I do.
          
                                                                  31.
          
                              HAYES
                    No, you don't, Jimmy. You wanna get
                    yourself educated. Give yourself some
                    options. Take this serious.
          
                              JIMMY
                    I do, Mr. Hayes, I do! Look, I've been
                    readin'.
          
          JIMMY pulls a battered book out of his coat pocket. HAYES takes
          the book. It has a painting of a TRAMP STEAMER on the cover and
          the title: HEART OF DARKNESS by Joseph Conrad.
          
                              HAYES
                    Where did you get this?
          
                              JIMMY
                             (prevaricating)
                    I borrowed it ...
          
          HAYES flicks the book open and sees "Property of New York
          Public Library" stamped on the interior of the dust jacket.
          
                              JIMMY (cont'd)
                    ... on long term loan. Look at this.
          
          JIMMY points to the printed byline on the back of the book.

          INT. ANN'S CABIN - DAY
          
          ANN is holding a copy of JACK'S PLAY "ISOLATION" ... she is
          standing in front of a mirror rehearsing her introduction.
          
                               ANN
                    It's nice to meet you Mr. Driscoll -
                    I'm actually quite familiar with your
                    work.
                              (trying again)
                    Oh yes! ... Hello, Mr Driscoll - it's
                    so nice to meet you! Actually, I'm
                    quite familiar with your work. I'm a
                    huge fan!
                              (one more time)
                    I've read everything you've ever
                    written.
          
          ANN'S face falls in DESPAIR - she can't get rid of her nerves
          about meeting the famous JACK DRISCOLL.
          
                                                                  32.
          
          
          INT. MESS ROOM - DAY
          
          A few sailors are finishing BREAKFAST.
          
          PRESTON, HERB and MIKE are seated at a TABLE.
          
          ANGLE ON: MIKE packing away his HEADPHONES and SOUND RECORDING
          EQUIPMENT.           M
                               IKE
                    I'm gonna have the ships' engines all
                    over the dialogue - sea gulls, camera
                    noise, wind and Christ knows what
                    else!
          
                              DENHAM
                    I don't care, Mike! You're the sound
                    recordist - make it work.
          
          ANGLE ON: ANN in the CHIFFON DRESS, hesitating in the doorway of
          the MESS.
          
          DENHAM looks up and signals her over.

                    Ann! Come on in! Let me introduce you
                    to the crew! This is Herb - our
                    cameraman ...
          
          ANN reaches out to shake HERB'S hand.
          
                              HERB
                    Delighted to meet you, ma'am. And may
                    I say what a lovely dress.
          
                              ANN
                    Oh! This old thing! I just - threw it
                    on!
          
                              PRESTON
                             (confused to DENHAM)
                    Isn't that one of Maureen's costumes?
          
                              ANN
                             (hurriedly)
                    What does a girl have to do round here
                    to get some breakfast!
          
                              DENHAM
                    Lumpy! You heard the lady!
          
          ANGLE ON: LUMPY looking up. He is simultaneously shaving a
          SAILOR and stirring PORRIDGE.
          
                              LUMPY
                    Fancy some of me ... ah ... Porridge
                    aux walnuts?

          DENHAM turns back to ANN, who is staring at MIKE, who has his
          head down, scribbling in a NOTEBOOK.
          
                              DENHAM
                    ANN, I don't believe you've met -
          
                              ANN
                    That's alright Mr. Denham, I know who
                    this is ...
          
          ANGLE ON: ANN, who is staring at MIKE in quiet awe. He glances up
          at her, nervously.
          
                              ANN (cont'd)
                    Thrilled to meet you. It's an honour -
                    to be part of this.
          
                              MIKE
                             (bewildered)
                    Gee, thanks!
          
                               ANN
                    Actually - I am quite familiar with
                    your work.
          
          ANGLE ON: DENHAM raises a quizzical EYEBROW.
          
                                 MIKE
                    Really?
          
                              ANN
                    Yes, and what I most admire - is the
                    way you have captured the voice of the
                    common people.
          
                              MIKE
                    Well - that's my job.
          
                              ANN
                    I'm sure you've heard this before, Mr
                    Driscoll, if you don't mind me saying -
                    you don't look at all like your
                    photograph ...
          A
           NGLE ON: JACK at the bar, holding a cup of COFFEE. He turns
          and glances at ANN.
          
                                 MIKE
                    Excuse me?
          
                              DENHAM
                    Wait a minute! Ann -
          
                              ANN
                             (to DENHAM)
                    Well, he's so much younger - in
                    person.
                             (turning back to MIKE)
                    And much better looking.
          
                  

          
                                                                    34.
          
          JACK starts to walk over to the table.
          
                              DENHAM
                    ANN! Stop! Stop - right there -
          
          ANGLE ON: MIKE staring past ANN'S shoulder.
          
                              ANN
                    I was afraid you might be one of those
                    self obsessed literary types. You know
                    - the tweedy twerp with his nose in a
                    book and his head up his -
          
          JACK snaps his BOOK closed. ANN turns around ... her face drops.
          JACK looks at ANN, who stares at him MORTIFIED.
          
                              JACK
                    It's nice to meet you too, Miss
                    Darrow..
          
          
          INT. SHIP'S CORRIDOR/BRUCE'S CABIN - DAY
          
           RUCE bumps into JIMMY who hurries away looking shifty.
          
          BRUCE enters his CABIN ... A moustache has been drawn on all his
          POSTERS. BRUCE looks annoyed ... then takes another look.
          
          CLOSE ON: BRUCE glancing in the mirror - imaging himself with a
          moustache. Not bad.
          
          
          EXT. VENTURE - DAY
          
          WIDE ON: The VENTURE ploughs through a HEAVY SWELL.
          
                              DENHAM (V.O.)
                    She's standing at the railing ... she
                    doesn't know it yet, but they're
                    sailing towards disaster. You got
                    that?
          
                              JACK (V.O.)
                    She turns ... The First Mate is
                    staggering towards her - there's a
                    knife sticking out of his back!
          
          
          INT. SHIPS HOLD
          
          ANGLE ON: JACK, sitting in the hold, TAPPING on an OLD TYPEWRITER
          propped up on BOXES. He is clearly very QUEASY, as he tries to
          stay focussed on the TYPEWRITER KEYS.
          
          DENHAM is pacing the HOLD, sucking on a PIPE.
          
                              DENHAM
                     ait a second, we're killing off the
                    First Mate?
          
                               

                                                                  35.
          
                              JACK
                    That's assuming she knows who the
                    First Mate is.
          
                              DENHAM
                    Come on, Jack! It was an honest
                    mistake. Ann is near-sighted - it
                    could happen to anyone.
          
                              JACK
                    I was joking, Carl.
          
                              DENHAM
                    The point is: she's horrified. She has
                    to look away. And that's when she sees
                    it.
          
                              JACK
                    See's what? What?
          
          ANGLE ON: Unseen by either DENHAM or JACK, JIMMY has snuck down in
          to the HOLD ...
          
                              DENHAM
                             (dramatic)
                    The island.
          
                              JACK
                             (taken aback)
                    We're filming on an island now? When
                    did this happen?
          
                              DENHAM
                    Jack, keep your voice down! I don't
                    want the crew getting spooked.
          
                              JACK
                    Why would they get spooked? What's it
                    called?
          
          DENHAM looks SHIFTY.
          
                              DENHAM
                    All right ... It has a local name, but
                    I'm warning you, Jack, it doesn't
                    sound good.
          
          ANGLE ON: JIMMY, his attention caught as he eavesdrops on the
          conversation.
          
          JACK looks at DENHAM in GROWING FRUSTRATION.
          
                              DENHAM (cont'd)
                             (quietly)
                    They call it ...
                             (muffled)
          
          JIMMY POV: DENHAM leaning in and murmuring to JACK.
          
                             

                                                                  36.
          
                              JACK
                    What's wrong with this place?
          
                              DENHAM
                    There's nothing officially wrong with
                    it. Because technically it hasn't been
                    discovered yet.
          
          JACK gives up, feeling too seasick to argue ...
          
                               JACK
                             (resuming typing)
                    Okay ... alright ... so we arrive at
                             (
                    this place ...
                               typing)
                    S ... k ... u ...
          
          CLOSE ON: DENHAM looks up in time to see JIMMY listening ... Their
          eyes meet ... DENHAM tries to hush JACK - too late.

          alongside.
          
          
          EXT. VENTURE DECK - DAY
          
           IDE ON: DENHAM is FILMING ANN and BRUCE. Clustered around are his
          crew, HERB and MIKE and PRESTON.
          
                               DENHAM
                    All right everyone, from the top.   And
                    ... action!
          
          ANGLE ON: BRUCE saunters up to ANN, who is leaning on the rail,
          staring out to sea, in full hair and make-up.
          
                              ANN
                    I think this is awfully exciting! I've
                    never been on a ship before.
          
                              BRUCE
                    I've never been on one with a woman
                    before.
          
                              ANN
                    I guess you don't think much of women
                    on ships, do you?
          
                              BRUCE
                    No, they're a nuisance.
          
          ANGLE ON: DENHAM looking intently at JIMMY and HAYES who are
          further down the DECK ... talking quietly.

          ANGLE ON: HAYES shoots DENHAM an ALARMED LOOK.
          
                              ANN (O.S.)
                    Well, I'll try not to be.
          
                              BRUCE (O.S.)
                    Just being around is trouble.
          
                              ANN (O.S.)
                    Well! Is that a nice thing to say!
          
                              BRUCE (O.S.)
                    It's a dangerous thing, having girls
                    on ships. They're messy and they're
                    unreliable!
          
                              DENHAM
                             (distracted)
                    Cut! Great!
          
           NGLE ON: DENHAM'S gaze returns to JIMMY and HAYES who are huddled
          in a group with three more SAILORS ... word is travelling fast.
          
                              DENHAM (cont'd)
                    Bruce, wonderful performance. You can
                    relax for ten minutes.
          
          ANGLE ON: BRUCE looking pretty pleased with himself.
          
                              DENHAM (cont'd)
                    That was very natural... I felt moved.
          
          JACK looks on in disbelief.
          
                               B
          ANGLE ON: BRUCE walking past JACK ...
          
                               RUCE
                     hat do you think, Driscoll? The
                    dialogue's got some flow now - huh?
          
                              JACK
                    It was pure effluence.
          
                                BRUCE
                        beefed up the banter ...
          
                              JACK
                    Try to resist that impulse.
          
                              BRUCE
                    It's just a little humor, Bud - what
                    are you, a Bolshevik or something?
          
          JACK watches as BRUCE saunters off ... he turns back to DENHAM.
          
                              JACK
                    Actors. They travel the world but all
                    they ever see is a mirror!

          JACK looks up to see ANN looking dismayed, a MIRROR COMPACT, in
          her hand ...
          
          She quickly snaps the COMPACT shut and turns away.
          
          CLOSE ON: JACK - taken aback.
          
          
          INT. SHIP'S CORRIDOR - DAY
          
          ANN is making her way to the BATHROOM. She looks up as JACK
          rounds a corner coming the other way. They walk toward each
          other.
          
          SUDDENLY the ship sways, JACK is thrown forward, but ANN
          manages to hold her BALANCE.
          
                                 JACK
                    Good legs.
          
          ANN looks at him SHARPLY.
          
                              JACK (cont'd)
                    Sea legs - I meant - you know ... sea
                    legs. Not that you don't have good
                    legs, I was just ...
          
          JACK trails off as ANN edges past him, averting her eyes.
          
                              JACK (cont'd)
                    ... making conversation. Jesus!

                    I know, it wasn't what you wrote. But
                    Mr Baxter felt very strongly that when
                    a man likes a woman - then he must
                    ignore her. And if things turn really
                    hostile ... no?
          
                              JACK
                    Interesting theory.

                    It wasn't what I had intended ... but
                    it -

                    I was nervous.
          
                              JACK
                    It was funny, actually ... you were
                    funny.

          ANN goes to close her CABIN DOOR.

          ANN looks at him.

          ANN turns, TEARS on her cheeks.. lit by the GOLDEN RAYS of the
          SETTING SUN.
          
          ANN stares at JACK, momentarily forgetting where she is. He stares
          back at her.
          
          CLOSE ON: DENHAM catching the EXCHANGE of LOOKS. He takes the
          script pages off JACK and shoos him away ...

          nearby in the doorway.
          
                              ENGLEHORN
                    There's no land south-west for
                    thousands of miles. It takes us way
                    outside the shipping lanes.
          
          ENGLEHORN turns and confronts DENHAM.
          
                              ENGLEHORN (cont'd)
                    I won't sail blind in these waters.

                     'll make it worth your while.
          
           NGLE ON: ENGLEHORN ... tempted by the offer of more money, but
          his instincts are telling him to not to agree.

                    There's nothing out there.
          
                              DENHAM

                    If someone were to tell you this ship
                    is headed for Singapore, what would
                    you say?

                              LUMPY
                    I would say they was full of it, Mr.
                    Hayes. We turned south-west last
                    night.

                    ...
          
          PRESTON glances warily at DENHAM. DENHAM takes in the situation
          and decides to front up.
          
                              DENHAM
                             (quietly)
                    Yes .... we are. We're gonna find
                    Skull Island! We're gonna find it,
                    film it and show it to the world. For

                              LUMPY
                    I wouldn't be so sure of that.
          
                              PRESTON
                    What do you mean?
          
                              LUMPY
                    Seven years ago, me and Mr Hayes - we
                    were working our passage on a
                    Norwegian barque.
          
                              HAYES
                    We picked up a castaway - found him in
                    the water - he'd been drifting for
                    days.
          
                              LUMPY
                    His ship had run aground on an island,
                    way West of Sumatra. An island hidden
                    in fog. He spoke of a huge wall, built
                    so long ago - no one knew who had made
                    it ... A wall a hundred foot high ...
                    as strong today as it was, ages ago.
          
                              PRESTON
                    Why did they build the wall?
          
          SILENCE ...
          
         

          
                                                                  42.
          
                              LUMPY
                    The castaway - he spoke of a creature,
                    neither beast nor man, but something
                    monstrous, living behind that wall...
          
                              DENHAM
                    A lion or a tiger. A man-eater. That's
                    how all these stories start.
          
                              PRESTON
                             (to LUMPY)
                    What else did he say?
          
                              LUMPY
                    Nothing. We found him the next morning
                    ... he'd stuck a knife through his
                    heart.

                     orry fellas, you'll have to do better
                    than that. Monsters belong in B

           t is late at night. JACK sits on his make shift bed, his
          typewriter balanced on his lap ... intent on what he is writing.

          INT. WHEELHOUSE - NIGHT
          
          HAYES is manning the WHEEL. ENGLEHORN is staring at the CHARTS, a
          CIGARETTE in his hand. There is a PALPABLE sense of tension in
          the AIR.
          
                              HAYES
                             (tense)

          smiles as she turns pages of a loose leaf manuscript. ANN looks up
          at JACK.
          
                              ANN
                             (surprised)
                    You're writing a stage comedy?

                    I'm writing it for you.

                    Why would you do that?

                    Why would I write a play for you?

                                 ANN
                    Not to me.

                    Well, it's in the sub-text.
          
                              ANN
                    I guess I must've missed it.
          
                              JACK
                    It's not about words ...
          
          ANN looks at him uncertainly ... as JACK moves towards her ...
          
          He takes her in his arms and kisses her.

                    Did you know that? I've been ordered
                    to divert to Rangoon.

                    What?

          become clear - a GORILLA-LIKE FACE.
          
          ON THE SOUNDTRACK: the sudden blast of the SHIP'S FOG HORN.
          
          DENHAM's eyes shift upwards ...
          
          AT THAT MOMENT a GUST of WIND plucks the MAP from DENHAM'S HAND

                              HAYES
                    We're shallowing!
          
          ENGLEHORN looks with despair at the THICKENING FOG ahead. He
          starts spinning the WHEEL.
          
                              ENGLEHORN
                    20 degrees starboard!

                             (urgent)
                    Captain, you don't know where the hell
                    you're going!
          
          ENGLEHORN glares at HAYES.
          
                              ENGLEHORN
                    Get me another reading!
          
          HAYES leaves ...

          ANGLE ON: JACK looks alarmed as CREWMEN hurry past.
          
          DENHAM walks away from him, towards the front of the SHIP.

                              ENGLEHORN
                    Douse the lights!

          ANGLE ON: JIMMY looking around ... confused.
          
          CLOSE ON: JIMMY'S eyes SUDDENLY WIDEN in DISBELIEF ... he leaps to
          his feet, unable to summon the power of speech!
          
       

          
                                                                   50.
          
          ANGLE ON: A HUGE ROCK FACE looms out of the FOG straight AHEAD!

                             (yelling)
                    Wall! There's a wall ahead!!!
          
          
          EXT. VENTURE - FOGGY NIGHT
          
          ENGLEHORN ... a look of DISBELIEF on his FACE.
          
          
          W
          EXT. VENTURE - FOGGY NIGHT
          
           IDE ON: The VENTURE sails directly towards a HUGE WALL which
          rises up 200 feet into the sky! The SHIP is DWARFED by the
          monstrous structure.
          
          
          INT. WHEELHOUSE - FOGGY NIGHT
          
          ENGLEHORN stares at the LOOMING WALL, unable to believe his
          eyes ... he starts SPINNING the WHEEL hard to STARBOARD!
          
                              ENGLEHORN
                    Stop engines!
          
          ANGLE ON: HAYES slams the TELEGRAPH to "STOP"
          
          
          EXT. VENTURE DECK - FOGGY NIGHT
          
          ANGLE ON: DENHAM is drawn to the FORWARD RAILING of the SHIP,
          looking up at the VAST WALL of ROCK towering over them in AWE.
          
          
          EXT. VENTURE - FOGGY NIGHT

          EXT. CROWSNEST - FOGGY NIGHT

          EXT. VENTURE- FOGGY NIGHT
          
           RUNCH! The BOW of the SHIP crumples in to the WALL!
          
 

                                                                  51.

           NGEL ON: ANN rushes out of a door, on to the DECK, alarmed at
          the PANIC on the SHIP.
          
          ANGLE ON: DENHAM looks in utter AWE at the WALL.
          
          
          INT. VENTURE WHEELHOUSE - FOGGY NIGHT
          
          CLOSE ON: ENGLEHORN yells at HAYES.
          
                              ENGLEHORN
                    Give me some power! Half astern, both!
          
                              HAYES
                    Half astern, both, Captain!
          
          
          EXT. VENTURE DECKS - FOGGY NIGHT
          
           NGLE ON: JACK looks with horror as a JAGGED ROCK looms out of
          the FOG off the starboard bow.
          
                              JACK
                    Rocks!
          
          
          EXT. CROWSNEST - FOGGY NIGHT
          
          ANGLE ON: JIMMY spinning around as he sees ROCKS surrounding
          the SHIP.
          
                              JIMMY
                             (yelling)
                    Rocks to starboard ... to port ...
                    rocks everywhere!
          
          
          INT. VENTURE WHEELHOUSE - FOGGY NIGHT
          
          ANGLE ON: ENGLEHORN lets go of the WHEEL rushing towards the
          WHEELHOUSE DOOR.
          
                              ENGLEHORN
                    Take the wheel, Hayes!
          
          ANGLE ON: ENGLEHORN rushes on to the DECK and looks with HORROR as
          he realises his SHIP is trapped amid a LABYRINTH of ROCKS.
          
          
          EXT. OCEAN - FOGGY NIGHT
          
           he VENTURE lolls WITHOUT POWER in the heavy swell.
          
          The HEAVY THROB of the ENGINES regain strength ... the reverse
          propellers pull the ship away, but still without adequate control.
          
 

          
                                                                  52.
          
          
          EXT. VENTURE DECK - FOGGY NIGHT
          
          ANGLE ON: ANN hurries up the STAIRS ... she clutches the
          RAILING for support and reels off balance, literally FALLING
          into JACK'S ARMS as the side of the VENTURE CRUNCHES against rock.
          
          
          EXT. VENTURE - FOGGY NIGHT
          
          The IMPACT sends the VENTURE into a SLOW SPIN. As the SHIP sinks
          in the trough of a WAVE, MORE ROCKS emerge from the WATER around
          it.
          
          
          EXT. VENTURE DECK - FOGGY NIGHT
          
          JACK looks down at ANN - he still has hold of her.
          
          
          INT. WHEELHOUSE - FOGGY NIGHT
          
          ANGLE ON: ENGLEHORN staggers into the WHEELHOUSE, slamming the
          TELEGRAPH LEVER forward.
          
                                ENGLEHORN
                      Full ahead!
          
          ENGLEHORN takes the WHEEL from HAYES.
          
          
          EXT. VENTURE DECK - FOGGY NIGHT
          
          HAYES runs OUTSIDE
          
                                HAYES
                      Rocks to port, Captain!
          
          
          EXT. OCEAN - FOGGY NIGHT

          ANGLE ON: The VENTURE rides the SWELL towards CAMERA.
          
          SUDDENLY!
          
          A SICKENING GROAN OF METAL ... as the VENTURE RUNS AGROUND on
          HIDDEN ROCKS! HAYES looks in HORROR as he comes within inches of
          the rock outcrop.
          
          
          EXT. VENTURE DECK - FOGGY NIGHT
          
          ANGLE ON: DENHAM watches as a HUGE STONE FACE - part of the ROCK
          OUTCROP they have grounded on - slides to a halt just off the
          VENTURE'S BOW. Weathered ... eroded away ... carved by the hand of
          some ANCIENT PEOPLE.
          
           NGLE ON: A breathless JIMMY scuttles backwards as the CROWSNEST
          settles against the ROCK.
          
      

          
                                                                     53.
          
          ANGLE ON: ENGLEHORN shuts the engines down as his ship GRINDS
          sickeningly against the rock ...
          
          ... STUCK FAST.
          
          PANDEMONIUM ON DECK!
          
           NGLE ON: HAYES, unable to believe his eyes as he STARES up at the
          LOOMING ROCK.
          
          DENHAM stares at the EERIE SILHOUETTE of an ISLAND, visible
          through the thinning FOG. JAGGED PEAKS rise from a ROCKY
          SHORELINE. CRUMBLING RUINS cling to BARREN CLIFFS.
          
          ANN steps closer, a LOOK of total DISBELIEF on her FACE.
          
          
          INT. VENTURE ENGINE ROOM - FOGGY DAWN
          
          CLOSE ON: JETS of WATER are squirting into the ENGINE ROOM,
          through cracks between RIVETED PLATES.
          
          HAYES supervises STOKERS frantically opening valves on the
          PUMPS. OLD MATTRESSES are being shoved up against the LEAKS.
          
          ENGLEHORN arrives, looking GRIM.
          
                                 ENGLEHORN
                    Hayes!
          
                              HAYES
                     he's taken a pounding ...
          
                              ENGLEHORN
                    What about the prop?
          
                              HAYES
                    Shaft's not bent, far as we can tell,
                    but she's stuck hard against the rock -
          
          A LOUD GROAN as the SHIP shifts against the ROCKS.
          
          At that moment JIMMY comes bursting into the ENGINE ROOM.
          
                              JIMMY
                    Captain! You'd better come up quick!
          
          
          EXT. VENTURE DECK / OFFSHORE SKULL ISLAND - FOGGY DAWN
          
          ANGLE ON: ENGLEHORN, HAYES and JIMMY emerge onto the DECK as the
          MILKY LIGHT of DAWN washes over the SHIP.
          
          CLOSE ON: HERB holds the CAMERA as DENHAM cranks the HANDLE.
          
          POV: A WHALER - a small lifeboat - is being ROWED away from the
          VENTURE towards the SHORE of the ISLAND. DENHAM, JACK and ANN,
          HERB, MIKE, BRUCE and FOUR SAILORS are packed into the tiny
          boat.
          
  

          
                                                                  54.
          
                              HAYES
                    You want me to bring them back?
          
                              ENGLEHORN
                    I don't give a damn about Carl Denham
                    ... I want this ship fixed and ready
                    to float on the next high tide. We're
                    leaving Mr. Hayes.
          
          
          EXT. SKULL ISLAND COAST - DAY
          
           IDE ON: The WHALER rows towards the ISLAND passing great STONE
          RUINS jutting out of the WATER. The HUGE WALL rises out of the
          WAVES and disappears INLAND.
          
           NGLE ON: DENHAM is balanced at the front of the BOAT, filming as
          the SAILORS row ashore ...
          
                              DENHAM
                             (quietly)
                    Can you believe this, Jack? ... Skull
                    Island! We got our picture!
          
          ANGLE ON: JACK as he STARES up at the RUINS ...
          
          CLOSE ON: ANN, as if COMPELLED, turns and looks over the side of
          the BOAT, into the SEA ... her breathe catches!
          
          ANN'S POV: Beneath the WATER the HIDEOUSLY, DISTORTED FACE of     a
          FALLEN STATUE gapes up at her ...
          
          ANGLE ON: ANN sitting huddled to one side of the BOAT ... drawing
          her RAIN-SLICKER closer around her ... ANN'S FINGERS edge across
          the seat and curl over JACK'S HAND ...
          
          WIND WHISTLES through the GAPING HOLES in the EDIFICE ... a CREEPY
          MOANING SOUND that mixes with the DEEP BOOM of the CRASHING WAVES
          
          
          EXT. SKULL ISLAND SHORE - DAY
          
           NGLE ON: The WHALER runs onto a tiny, stony BEACH. SHEER CLIFFS
          rise straight up from the SHORE.
          
          DENHAM, JACK, ANN, BRUCE, HERB, MIKE, PRESTON and TWO SAILORS
          clamber out.
          
          
          INT. ANCIENT STAIRCASE - DAY
          
           IDE ON: DENHAM leads HERB, PRESTON, JACK, ANN, BRUCE, MIKE   and
          the TWO SAILORS up a DARK, VAULTED TUNNEL. They look in silence at
          the primitive signs of civilisation.
          
          ANGLE ON: ANN looks up the STAIRCASE nervously ... taking in the
          sight of the HUMAN SKULLS lining the walls.
          
 

          
                                                                  55.
          
          
          EXT. VENTURE - DAY
          
          JIMMY looks up, hollow-eyed ... in his hand is the copy of
          "HEART OF DARKNESS". HAYES stands nearby.
          
          ANGLE ON: JIMMY closing the BOOK, an ashen expression on his
          FACE.
          
                              JIMMY
                    Why does Marlow keep going up the
                    river, why doesn't he turn back?
          
                              HAYES
                              shrugs)
                    There's a part of him that wants to,
                    Jimmy. A part, deep inside himself
                    that sounds a warning, but there's
                    another part, that needs to know ...
                    that needs to defeat the thing which
                    makes him afraid.
          
          CLOSE ON: HAYES pauses, filled with a sudden sense of DREAD.    He
          reluctantly turns, his eyes drawn to the creepy CARVED HEAD
          towering above the SHIP.
          
                              HAYES v/o
                    "We could not understand, because we
                    were too far ... and could not
                    remember, because we were travelling
                    in the night of First Ages ...
          
           LOSE ON: DENHAM obsessed ... cranking the handle of his CAMERA.

                    ... of those Ages that are gone,
                    leaving hardly a sign and no memories

          INT. BURIAL CHAMBER - DAY
          
          DENHAM leads the GROUP across a RICKETY BAMBOO BRIDGE, spanning a
          section of BROKEN PATH. They pass BROKEN TOMBS, burial niches
          containing glimpses of MUMMIES.
          
          AHEAD ... DAYLIGHT streams in as they near the end of the
          STAIRCASE. They make their way over large stone blocks, caved
          in from above ... QUIET, TENSE.
          
          
          EXT. NATIVE VILLAGE/WALL - DAY
          
          THUNDER RUMBLES overhead as DENHAM, JACK, ANN, HERB, BRUCE,
          PRESTON, MIKE and 2 SAILORS clamber out of the RUINED TUNNEL
          MOUTH.
          
          DENHAM stays low, and hurries to a VANTAGE POINT. The OTHERS
          FOLLOW ...
          
        

          
                                                                     56.
          
                              HAYES V/O
                    We are accustomed to look upon the
                    shackled form of a conquered monster,
                    but there, there you could look at a
                    thing monstrous and free."
          
          CRANE UP: to reveal a PLATEAU below them, covered with the RUINS
          of an ANCIENT BURIAL GROUND ... stone MAUSOLEUMS and TOMBS,
          smashed open and destroyed.
          
          
          EXT. VENTURE - DAY
          
          ANGLE ON: JIMMY closes the BOOK.
          
                               JIMMY
                             (quiet)
                    It's not an adventure story - is it,
                    Mr. Hayes.
          
                              HAYES
                             (quiet)
                    No, Jimmy, it's not.
          
          HAYES' EYES drift back to the STATUE. JIMMY follows his GAZE.
          
          
          EXT. NATIVE VILLAGE/WALL - DAY
          
          ANGLE ON: DENHAM as he leads the group into the village.
          
          SPREAD among the RUINS is a VILLAGE - a crude shanty town, created
          by a more recent and far less sophisticated culture ... ramshackle
          GRASS and BAMBOO HUTS.
          
          ANGLE ON: PRESTON looking around, UNNERVED ...
          
                              PRESTON
                    It's deserted ...
          
          ANGLE ON: DENHAM cranking the CAMERA as he rolls film on the
          VILLAGE.
                              DENHAM
                    Of course it's deserted. Use your
                    eyes, Preston. The place is a ruin!
                    Nobody's lived here for hundreds of
                    years.
          
          At the moment they hear the sound of the SOBBING of a HUMAN CHILD
          ...
          
          ANGLES ON: ANN, PRESTON, JACK, DENHAM, HERB ... not knowing if
          they heard what they just heard ...
          
          ROW UPON ROW of sharpened BAMBOO SPIKES line the top of the WALL.
          
          CLOSE ON: DENHAM ... His eyes suddenly widen in disbelief.
          

          
                                                                     57.
          
          ANGLE ON: A SMALL CHILD standing on the DUSTY PATH ahead of them.
          She stares up at them, with weird FERAL EYES.
          
          THE CHILD slowly raises an arm towards the watching GROUP ... in a
          pointing gesture. A suspended moment ... DENHAM steps forward.
          
                              ANN
                             (whispering)
                    Mr Denham ... I think we should go
                    back.
          
                                DENHAM
                        will handle this.
          
          DENHAM pulls a NESTLE BAR from his pocket and walks up to the
          CHILD. DENHAM waves the chocolate around.
          
                              DENHAM (cont'd)
                    Look chocolate ... you like chocolate?
          
          The CHILD'S EYES drill into DENHAM. RAIN STARTS FALLING.
          
                              DENHAM (cont'd)
                    Good to eat! Take it ... take it!
          
          The CHILD steps back. DENHAM grabs the CHILD by the wrist and
          attempts to press the chocolate bar into her HAND. The CHILD
          struggles and CRIES OUT!
          
                              BRUCE.
                    For Godsake, Denham, leave the native
                    alone.
          
                              JACK
                    She doesn't want the chocolate!
          
          ANGLE ON: VILLAGERS begin to melt out of the shadows, OLD PEOPLE,
          YOUNG PEOPLE, WOMEN stare HOLLOW-EYED at DENHAM as he wrestles
          with the CHILD.
          
           he CHILD sinks her TEETH into DENHAM'S WRIST. He yells, releasing
          his grip. The CHILD runs off ... in to the arms of an OLD WOMAN
          ...
          
               

                                                                  58.
          
          The GROUP starts to nervously walk forward, DENHAM gestures
          impatiently.
          
                              DENHAM
                     t's alright - it's just a bunch of
                    women and old folks ... they're
                    harmless.
          
          ANGLE ON: ANN looks STARTLED as MIKE suddenly LURCHES past her.
          
                              ANN
                    Mike?
          
          MIKE turns, gasping, staring at her helplessly! And then FALLS
          face forward, a JAGGED SPEAR stuck in his BACK!
          
          ANN steps back in HORROR and SCREAMS!
          
          A RUMBLING, BESTIAL ROAR fills the VILLAGE as if in answer to
          ANN'S CRY ... LOUD and CLOSE ... for a brief moment everyone
          freezes ...
          F
           AST ACTION: NATIVE MEN emerge as if from NOWHERE ... before
          anyone can react, they are roughly SHOVED and PULLED into the
          MIDST of the FURIOUS NATIVE MOB.
          
          In the SHADOWS the agitated WOMEN of the VILLAGE start rocking and
          wailing in unison.
          
          IMAGES: STRANGE FACES, smeared with MUD ... SCREECHING MOUTHS.
          BRUCE is HELD BACK by SEVERAL NATIVES as he struggles. JACK
          pulls ANN close to him, trying to protect her. ANN is wrenched
          from him ...
          
          She struggles against her captors ...
          
          ANGLE ON: A OLD-WOMAN moves through the midst of the VILLAGERS ...
          her gaze fixed on ANN, muttering curses, eyes burning with a dark
          fury ...
          
          DENHAM is YELLING at the NATIVES ... he is SHOVED to the GROUND.
          
          The NATIVES SHRIEK. One of the SAILORS is DRAGGED forward, his
          HEAD pushed against a FLAT STONE SLAB, and CLUBBED TO DEATH.
          
          ANGLE ON: In the midst of the CONFUSION, JACK sees the          OLD
          SHA-WOMAN screaming at ANN. She starts chanting with rising
          HYSTERICS ...
          
                              SHA-WOMAN
                             (chanting)
                    Larri yu sano korê ... Kweh yonê
                    kah`weh ad-larr ... torê Kông.
          
          CLOSE ON: JACK struggles, fists flying - he is clubbed and DROPS
          like a stone.
          
          ANN SCREAMS ... the BEAST ROARS in the DISTANCE!
          
                             

          
                                                                  59.
          
          DENHAM punches a NATIVE ... they haul him forward and thrust
          his HEAD onto the BLOOD SPLATTERED STONE ... NATIVE CLUBS rise
          into the air ...
          
           .. a GUNSHOT!
          
          The NATIVES hesitate, as if STUNNED ... then SCATTER.
          
          ENGLEHORN, HAYES and an ARMED GROUP of SAILORS race into the
          VILLAGE!
          
          ENGLEHORN roughly hauls DENHAM to his feet.
          
                               ENGLEHORN
                     Seen enough?

                     Lighten the ship! Anything that's not
                     bolted down goes overboard!

          DENHAM is swigging from a HIP FLASK. HERB and PRESTON are gathered
          gloomily around a TABLE, while DENHAM strides around the ROOM,
          swigging and talking in a animated fashion. The STORM BATTERS and
          CRASHES outside.
          
                               DENHAM
                     We got away. We gotta be grateful for
                     that gentlemen.
          
                               PRESTON
                     What about Mike? He didn't get away -
                     he's still there!

                              (sharply)
                     Mike died doing what he believed in!
                     He didn't die for nothing. And I'll
                     tell you something else - I'm going to
                     finish this film - for Mike.

          CLOSE ON: A withered old WOMAN, EYES RED in some DRUG induced
          TRANCE, speaks in TONGUES. ANN is forced to her knees.

                       What the hell are you doing? You want
                       that boat to sink? Stow those rifles

          EXT. SKULL ISLAND COAST - NIGHT
          
          ANGLE ON: the TINY BOATS are tossed in the RAGING SEAS. SAILORS

          looking out onto DARK TREE TOPS.
          F
           LAMES DANCE ... DRUMS BEAT in a RITUALISTIC FRENZY.
          
          ANGLE ON: SKULL ISLANDERS knock away WOODEN PLUGS, releasing the
          FLAMING OIL to pour down rough CHANNELS hewn into the STONE of the
          WALL ... it runs and falls down CHUTES into POOLS carved into the
          GROTTO WALLS.
          
          WIDE ON: The CLIFF WALLS light up as FLAMES within LARGE CARVED
          CHAMBERS create huge backlit PAGAN FACES.
          
          FIRELIGHT dances across the nightmarish JUNGLE ... DISTANT TREES
          start to TREMBLE, their canopies swaying as if PUSHED by an UNSEEN
          FORCE.
          
          CLOSE ON: ANN ... looking on with HORROR at the MOVEMENT in the
          JUNGLE below her. She struggles against the ROPES, to no avail.
          
          CLOSE ON: The OLD WOMAN, eyes rolled up in her head.
          
           LOSE ON: A NECKLACE is placed over ANN'S head.

          ANGLE ON: A SHAMAN starts BEATING out a RHYTHM on a LOG DRUM ...
          SKULL ISLANDERS fall to their KNEES ... a MOANING WAIL rises ...
          the DRUMMING builds to a FRENZIED CLIMAX.
          
          WIDE ON: On the OTHER SIDE, the WALL falls away vertically into a
          ROCKY GROTTO, leading into the DENSE TANGLED JUNGLE of SKULL
          ISLAND.
          
          SUDDENLY ANN feels herself DRAGGED FORWARD ... the POSTS she is
          tied to are MOVING, pulling her TOWARDS the EDGE of the WALL! ANN
          digs her heels and tries to PULL AGAINST it, but is unable to stop
          herself being HAULED OFF THE WALL ...
          .
           .. into thin air!
          
          ANGLE ON: SKULL ISLANDERS lowering the BAMBOO ALTAR STRUCTURE
          DOWN, slowly releasing the flaxen ROPE.
          
          ANN is dangling from the POSTS by her WRISTS, as the HINGED
          FRAMEWORK swings her out over the CHASM, LOWERING her towards a
          ROCK PROMONTORY on the EDGE of the FOREST.
          
           NGLE ON: ANN is LOWERED onto the ROCK PROMONTORY, which resembles
          an ALTAR ... ANN struggles to free herself, but she is tied fast
          to the posts, a TINY FIGURE illuminated by enormous GLOWING
          CARVINGS ... the WALL towering up behind her.
          
          ANGLES ON: ANN squirms ... as the FOREST BELOW HER BROILS and
          SEETHES! TREES are violently SWAYING ... above the crescendo of
          the NATIVE FRENZY, ANGRY BESTIAL ROARS can be heard.
          
          SKULL ISLANDERS line the TOP of the WALL, their WAILING and
          CHANTING interrupted by a LOUD SPLINTERING SOUND.
          
          
          EXT. SKULL ISLAND SHORE - NIGHT
          
          The SHIP'S BOATS pull up at the foot of the great STAIRCASE. JACK
          leaps out of the BOAT and races up the stairs.
          
          
          EXT. WALL GROTTO - NIGHT
          
          CLOSE ON: ANN lifts her head ... something VERY BIG is moving
          towards HER.
          
          ANN catches a BRIEF GLIMPSE of a HUGE DARK SHAPE propelling itself
          THROUGH the JUNGLE ... the OILY SMOKE from the FIRES hangs in the
          air, OBSCURING HER VISION ... she can now only hear the CREATURE'S
          MOVEMENTS and BREATH as it draws ever closer.
          
          ANN cowers back, pulling at her bonds.
          
          A MASSIVE SHAPE moves through the air ... The ground SHAKES with a
          sudden force of IMPACT!
          
          ANGLE ON: ANN stands trembling, as the swirling smokey cloud
          slowly DISSIPATES ... a GIANT LEATHERY FOOT is visible.
          
          CLOSE ON: ANN balanced on a knife-edge of TERROR.
          
         

                                                                  66.
          
          A SUDDEN PUFF OF WIND INSTANTLY CLEARS THE VEILING SMOKE.
          
          ANN slowly LOOKS UP, her face filled with DREAD.
          
          The SKULL ISLANDERS reply in UNISON ... a piercing WAIL, from the
          TOP of the WALL.
          
          ANN'S strength suddenly DRAINS from her legs, and SLUMPS between
          the POSTS.
          
          Before her is ... KONG!
          
          A 25 FOOT TALL MALE GORILLA! KONG stares at ANN for a beat,
          leaning forward on his KNUCKLES ... then prods her with his
          finger.
          
          SUDDENLY ... GUNSHOTS!
          
          
          EXT. NATIVE VILLAGE/WALL - NIGHT
          
          FRENZIED MOVEMENT: SAILORS, lead by ENGLEHORN, race into the

          SCATTER in TERROR ...
          
          
          EXT. WALL GROTTO - NIGHT
          
           IDE ON: KONG in front of ANN ... HE RISES to his full height and
          BEATS HIS CHEST!
          
          KONG'S HUGE HAND snatches ANN and roughly PULLS her free of her
          bonds.
          
              DEAFENING ROAR!
          
          ANN SCREAMS!
          
          CLUTCHING her tightly, KONG carries ANN away from the ALTAR.

          vanishing as fast as they appeared.
          
          ... from behind the WALL, the DISTANT CRY of ANN screaming for
          help, following by an EARTH SHUDDERING ROAR.
          
                                ENGLEHORN
                               (staring upwards)
                      What in God's name was that?
          
                                JACK
                               (sudden realisation)
                      Behind the wall!
          
         

          
                                                                     67.

          ...
          
          DENHAM hurries to the massive, heavily fortified gate.

           LOSE ON: DENHAM staring through the LATTICE WORK of sharpened
          bamboo ...
          
          DENHAM'S POV: A fleeting glimpse of KONG disappearing into the
          depths of the jungle. In his HUGE FIST KONG clutches ANN!
          
          
          EXT. TOP OF WALL - NIGHT
          
           NGLE ON: JACK has reached the top of the WALL ... he races to the
          EDGE peering over it. Nothing ... only the primitive ALTAR, and
          beyond, DARK JUNGLE dissolving into BLACKNESS.
          
          JACK'S POV: The EMPTY ROPES binding ANN'S WRISTS swing from the
          ALTAR POSTS.
          
                                JACK
                               (disbelief)

           ACK is hurrying down from the WALL.
          
                                JACK
                      She's gone!
          
          CLOSE ON: DENHAM in SHOCK ... his mind racing, fuelled by FEAR.
          Gradually his breathing slows and another part of his brain kicks
          into gear.
          
          JACK makes brief eye contact with DENHAM, who quickly looks away.
          
                                JACK (cont'd)
                      Carl? What is it?
                               (realizing)
                      You saw something ...
          
          LATER ...
          
          ANGLE ON: BOXES of AMMUNITION and GUNS have been brought up      from
          the beach. Lids are prised open ... AMMO distributed.
          
          DENHAM is surrounded by JACK, ENGLEHORN and the SAILORS.
          
                                ENGLEHORN
                      You can take Hayes and fifteen others.
                      I'll put a guard on the gate until you
                      return ... The rest of you, stay with
                      the ship.
          
          JACK grabs his PACK and WALKS away TOWARDS THE GATE, with LUMPY &
          JIMMY following.
          
           

                                                                  68.
          
                              HAYES
                    Not you, Jimmy.
          
                              JIMMY
                    Com'on Mr. Hayes, look at `em. None of
                    them knows a which way to point a gun.
          
          HAYES takes the RIFLE out of JIMMY'S HANDS.
          
                                 HAYES
                    Stay here.
          
                              JIMMY
                    Miss Darrow needs me!
          
                                 HAYES
                    No!
          
          CLOSE ON: JIMMY, crestfallen.
          
          ANGLE ON: DENHAM by the CAMERA BOXES with HERB and PRESTON.
          
                              DENHAM
                             (quietly)
                    Bring the tripod - and all of the film
                    stock.
          
                              HERB
                    You wanna go with the six inch lens?
          
                              DENHAM
                    The wide angle will do just fine.
          
          CLOSE ON: PRESTON slings the FILM STOCK BAG over his SHOULDER.

          ANGLE ON: JACK, PRESTON, HAYES, LUMPY, CHOY, BRUCE and 8 SAILORS
          as ENGLEHORN surveys the GROUP. DENHAM and HERB are HAULING CAMERA
          EQUIPMENT.
          
                              ENGLEHORN
                    You got guns, you got food, you got
                    ammo. You got twenty-four hours.
          
                              BRUCE
                    Twenty-four hours?
          
                              ENGLEHORN
                    This time tomorrow we haul anchor.
          
          CLOSE ON: JACK ... as he slings his GUN on his shoulder, turns
          and HEADS through the GATE.
          
          
          EXT. SKULL ISLAND JUNGLE -     NIGHT
          
          WIDE ON: The VOLCANIC ROCKS form a JAGGED, TORTURED LANDSCAPE of
          DEEP CREVASSES and TOWERING CLIFFS. The vegetation is THICK, the
          JUNGLE DARK. ANCIENT GNARLED TREES twist out of the ground, thick
          LICHEN and long MOSSES hang from branches and TANGLED VINES. STEAM
          RISES from festering SWAMPS ...
          
  

          
          
                                                                  69.
          
          HAYES is LEADING DENHAM, JACK, PRESTON, LUMPY, CHOY, BRUCE and
          EIGHT SAILORS. HERB is limping along with the heavy CAMERA on his
          shoulder.
          
          The atmosphere is TENSE ... unseen creatures scurry in the
          darkness, fleeing from the approaching humans.
          
          HAYES puts his hands up ... the GROUP stops ... a STRANGE, LOW
          MOAN echoes from the SURROUNDING JUNGLE ... The MEN stare into the
          darkness ... watchful, on edge ...
          
          
          EXT. KILLING GROUND - NIGHT
          
          CLOSE ON: ANN in KONG'S HAND, being tossed around like a rag doll
          as KONG RUNS through the FOREST.
          
           NGLE ON: KONG propels himself through the JUNGLE with EASE,
          barely disturbing the forest, moving with GRACE along a well used
          route.
          
           LOSE ON: ANN held fast in his GRIP. She is FLUNG wildly around as
          KONG BOUNDS across CHASMS, LEAPING over rivers.
          
          ANN'S FEVERED POV: The JUNGLE SPINNING and BLURRING by. She tries
          to brace herself against KONG'S FINGERS, but the rigors of the
          journey knock her sideways like a RAG DOLL.
          
          WIDE ON: SHAFTS of MOONLIGHT play on the faces of grotesque
          STATUES set into a MOSSY CLIFF.
          
          ANGLE ON: ANN clutched tightly in KONG'S HAND. She is rigid with
          FEAR. KONG squats down ... he LOOKS CLOSELY at ANN.
          
          CLOSE ON: KONG ... we see him clearly for the first time. A very
          old, brutish BULL GORILLA. Years of survival have left SCARS on
          his face. One EYE LID is mangled and his JAW is CROOKED ...
          leaving a huge yellowed INCISOR TOOTH jutting up.
          
          KONG stares at ANN ... she dare not move; only her RAPID BREATHING
          belies her INNER TERROR.
          
          ANGLE ON: ANN is suddenly swung UPSIDE DOWN and SHAKEN ... the
          ceremonial NECKLACE falls from ANN'S NECK.

          CLOSE ON: ANN'S HORRIFIED FACE ... she sees HUMAN REMAINS amongst
          the NECKLACES! Bones ... skulls! A WHIMPERING SOUND escapes from
          the back of her throat.
          
          SWIRLING UPSIDE DOWN POV: The NECKLACE lands on the ground - amid
          DOZENS of OTHER NECKLACES littering the clearing.
          
          ANGLE ON: ANN is lifted UPWARDS ... KONG'S LIPS curl in a low,
          slow SNARL.
          
          ANN looks at KONG, aghast, and in this moment her heightened sense
          of FEAR gives way to something more fundamental: SELF
          PRESERVATION!
          

          
                                                                   70.
          
          KONG'S FINGERS start to OPEN - ANN seizes her chance! She suddenly
          PROPELS herself off his HAND! ANN DROPS 12 feet and lands heavily
          at KONG'S FEET. She rolls amongst grinning HUMAN SKULLS and LEG
          BONES ... staggers to her feet and RUNS!
          
          KONG rises up with a ROAR, but ANN is already disappearing into
          the JUNGLE!
          
          
          EXT. DENSE JUNGLE - NIGHT
          
            NGLES ON: ANN desperately powering through the DENSE UNDERGROWTH.
          She throws herself over huge FALLEN LOGS, through TANGLED VINES.
          .
          She GLANCES BACK ...
          
           .. TREES are FALLING, KONG is smashing through the undergrowth
          after her!
          
          ANGLE ON: With surprising AGILITY and GRACE, KONG sweeps down from
          above and SCOOPS ANN off the ROCK. She barely has time to CRY OUT
          before being CARRIED AWAY, as KONG disappears into the DEPTHS of
          the ISLAND.
          
          
          EXT. TANGLED VINES - NIGHT
          
          CLOSE ON: JACK ... hearing ANN'S DISTANT SCREAMS!
          
                              JACK
                    Ann!
          
          ANGLE ON: JACK starts RUNNING towards the SOUND. DENHAM and the
          OTHERS follow ... JACK is barging through THICK TANGLED
          VEGETATION, which is growing between huge moss covered FALLEN
          COLUMNS.
          
          KONG'S ENRAGED ROAR echos through the JUNGLE.
          
                              JACK (cont'd)
                             (yelling)
                    Ann!
          
          
          EXT. TANGLED VINES - NIGHT
          
          ANGLE ON: The GROUP pause at the sound of ANN'S TERRIFIED SCREAM.
          
          CLOSE ON: JACK'S ashen face.
          
          
          EXT. DENSE JUNGLE - NIGHT
          
           ONG LEAPS ACROSS CHASMS as he CARRIES ANN through the JUNGLE.
          
          
          EXT. KILLING GROUND - DAWN
          
          ANGLE ON: JACK picks up ANN'S NECKLACE ... a LOCK of BLONDE    HAIR
          still tangled within it's STRANDS ...
          

          
                                                                  71.
          
          WIDE ON: DAWN LIGHT brightens the SKY as the GROUP survey the
          KILLING GROUND.
          
                              LUMPY
                    Christ! It's a bleeding bone yard!
                             (horrified realization)
                    They've been ripped limb from limb.
          
                                 JACK
                                (calling)
                    ANN! Ann!
          
          ANGLE ON: DENHAM casts an eye over the DEBRIS STREWN GROUND ...
          his gaze rising to a HUGE GASH in the FOREST ...
          
          DENHAM POV: TREES have been RIPPED from the earth where KONG    has
          SMASHED a path through the JUNGLE ...
          
          ANGLE ON: HAYES notices a SAILOR with a WOOLLEN HAT pulled   down
          over his head ... the SAILOR has turned away from the GRISLY
          REMAINS. HAYES bats the hat off the SAILOR'S HEAD ... it's JIMMY.
          
                              JIMMY
                    Just keep walking, Mr. Hayes. Pretend
                    you didn't see me.
          
                              HAYES
                     esus, Jimmy!
          
          HAYES snatches the GUN off him ...
          
                              JIMMY
                              defiant)
                    Hey! I need that!
          
                              HAYES
                             (angry)
                    I'm not giving you a gun!
          
                              JIMMY
                    You were younger than me when they
                    gave you one!
          
                              HAYES
                    I was in the army. I was trained - I
                    had a drill sergeant!
          
          CLOSE ON: JIMMY looks at HAYES.
          
                               IMMY
                              quietly)
                    I just wanna help bring her back.
          
          HAYES's expression softens. He hands the gun back to JIMMY.
          
                              HAYES
                    Don't make me regret it.
          
   

                                                                  72.
          
          
          EXT. ROUGH TERRAIN - DAY
          
          ANGLE ON: The GROUP'S NERVES are FRAYED ... as they continue
          slogging through the difficult TERRAIN. HUGE INSECTS fly around
          them, AND THE GROUP try in vain to SWAT them away.
          
          ANGLE ON: LUMPY shooting WILDLY at a HUGE BUG ...
          
                              HAYES
                              growling)
                    Conserve your ammunition!
          
          LUMPY GLARES at HAYES ... and SHOOTS one last time at a HUGE BUG
          ON A NEARBY TREE ...
          
          
          EXT. RUINED VALLEY - DAY
          
          ANGLE ON: SLIDING FEET ... down a VINE strewn slope.
          
           ULL BACK to reveal ... the GROUP have emerged from the JUNGLE
          into a NARROW VALLEY, deep in the heart of SKULL ISLAND ... The
          VALLEY is less than 75 feet wide, flanked by sheer CLIFFS.
          
          JACK looks up and down the VALLEY ... he wipes his brow ..    the
          SUN is high, it is hot out of the SHADE.
          
          ANGLE ON: LUMPY stumbling forward with a hacking SMOKER'S COUGH.
          
                              LUMPY
                    I'm knackered! I've gotta have a
                    breather.
          
          LUMPY flops down on the ground, and grabs a cigarette from behind
          his ear and lights up.
          
          JACK watches as OTHER SAILORS follow suit.
          
                              JACK
                    Hey fellas - we don't have time for
                    this. We've lost too much ground
                    already! Come on, - get up!

                              HAYES
                             (quiet)
                    They're not about to quit on you. Cut
                    them some slack.
          
          JACK stares at HAYES and then sighs, resigned.
          
          HAYES calls to the MEN ...
          
                              HAYES (cont'd)
                    Alright, you got five minutes!
                    Everybody stay in sight!
          
          ANGLE ON: DENHAM grabs the CAMERA from HERB. Nearby PRESTON sets
          up the TRIPOD.
          

                                                                     73.
          
                              DENHAM
                             (hushed)
                    Over here. I wanna get a wide shot of
                    the valley.
          
           NGLE ON: DENHAM as he arrives at the top of the SLOPE, he       turns
          at the sound of a STRANGE NOISE ...
          
          PUSH IN: ON DENHAM ... a look of AMAZEMENT dawning on his FACE.
          
          CLOSE ON: JACK kneels down and stares at an unmistakable     indent
          in the sand: a GIANT FOOTPRINT!
          
                              LUMPY
                    Bloody Nora!
          
          JACK looks up to see SAILORS gathering around.
          
                              JIMMY
                    Is that what took Miss Darrow?
          
                              LUMPY
                             (sagely)
                    There's only one creature capable of
                    leaving a footprint that size ...
          
          ALL look up at LUMPY ...
          
                              LUMPY (cont'd)
                    The abominable snowman!
          
          A ripple of FEAR spreads throughout the CROWD.
          
          The RATTLED SAILORS mutter agreement. There is random chatter of
          turning back.
          
          HAYES kneels down beside JACK ...
          
                               HAYES
                             (quiet)
                    It's gotta be - what? Twenty - twenty-
                    five feet?
          
                              JACK
                             (grimly)
                    Carl saw it. Let's ask him.
          
          HAYES looks over his SHOULDER ...

                    Where'd he go?
          
          ANGLE ON: JACK walking up the VALLEY.
          
                                  JACK
                    Carl!!!
          
              

          
                                                                     74.
          
          WIDE ON: DENHAM, BRUCE and HERB arrive at the TOP of the VALLEY
          A
          ... they stare transfixed at a HERD of grazing BRONTOSAURS.
          
           NGLE ON: DENHAM is cranking the CAMERA ...
          
                              DENHAM
                              low)
                    Walk forward, Bruce.
          
                                 BRUCE
                    What?!
          
          ANGLE ON: a HERD of TWELVE BRONTOSAURS are slowly moving through a
          WIDE CLEARING ahead.
          
                              DENHAM
                    You're the star of this picture! Get
                    into character and head towards the
                    animals.
          
          ANGLE ON: BRUCE nervously SHUFFLES forward ...
          
                               BRUCE
                    What the hell kind of place is this?
                              (beat)
                    Are you sure about this, Denham???
                    Don't we have a stand-in for this type
                    of thing?
          
                              DENHAM
                      need you in the shot, or people will
                    say they're fake.
          
                              BRUCE
                    Nobody's gonna think these are fake!
          
          SUDDEN flash of MOVEMENT! CARNOTAURS are circling the HERD.
          
          ANGLE ON: the BRONTOSAUR HERD looking EDGY and RESTLESS!
          
                              DENHAM
                     ou're making them nervous! No sudden
                    movement.
          
                              BRUCE
                    I'm not moving.
          
          A LOW RUMBLING SOUND can now be heard ... the GROUND starts to
          SHAKE ...
          
          PUSH IN: on BRUCE as he realizes what is about to HAPPEN!
          
                              BRUCE (cont'd)
                             (under his breath)
                    Mother of God ...
          
          ANGLE ON: BRUCE suddenly turns and runs!
          
          ANGLE ON: HERB is starting to get NERVOUS as DENHAM determinedly
          continues filming ...
          
                                                                  75.
          
          WIDE ON: A sudden FALL of ROCKS ... Jack looks up!
          
          ANGLE ON: The MEN look NERVOUS as the GROUND starts to TREMBLE
          beneath their feet!
          
          JACK turns and sees: BRUCE running down the hill ...
          
                              JACK
                    What is it?! Where's Carl?
          
          BRUCE slows down, attempting to appear CALM.
          
                              BRUCE
                    He's - he's ... um ... well, he's up
                    there ... filming.
          
          A LOUD ROAR!
          
          BRUCE bolts like a STARTLED RABBIT!
          
          SEVERAL nervous SAILORS jump up and start running.
          
          ANGLE ON: JACK cautiously moves uphill towards the source of the
          LOUD RUMBLING SOUND.
          A
           NGLE ON: DENHAM and HERB appear on the brow of the HILL. They are
          running flat out towards JACK!
          
          Seconds later a HERD of BRONTOSAURUS stampede down the hill after
          DENHAM and HERB!
          
                                DENHAM
                    Run Jack!
          
                              JACK
                    Holy Christ!
          
                              HAYES
                             (yelling)
                    Go Jimmy - Run!
          
          EVERYONE TURNS and FLEES!
          
          ANGLE ON: JACK running ... he looks back and sees DENHAM trip and
          fall!
          
          The STAMPEDING DINOSAURS storm towards DENHAM down the NARROW
          VALLEY!
          
          CLOSE ON: DENHAM is frozen to the spot, staring at the CAMERA,
          which is lying directly in the rampaging DINOSAUR'S PATH.
          
          JACK turns back ... he attempts to drag DENHAM to his FEET, as
          DENHAM struggles to grab hold of the CAMERA and TRIPOD.
          
                              JACK
                    Leave it!!!
          
                                DENHAM
                    No!!!
          

          
                                                                  76.
          
          DENHAM and JACK scramble to their feet and start to RUN!   DENHAM
          cradles the CAMERA and TRIPOD in his ARMS, as the   BRONTO PACK
          bears down on them from behind!
          
          Spectacular TRACKING SHOT: ... The PACK of 15 CARNOTAURS are
          CLOSING IN on the BRONTOSAURUS HERD! A CARNOTAUR leaps onto the
          back of a FLEEING BRONTOSAUR, causing it to falter and slide
          against the cliff. TWO MORE CARNOTAURS leap onto the ailing
          BRONTOSAUR as the rest of the pack stream past.
          
          DENHAM, JACK and the OTHERS are running as fast as they can ...
          JACK glances over his shoulder - the WALL of THUNDERING BRONTOSAUR
          LEGS are about to ENGULF THEM!
          A
           NGLE ON: JACK and DENHAM suddenly find themselves in a SEA of
          HUGE LEGS - like wildly pounding Redwood tree trunks! The
          CARNOTAURS are snapping and snarling at the LEGS ... they see the
          MEN! Their only hope of survival is to stay WITHIN THE STAMPEDE,
          out of reach of the MEATEATERS!
          
          QUICK IMAGES: THE GROUP in the SEA of LEGS ... a SAILOR trips and
          is CRUSHED UNDERFOOT. A COUPLE OF SAILORS jump clear of the
          BRONTOSAURS - only to be set on by the CARNOTAURS. JACK ... DENHAM
          ... SAILORS ... everyone is running madly, dodging BRONTOSAURS,
          CARNOTAURS and trying not to fall!
          
          A CARNOTAUR focuses on JACK ... it skillfully weaves IN BETWEEN
          and UNDER the BRONTOSAURS and emerges right behind JACK, it's
          SNAPPING JAWS inches away from his head!
          
           ACK suddenly SIDE-STEPS, and SHOULDER-BARGES the CARNOTAUR
          SIDEWAYS - under a BRONTOSAUR'S LEGS. The CARNOTAUR is instantly
          trampled!
          
          BRUCE is managing to stay ahead of the stampede - possibly RUNNING
          FASTER than any human before him! A CARNOTAUR races out in front
          of the stampede and bears down on BRUCE with incredible speed!
          BRUCE desperately waves a TOMMY GUN at the CARNOTAUR ... TOWARDS
          THE STAMPEDE!
          
          JACK sees it coming ...
          
                              JACK
                             (yelling)
                    No!!!!
          
          BRUCE FIRES, missing the CARNOTAUR ...
          
          ... but he hits the LEAD BRONTOSAUR, following behind, in the
          chest. The BRONTOSAUR COLLAPSES AT TOP SPEED! It CARTWHEELS OVER,
          it's huge NECK and TAIL thrashing out. The OTHER BRONTOSAURS
          PLOUGH INTO IT, tripping and rolling!
          
          JACK and the SAILORS suddenly find themselves in the middle of an
          amazing FLESHY FREIGHT TRAIN PILE-UP! SAILORS are crushed as
          BRONTOSAURS come down on top of them! A CARNOTAUR is squashed when
          TWO BRONTOSAURS slam together.
          
          JACK rolls against a rock as MOUNTAINS of BRONTOSAUR TUMBLE all
          around him.
          
                           

          
                                                                   77.
          
          DENHAM throws himself onto the ground, shielding the CAMERA.
          
            n the space of seconds, the MIGHTY HERD OF BEHEMOTHS is reduced
          to a VAST PILE of DEAD or WOUNDED ANIMALS ... The CARNOTAURS
          immediately go to work, leaping onto BRONTOSAURS, ripping into
          fleshy stomachs.
          J
           ACK crawls past huge HEAVING BELLIES and TWITCHING LEGS ... he
          staggers out of the DINOSAUR PILE-UP ... he turns back at the
          SOUND OF LOUD HISSING - a CARNOTAURUS is climbing over a DEAD
          BRONTOSAUR, it's gleaming eyes intent on JACK. The CARNOTAURUS
          leaps ...
          
          BAM! BAM! BAM! The CARNOTAURUS is riddled with BULLETS and falls
          DEAD at JACK'S FEET!
          
          HAYES hurries towards JACK, clutching his TOMMY GUN!
          
                               HAYES
                              (yelling)
                    Go! Go!
          
          HAYES sends the rest of the MEN up a steep ROCKY SLOPE ... they
          SLIP and SLIDE on the SLIMY MOSS-COVERED ROCKS.
          
          JACK doesn't move. He looks around in mounting panic.
          
                              JACK
                             (frantic)
                    Carl!? Carl?! Get up!
          
          DENHAM limps out of the PILE-UP, bloodied and covered in DUST -
          the CAMERA in his arms.
          
          HAYES blasts at another CARNOTAURUS - it TOPPLES BACKWARDS.
          
                               HAYES
                    Run!
          
          
          EXT. SLIMY SLOPE - DAY
          
          The GROUP are desperately scrambling up the STEEP ROCKY SLOPE -
          slipping and sliding on the WET MOSS ... FOUR SURVIVING CARNOTAURS
          follow in pursuit ... the MEN start sliding backwards in their
          panic. The CARNOTAURS are sliding too, but their powerful legs are
          working furiously, propelling them closer and closer to the
          flailing SAILORS!
          
          A SAILOR loses his footing completely ... he rolls past TWO
          CARNOTAURS before being grabbed by the JAWS of the THIRD.
          
          The MEN grab hold of WEEDS, ROCKS ... ANYTHING, to get away from
          the DINOSAURS. They are crawling towards a network of NARROW
          FISSURES between HUGE ROCKS ... which the CARNOTAURS cannot
          squeeze through.
          
          ANGLE ON: HERB is scrabbling up as best as he can with his bad leg
          ... DENHAM moves towards him, reaching desperately ...
          

                                                                  78.
          
                              DENHAM
                    Herb! Come on!
          
                              HERB
                             (gasping)
                    Mr Denham ... ! Take the tripod.
          
                              DENHAM
                    Come on Herb - I'm pulling you up.
                    Come on, hold on to your end.
          
                              HERB
                             (gasping)
                    You gotta go!!
          
                              DENHAM
                    I'm not going anywhere without you!
          
                              HERB
                    You gotta leave me!
          
          HERB is straining to hold the TRIPOD when his GAMMY LEG gives way
          ... he SLIPS and ROLLS into the path of an oncoming CARNOTAUR!
          
          CLOSE ON: DENHAM reacting in SHOCK as HERB is KILLED by the
          frenzying CARNOTAURS.
          
          
          EXT. JUNGLE RUINS - DAY
          
          ANGLE ON: KONG drops ANN onto the ground. She LANDS in a LIFELESS
          heap.
          
          KONG has dropped ANN in a small RUINED COURTYARD, it's WALLS are
          cracked and split by encroaching JUNGLE CREEPERS.
          
           IDE ON: KONG circles around ANN who lies MOTIONLESS on the
          GROUND. He PRODS her ROUGHLY with a FINGER ... no response.   KONG
          GROWLS ... PRODS AGAIN ... ANN lies STILL.
          
           LOSE ON: ANN ... she slowly OPENS HER EYES! ANN looks warily
          towards KONG.
          
          
          EXT. EDGE OF SWAMP - DAY
          
           ACK, DENHAM, HAYES, BRUCE, JIMMY, LUMPY, CHOY and PRESTON clamber
          down a JAGGED ROCK face into lush sub-tropical VEGETATION. They
          are followed by a few surviving SAILORS - a bedraggled GROUP ...
          CUT, BRUISED, COVERED in DUST, SOAKED in SWEAT. Most of the GUNS
          are lost.
          
           AILORS slump to the ground, EXHAUSTED.
          
          They are on a NARROW CLEARING at the edge of a MISTY SWAMP. SHEER
          CLIFFS rise out of the SWAMP on both sides of the SHORE.
          
                              HAYES
                    Jimmy, do a head count. I wanna know
                    how many injured and how bad -
          
                                                                  79.
          
                              LUMPY
                             (interrupting)
                    Injured? Four of us are dead!
          
          CLOSE ON: DENHAM reaches with a trembling hand for his HIP FLASK.
          He takes a big SWIG ... and stands staring out over the SWAMP.
          PRESTON sits on A TREE STUMP nearby.

                               PRESTON
                    It's not your fault. What happened to
                    Herb - it's no ones fault.
          
                              DENHAM
                             (soft realization)
                    You're absolutely right, Preston ...
                    And I'll tell you something else.
                    Herbert didn't die for nothing. He
                    died for what he believed in and I'm
                    gonna honour that.
          
          CLOSE ON: DENHAM reaching for that moment of self justification.
          
                               DENHAM (cont'd)
                    He died believing there is still some
                    mystery left in this world - and we
                    can all have a piece of it - for the
                    price of an admission ticket!
                              (excited)
                    Goddammit Preston we're gonna finish
                    this film for Herb. We'll finish it,
                    and donate the proceeds to his wife
                    and kids.
          
          CLOSE ON: PRESTON, he has heard this all before.
          
          WIDE ON: BRUCE stands amongst the SEATED SAILORS.
          
                              BRUCE
                             (desperate)
                    We gotta get back to the ship.
                    Englehorn sails in nine hours.
          
                              JIMMY
                    So? We gotta find Miss Darrow.
          
                              BRUCE
                    Hey, did you hear me? We're gonna be
                    stranded here!
          
          BRUCE becomes aware of JACK staring at him COLDLY. BRUCE self
          consciously clears his THROAT.
          
                              BRUCE (cont'd)
                    Miss Darrow was a great gal - no
                    question. She was a wonderful person.
                    It's a terrible loss. We're all gonna
                    miss her.
          

          
                                                                   80.
          
                              JACK
                    I always knew you were nothing like
                    the tough guy you play on screen - I
                    just never figured you for a coward.
          
                               BRUCE
                    Hey, pal, wake up. Heroes don't look
                    like me - not in the real world. In
                    the real world they've got bad teeth,
                    a bald spot and a beer gut ... be
                    seeing ya.
          
          BRUCE walks off. HAYES turns to the rest of the GROUP.
          
                              HAYES
                    Anyone else?
          
          A couple of SAILORS shuffle forward towards BRUCE.
          
          
          EXT. JUNGLE RUINS - DAY
          
          WIDE ON: KONG SITS on the EDGE of a RUIN, surveying the JUNGLE.
          
          He SITS with his BACK to ANN, in the crumbling remains of an
          enclosed ENTRY AREA ... which also provides the only way out.
          
           ith a splintering rip, KONG pulls off one of the DINOSAUR'S LEGS
          and starts EATING it.
          
          ANGLE ON: ANN, having feigned unconsciousness, she now cautiously
          searches for a way to escape.
          C
           LOSE ON: ANN LIFTING HER HEAD, risking a quick look around. The
          WALLS are TOO STEEP to attempt an escape ...
          
          ... but there is a NARROW STAIRWAY across the COURTYARD, leading
          down into the JUNGLE.
          
          INCH by INCH ANN starts to EDGE FORWARD, CRAWLING on her STOMACH
          towards the STAIRS. KONG is CHEWING NOISILY ... he SHIFTS HIS
          WEIGHT, half turning ... ANN FREEZES.
          
           ONG GLANCES at ANN, who has resumed her LIFELESS POSE. KONG
          doesn't appear to notice she's moved several feet. He continues
          EATING ...
          
          ANN again starts to EDGE FORWARD ... she is STARTLED when some
          CREEPY INSECTS swarm out of a CRACK in the FLAGSTONES, inches from
          her FACE!
          
          With only a few feet left to go, ANN quietly rises and scurries
          towards the STAIRWAY. She clambers into the NARROW PASSAGE -
          finally out of KONG'S SIGHT! Glancing back over her shoulder, ANN
          hurries down the STAIRWAY towards FREEDOM!
          

                                                                  81.
          
          
          EXT. BOTTOM OF STAIRWAY/JUNGLE - DAY
          
          ANN pauses at the BOTTOM of the STAIRS, listening for sounds of
          KONG. All is QUIET ... she glances back up the stairs ... no sign
          of him there ...
          
          ... gathering all her strength ANN emerges from the PASSAGE and
          makes a bold run across the CLEARING towards the cover of the
          JUNGLE!
          
          THUD! KONG'S FIST SLAMS DOWN in FRONT of ANN!
          
          She GASPS and tries to change direction ... THUD! Another FIST
          blocks her way. KONG GROWLS ANGRILY!
          
          ANN swings around and FACES KONG ... he SNARLS at HER, FURIOUS and
          DEADLY.
          
           NGLE ON: ANN suddenly ducks under KONG'S ARM and makes a last
          ditch attempt to escape! She is half way across the clearing when
          she TRIPS and FALLS!
          
           NGLE ON: KONG bounds over to ANN, SLAPPING his HANDS on the
          GROUND in a frenzy of excitement - he utters a GUTTERAL SQUEAL.
          
          CLOSE ON: ANN, flat on the ground, eyes shut, lying still.
          
          ANGLE ON: KONG .. circling around ANN, SUSPICIOUS. He PRODS her a
          couple of times ...no response. KONG moves on ... ANN'S EYES flick
          OPEN! At that moment KONG doubles back - CATCHING her out!
          
          ... ANN SPRINGS UP, looks at KONG for a desperate moment, wonders
          if she should run, decides she'll never make it ... and takes
          another PRATFALL!!

          KONG cocks his HEAD! He GRIMACES, baring his teeth and CIRCLES
          her.
          
          ANN repeats the COMIC FALL! KONG SLAPS his HANDS on the GROUND,
          SHAKES his HEAD and GROWLS.
          
          ANN starts to draw upon her VAUDEVILLE ROUTINE, swaying drunkenly
          and falling, then bouncing back up ... working her timing around
          KONG'S reactions - he grows increasingly ENGAGED.
          
           NGLE ON: ANN BOUNCES UP ... PANTING ... BEADS of SWEAT trickle
          down her face. Her EYES dart between the JUNGLE and KONG, she's
          looking for her chance ...
          
          ... but KONG is a DEMANDING audience. He wants more ... he wants
          ANN to fall down again.
          
          KONG PRODS ANN ROUGHLY, knocking her OFF HER FEET. She FALLS to
          the GROUND ... WINDED.
          
          KONG slaps his hands on the GROUND, and lets out another EXCITED
          GROWL. He thumps the GROUND with his FISTS, and SHAKES his HEAD,
          delighted with the GAME.
          

          
                                                                   82.
          
          ANN tries to get up - KONG pushes her over again! This time she
          stays on the GROUND, breathing HEAVILY.
          
           HUMP! THUMP! THUMP! KONG wants more! He tries to PROD ANN into
          getting up and is STARTLED when she HITS his FINGER AWAY!
          
                              ANN
                             (gasping)
                    No! I said no!
          
          KONG cocks his HEAD ... he THUMPS his FISTS on the GROUND.
          
           HUMP! THUMP! THUMP!
          
                               ANN (cont'd)
                              (gasping)
                    That's all there is ... there isn't
                    any more.
          
          KONG RISES TO HIS FEET, and BEATS his CHEST, towering over ANN.
          
          His HUGE FIST rises into the air and comes SLAMMING DOWN straight
          TOWARDS ANN!
          
          CLOSE ON: ANN shuts her eyes ... KONG'S FIST THUDS into the ground
          inches away from her.
          
          THUD! Another FIST SLAMS into the GROUND!
          
          ANGLE ON: KONG ROARS and beats his chest in a dramatic display of
          ANGER and FRUSTRATION. He rips a TREE from the ground as his ANGER
          spirals into violent MADNESS.
          
            LOSE ON: ANN as the GROUND SHAKES with the fury of his RAGE. For
          a brief moment KONG and ANN lock in EYE CONTACT!
          C
           LOSE ON: KONG stares at the small figure in his hand who is
          waiting for DEATH to come.
          
          In this moment an UNFAMILIAR feeling wells inside him ... a half
          formed emotion he hasn't experienced much in his long life: he
          feels a connection to this tiny creature.
          
          The SPARK of RAGE goes out in KONG'S EYES ...
          
          KONG stares at ANN as a confusion of feelings wash over him.
          
           ONG pulls back from ANN ... overcome by sudden UNCERTAINTY. He
          knows only that she has somehow disarmed him ... and this has in
          turn, DIMINISHED his power.
          
          KONG starts to BACK AWAY from ANN - slowly at first, until DOUBT
          and FEAR compel him to move faster. Suddenly he turns away.
          
          ANN watches as KONG lopes off. He pulls himself up and over a
          RUINED WALL and DISAPPEARS from SIGHT.
          
          ANGLE ON: ANN, rising to her feet, finally free of her captor.
          

          
                                                                  83.
          
          
          EXT. THICK JUNGLE - DAY
          
           NGLE ON: ANN hurrying through the JUNGLE ... pushing THROUGH
          thorns, TANGLED in VINES ... she is EXHAUSTED, THIRSTY.
          
          
          EXT. LOG CHASM - DAY
          
           IDE ANGLE: DENHAM, JACK, HAYES, LUMPY, JIMMY, PRESTON and the
          remaining CREW have arrived at a DARK, VINE ENTANGLED CHASM ...
          spanning the narrow, but deadly RAVINE is a SINGLE FALLEN TREE.
          
          WEAK SUNLIGHT filters through the DARK CANOPY above casting a
          SICKLY GREEN HUE over the place.
          
           IDE ON: HAYES, followed by JIMMY, leads the GROUP across the
          SLIMY, MOSS covered LOG ... the going is treacherous.
          
          ANGLE ON: DENHAM struggling with the CAMERA ... JACK follows HAYES
          ... LUMPY helps CHOY. They put one foot in front of the other,
          trying not to let the DROP unnerve them.
          
          ANGLE ON: HAYES suddenly stops ... tensely scanning the DARK RUINS
          on the other side of the CHASM ...
          
          CREEPY POV: ... something is watching the MEN on the LOG.
                               J
                                IMMY
                             (low voice)
                    What is it?
          
          HAYES motions for JIMMY to be quiet. He stares intently into    the
          DARKNESS of the FOREBODING RUINS.
          
                              JIMMY (cont'd)
                             (whispering)
                    Mr. Hayes ...?
          
          HAYES turns and looks at JIMMY.
          
                              HAYES
                    If anything happens, I want you to
                    run! Understand?
          
                              JIMMY
                    I'm not a coward - I ain't gonna run.
          
                              HAYES
                             (gently)
                    It's not about being brave, Jimmy.
          
          CLOSE ON: JIMMY looking at HAYES uneasily, as he continues across
          the LOG.
          
          
          EXT. FAR EDGE OF CHASM - DAY
          
           NGLE ON: HAYES is the first to step off the LOG, to the safety of
          the FAR BANK.
          

          
                                                                  84.
          
          Ahead, some RUINS have collapsed, creating a LONG DARK TUNNEL.
          
          CLOSE ON: HAYES ... peers into the DARKNESS of the TUNNEL.
          
          ANGLE ON: A PAIR of GLEAMING EYES, reflecting LIGHT ... rushing
          towards HAYES.
          
                              HAYES
                     o back! Back across the log!
          
          The GROUP on the LOG FREEZE, start to BACK AWAY, slipping and
          sliding on the WET MOSS.
          
                              JIMMY
                    I ain't gonna run.
          
                              HAYES
                    Get Jimmy out of here.
          
          ANGLE ON: HAYES... SHOOTS into the DARKNESS of the TUNNEL.
          
          KONG rampages out of the TUNNEL MOUTH! He SNATCHES HAYES with one
          SWEEP of his HAND.
          
          CLOSE ON: HAYES in KONG's HAND ...
          
           IMMY yells! KONG's GAZE turns toward the MEN on the LOG!
          
                              JIMMY
                    No! Let him go!
                             (to HAYES)
                    Kill him! Kill him!
          
                              HAYES
                             (to KONG)
                    Look at me! Look at me!
          
                              JIMMY
                             (desperate)
                    Bring him down! Mr Hayes!
          
          SLOWLY HAYES begins to lift his PISTOL up ... KONG's GAZE locks
          back on HAYES ...
          
                              HAYES
                              deadly calm)
                    You've gotta run, Jimmy.
          
                               IMMY
                    No! I ain't gonna run.
          
                               HAYES
                    Do as I say.
                              (to JIMMY)
                    G
                      o with Jack ... All of you.
          
          KONG stares at HAYES a BEAT ... HAYES suddenly raises his PISTOL
          at KONG to shoot!
          

                                                                  85.
          
                              HAYES (cont'd)
                    Run!
          
          ANGLE ON: KONG HURLS HAYES at the SAILORS ... he flies over their
          heads like RAG-DOLL and smashes against the FAR WALL of the RAVINE
          with a sickening CRUNCH.
          
                              JIMMY
                    No!
          
          JIMMY runs at KONG, blinded by tears of GRIEF and RAGE ... JACK
          KNOCKS him down and SHOOTS at KONG.
          
                               JACK
                             (desperate)
                    Shoot him!
          
          WILD SHOOTING from the SAILORS, as they try to maintain BALANCE on
          the LOG.
          
          KONG ROARS ... DESPERATE SAILORS try to back across the RAVINE.
          
          KONG runs towards the LOG ... KONG'S FIST smashes at the LOG,
          knocking the men off balance. A SAILOR plummets off into the CHASM
          below.
          
          
          EXT. THICK JUNGLE - DAY
          
           NGLE ON: ANN hurrying through the JUNGLE ... hearing the sound of
          gun fire.
          
                              ANN
                    Hey! Here! Over here!
          
          She runs up the bank towards the noise.
          
          
          EXT. FAR EDGE OF CHASM - DAY
          
           IDE ON: KONG has LIFTED the END of the LOG!
          
          JACK, DENHAM, LUMPY, CHOY, JIMMY, PRESTON and THREE SAILORS hold
          on for dear life ... as KONG vigorously TWISTS and SHAKES the LOG,
          bucking the MEN into the air.
          
          ANGLE ON: DENHAM skates on the MOSS and his CAMERA slides away,
          becoming WEDGED in the fork of a STUMP.
          
           LL AROUND panicked SAILORS are SHOOTING WILDLY, but fear and lack
          of balance throws their AIM OFF.
          
           WO SAILORS FALL ... CHOY scrambles for something to grab.
          
                              CHOY
                    Lumpy! Help me!
          
          LUMPY desperately tries to reach CHOY'S hand ... but CHOY slips
          away into the ABYSS.
          

          
                                                                  86.
          
          KONG ROARS with FRUSTRATION, and TOSSES the ENTIRE LOG into the
          CHASM!
          
          QUICK IMAGE: DENHAM, PRESTON, JACK, JIMMY and LUMPY gripping the
          LOG as it FALLS!
          
          QUICK IMAGE: PRESTON thrown off the LOG halfway down ... he
          manages to GRAB onto a ROCKY SHELF.
          
          ANGLE ON: PRESTON is nearest to the FAR BANK ... he LEAPS, and
          MANAGES to catch hold of some hanging VINES, hauling himself up to
          safety.
          
          ANGLE ON: The LOG plummets into a web of VINES, which arrest its
          FALL and sends it FLIPPING end on end, throwing the MEN CLEAR into
          mid-air... DENHAM, JACK and LUMPY land in SOFT MUD which cushions
          the impact of the LANDING.
          
          
          EXT. VALLEY EDGE - DAY
          
          ANN suddenly spins around ... the DISTANT SOUND of approaching
          FOOTSTEPS through the dense JUNGLE. A flicker of hope in ANN'S
          eyes! She starts hurrying towards the FOOTSTEPS!
          
          CLOSE ON: ANN sees a distant PLUME of SMOKE - over FOUR MILES AWAY
          ... she hesitates.
          
          She SLOWLY turns towards the SOUND of the FOOTSTEPS, which are now
          VERY CLOSE. Suddenly a LARGE 8 foot tall CARNIVOROUS DINOSAUR is
          in the GLADE before her!
          
           NGLE ON: ANN as she quietly backtracks. The CARNIVORE pauses, as
          if SENSING something. It's NOSTRILS twitch. She ducks behind a
          WIDE TREE.
          
           NGLE ON: ANN PEERING around from behind the TREE ...
          
          ... there is another CARNIVORE BEHIND HER! It snares at her ...
          and pounces!
          
          ANN leaps away ... she barely has time to start running before the
          CARNIVORE GIVES CHASE!
          
          ANGLE ON: ANN races past the first CARNIVORE ... the creature
          turns it's head ... and soon BOTH DINOSAURS are pursuing ANN.
          
          
          EXT. HOLLOW TREE GLADE - DAY
          
           NGLE ON: ANN desperately heads towards the TANGLED ROOT SYSTEM of
          a HUGE TREE. She throws herself forward, as the CARNIVORE'S JAWS
          snap above her head.
          
           NGLE ON: ANN ROLLS and SCRAMBLES into a HOLLOW under the ROTTEN
          TREE.
          
          ANGLE ON: The CARNIVORE CLAW at the TREE, trying to get at ANN.
          

          
                                                                  87.
          
          ANN is lying beneath the ROOTS ... all she can see are LEGS and
          SLAVERING SNOUTS! The DINOSAUR RAM'S it's nose into the NARROW
          GAP.
          
          SUDDENLY ... ANN sees the LEGS of one of her pursuers LIFT off the
          GROUND - it's taloned feet thrashing in mid-air.
          
           he SECOND CARNIVORE turns and FLEES into the JUNGLE, as ANN is
          forced to watch the twitching legs SHUDDER and FLAIL.
          
          The SOUND of BONE CRUNCHING ... CRACK! The CARNIVORE'S LEGS SPASM
          and go limp.
          
          ANN is completely still, she dare not breathe ... whatever killed
          the CARNIVORE is now inches from her hiding PLACE.
          
          CLOSE ON: ANN'S FACE ... as she sees something CRAWLING above her.
          
          CLOSE ON: A DARK HOLE, beneath the tree ... Long FEELERS probe
          along the ROOF of the hole as a HUGE CENTIPEDE CRAWLS towards her.
          
          ANN doesn't move as it inches towards her face. Suddenly she feels
          another crawling up over her shoulder.
          
          ANN FREAKS! She desperately scrambles away from the CENTIPEDES ...
          rolls out on the OTHER SIDE of the TREE and stands to RUN...
          
          ... TOWERING above her, with the DEAD CARNIVORE hanging limply
          from it's HUGE JAWS, is a TYRANNOSAURUS REX!
          
          ANN starts RUNNING! The TYRANNOSAUR crashes after her with the
          DEAD CARNIVORE still in it's MOUTH... as SHE races through the
          JUNGLE, dodging TREES, leaping over FALLEN LOGS, smashing through
          BUSHES, the TYRANNOSAUR POUNDING ever closer in pursuit. ANN can
          feel its hot sour BREATH blowing on the back of her neck! The HUGE
          JAWS of the HUGE BEAST open INCHES from ANN'S HEAD!
          E
          
          EXT. VALLEY EDGE - DAY
          
           NGLE ON: ANN slips down a MUDDY BANK, rolls over a LOG, and
          CRASHES NOISILY through a THICKET of PALMS ...
          
          
          EXT. FALLEN TREE GLADE - DAY
          
          ANGLE ON: ANN'S LUNGS are bursting, but the TYRANNOSAUR is   GAINING
          on her ... she manages to scramble onto a FALLEN TREE that   juts
          out over a small CLIFF. ANN clings onto the MOSSY LOG, and   crawls
          towards the END ... the TYRANNOSAUR cannot possibly follow   her.
          
          She falls amongst the roots, lying as flat as possible, praying
          the TYRANNOSAUR doesn't see her. It seems to work and IT walks
          off. ANN HESITANTLY SITS up, thinking that she is at last free,
          only to turn and discover another is behind her!
          
          With an almost delicate movement, the TYRANNOSAUR nudges the LOG
          with it's head ... causing it to lurch dramatically! The
          TYRANNOSAUR pushes HARDER, sending ANN over the SIDE ...
          

          
          
                                                                  88.
          she just manages to grab hold of a BRANCH as she FALLS. ANN hangs
          on desperately ...
          
          SHE SCREAMS!
          
          ANN is HELPLESS ... The TYRANNOSAUR positions it's HEAD for the
          FINAL LUNGE - gaping JAWS OPEN impossibly WIDE ...
          
          AT THAT MOMENT: KONG CHARGES!
          
          KONG meets the TYRANNOSAUR HEAD-ON at FULL SPEED! He swings, with
          his FOOT smashing the TYRANNOSAUR against the FALLEN LOG ... ANN
          loses her GRASP and FALLS ... as the DINOSAUR SPRAWLS onto the
          ground beside her ... in a flash, KONG CATCHES HER mid-fall ...
          ROLLING AWAY as the TYRANNOSAUR LEAPS UP and tries to take another
          swipe.
          
          
          EXT. SKULL ISLAND JUNGLES - DAY
          
           AST FEVERED ACTION: A pair of CARNIVOROUS DINOSAURS leap towards
          HER! They cling onto KONG'S ARM, clawing furiously, snapping at
          ANN!
          
           LOSE ON: Saliva flies from wild, snapping jaws.
          
          WIDE ON: KONG rolls over, THUMPING his arm against a TREE,
          crushing a DINOSAUR.
          
          ANN is WINDED ... she clings to KONG'S FINGERS as he strangles the
          second BEAST with one hand, snapping it's NECK with a BONE
          CRUNCHING sound.
          
            UDDENLY! A SECOND TYRANNOSAUR ATTACKS!!! He comes charging into
          shot, grabbing KONG'S ARM in his JAWS! KONG ROARS, sending both
          TYRANNOSAURS SPRAWLING TO THE GROUND. The FIRST TYRANNOSAUR
          scrambles back to it's feet! KONG holds ANN protectively as he
          braces himself for the FIGHT OF HIS LIFE. The TWO TYRANNOSAURS
          CIRCLE him ... when SUDDENLY! A THIRD TYRANNOSAUR comes from
          behind.
          T
           hey ATTACK KONG and ANN ... a BREATHTAKING FIGHT to the DEATH.
          KONG fights like a madman on three separate fronts ... Not only
          does he have to do battle with the TYRANNOSAURS, he is also
          PROTECTING ANN - constantly transferring her from ONE HAND to THE
          OTHER as the TYRANNOSAURS SNAP AT HER HEELS.
          
          KONG punches and smashes with his fists, but he also uses
          wrestling-style headlocks and flips ... for a brief moment, ANN
          rolls free on the ground and has to dodge 25-foot DINOSAURS and
          the GORILLA, as the frenzied fight THUNDERS all around her.
          
          The FIRST TYRANNOSAUR is taken out when KONG LIFTS up a HUGE
          BOULDER and SMASHES it against the TYRANNOSAUR'S HEAD.
          
          KONG and the TWO TYRANNOSAURS slide down on to a ROCKY OUTCROP.
          
          KONG outs the SECOND TYRANNOSAUR in a HEADLOCK, FLIPPING it over
          his shoulder, and throwing it down into the CHASM. CLINGING ONTO
          THE LEDGE KONG PULLS THE FIRST TYRANNOSAUR OFF THE LEDGE ... BUT
          AS IT FALLS it SNAPS AT KONG'S FOOT.
          
          E

          KONG ROARS IN PAIN AND TOGETHER THEY FALL DOWN INTO THE CHASM ...
          DOWN INTO THE VINES. KONG CONTINUES TO FIGHT THE TYRANNOSAUR, AS
          ANN IS LEFT SWINGING, CAUGHT UP IN THE VINES ... TOWARDS THE
          SECOND TYRANNOSAUR. HE SNAPS AT HER AS SHE COMES WITHIN INCHES OF
          HIS JAW.
          
          WIDE ON: KONG SEES AND CLIMBS UP TOWARDS IT, PULLING IT DOWN.
          THEY ALL TUMBLE DEEPER INTO THE CHASM, AND SUDDENLY ANN FINDS
          HERSELF DANGLING FROM THE JAWS OF THE TYRANNOSAUR ABOVE THE JAWS
          OF ANOTHER! KONG SWINGS AND KICKS THE TYRANNOSAUR IN THE HEAD ...
          ANN LOSES HER GRIP AND PLUMMETS DOWN ... VINES BREAKING AS SHE
          FALLS. AND more SMASHING AGAINST THE CHASM WALLS ... SHE FALLS AND
          LANDS ON THE HEAD OF ANOTHER. FALLS AGAIN. SHE LANDS IN THE SWAMP.
          RUNS. IT CHASES.
          
          EXT. CLEARING - DAY
          
          WIDE ON: ANN faces the TYRANNOSAUR! SUDDENLY KONG THUDS DOWN
          BEHIND HER ... GLARING AT THE DINOSAUR ... ANN FINDS HERSELF
          CAUGHT BETWEEN THE TWO BEASTS. ANN WEIGHS UP HER OPTIONS BETWEEN
          BOTH ... and for a moment ANN & KONG LOCK EYES. SHE THEN BACKS
          BENEATH THE LOOMING FIGURE OF KONG.
          T
           HE TYRANNOSAUR SNARLS at KONG and he ROARS BACK ... KONG THROWS
          ANN GENTLY to the side as HE and the TYRANNOSAUR LUNGE at each
          other.
          
          KONG GRABS HIS JAWS in BOTH HANDS forcing it OPEN and BITING the
          TYRANNOSAUR'S TONGUE. HE ROLLS the TYRANNOSAUR over and over,
          using all his strength to force the TYRANNOSAUR'S JAWS OPEN
          before RIPPING them clean APART at the HINGE! The TYRANNOSAUR
          sprawls back, DEAD.
          
          KONG is PANTING HEAVILY ... he has been BITTEN, RAKED and CUT.    He
          puts his foot on the LAST TYRANNOSAUR and BEATS HIS CHEST,
          TRIUMPHANTLY with a DEAFENING ROAR.
          
          WIDE ON: KONG KICKS THE DINOSAUR OUT THE WAY. KONG ROARS ANGRILY -
          his blood is up, he is ready to take on the world. HE STANDS NEXT
          TO ANN, BUT HE WON'T LOOK AT HER DIRECTLY. SHE TRIES TO HIS
          ATTENTION BUT HE LOOKS AWAY. HE LUMBERS AWAY. KONG has DEADLY
          INTENT in his EYES. ANN watches as he DISAPPEARS into the JUNGLE.
          
          ANGLE ON: ANN, CONFUSED for a minute ... THEN RUNS AFTER HIM.
          
                                ANN
                    Wait!
          
          ANGLE ON: ANN is roughly SWUNG into the air, as KONG bounds off
          into the DEEP JUNGLE INTERIOR.
          
          ANN as she is suddenly SNATCHED UP by KONG and SWUNG ROUGHLY on to
          his SHOULDER.
          
          CLOSE ON: ANN HANGS ON for dear life as KONG GALLOPS into the
          JUNGLE.
          
          KONG moves SWIFTLY and POWERFULLY through the JUNGLE with ANN on
          his SHOULDER ...
          

          
                                                                  90.
          
          ANGLE ON: ANN as she looks up at the GIANT GORILLA ... the
          tension seems to go out of her body, she relaxes into his HAND
          ... for the first time since coming to SKULL ISLAND she feels
          SAFE.
          
          
          EXT. BOTTOM OF CHASM - DAY
          
          CLOSE ON: JACK STIRRING, immediately hearing the SCUTTLE OF
          INSECTS. HE ROLLS OVER and see's HUGE SPIDERS CRAWLING INTO THE
          PIT. HE staggers to his FEET ... REACHING INTO HIS PACK and PULLS
          from it A FLARE. THROWING it at the SPIDERS they CRAWL OFF.
          
          DENHAM is lying nearby.
          
                              JACK
                    Carl!!!
          
          DENHAM STIRS, MUMBLING IN PAIN BUT ALIVE.
          
          JACK SEES JIMMY.
          
          CLOSE ON: JIMMY is looking VACANTLY into space, JACK kneels down.
          
                              JACK (cont'd)
                    Jimmy?
          
          CLOSE ON: JIMMY looks up at JACK, there are tears filling his
          eyes. He falls into JACK'S arms softly sobbing.
          
          ANGLE ON: DENHAM sitting up... dawning realization in his eyes.
          
          LUMPY, his back to CHOY ... he HOLDS CHOY'S HAND ... but CHOY'S
          FINGERS SLIDE LIMPLY out of LUMPY'S HAND ... LUMPY TURNS TO CHOY
          .. ONLY TO SEE THAT HE has DIED.
          
           NGLE ON: HAYES' eyes closed, his FACE peaceful, lying DEAD on the
          floor of the RAVINE.
          
          ANGLE ON: DENHAM PEERING over a ROCK. The wreckage of the CAMERA
          lies smashed and broken on the CHASM floor ... a thin, shiny,
          thread of black FILM trailing from the smashed CAMERA body like
          spilt innards.
          
          DENHAM reaches out and touches the EXPOSED FILM ... his dreams
          DESTROYED.
          
          WIDE ON: THE FLARE SLOWLY DIES.
          
          CLOSE ON: JACK cradling JIMMY in his ARMS. HE LOOKS UP as he SEES
          the INSECTS CRAWL BACK.
          
          ANGLE ON: a HUGE six-foot CARNIVOROUS MAGGOT-THING squirms out!
          It crawls blindly towards LUMPY and CHOY!
          
          ANGLE ON: LUMPY pulling CHOY'S BODY to safety, but both are
          ATTACKED by LARGE INSECTS, the size of dogs!

          JACK tries to PULL THE GIANT CRAB-SPIDER OFF LUMPY, but instead it
          TURNS on him! More GIANT CRAB-SPIDERS JUMP at JACK.
          
                                                                     91.
          
          LUMPY and CHOY are CONSUMED by the nightmarish BUGS.
          
          ANGLE ON: DENHAM is WIELDING a short stick like a CLUB ... he
          smashes the HUGE BUGS in a psychotic explosion of RAGE,
          pulverizing their bodies into the DIRT!
          
          All around, MONSTROSITIES OF NATURE emerge from DANK BURROWS and
          crawl towards the JACK, DENHAM and JIMMY ... these are HUGE
          INSECTILE MUTANTS - combinations of SPIDERS, CRABS, MANTISES and
          CENTIPEDES!
          
          SUDDENLY JIMMY notices the TOMMY GUN sticking out of JACK'S PACK.
          GRABBING IT he aims at the INSECTS on JACK.
          
          BAM! BAM! BAM! The GIANT INSECTS are blown apart!
          
          JACK looks wildly around for DENHAM. THEY SEE that they're
          SURROUNDED BY SPIDERS. ANGLE ON: JACK desperately swings at the
          INSECTS with a STICK, whacking and stabbing them.
          
          BAM! BAM! BAM! GUNSHOTS RING OUT. SPIDERS SWARM out of HOLES in
          the CLIFF AND DIE. JACK spins around ... confused.
          
          ANGLE ON: ENGLEHORN and a COUPLE of SAILORS OPEN FIRE from the LIP
          of the CHASM, SHOOTING the SPIDERS into SMITHEREENS!
          
          ANGLE ON: BRUCE SWINGS down from above, clinging to a VINE ... GUN
          BLAZING!
          
          BRUCE proceeds to lay waste to the INSECTS ... those not    blasted
          apart, scurrying away, back in to the darkness.
          
          
          EXT. JUNGLE - DAY
          
          Moving purposefully along a well-known route to his LAIR, KONG
          launches himself across a LOW CHASM ... one hand reaching out
          to clutch at THICK VINES on the other side ...
          
          SUDDENLY! The THICK VINES TEAR AWAY from the side of the CHASM
          WALL ... KONG falls backwards. ANN still clutched protectively
          to his CHEST he lands with a THUD!
          
          ANN looks up alarmed!
          
          KONG scrambles to his feet, GROWLING ... he places ANN on the
          GROUND pushing her protectively behind him.
          
          KONG POV: LOOMING out of the CHASM WALL is a HUGE FACE!
          
          CLOSE ON: ANN as her expression suddenly changes from FEAR to
          DAWNING COMPREHENSION.
          
          ANN walks past KONG ... who emits another LOW, WARNING GROWL.
          
                              ANN
                    It's alright ... it's okay ...
          
          ANN reaches the WALL and begins to pull away more of the VINES
          and CREEPERS to reveal ...
          
                                                                  92.
          
          A life-size and very life-like eroded STATUE of a SITTING
          GIANT GORILLA ... the IMAGE of KONG ...
          
          ANN turns back excitedly to KONG, trying to make him understand.
          
                              ANN (cont'd)
                    Look - it's you ... "Kong". See ...
                    you. "Kong". This is you.
          
          KONG looks from ANN to the HUGE STATUE ...
          
          KONG POV: ANN is dwarfed by the STONE MONOLITH.
          
          PUSH IN on KONG ... a growing sense of REALISATION as he comes to
          understand the STATUE is in fact a reflection of himself.
          
          CLOSE ON: KONG looking down at his hands ... it's as if he is
          seeing his GNARLED, LEATHERY FINGERS for the first time.
          
          ANN moves towards KONG ... he looks at her ... there is a
          VULNERABLE EXPRESSION on his FACE ... FEAR and SADNESS well in his
          EYES.
          
          
          EXT. SKULL MOUNTAIN - DUSK
          
          In VERTIGO-INDUCING shots, KONG climbs HIGHER and HIGHER - up into
          the HIGHEST PEAK of SKULL ISLAND ... carefully cradling ANN in his
          hand.
          
          A sudden FLAP OF WINGS and FLICKERING SHADOW causes KONG to pull
          ANN close to his chest as a sinister BAT-TYPE CREATURE lunges at
          her ... these SCAVENGERS hover in the SKIES around SKULL MOUNTAIN
          ... they have eight-foot wing spans and TALONED FEET. Their faces
          are more reptile than bat.
          

          
          
                                                                  93.
          
          
          EXT. KONG'S LAIR - DUSK
          
          WIDE ON: KONG steps out of a LARGE ROUND CAVE onto a LEDGE that
          juts out high over SKULL ISLAND ...
          
          This is KONG'S LAIR ... Over the ledge is a DIZZYING DROP of at
          least 1000-feet down to the JUNGLE.
          
          The "VENTURE" can be seen - moored off the TIP of the ISLAND, some
          three miles away.
          
           NGLE ON: KONG gently places ANN on the GROUND ... ANN watches as
          he moves away and sits to one side of the LEDGE.
          
          The SKY is a FIERY ORANGE as the SUN goes down ...   SILHOUETTING
          the FIGURE of KONG ...
          
          CLOSE ON: ANN looks around the CAVE taking in her STRANGE
          SURROUNDINGS ... her eyes fall upon a HUGE GORILLA SKULL and
          SKELETON which lie within the recesses of the CAVE ...
          
          ANN turns and looks back at KONG ... realizing these are the BONES
          of his FOREBEARS ... that KONG was not always alone.
          
            SUDDEN flutter in the DARK recesses of the LAIR, a SINISTER
          SOUND, sends ANN scurrying towards KONG ...
          
           ONG won't look at her.
          
          ANN breaks into a few tap steps ... NO RESPONSE. She leans   down
          and picks up some STONES ... JUGGLING them, attempting to amuse
          him as she did before. KONG's gaze remains averted ...
          
          He looks out over the JUNGLE CANOPY. ANN follows his GAZE, taking
          in the RUGGED LANDSCAPE which is bathed in the last EVENING RAYS
          of the SUN. She stares out to sea, a RAIN CLOUD casts shadows over
          the OCEAN.
          
                              ANN
                             (softly)
                    It's beautiful.
          
          KONG sits QUIETLY staring out over the JUNGLE ... she looks up at
          him.
          
                                 ANN (cont'd)
                    Beautiful.
          
          ANN places her HAND against her heart.
          
                              ANN (cont'd)
                    Beau-ti-ful.
          
          KONG'S BIG PAW unfurls beside ANN ... she hesitates for a moment,
          then CLIMBS into it.
          
          ANGLE ON: KONG gently lifts ANN ...
          

          
                                                                  94.
          
          WIDE ON: KONG with ANN, high above the JUNGLE, as the last of the
          DUSK LIGHT FADES.
          
          
          EXT. LOG CHASM - DAY
          
           LOSE ON: HANDS reach down as ENGLEHORN and a SAILOR PULL PRESTON
          up the last stretch of the ROPE ...
          
          ENGLEHORN turns and sees JACK climbing towards the TOP of the
                               D
          CHASM ... TWO SAILORS reaching down to help him.
          
                                DENHAM
                    Thank God.
          
                              ENGLEHORN
                    Don't thank God, thank Mr. Baxter ...
          
          CLOSE ON: BRUCE PULLING HIMSELF UP THE ROPE, gasping from
          exertion.
          
                              ENGLEHORN (cont'd)
                    He insisted on a rescue mission. Me? I
                    knew you'd be okay ...
          
          CLOSE ON: DENHAM looks up to see ENGLEHORN standing at the top of
          the CHASM. ENGLEHORN is watching him IMPASSIVELY.
          
                              ENGLEHORN (cont'd)
                    That's the thing about cockroaches; no
                    matter how many times you flush them
                    down the toilet they always crawl back
                    up the bowl!
          
          ANGLE ON: DENHAM as he rises to his feet.
          
                              DENHAM
                     ey buddy! I'm outta the bowl! I'm
                    drying off my wings and trekking
                    across the lid!
          
          ENGLEHORN LOOKS at DENHAM a BEAT and then LOOKS across the CHASM
          in SURPRISE. DENHAM FOLLOWS HIS GAZE.
          
          WIDE ON: JACK at the TOP of the opposite side of the CHASM ... a
          solitary figure, bloodied and torn.
          
                              ENGLEHORN
                    Driscoll ... don't be a fool! Give it
                    up, it's useless ... She's dead.
          
                              DENHAM
                             (quietly)
                    She's not dead. Jack's gonna bring her
                    back.
          
          ENGLEHORN turns to DENHAM.
          
                                                                     95.
          
                              DENHAM (cont'd)
                    And the ape will be hard on his heels.
                    We can still come out of this thing
                    okay -
                             (pause)
                    More than okay. Think about it, you've
                    got a boat full of chloroform we can
                    put to good use.
          
          ENGLEHORN looks at DENHAM for a BEAT and then LAUGHS.
          
                              ENGLEHORN
                    You want to trap the Ape? I don't
                    think so.
          
                              DENHAM
                    Isn't that what you do? Live animal
                    capture? I heard you were the best.
          
          ENGLEHORN stares at DENHAM for a moment, it is impossible to know
          what he is thinking.
          
                                 DENHAM (cont'd)
                    Jack!
          
          JACK looks at DENHAM D
                               ... DENHAM raises a hand in salute.
          
                              DENHAM (cont'd)
                             (calling)
                    Look after yourself!
          
                              JACK
                    Keep the Gate open.
          
                              DENHAM
                    Sure thing, buddy! Good luck!
          
          ANGLE ON: JACK turns to go ... and disappears up the DARK TUNNEL.
          
                                 DENHAM (cont'd)
                    I'm sorry.
          
          
          EXT. THICK JUNGLE - DUSK
          
          ANGLE ON: JACK struggles through the JUNGLE ... he breaks into
          CLEARING and STOPS SHORT as he see's the VAST VISTA of the
          MOUNTAIN in front of him.
          
          
          INT. KONG'S LAIR - NIGHT
          
          ANGLE ON: MOONLIGHT steams into the CAVE ... KONG sits on his
          LEDGE, HE CRADLES ANN IN HIS ARM.
          
          CLOSE ON: ANN SLEEPS PEACEFULLY in his HAND.
          
          ANGLE ON: KONG gently lifts ANN ... he STARES at her ... his
          FINGER touches ANN'S HAIR.
          

          
          
                                                                     96.
          
          
          EXT. KONG'S LAIR - NIGHT
          
          ANGLE ON: JACK is climbing up through ROCKS towards KONG'S LAIR!
          
          BAT-THINGS flutter ... AGITATED ... SENSING an INTRUDER.
          
          CLOSE ON: JACK freezes.
          
           NGLE ON: A LARGE NUMBER of BAT-THINGS are GATHERING amid the
          STALACTITES that hang from the ROOF of the CAVERN.
          
          He scans the LAIR for any sign of ANN ... but can't see her. The
          OLD BONES of a LARGE GORILLA lie across the CAVE from JACK.
          
           ACK CLIMBS higher INTO THE CAVE until at last he's on THE LEDGE
          WITH KONG.
          
          ANGLE ON: JACK moves forward, towards KONG. He stays in the
          SHADOWS of the ROCKS.
          
          JACK CRAWLS FORWARD onto the LEDGE.
          
          
          EXT. KONG'S LAIR - NIGHT
          
          ANGLE ON: JACK creeps CLOSE to the SLEEPING KONG'S BACK ... his
          SHOULDERS gently heaving with each breath.
          
           LOSE ON: JACK crawls past KONG'S FEET ... he looks in AMAZEMENT.
          
          ... ANN is ASLEEP in KONG'S HAND!
          
           LOSE ON: KONG GROWLS ... JACK SPINS AROUND ... KONG is growling
          in his sleep!
          
          JACK is less than 8 FEET away from ANN.
          
          CLOSE ON: ANN'S eyes OPEN. For a MOMENT she stares blankly at JACK
          ... then REALISATION arrives quickly - he has come for her! She
          looks at JACK with disbelief.
          
           LOSE ON: JACK looks at ANN, drawing a finger to his lips ...
          neither DARES to move, or make a sound.
          
           ERY SLOWLY, JACK rises and steps towards ANN. He gestures for her
          to stay motionless in KONG'S PALM.
          
           NGLE ON: The salivating, carnivorous BAT-THINGS flutter out of
          the CAVE and SWARM around the LEDGE ... their FEAR of KONG is
          overwhelmed by the tempting SIGHT of JACK and ANN.
          
          KONG STIRS.
          
          CLOSE ON: JACK extends his HAND towards ANN ... she reaches out
          ... their FINGERS TOUCH ...
          
          ... and KONG'S EYES SNAP OPEN!
          

          
          
                                                                   97.
          
          TIME seems to SLOW: JACK attempts to GRAB ANN'S WRIST, but KONG'S
          FINGERS CLOSE around ANN with stunning SPEED! KONG ROLLS to his
          FEET, pulling ANN away from JACK!
          
           NGLE ON: KONG SNARLS at JACK, who now stands HELPLESSLY before
          him.
          
          The BAT-THINGS SWARM above KONG.

                             (yelling)
                    Jack, run!
          
          ANGLE ON: KONG SWATS at JACK with his FREE HAND. ANN struggles and
          KICKS in his GRASP. A
          
                              ANN (cont'd)
                             (yelling)
                    No!
          
          KONG places ANN high on a SMALL LEDGE and CHARGES at JACK!
          
           NGLE ON: JACK ROLLS to the SIDE, KONG'S FISTS smashing DOWN
          around him!
          
           ONG STAMPS on JACK, who DIVES CLEAR, just as the HUGE FOOT
          pummels into the GROUND.
          
          CLOSE ON: JACK is LYING on the GROUND with KONG rearing above him
          ... there is NO ESCAPE!
          
          CLOSE ON: KONG'S EYES, blazing with DEADLY INTENT. He LIFTS his
          FOOT, ready to SQUASH JACK like a bug!
          
          AT THAT MOMENT! ANN SHRIEKS in PAIN!
          
          KONG spins around ...
          
          ANGLE ON: ANN is under ATTACK from the BAT-THINGS ... they are
          FRENZYING around ANN, sharp CLAWS lashing her! She cowers against
          the ROCK FACE, trying to protect herself.
          
          CLOSE ON: KONG ... ROARING with ANGER ... he abandons JACK and
          CHARGES at the BAT-THINGS!
          
          The FRENZIED BAT-THINGS ATTACK KONG EN MASSE as he snatches ANN
          from the LEDGE.
          
          They strike at KONG and ANN like a swarm of giant bees. KONG ROARS
          and THRASHES OUT at them in a FRENZY!
          
            NGLE ON: KONG puts ANN down against the ROCKS, so he can use BOTH
          HANDS to strike at the DEADLY BAT-THINGS. With every sweep of his
          ARM, several BAT-THINGS are KNOCKED TO THE GROUND, but OTHERS claw
          at his HEAD and BODY.
          A
           NGLE ON: JACK seizes his CHANCE! He rushes along the EDGE of the
          CLIFF towards ANN ... under the cover of an OVERHANG.

          JACK and ANN are inches away from each other right behind KONG'S
          FEET!
          
           ACK grabs ANN'S HAND and leads her towards the only possible
          escape route - the EDGE of the LEDGE, 1000 FEET above the JUNGLE!
          
          JACK grabs a LARGE VINE, testing it's strength. He turns to     Ann.
          
                              JACK
                             (urgent)
                    This way! Come on!
          
          JACK pulls ANN to him and clambers over the EDGE of the   DIZZYING
          DROP.

          WIDE ON: JACK and ANN desperately CLIMB down the THICK VINES that
          hang over the LEDGE ... hand over hand ... the SOUND of KONG
          ROARING above, as he battles the BAT-THINGS.
          
          
          EXT. KONG'S LAIR - NIGHT
          
          ANGLE ON: SEVERAL BAT-THINGS are gripping and CLAWING KONG'S BACK
          in an effort to weaken the huge ape ... he suddenly POUNDS HIS
          BACK against the WALL of the CAVE, SQUASHING THEM ALL!
          
          The surviving BAT-THINGS wheel away from KONG, HISSING ANGRILY ...
          16 lie on the cave floor, STUNNED or DEAD. They FLUTTER towards
          the BACK OF THE CAVE, preparing their NEXT ATTACK.
          
          KONG LOOKS for ANN ... she has GONE!

          SUDDENLY! They start RISING!
          
          WIDE ON: KONG is PULLING on the VINE! He lifts JACK and ANN
          towards HIM, like a fisherman reeling in a catch.
          
          ANN tightens her grip on JACK'S SHOULDERS as BAT-THINGS flutter
          around THEM.
          A
           NGLE ON: JACK and ANN are HELPLESS ... KONG almost HAS THEM! BAT-
          THINGS dive towards JACK and ANN!
          
          A BAT-THING CLAWS at JACK'S HEAD. He releases ONE HAND and GRABS
          it's TALONED ANKLE.

          OTHER ANKLE.
          
          ANGLE ON: JACK and ANN DESCENDING RAPIDLY ... the BAT-THING
          furiously FLAPPING it's WINGS, but unable to stop the SPIRALLING
          plunge past the CLIFF FACE.
          
          SOUNDS of KONG ROARING WITH GRIEF FROM THE LEDGE.
          
          
          EXT. RIVER - NIGHT
          
          The BAT-THING wobbles crazily in the sky, rapidly LOSING ENERGY
          ... JACK looks down - a FAST FLOWING RIVER is 50 feet below. He
          RELEASES HIS GRIP!
          
          ANN SCREAMS as she and JACK fall into the RIVER ... they are
          immediately picked up by the current and SWEPT AWAY.
          
          JACK and ANN are carried into the RAPIDS, swept down a small
          WATERFALL, surfacing into a FAST-FLOWING, but less violent part of
          the river.

                    Not yet ... wait.
          
          The GROUP react to KONG'S ROAR - now VERY CLOSE. A SAILOR with a
          MACHETE hovers near the ROPE, ready to cut it on DENHAM'S COMMAND.
          
                                DENHAM (cont'd)

          slices through the ROPE ...

                                  ACK
                    Jimmy! No!
          
          JACK tries to prevent JIMMY from shooting at KONG, as SAILORS push
          their BOAT away from the shore.
          
          CLOSE ON: DENHAM finds a CRATE of CHLOROFORM BOTTLES on the FLOOR
          of the BOAT. He snatches one up ... prepares to throw.
          
          ANGLE ON: JIMMY manages to fire a BURST at KONG ... KONG CHARGES
          in FURY and THUMPS his FIST down on the BOW of the BOAT.

           NGLE ON: DENHAM is flung into the water, still clutching the
          CHLOROFORM BOTTLE.
          
          ANGLE ON: KONG flings the BOAT against the COVE WALL, smashing it -
          sending JACK, JIMMY and SAILORS into the SEA!
          
          ANN looks on in horror as JACK SURFACES, holding onto JIMMY,    who
          is COUGHING SEA WATER.
          
          KONG turns to ANN'S BOAT ... he looks at her ...
          
                                 ANN
                    Go back!
          
          KONG PAUSES at the SOUND of her VOICE ... as if sensing her    fear
          for him.
          
                                 ENGLEHORN
                    Hold her!
          
          BRUCE holds ANN as ENGLEHORN suddenly FIRES a HARPOON into KONG'S
          KNEE ... KONG ROARS in PAIN and SINKS into the water. ANN is
          sobbing with DISTRESS.
          
          ANGLE ON: ENGLEHORN starts LOADING a SECOND HARPOON ... DENHAM
          scrambles on to a ROCK, clutching the CHLOROFORM BOTTLE.
          
                                 DENHAM
                    Wait!
          
          ENGLEHORN ignores him, intent on killing KONG with his next
          HARPOON.
          A
           NGLE ON: KONG starts CRAWLING painfully towards ANN. ENGLEHORN
          has almost finished LOADING.
          
                              ANN
                    Leave him alone!
          

                                                                 105.
          
          ANGLE ON: DENHAM steadies himself on his rock as KONG crawls past.
          He hurls the CHLOROFORM BOTTLE ... it smashes against KONG'S FACE.
          KONG starts choking on the GAS.
          
          ANGLE ON: JACK in the sea, holding the unconscious JIMMY, watching
          ANN from across the void of water ...
          
          KONG starts to succumb to the GAS ... he reaches for ANN.
          
          ANN watches KONG'S HAND reach out to her .... But she can no
          longer help him ... she has failed to stop this happening.
          
          CLOSE ON: ANN turns away from KONG ... as he slumps into
          unconsciousness.
          
          CLOSE ON: ANN and JACK make EYE CONTACT across the water .... She
          starts to CRY. JACK is unable to offer her any comfort.
          
          ANGLE ON: DENHAM steps up to the UNCONSCIOUS KONG:
          
                              DENHAM
                     he whole world will pay to see this.
                    We're millionaires, boys. I'll share
                    it with all of you! In a few months
                    his name will be up in lights on

          are pulling up ... a QUEUE is forming ... SCALPERS are selling
          tickets outside the door.
          
           LOSE ON: BILLBOARDS outside the THEATRE proclaim "Relive the
          adventure of the Century ... see Miss Ann Darrow offered to the

          side by his FRIEND, DREW. They are on the STAGE SET of a HOTEL
          LOBBY. A LARGE BOWL of FRUIT sits on a DECORATIVE SIDEBOARD.
          
                              DREW
                    No woman is worth this!
          
                              EDGAR
                    This woman is worth it. I've gotta win
                    her back. I don't care what it takes.
          
                              DREW
                    She's not gonna buy it for a second!
          
                              EDGAR
                    Shuddup and hand me the grapefruit.
          
          EDGAR proceeds to stuff a LARGE GRAPEFRUIT down his BRASSIERE.
          
          THE AUDIENCE BREAKS into LAUGHTER. THE CAMERA PANS along a row in
          a SMALL FRINGE THEATRE, and comes to rest on a THEATRE PROGRAMME
          in the hands a MIDDLE-AGED WOMAN. The front cover reads: "Cry
          Havoc" by Jack Driscoll.

          watching the stage ...

          THELMA, her CONFIDANT, entering THE HOTEL LOBBY from the other

                                                                 107.
          
                              THELMA
                    Tell me everything - every little
                    detail!
          
          They sit on a SOFA as EDGAR takes a seat in an ARMCHAIR nearby.
          
                              JAYNE
                    So, he took me to a fancy French
                    restaurant ...
          
                              THELMA
                    French, huh?
          
                              JAYNE
                    Anyway about half way through the
                    whore derves - he clutches my hand ...
          
                              THELMA
                    He clutches your hand?!
          
                               EDGAR
                              (falsetto)
                    It felt like the right thing to do at
                    the time.
                              (falsetto)
                    Oh! I'm sorry - I couldn't help but
                    over-hear!
          
          The TWO WOMEN look at him a beat before turning back to each
          other.
          
                              JAYNE
                    He's looking into my eyes -
          
                              THELMA
                    And that's when he told you how he
                    felt?
          
                              JAYNE
                    No - he never said it.
          
                              THELMA
                    He never said it?!
          
                              EDGAR
                             (falsetto)
                    He probably thought he didn't need to
                    say it.
          
          AUDIENCE LAUGHS!
          
                              THELMA
                    Then how does she know that it's real?
          
                              JAYNE
                    He said it was not about the words.
          
                              THELMA
                    Please - if you feel it, you say it.
                    It's really very simple.
          

                                                                   108.
          
                              JAYNE
                    He said we'd talk about it later. Only
                    there was no later ...
          
          CAMERA PUSHES IN on JACK ....
          
                               AYNE (cont'd)
                    It never happened.
                             (reflective)
                    I just thought that maybe this one
                    time, things might actually work out -
                    which was really very ...
          
           LOSE ON: JACK, hearing his own words ...
          
                              JACK/JAYNE

           UDDENLY JACK stands and making his way past surprised    AUDIENCE
          MEMBERS, heads for the EXIT.
          
                               HELMA
                    Men! They'll give you the world ...
                    But they let the one thing that truly
                    matters slip through their fingers.
                    All for the sake of three little
                    words!
          
                               EDGAR
                              (indignant)
                    The three hardest words in the English
                    language!
          
          AUDIENCE MEMBERS break into fresh LAUGHTER as JACK leaves the
          THEATRE.

          mixture of PRIDE and ANTICIPATION.
          
          The SOUND of KONG BREATHING - a RASPING WEAK GROWL - causes DENHAM

                    you! Ladies and Gentlemen, I am here
                    to tell you a very strange story ... a
                    story of our adventure in which
                    seventeen of our party suffered
                    horrible deaths! Their lives lost in
                    pursuit of a savage Beast, a monstrous
                    aberration of nature! But even the
                    meanest brute can be tamed. Yes,
                    Ladies and Gentlemen, as you will see,
                    the Beast was no match for the charms
                    of a girl - a girl from New York ...
                    who melted his heart. Bringing to mind
                    that old Arabian proverb ...

                    to show you the greatest thing your

                    the Eighth Wonder of the World!!
          
          STAGE MUSIC strikes up.
          
          
          INT. BROADWAY THEATRE STAGE - NIGHT
          
          WIDE ON: With a DRAMATIC FLOURISH the CURTAIN slowly rises to
          REVEAL:
          
          KONG sitting slumped and unresponsive, his WRISTS MANACLED to   a
          STEEL SCAFFOLD. Other MANACLES and CHAINS secure his ANKLES, NECK
          and WAIST.
          
          There is a BIG GASP from the AUDIENCE ... KONG'S sheer size is
          OVERWHELMING.
          
          CLOSE ON: DENHAM ... euphoric, as the collective GASP of 2000
          PEOPLE washes over him.
          
           NGLE ON: KONG's head lolls, as if he is barely aware of his
          surroundings ...
          
                              DENHAM
                    Don't be alarmed, ladies and
                    gentlemen. It is perfectly safe. These
                    chains are made of chrome steel!
          
          WILD APPLAUSE!

          ANGLE ON: JACK, jostled on a crowded NEW YORK STREET hurrying
          rapidly along the sidewalk.
          
          JACK crosses the BUSY ROAD, heading straight towards the BROADWAY
          THEATRE.

                              dramatic)
                    Observe if you will, I am touching the
                    beast! I am actually laying my hand on
                    the twenty-five foot gorilla.

          DENHAM reaches up and touches KONG'S LEG. KONG'S foot twitches
          slightly causing DENHAM to jump back in fright ...
          
           LOSE ON: JACK enters the AUDITORIUM.

          ANGLE ON: A STAGE HAND begins to CRANK a WINCH ... the CHAINS
          at KONG'S WRISTS tighten ... the AUDIENCE GASP as KONG is SLOWLY
          FORCED to his FULL HEIGHT ...
          
          ANGLE ON: JACK walks into the BACK of the BALCONY of the
          darkened AUDITORIUM. He quietly makes his way down the SHADOWED
          AISLE.
          
           NGLE ON: DENHAM turns back to face the AUDIENCE ...
          
                              DENHAM (cont'd)
                    We have in the auditorium tonight, a
                    surprise guest. The real life hero of
                    this story ... the man who hunted down
                    the mighty "Kong"!
          
          CLOSE ON: JACK as he watches DENHAM, unnerved by the SPECTACLE.
          
                              DENHAM (cont'd)
                    The man who risked all to win the
                    freedom of a helpless female! A big
                    hand for ... Mr. Bruce Baxter!
          
          ANGLE ON: BRUCE striding on stage, dressed as the Great White

           UGE AUDIENCE ACCLAIM! DENHAM shakes BRUCE by the hand, slapping
          him on the BACK as if they were OLD FRIENDS ... BRUCE turns and
          acknowledges the ADULATION of the AUDIENCE.
          
          A LINE of DANCERS, dressed as cheesy NATIVES appear from   either
          side of the stage. They dance to the beat, playing to KONG, who
          stares impassively at them.
          
          A PULSATING DRUM BEAT begins to fill the AUDITORIUM!
          
                              DENHAM (cont'd)
                    Ladies and Gentlemen, imagine if you
                    will an uncharted island ... a
                    forgotten fragment from another time
                    ... And clinging to life in this
                    savage place, imagine a people
                    untutored in the ways of the civilised
                    world. A people who have dwelt all
                    their lives in the shadow of Fear! In
                    the shadow of ... "Kong"!
          
          CLOSE ON: JACK ... staring TRANSFIXED at the STAGE.
          
           EHIND him in the DARKNESS of the AUDITORIUM a FIGURE rises
          from a SEAT.
          
                              PRESTON
                             (quietly)
                    He was right ...
          
          JACK turns to find PRESTON standing beside him ...
          

          
                                                                   112.
          
                              PRESTON (cont'd)
                    ... about there still being some
                    mystery left in this world ...

                             (softly)
                    And we can all have a piece of it ...
                    for the price of an admission ticket.
          
          ANGLE ON: PRESTON turns to look at JACK ... JACK'S EYES   flicker
          towards the SCAR which runs down one side of PRESTON'S CHEEK ...
          
                              JACK
                             (quietly)
                    That's the thing you come to learn
                    about Carl ... his unfailing ability
                    to destroy the things he loves.
          
          ANGLE ON: DENHAM as he strides to the FRONT of the STAGE ...

          DANCERS fall to their KNEES in WORSHIP as a PLATFORM rises      from
          beneath the STAGE ...
          
                              DENHAM (cont'd)
                    Behold her terror as she is offered up
                    to the mighty "Kong"! A big hand folks

          CLOSE ON: KONG, a flicker of HOPE in his EYES.
          
          The TINY FIGURE tethered to the ALTAR looks up! For the first
          time KONG sees her FACE.
          A
           NGLE ON: KONG utterly CONFUSED; this is NOT ANN, but a woman in a
          blonde wig, dressed to look LIKE HER!
          
           ONG roars!
          
          FAKE ANN thrashes around SCREAMING unconvincingly!

          ANGER!

                    Where is she??

                               PRESTON
                    I've no idea. I heard he offered her
                    all kinds of money and she turned him
                    down flat.

          JACK'S eyes turn to the AUDIENCE seated nearby ... he gets up and
          attempts to usher people out.
          
                              JACK (cont'd)

                              BRUCE
                    Well to be honest with you, I had some

                    For a while there it looked like I
                    wasn't going to get paid ... But as it
                    turned out, Mr. Denham here has been
                    more than generous -

          blocks away PANDEMONIUM is erupting outside a BROADWAY THEATRE.
          
          ANN starts to RUN.

          ANGLE ON: KONG ... his FIST about to SMASH down on a TRAM full
          of PEOPLE! The BLARE of a CAR HORN makes him turn ... he

           ACK'S POV ... as KONG comes closer. PANICKING DRIVERS PILE into
          each other. JACK desperately tries his door, but it won't open, he
          is WEDGED IN by CARS on either side.
          
          KONG LIFTS THE CAR directly in front - HIGH ABOVE HIS HEAD,
          throwing it into a BUILDING.

          by KONG'S DESTRUCTION.
          
          KONG BOUNDS AFTER THE CAB, running on all FOURS with incredible
          speed.
          
          JACK crosses an INTERSECTION, driving up on the SIDEWALK to get a
          CLEARER DRIVING LANE ... PEDESTRIANS scatter - not only from the
          CAB, but from KONG who is in HOT PURSUIT.
          T
           he CAB SLEWS across the STREET, disappearing up a TINY ALLEY,
          only just wide enough for the CAB, but TOO NARROW for KONG.
          
          JACK glances back at KONG, ROARING with frustration at the ALLEY
          ENTRANCE.

          KONG BURSTS his way out of the ALLEY ENTRANCE ... RIGHT IN FRONT
          OF JACK'S CAB!!!

          JACK steers the CAB wildly along the SIDEWALK scattering
          PEDESTRIANS in all directions!
          
          KONG follows in HOT PURSUIT!
          
           ACK sends the CAB into a couple of TIGHT TURNS ... he rounds a
          bend and DRIVES straight into a FRUIT VENDOR'S STALL!
          
          ANGLE ON: The CAB, covered by the RUINED STALL, SLAMS into the
          WALL of a BUILDING. JACK is thrown forward on IMPACT ...

          beneath the RUBBLE ...
          
          KONG searches for the CAB, ROARING in FRUSTRATION!
          
          KONG'S HUGE EYES glance in the WINDOW, just as:
          
          KONG suddenly FREEZES! He inclines his HEAD; unsure if what he is
          seeing is REAL.
          
          KONG'S POV: ANN is walking towards him!
          
          KONG tentatively inches TOWARDS ANN!
          
          ANN stops ... KONG stops. They stare at each other for a long
          moment ... ANN offers KONG a small SMILE, and reaches her HAND out
          hesitantly towards his ARM.
          K
           ONG gently picks ANN up ... his EYES never leaving her FACE.
          
          ANN holds tightly on to his HAND and they DISAPPEAR into the

          ... nothing happens ...
          
                               LD SECURITY GUARD
                    Hey, hey, nobody past this point. You
                    can't go in there.
          
          JACK pushes past the OLD SECURITY GUARD!
          
          ANGLE ON: JACK races round a corner ... races into the SERVICE
          ELEVATOR ... the doors slowly close.
          
          
          EXT. EMPIRE STATE BUILDING/MANHATTAN - PRE DAWN
          
          The continued assault ... POV: through the gunners sight as
          bullets attack KONG.
          
          ANGLE ON: ANN continues to climb the ladder, SHE is nearing the
          top.
          

          
                                                                 123.
          
          SUDDENLY a PLANE FLIES straight at KONG. He LEAPS out the way and
          FALLS...
          
          KONG smashes into the SIDE of the BUILDING ... one hand still
          grasping onto the UPPER LEVEL ... the TOP of ANN'S LADDER gives
          way ...
          
          HIGH ANGLE ON: ANN dangling precariously in mid-air as she
          desperately tries to hold on to the STEEL RUNGS ... her fingers
          slip ... ANN FALLS!
          
          KONG stretches out and catches ANN in his HUGE PAW ... behind him
          the planes are circling preparing to dive once again ...
          
          KONG reaches through the BROKEN WINDOWS and puts ANN in the GLASS-
          IN UPPER-OBSERVATION DECK ... ANN tumbles to the GROUND.
          
          Before she can stand another BURST of GUNFIRE rakes the BUILDING!
          WINDOWS SHATTER! GLASS FLIES all around ANN. BULLETS SLAM into the
          BACK of KONG!
          
          KONG circles the building trying to get away from the PLANE but it
          continues to follow him.
          
           NGLE ON: KONG leaping back on to the top of the EMPIRE STATE
          BUILDING ... He grabs the PLANE'S WING, spinning it around and
          around ...
          
           NGLE ON: The PLANE CRASHING in to one of the OTHER PLANES ...
          both PLANES plummet to the ground.
          
          
          INT. OBSERVATION DECK, EMPIRE STATE BUILDING - DAWN
          
           NGLE ON:ANN staggers to her FEET and races outside to the
          balcony, desperately looking for KONG.
          
          KONG looks FEARFUL ... he is WEAKENING from his BULLET WOUNDS.
          
          ANGLE ON: ANN climbs the SMALL STAIRWAY which leads to the STEEL
          DOME ...
          E
          
          EXT. UPPER-LEVEL, EMPIRE STATE BUILDING - DAWN
          
          KONG, clearly weakened, looks out across the city to the
          approaching PLANES.
          
          THE PLANES are CIRCLING in the DISTANCE, preparing for an ATTACK
          RUN.
          
          
          INT. ELEVATOR, EMPIRE STATE BUILDING
          
          CLOSE ON: JACK watches the LIFT FLOOR INDICATOR as it slowly
          rises.
          

          
                                                                    124.
          
          
          EXT. UPPER-LEVEL, EMPIRE STATE BUILDING - DAWN
          
          ANGLE ON: A LONE PLANE as it NEARS it's TARGET.
          
          CLOSE ON: THE PILOTS FACE...
          
          CLOSE ON: KONG musters all his remaining strength and in one last
          challenge, rises up ROARING at the APPROACHING PLANE...
          
          ANN races between KONG'S LEGS to the EDGE of the BUILDING ... she
          frantically waves at the PLANES, screaming as loud as she can!
          
                              ANN
                    No! No!
          
          CLOSE ON: THE PILOT ... seeing ANN, he decides not to fire.
          
          ANGLE ON: KONG, now barely clinging to the top of the building,
          gently picks up ANN and STARES AT HER ONE LAST TIME. HE places her
          GENTLY down on the ground ...
          
           IDE ON: THE PLANES as they fly at KONG.
          
          GUNFIRE SMASHES into KONG. ANN looks up ... KONG grasps the side
          of the BUILDING ... She crawls over to him, clutches his FINGERS,
          hugging them, trying to COMFORT HIM. TEARS STREAM DOWN HER FACE
          ... KONG slowly lifts her in his HAND ... he looks beyond her ...

          ALL SOUND FADES AWAY ... except for a gentle breeze ...
          
          The FEAR leaves KONG ... he looks at ANN with TENDERNESS and LOVE.
          
           LOSE ON: KONG ... as the light in his eyes slowly fades and goes
          out.
          
          KONG topples back ... disappearing from sight.
          
          WIDE ON: KONG plummeting away ... Towards the ground FAR BELOW.
          
          ANGLE ON: ANN as she moves towards the edge of the EMPIRE STATE
          BUILDING ... she stares down at the STREETS BELOW ... overcome
          by a sense of utter despair ...
          
          CLOSE ON: ANN ... for a brief moment she wants to do nothing
          more than follow KONG ...
          
          ANGLE ON: JACK as he climbs on to the ROOF ... he looks at ANN.
          
          SLOWLY ANN turns and faces him ... her grief still trapped
          inside her ... JACK can see in her eyes how close he is to
          losing her.
          
          ANN stares at him a beat ... tears begin to spill from her
          eyes. Slowly she rises to her feet and walks hesitantly towards
          Jack.
          
           ACK gently embraces her. She wraps her arms around him.
          

          
                                                                 125.
          
          WIDE SHOT: JACK and ANN holding each other as dawn light washes
          over them.
          
          
          EXT. FIFTH AVENUE - MORNING
          
          CROWDS are gathering to STARE at KONG'S BODY. A SWARM of
          JOURNALISTS converge on KONG ... light-bulbs flashing ...
          
          ANGLE ON: TWO PHOTOGRAPHERS climb onto KONG'S CHEST ... CAMERAS
          AIMED right at KONG'S FACE ... they jostle for position.
          
          A POLICEMAN drags them off ...
          
                              POLICEMAN
                    Come on, boys, move on! Show's over!
                    Stay back! Behind the line!
          
          As the NATIONAL GUARD begin holding the CROWD of ONLOOKERS
          BACK.
          
          SOLDIERS pose for PHOTOS.
          
          CLOSE ON: PHOTOGRAPHER 1 staring up the long length of the
          EMPIRE STATE BUILDING ... the distance that KONG has plummeted.
          
                              PHOTOGRAPHER 1
                    Why'd he do that? Climb up there and
                    get himself cornered? The ape musta
                    known what was comin'.
          
                              PHOTOGRAPHER 2
                    It's just a dumb animal - it didn't
                    know nuthin'!
          
          ANGLE ON: DENHAM pushing through the CROWD. He stares at KONG,
          DREAD, REALIZATION dawning on his face.
          
                              PHOTOGRAPHER 2 (cont'd)
                    What does it matter? The airplanes got
                    him.
          
          PUSH IN ... on DENHAM staring at KONG, an ASHEN expression on
          his face.
          
                              DENHAM
                    It wasn't the airplanes ...
          
          The PHOTOGRAPHERS stare at DENHAM ... expectant.

                               DENHAM (cont'd)
                    ... it was beauty killed the beast.
          
          ANGLE ON: DENHAM turns and slowly walks away from CAMERA.
          
          FADE TO BLACK

FADE IN ON:

1	EXT: SKY - DAY

A WHITE BIRD soaring. The sky is a glorious explosion of blue and
mauve and lavender. The setting sun washes the clouds with a delicate
pink tint. The bird swoops and spirals and we are right there with
him. Then suddenly, below us, an extraordinary sight appears.

2	EXT: LABYRINTH - DAY

It is the labyrinth, an enormous maze of incredible mandala like
intricacy. From our magnificent vantage point, WE ARE BARELY ABLE TO
MAKE OUT its details: the twisting walls interrupted here and there
by lush forest, the complex web of waterways, the forbidding castle
at the core. It is vast and magical, frightening and compelling at
the same time. We would love to linger, perhaps fly lower and get a
better look at this wondrous place, but the bird flies on

3	EXT: GLADE - DAY

It is an idyllic setting, warm and inviting. The late afternoon sun
washes everything with a pink glow. Between the water and a line of
lush fruit trees is a flower-strewn glade. A FIGURE emerges from the
trees and walks toward the water. It is a YOUNG WOMAN dressed in a
flowing white dress that swirls around her in the breeze. The pink
light burnishes her hair and causes a gold circlet she wears on her
head to glow. She is breathtaking, a vision of innocence and grace.
She stops to pick a flower and then turns suddenly as if she has
heard something.

GIRL: Is it you?

She takes a few hurried steps and then stops, smiling shyly

GIRL: Your Highness!

The GIRL curtsies deeply and then looks up through lowered lashes,
the shy smile still dancing on her lips. And then WE PULL BACK TO
REVEAL a crown perched on a head of tight curls. WE ARE LOOKING
THROUGH the crown at the girl as she rises slowly, then looks boldly
at the PRINCE.

GIRL: Do not be swayed by my pleasure at the sight of you, my lord.
For though my father, the Duke, has promised you my hand, I cannot
consent to be yours until the evil that stalks our land from highest
hill to deepest dale is ...

Suddenly the GIRL stops speaking, a look of stunned confusion on her
face.

GIRL: ... from highest hill to deepest dale ... (her brow furrows in
concentration and then) Damn!

She burrows one hand into the deep sleeve of her gown and pulls out a
rolled-up soft-cover book. She rifles through the pages.

The PRINCE is not a prince at all, but a SHEEPDOG wearing a tin foil
crown. He thinks his work is over and it's time to play and he lunges
happily towards the GIRL who isn't a princess or even a duchess, but
15-year-old SARAH.

SARAH is knocked over by the playful DOG. Beneath the gown which WE
CAN NOW SEE is homemade and not very grand at all, WE SEE faded jeans
and running shoes.

SARAH: Get off me, you monster!!

The DOG grabs the book out of her hand and runs away with it, hoping
to be chased. SARAH doesn't follow, she just sits up and pulls the
grass out of her tangled hair and sighs with frustration. The DOG
comes back over to SARAH, its tail wagging hopefully.

SARAH: If you value your mangy life, Merlin, you'll hand it over.

The DOG obediently drops the book.

THE BOOK

On the cover it says, _MEANDER'S QUEEN a play in three acts by Robin
Zakar_. SARAH reaches for it and we hear a clock tower begin to chime.

SARAH leaps to her feet.

SARAH: Oh no, Merlin! We're really late! Why does everything have to
happen to me!!!?

MERLIN prances around her happily, his foil crown in his mouth. SARAH
pulls it out of his mouth and throws it in a nearby trash basket. He
rushes after it and peers into the basket, wanting to fetch.

SARAH: It's all your fault, you miserable mutt!!

She hikes up her dress and runs into the trees. MERLIN whimpers and
tags along behind her.

4	EXT: THE OTHER SIDE OF THE TREES - DAY

SARAH comes bursting through the trees and runs down a hill toward
the street. WE PULL BACK and WE CAN SEE an enormous steel mill on the
other side of the river. And now WE NOTICE that the light isn't pink
any more but sort of dull and hazy, and the idyllic glade is barely a
suburban park, and this is just an ordinary day in a very ordinary
place.

5	EXT: AN OLD RAMBLING HOUSE - DUSK

SARAH runs up a path to an older, rambling house. She goes through
the front door, MERLIN hot on her heels, and neither one of them sees
the beautiful SNOW-WHITE BIRD that lands in a tree beside the path.

6	INT: INSIDE THE ROUSE - EVENING

SARAH bursts through the front door and makes a beeline for the
stairs. She almost makes it. SARAH'S MOTHER appears in the hallway.

MOTHER: _Sarah_, where have you been?!!!

SARAH abruptly stops and changes to an elegantly graceful ascension
of the stairs.

SARAH (in an affected voice): I can't talk to you now. I'm in
rehearsal.

She continues grandly on and heads for her room.

MOTHER: You were supposed to be home an hour ago to baby-sit for
Freddie! Don't we at least deserve an explanation?

SARAH stops and leans over the railing. She speaks with a
melodramatic solemnity.

SARAH: As Meander's Queen, I've been ... meandering. Dither me not
about explanations.

With that she turns and heads for her room. On the door is a sign
that says: "Admittance by Invitation Only." SARAH'S FATHER comes into
the hall.

FATHER: What's that all about?

MOTHER: It's a part in a play, (raising her voice) but that's no
reason to...

SARAH turns in her doorway. She calls down.

SARAH: Chasten not your Queen, _Peasant_!

She dramatically sweeps into her room.

7	INT: SARAH'S ROOM - NIGHT

SARAH slams the door and leans against it, playing the scene.

FATHER (VO): _Sarah_, that's no way to talk to your mother!

SARAH (mumbles to herself): She's not my mother.

SARAH takes a deep breath and closes her eyes. She can hear footsteps
and SOMEONE comes to the other side of the door.

SARAH ignores her STEPMOTHER and kicks off her running shoes.

With a practiced gesture SARAH removes her jeans while leaving her
gown in place.

STEPMOTHER (VO): _Sarah_, when I tell you to be home at five, I
expect you to be home at five.

SARAH quickly shifts to her STEPMOTHER's attitude -- hands on hips,
and silently mimes her words.

SARAH: Yes, Madame!

7A	INT: UPSTAIRS HALLWAY

STEPMOTHER: And don't "Yes Madame" me!

FATHER: Is she all right?

STEPMOTHER (frustrated): Of course she's all right! I left the
Bernsteins' number on the kitchen table ... Freddie might be coming
down with a cold so call us if he seems even the least bit
uncomfortable ...

SARAH (VO) (sighs): Yes, Mother.

STEPMOTHER: Oh! I give up!

She hurries down the stairs.

FATHER: We'll see you later, baby. And remember ...

7B	INT: SARAH'S ROOM - NIGHT

SARAH speaks along with him, mimicking.

SARAH & FATHER (VO): Don't open the door to strangers.

We hear him leave. SARAH waits a beat and then turns and opens her
bedroom door.

SARAH: And don't call me baby! (she slams the door shut; mimicking
her parents) Precious little Freddie might be coming down with a cold
...

She sighs and looks around. This is really her world, her retreat,
and she knows and controls every inch of it. The shelves are filled
with an orderly array of childhood dolls and toys. The books are
lined up neatly in the bookcase and if we could see them up close we
would see that they were placed in alphabetical order -- and
according to the year they were acquired. She walks over to her
dresser. She checks herself out in the mirror above the chest of
drawers and adjusts the golden circlet which has been knocked askew
by her run. She then stops for a moment and looks at the photographs
on the dresser. One of her FATHER, her MOTHER and herself as a LITTLE
GIRL. Another picture of her MOTHER in a newspaper clipping is taped
to the mirror. The headline says, "Linda Williams a Smash in New
Play." A cover of a Playbill is also tacked on to the mirror. It says
_Best of Both Worlds_ starring Linda Williams. SARAH then reverently
opens a music box -- the kind with a twirling dancer inside -- and to
the strains of an unbearably tinny version of "Greensleeves" she
begins to rehearse.

SARAH: Do not be swayed by my pleasure at the sight of you, my Lord
...

Suddenly, something stops her cold.

SARAH (yelling angrily): Someone has been in my room!

Through the mirror WE SEE what she sees: an empty space on one of the
shelves. She swirls around and rushes out the door.

8	INT: THE HALLWAY - NIGHT

SARAH bursts out of her room.

SARAH: Where's Lancelot?

She stomps down the hallway.

SARAH: Where's my bear?!!

9	INT: NURSERY - NIGHT

SARAH enters FREDDIE's room. She searches the nursery.

SARAH: Nobody listens to a thing I say.

She opens a toy box and rifles through it.

SARAH: How many times have I told them to stay out of my room ...

She gets to the crib and looks down. FREDDIE is wide awake, gurgling
at Lancelot, SARAH's tattered old teddy bear.

SARAH: And you, you can just give me back my bear!

She yanks it out of the crib and leaves. FREDDIE looks hurt and his
face starts to cloud up.

10	INT: SARAH 'S ROOM - NIGHT

SARAH is curled up on her bed, cuddling her bear. MERLIN sits beside
her. She looks at the DOG.

SARAH: You're the only one who understands me, Merlin.

He licks her face. She gets up and holds the bear out in front of her.

SARAH: Do not be swayed by my pleasure at the sight of you, my lord
...

She is interrupted by FREDDIE's cries.

SARAH: Go to sleep, Freddie!

The cries get louder. SARAH sighs and repeats her favorite litany.

SARAH: Why does everything have to happen to me?

11	INT: NURSERY - NIGHT

SARAH enters and approaches the howling INFANT.

SARAH: I don't need this.

She pulls the blanket up over him and attempts to tuck him in.

SARAH: There, isn't that nice ...

But FREDDIE doesn't think so. He pushes the blanket off and howls
even louder. SARAH sees one of his toys on the floor and picks it up
and gives it to him. She speaks through gritted teeth.

SARAH: Want your nice toy?

But FREDDIE doesn't. He flings the toy across the room. SARAH bends
over the crib and speaks softly.

SARAH: You know, Freddie, I heard that the only thing to do with a
baby who won't stop crying is to get some goblins to come over and
teach him a lesson ...

FREDDIE lowers his screams to a whimper, but a loud whimper.

SARAH: How would you like that, kid? A nasty evil goblin ...

FREDDIE is quiet for a moment, almost as if he is considering. Then
he really howls. SARAH sighs and picks him up. She begins to pace
back and forth, and starts to hum. FREDDIE goes back to a mere
whimper.

SARAH: Oh, you like that, do you?

She begins to hum even louder and more melodically as she places the
BABY back into the crib. She then begins one of the moat macabre
lullabies you could ever imagine. She sings of how scary the dark is,
how "the shadows on the wall like to eat you when you're small" and
how "a baby doesn't stand a chance when the Goblins start their
dance." She throws herself into her performance; adding to it a wild
dance that has her whirling around the room, leaping into the air,
making strange shadows on the wall. Finally, the dance ends when too
many crazed pirouettes result in her stumbling against FREDDIE's
dresser. She staggers a bit and then the lights blink as a crack of
thunder is heard, followed by a flash of lightning.

ANOTHER ANGLE

Little FREDDIE is wailing. He hasn't understood a thing that SARAH
has sung but he can sense that something is wrong.

SARAH: Ah, c'mon, Freddie. It was just a song.

They are interrupted by the sound of the doorbell. SARAH reacts with
a gasp of surprise. FREDDIE, for some inexplicable reason, is
suddenly quiet.

12	INT: FOYER - NIGHT

SARAH approaches the front door with some trepidation. She starts to
open it, then realizes what she is doing. She fastens the chain and
only then opens the door.

13	EXT: HOUSE - NIGHT
SARAH'S POV

Through the door opening SARAH can see a very elegantly dressed,
quite good-looking MAN of an indeterminate age. He has a worldly air,
or is it other-worldly? Before he can speak a flash of lightning
illuminates his face. He is a mesmerizing sight and SARAH can't help
but gawk.

MAN: Excuse me, is this the home of Sarah Williams ... Sarah
Williams, the actress?

SARAH's jaw drops.

SARAH: That's me.

MAN: Allow me to introduce myself ... (he holds out his hand) I'm
Robin Zaker.

SARAH squeals with delight.

SARAH: You wrote the play!

He smiles.

SARAH: Just a second.

14	INT: FOYER - NIGHT

SARAH's hand hesitates over the chain for just a moment, and then she
unfastens it and opens the door. ZAKAR enters and extends his hand.

ZAKAR: It is an honour, Miss Williams. I understand you make a
delightful Queen Meander.

SARAH: Well, we've just started rehearsal, but how did you know?

ZAKAR: I was passing through this part of the country and heard that
it was going to be done here. This is the first amateur production of
the play, which of course is delightful for me.

SARAH: You know we were supposed to open tonight, but we got delayed.
The firemen had to use the hall.

ZAKAR: Yes, I know, that's why I wanted to stop by to see you.

They are interrupted by a particularly loud crash from upstairs. And
then FREDDIE begins to howl.

SARAH: That's my brother ...

There is another crash and SARAH starts up the stairs.

SARAH: I'll be right back!

ZAKAR watches her run up the stairs. He glances around and then walks
right to the liquor cabinet and takes out a bottle.

15	INT: NURSERY - NIGHT

FREDDIE in standing in his crib crying his eyes out. SARAH rushes in
and sees that the storm has blown open the basement window and it is
crashing against the wall. She rushes to close it. FREDDIE's screams
are piteous.

SARAH: Oh, Freddie ...

There is more thunder, and then lightning flashes across the darkened
room.

ZAKAR (VO): Perhaps I can soothe him ...

SARAH gasps and whirls around. ZAKAR is framed in the doorway. He has
a drink in his hand. SARAH holds the BABY close.

SARAH: You shouldn't be up here!

ZAKAR (smoothly): I just wanted to help ...

SARAH rushes by him, still clutching the BABY.

16	INT: HALLWAY - NIGHT

SARAH comes out of the nursery and hurries down the stairs. ZAKAR
follows. FREDDIE is still crying.

SARAH: Maybe you'd better leave ...

She gets to the bottom of the stairs. FREDDIE whimpers. ZAKAR is
making her very nervous.

SARAH: ... I, uh, don't think I care to talk to you about the play.

He is right behind her, almost too close.

ZAKAR: Neither do I.

SARAH is shocked and disturbed by this.

SARAH: What!

ZAKAR reaches over and smoothes FREDDIE's hair.

ZAKAR: I'm more concerned about the baby, of course.

SARAH pulls FREDDIE out of his reach.

SARAH: Freddie's just fine.

But he isn't. He's still crying. ZAKAR reaches into his pocket and
pulls out a coin. Be runs it over his fingers right in front of
FREDDIE's face. The BABY stops crying.

ZAKAR: There, isn't that better?

SARAH (nervously): Uh, sure ... but you really have to leave ...

ZAKAR ignores her and heads into the living room.

ZAKAR: I'm not just a playwright, as you can see ... bring him in
here and I'll do some other tricks for him ...

SARAH: No! You've got to ...

But he is already in the living room. She follows, still holding the
BABY.

17	INT: LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

ZAKAR is sitting on the sofa, looking very comfortable. SARAH stands
in the doorway, not sure what to do. Reluctantly, she goes and sits
down across from him.

ZAKAR: Now watch this, Freddie ...

He reaches into his breast pocket and tugs on the handkerchief there.
It comes out followed by many others, all different colours. SARAH
rolls her eyes. This is not that exciting a trick. FREDDIE isn't
impressed, either. In fact he starts to cry again.

ZAKAR: So you're going to be like that, are you, Freddie? Well, you
know what that means?

He leans across the table and SARAH pulls the BABY closer.

ZAKAR: It's time to call the goblins!

SARAH: What?!!

SARAH is surprised to hear this, to say the least. It echoes her
silly threat to FREDDIE earlier.

ZAKAR: Yes. That's what we do with bad babies ... we send for the
goblins!!

And with that he reaches into yet another pocket and pulls out a
poorly made, very silly-looking goblin hand puppet. SARAH laughs
with relief. ZAKAR, his hand in the puppet, talks in a high-pitched,
unconvincing goblin voice.

ZAKAR: You like goblins, don't'cha, Freddie? (singsong) but I bet
your sister doesn't ...

SARAH rolls her eyes at this, and then gasps. Because for one very
strange moment, the puppet keeps bouncing, but both of ZAKAR's hands
are visible! And then the puppet seems to move away from the table,
and disappear! FREDDIE claps his hands with delight. SARAH jumps out
of her chair.

SARAH: Where is it?!!!

ZAKAR points to a large cabinet against the wall.

ZAKAR: It's in there.

SARAH: Impossible!

ZAKAR: See for yourself.

SARAH hesitates for a moment, and then places FREDDIE carefully on
the rug. She then marches over to the cabinet and throws open the
door.

ANOTHER ANGLE

the puppet, grinning wildly from inside the cabinet.

ANOTHER ANGLE

SARAH gasps and involuntarily slams the door. She whirls around to
face ZAKAR.

SARAH: How did you do that?!!

ZAKAR leans back into the sofa.

ZAKAR: Magic.

SARAH: Oh sure ...

She nods, skeptically. She can't see -- but WE CAN DEFINITELY SEE --
the cabinet door slowly open behind her, and out of it comes a tiny,
fierce-looking GOBLIN! This is not a puppet, but a living creature
that moves quickly out of sight with an exaggerated tiptoe. SARAH is
busy with another problem. She doesn't see FREDDIE!

SARAH: Where's Freddie?!!

ZAKAR shrugs. In a panic, SARAH begins to look around this room. She
calls for FREDDIE and, as she passes in front of the living room
doorway, WE CAN SEE something scurry across the hallway. SARAH stops
and listens.

SARAH: Freddie?

But it wasn't a BABY she heard. Behind her there is more scurrying as
CREATURES begin to appear from various parts of the room. We hear
faint snickering. She turns to ZAKAR, terrified.

SARAH: Where is he?!!

ZAKAR points to the chair SARAH was sitting in. She is behind the
chair and can't see anything. But when she comes around in front of
it she sees FREDDIE comfortably ensconced in the cushions. And he's
playing with the goblin puppet! SARAH reaches over and grabs the
puppet out of his hands. She flings it across the room and scoops up
the BABY.

SARAH: Who are you?!!!

ZAKAR throws back his head and laughs, then suddenly leaps off the
sofa and lands very close to her.

ZAKAR: I've been known by many names ... but the one I prefer is
_Jareth, King of the Goblins_!!!

SARAH holds FREDDIE close and backs away.

SARAH: I don't believe this!

Amidst thunder and lightning JARETH flings his arms up into the air,
and he is suddenly dressed in strange, medieval garb, a cloak
swirling around him. And what's worse, much, much worse, is that
suddenly GOBLINS are everywhere! Popping out of drawers, from under
chairs, swinging off the chandeliers. SARAH turns and runs out of the
room.

18	INT: FOYER - NIGHT

It's worse in here! The GOBLINS are pouring down the stairs, SOME
slide down the bannister! SARAH tries running into another room, but
is soon back, followed by a DOZEN MORE! She barely makes it to the
front door and struggles to open it with the BABY in her arms. The
GOBLINS pull her back and laugh wildly. They fling her right into
JARETH's arms. He scoops FREDDIE up and whirls away from her. SARAH
tries to grab the BABY back but the GOBLINS get between them.

SARAH (hysterical): Give him back, you monster! Give him back!

JARETH only laughs and starts to swirl gracefully. FREDDIE laughs
with delight and SARAH struggles to reach him. With a superhuman
effort she pushes through the MASS OF CREATURES and grabs onto
JARETH's fluttering cloak. It's like being caught up in a whirlwind
of incredible force.

SARAH (screaming): I ... won't ... let ... you ... take ... him!

But it's too late. SARAH's feet leave the ground and she is pulled
with them and the whole MASS OF GOBLINS. JARETH and FREDDIE swirl up
through where the ceiling would have been, up into the blackness.
There's a QUICK MONTAGE OF SHOTS: JARETH's laughing face; SARAH,
desperate as her fingers are losing their grip; FREDDIE, who's having
a great time; GOBLINS, ALL gleeful; then -- JARETH's garment pulls
out of SARAH's grip. She falls OUT OF FRAME, a silent scream on her
face.

19	EXT: LABYRINTH - DAY
A WIDE PEACEFUL SHOT

The sky is pink, and the WHITE BIRD swoops by us as WE TILT DOWN TO
SEE the exterior wall of the labyrinth. It is a high masonry wall
that extends off in either direction. Along the wall are various
ornamental bushes and there is a small figure of a dwarf, his back to
us, peeing into a tiny pond. It looks for all the world like one of
those ornamental garden sculptures. But it isn't. This is HOGGLE. In
a CLOSER SHOT, which is quite discreet, HOGGLE finishes peeing, and
goes over to a particularly lush shrub. A few butterfly-like
creatures, flower fairies, flit around the bushes.

HOGGLE: An' how's me pride an' joy!

He leans forward to sniff one of the magnificent blossoms, sighing
with pleasure as he does. But before he can indulge he is stopped by
the whistling sound of a falling object. SARAH falls from the sky and
lands right on his prize shrub! Incensed, he screams with fury.

HOGGLE: What is this? Look what you done! You murderer!

SARAH struggles out of the broken shrub.

SARAH: What are you saying, you horrible little man?!

HOGGLE: I ain't horrible, I'm _Hoggle_. And just look! You've
destroyed me prize blossoms!

He realizes the extent of the damage to his prize specimen.

HOGGLE: I'll get ya for it, you big oaf!

And he picks up a spray can and goes after SARAH. But she's had
enough. After the nightmarish kidnapping of FREDDIE and a drop from
the deepest space, this guy is child's play. She reaches out and
pulls the can from HOGGLE's hands. She then grabs him by the
shirt-front and practically lifts him off the ground.

SARAH: Oh no you don't! If anyone's getting anything around here,
it's me ... now where' my brother?!!

HOGGLE: I ain't sayin' nothin' 'til ye let me go!

SARAH sighs and lets go.

SARAH: I'm sorry. But this just hasn't been my day.

HOGGLE looks at his crushed shrub again.

HOGGLE: Ye ain't the only one.

SARAH ignores him and stares at the massive wall behind them.

SARAH: And I don't understand any of this!

HOGGLE shakes his head and sighs.

HOGGLE: Now where have I heard that before.

SARAH: What do you mean?

HOGGLE: I mean, everyone who comes here thinkin' they can make it
through the labyrinth says sumthin' like (mimicking Sarah in a whiny,
high pitch) ... I don't understand this, whatever am I doing here,
how will I ever get home ...

SARAH: What makes you think I'm here to get through a labyrinth?

HOGGLE shakes his head again.

HOGGLE: Can't think of any reason why you'd be standin' here in front
o' this gate if you weren't.

SARAH doesn't understand what he is talking about but when she looks
up she can't believe her eyes.

ANOTHER ANGLE

A huge gate where just a moment ago there nothing but smooth, endless
wall. SARAH gulps in disbelief. Then the huge wooden doors fly open
and a terrified CREATURE runs out, full speed, screaming for his
life. Right behind him come TWO MENACING GOBLINS riding on strange
BEASTS. They are armed and dangerous looking. They quickly catch up
with the CREATURE and drag him, screaming piteously, back through the
gate. Before the gates close SARAH can see MORE GOBLINS, what seems
like hundreds of them. SOME are mounted, MOST of them are armed. And
beyond them a walled passageway seems to go on forever. Then the
wooden doors slam shut.

SARAH: Oh, no! Not more goblins!

HOGGLE: That's Jareth's goblin army, and that other poor fool musta
been caught meanderin' where he had no business.

SARAH: What will they do to him?

HOGGLE: I don't like to think about things like that.

SARAH shudders.

SARAH: I wonder if things can get any worse?

HOGGLE sighs knowingly.

HOGGLE: He's taken sumthin' o' yours, ain't he?

SARAH is clearly surprised.

HOGGLE: Jareth, our high an' mighty king ...

SARAH nods, excited that someone has a grasp of the situation.

HOGGLE: Bet he's gone and taken sumthin' you love.

SARAH (shrugging): Close. He's got my baby brother.

HOGGLE laughs derisively.

HOGGLE: Baby snatchin'! That's low.

SARAH: So I've just got to do something!

HOGGLE: Like what?

SARAH: Get Freddie back, of course!

HOGGLE: Then ya'd have ta make it through the labyrinth, 'cause
Jareth's castle is at its very center.

SARAH looks at the gates and gulps.

SARAH: Is it difficult?

HOGGLE snorts with derision.

HOGGLE: Is me prize shrub crushed into oblivion?

SARAH is reaching the breaking point.

SARAH: Look, I'm sorry about your bush! But it's not like I asked to
have some weirdo come and take my baby brother and then drop me out
of the sky!

HOGGLE: Well, I didn't ask for some overgrown flower fairy to drop on
me prized possession, neither!

SARAH: Oh, this is ridiculous!

And she stalks off to the gate, mumbling all the way.

SARAH (to herself): ... standing here wasting time talking to some
weird guy who should be living under a bridge ...

She is almost at the gate when she freezes with fear. Through the
gate she can hear the cheers and jeers of the GOBLINS, and what might
be the wailing of their poor CAPTIVE. There's no way she wants to
risk facing that horrific CREW. HOGGLE has come up behind her and as
she backs away from the gate she bumps into him. She shrieks and
whirls around.

HOGGLE: That ain't the only way in, ya know!

SARAH is very relieved to hear this.

SARAH: It's not?!

HOGGLE: Course it ain't. There's many a route in ... just only one
way out.

SARAH: Well show me one! I've got to find my brother!

HOGGLE sighs impatiently. Be fingers a belt that he wears, rattling
it in an obvious manner. It in hung with every kind of watch and
bracelet and ring you can imagine.

HOGGLE: Information like that has a price ...

SARAH, taken aback by the amount of loot he's acquired.

SARAH: I could give you this ...

She takes the gold circlet off her head. HOGGLE isn't interested.

HOGGLE: I had sumthin' o' this caliber in mind ...

He takes her hand and WE SEE that she is wearing a beautiful ruby
ring. SARAH shakes her head vehemently.

SARAH: No. My mother gave me that.

HOGGLE eyes it greedily.

HOGGLE: She could give ya another ...

SARAH: No, she couldn't. (sadness crosses her face suddenly) She
lives real far away ...

The sadness disappears just as suddenly. She holds out the circlet.

SARAH: This is all you get.

He grabs the circlet and bites it.

HOGGLE: Bah! It's paste!

Something catches SARAH's eye. It is one of the tiny FLOWER FAIRIES.
She leans over for a better look.

SARAH: No it's not, it's plastic.

HOGGLE's eyes light up at that and he grunts with satisfaction as he
strings the circlet onto his belt. SARAH reaches out her hand to the
FAIRY.

SARAH: What a beautiful little thing ...

HOGGLE reaches for the spray can.

HOGGLE: Let me at it!

SARAH is enraged.

SARAH: You murderer! How can you kill such beautiful creatures?!!

Just then the FAIRY gives SARAH a vicious bite. She shakes it off her
hand and cries out in pain.

SARAH: It bit me!

HOGGLE quickly sprays the offending FAIRY and it falls to the earth,
screaming all the way.

HOGGLE: Of course it bit ya! There's nuthin' more vicious than a
flower fairy. Any fool knows that!

SARAH sucks on her wounded hand and tries not to cry.

HOGGLE (sighs): But you don't know nuthin', do ya?

A tear trickles down SARAH's cheek. HOGGLE sighs.

HOGGLE: I got a feelin' I'm gonna regret this. (he stalks off) Come
with me an' I'll show ya a way in.

SARAH hurries after him. As they walk along the endless wall HOGGLE
looks at the circlet and polishes it on his sleeve.

HOGGLE (thrilled): Plastic!

20	EXT: LABYRINTH - DAY

Another part of the wall. HOGGLE pushes a bush aside and shows SARAH
a tiny door. She looks at it dubiously.

HOGGLE: This'll take ya into the maze, that's the first part of the
labyrinth ...

SARAH: The first part! What comes after that?

HOGGLE gets down on his knees and starts to crawl through the door.

HOGGLE: Then there's the Garden Maze, then the Forbidden Forest ...

SARAH: That sounds inviting ...

He is through the door. He is still talking but SARAH can't hear him.
She quickly tries to follow.

SARAH: Wait! Wait! I can't hear you ...

21	INT: LABYRINTH - DAY

HOGGLE is through the door.

HOGGLE: ... then comes the castle ...

SARAH's head appears.

HOGGLE: ... that's surely where Jareth's keepin' the babe ...

He looks down at SARAH, she is through the door to her waist and
straining to get the rest of herself through. HOGGLE sighs and grabs
her hand. With a groan he tugs on her and pulls her through the
doorway. She lands flat on her face.

HOGGLE: Ya don't seem ta be able ta do nuthin' without my help, do ya?

He chuckles and SARAH gives him a look that could kill as she gets up
and dusts herself off. She looks around and the environment seems
rather benign. The brick walls are open to the sky, here and there a
flower peeks through a crack.

SARAH: Oh, I think I can handle it. In fact, this place doesn't seem
so bad at all.

And with that, she jauntily heads down the nearest corridor.

22	INT: CORRIDOR 1 - DAY

SARAH turns a corner and comes face to face with a FACE. It is huge
and grotesque and protrudes out of the wall.

FACE: Go back! Go back before it's too late!

SARAH screams and backs away from it, moving further down the
corridor. She backs into something and whirls around. It is ANOTHER
FACE.

FACE 2: Turn back while you still can!!

SARAH turns and runs back the way she came.

SARAH: Hoggle!

23	INT: LABYRINTH - DAY

HOGGLE is still standing by the door, an amused smile on his face.
SARAH comes rushing toward him.

SARAH: Oh, I'm so glad you're still here! They were horrible ...

HOGGLE: You don't mean the False Alarms, do ya?

He shakes his head and goes off in the direction that SARAH just came
from.

HOGGLE: If ya gonna let a little thing like them scare ya, Missy, ya
haven't a hope o' makin' it to the castle.

SARAH quickly follows.

SARAH: False Alarms?

24	INT: CORRIDOR 1 - DAY

The corridor of faces. HOGGLE enters and the FACES start in on their
routine. SARAH comes up behind him, shuddering at the ghastly sight.

FACE 1: This is the path of no return!

FACE 2: Beware! Beware!

HOGGLE: Just ignore 'em.

SARAH: Are you sure?

HOGGLE sighs and turns to the NEXT FACE.

FACE 3: Abandon all hope ...

HOGGLE: Oh, shut up, will ya?

SARAH is wide-eyed at HOGGLE's defiance.

FACE 3: But I was just getting to the best part!

HOGGLE: All right. But don't expect us to pay any attention.

FACE 3 (winks at Sarah): You're going to love this ... Abandon all
hope ye who enter here, for this is the road to destruction!!!

HOGGLE (bored): Very nice ...

SARAH is dumbstruck. HOGGLE takes her hand and yanks her along.

FACE 3: Come back any time ... I mean, you're doomed, doomed!

25	INT: CORRIDOR 2 - DAY

HOGGLE and SARAH continuing down a similar corridor.

HOGGLE: Ya see, things aren't always what they appear to be around
here, Missy ...

SARAH (shrugging): Whatever. All I'm interested in is getting my
brother back from that creep.

She starts to look around for something.

HOGGLE: I admire yer determination, but it takes more'n that to beat
Jareth.

SARAH picks up a rock.

SARAH: Well, maybe I'm beginning to get the hang of this labyrinth
business.

She takes the rock and uses it to mark an X on the floor.

SARAH: See, now I'll know which way we came in case I get lost.

HOGGLE (sighs): Missy, goin' back the way ya came is par fer the
course around here, what ya want to do is go forward.

SARAH: Look, Hoggle! I've got to find Freddie and I don't need you to
discourage me!

HOGGLE: And I don't need to be wastin' me time goin' around in
circles with you!

SARAH: That's fine with me! (she starts off) I know you're only after
my ring, anyway!

She turns a corner and HOGGLE looks after her, hurt and pity crossing
his face. He takes a few steps in her direction and an officious
little creature, a BRICKKEEPER, emerges from the brickwork of the
floor, takes out the cobblestone that SARAH marked, and replaces it
with the marked side hidden. It looks up at HOGGLE.

BRICKKEEPER: Some people got no respect for property!

HOGGLE sticks his tongue out at the CREATURE just as it goes back
into its hole.

26	EXT: AERIAL SHOT - DAY

The WHITE BIRD flies over the maze and WE SEE SARAH marching along.
She thinks she's going forward but she's heading right for HOGGLE.

27	INT: CORRIDOR 2 - DAY

SARAH emerges into the corridor and comes face to face with HOGGLE.

SARAH: But ...

She whirls around to look behind her, then back at HOGGLE again.

SARAH: ... but you were just behind me! I'm sure of it!

HOGGLE shakes his head as she runs by him and looks down at the floor.

SARAH: My mark! It was right here!

HOGGLE comes up beside her.

HOGGLE: I told ya, Missy. Things aren't what they appear to be around
here ...

JARETH (VO): Except when they are.

ANOTHER ANGLE

JARETH, in all his glory. SARAH and HOGGLE whirl around and BOTH gasp
with surprise and fear.

JARETH: We meet again ... Sarah.

SARAH: Where's Freddie?!! What have you done with him!?

She starts to rush toward JARETH but HOGGLE holds her back.

JARETH: Nothing ... yet.

He walks toward them and they automatically step backwards. He looks
down at HOGGLE.

JARETH: And what have we here ... Hoghead, isn't it?

HOGGLE is humiliated.

HOGGLE: Me name's Hoggle.

JARETH: Ah, yes. Now I remember. (he moves closer to Hoggle) You're
the greedy little coward who lives outside the gate. Shouldn't you be
back there minding your own business ... Hedgehog?

He chucks HOGGLE under the chin, and is quite rough about it. HOGGLE
fumes silently. SARAH doesn't like this.

SARAH: Why, why don't you pick on someone your own size?

He looks her up and down.

JARETH: Whom did you have in mind?

SARAH tries to brazen it out.

SARAH: I don't have time for any games. I want Freddie, and I want
him now!

JARETH throws back his head and laughs.

JARETH: Ah, Freddie. An adorable little imp. I'm really growing
rather fond of him.

SARAH: Where is he?!!

JARETH: He's in my castle, and seems to be enjoying himself immensely.

He ambles toward them and they can't help themselves, they BOTH step
backwards.

JARETH: In fact, he likes being with goblins so much, I'm considering
turning him into one.

SARAH thinks this is crazy.

SARAH: You can't do that!

JARETH (grinning): Oh yes I can.

SARAH looks down at HOGGLE and speaks under her breath.

SARAH: Can he?

HOGGLE nods glumly.

JARETH: But let's make it interesting. I won't do it for ... thirteen
hours. If you make it to the castle before then you might be able to
save him. If not, well, I think little Freddie will mike an adorable
goblin prince, don't you?

He laughs and holds up both hands and WE SEE that they are empty. He
then closes them and when he opens them again there is a gold watch
in one hand. He throws it to SARAH, but HOGGLE intercepts it and eyes
it greedily. Annoyed, SARAH snatches it out of his hand. She looks at
it and sees that it has 13 hours marked on it. When she looks up
again, JARETH is gone.

WORM (VO): Well, good riddance to bad rubbish!

SARAH and HOGGLE BOTH jump and then look at where the voice is coming
from. It is a little WORM, poking its head out of a hole in the
brickwork.

WORM: That's what the missus always says, she does. Why the last time
she found that one around here she sent him packing.

SARAH: Jareth?!

WORM: She don't take to his kind of nonsense, that's for sure. Now,
how about a nice cup of tea? The missus has a kettle on.

SARAH looks down at HOGGLE, who shrugs. She then looks up at the WORM
and gives him a beaming smile.

28	INT: CORRIDOR 2 - DAY

SARAH and HOGGLE are sitting on the floor.

SARAH: Do you think Jareth will give Freddie back if I make it on
time?

HOGGLE: It's hard to say, Missy. But if I were you, I'd worry 'bout
first things first.

SARAH: What do you mean?

HOGGLE: I means ya got ta find the castle before ya can go savin' the
babe and I mean ta see that ya do!

SARAH is thrilled and leans over and gives him a kiss on the cheek.

SARAH: Oh, Hoggle! Thank you, thank you so much!

HOGGLE gets all flustered and tries to act gruff.

HOGGLE: Seems to me I could be gettin' that ring from ya after all if
I plays me cards right.

SARAH regards him affectionately.

SARAH: I know you don't mean that. You're helping me because you're
really nice.

HOGGLE: I ain't nice! I just likes the way ya stood up ta him is all.
(he is thoughtful for a moment; almost to himself) Too bad more've us
haven't had the guts to do the same.

The WORM reappears.

WORM: How about a biscuit? The missus just took a fresh batch out of
the oven.

SARAH: Thanks, but we really don't have any time. We've got to get to
the castle.

HOGGLE: Ya wouldn't happen to know a shortcut, would ya?

WORM: Well, you might try taking that first left.

SARAH and HOGGLE look down the corridor.

SARAH: But there isn't any left turn.

Just then a strange FIGURE seems to come through the left wall and
walks toward them. He is dressed in long flowing robes and wears a
hat shaped like a bird.

WORM: See, there's a left turn right there, where that Wise One just
came in.

SARAH: A Wise One! Maybe he knows the best way to the castle!

HOGGLE: I wouldn't bet on it.

But SARAH is excited about the possibility of getting more help.

SARAH: Excuse me, Sir. Could you tell us the best way to get to the
castle?

WISE ONE: The best way to the castle, hmmm. I'm glad you asked that
question.

To SARAH's and HOGGLE's surprise, the HAT joins into the conversation.

HAT: Now you've done it, gone and asked him a question. We'll be here
all day!

WISE ONE: A castle, or fortress, or as it is sometimes known, a
stronghold or citadel -- or, that which has a turret and barbican,
but usually not a portcullis ...

HAT: What did I tell you? There's no stopping him now.

WISE ONE: ... often there is a rampart or bulwark, and then a parapet
-- perchance an actual vallum or counterscarp ...

HAT: Shut up down there!

WISE ONE: ... and for entrenchment; a moat, drawbridge and sally-port
...

SARAH looks at HOGGLE.

SARAH: This was not one of my better ideas.

HAT: Well, I told you that, didn't I? But nobody ever listens to me!

He looks down at the still mumbling WISE ONE.

HAT: Enough! Nobody cares!!

The WISE ONE blinks and looks at SARAH and HOGGLE.

WISE ONE: Did one of you say something?

SARAH thinks quickly.

SARAH: Oh, no. We never talk to strangers.

WISE ONE: That's very wise. An idea worth savoring.

HOGGLE nudges him.

HOGGLE: Yeah, but keep it under your hat!

HOGGLE thinks this is hilarious. The HAT doesn't.

HAT: Ve-ry funny!

The WISE ONE continues on his way.

WISE ONE: The stranger, hmm. I'm glad you brought that up. The
stranger; one not indigenous, also known as the alien, or one from
beyond the sea ...

HAT (hysterical): I quit! I can't take it anymore!

And then they are gone, passing through the righthand wall as if it
wasn't there. SARAH watches after them, stunned.

SARAH: How did he do that?!!

HOGGLE: And how can we make sure he doesn't come back?

SARAH gives him a look and turns to the WORM.

WORM: Just go over to that bit of wall there and walk right through
it. The important thing is to forget what you think you know. It
doesn't apply around here.

SARAH and HOGGLE walk down to the part of the wall where the WISE ONE
entered. Once there, they can see that a section of the wall is
actually a passageway-width behind the rest of the wall. SARAH yells
back to the WORM.

SARAH: Thank you! And tell the missus we're sorry we missed her
biscuits!

And then they walk through the wall and are gone.

29	INT: CORRIDOR 3 - DAY

SARAH and HOGGLE appear through the wall and SARAH laughs with
delight. HOGGLE wasn't as pleased with the experience and feels the
wall as if testing to see if it really happened. SARAH sees that they
are in a corridor where the walls are crumbling and she climbs up to
the top of one and looks over.

ANOTHER ANGLE

SARAH'S POV - THE TURRETS OF THE CASTLE

SARAH (excited): I can see the castle! It doesn't look far at all!

HOGGLE is still feeling around the wall, trying to figure out how
they got there. SARAH jumps down and starts to run down the corridor.

SARAH: Come on, Hoggle. Let's go!

HOGGLE sees her retreating figure and hurries after her.

30	INT: CASTLE - DAY

JARETH's great hall. He stands by a window and looks out over the
labyrinth -- from this vantage point he can see clear across it: the
hovels that surround the castle walls, the arid plain that leads to
the dense forest, encircling that, the complex maze. He seems lost in
thought. The WHITE BIRD enters the window and lands on his shoulder.
Behind him FREDDIE is having a grand time. His slippery crawl is too
much for the GOBLINS that scurry about, trying to mind him.
Meanwhile, a particularly stupid looking GOBLIN begins to approach
JARETH. He saunters across the room and is stopped short by a FEMALE
GOBLIN. She grabs hold of his shirt and hisses a warning.

FEMALE GOBLIN: Remember! It's bow and scrape ... bow and scrape ...

The STUPID GOBLIN nods and she lets him go. He then continues his
approach to JARETH, only this time he does a little bow and then
scrapes his foot across the floor, then repeats the action.

STUPID GOBLIN (to himself): Bow 'n scrape ... bow 'n scrape ...

JARETH turns and sees the GOBLIN.

JARETH: Well, what is it?

The GOBLIN can't answer and do his bow-and-scrape at the same time so
continues his painfully slow approach.

STUPID GOBLIN: ... bow 'n scrape ... bow 'n scrape ...

Annoyed, JARETH walks over to the GOBLIN and lifts him up by his
shirt front. The GOBLIN is still bowing.

JARETH: I said, what is it?!!!

STUPID GOBLIN: Th ... the girl and Hoggle, sire. Th ... they're
halfway th .... through th ... the maze.

JARETH drops the GOBLIN hard on the floor. FREDDIE sees this and
laughs with delight. JARETH walks over and scoops the BABY up in his
arms. He then carries him over to the window. He calls over to an
ARMED GOBLIN by the door.

JARETH: I think it's time they had some company.

ARMED GOBLIN: Yes, Sir!

Be then salutes, causing his visor to close on his face, then
stumbles around looking for the door. JARETH shakes his head.

JARETH: You'll make a much better goblin than that, won't you,
Freddie!

FREDDIE's response is to clap his sticky baby's hand on to JARETH's
face. JARETH, pretending he doesn't mind, carefully removes it. He
then looks down to the courtyard below.

31	EXT: CASTLE - DAY
JARETH'S POV

ARMED GOBLINS are pouring out of the castle.

32	EXT: CORRIDOR 4 - DAY

SARAH and HOGGLE are striding down a corridor. They are about to come
to a corner.

SARAH: Are you sure Jareth can turn Freddie into a goblin? I mean,
that's really weird ...

They turn the corner and HOGGLE stops short. SARAH becomes alarmed.

SARAH: What is it?

HOGGLE gestures for her to be quiet and then we can hear what he
hears -- marching. They look back the way they came.

ANOTHER ANGLE

SARAH'S AND HOGGLE'S POV - A BATTALION OF ARMED GOBLINS, marching
right towards them!

ANOTHER ANGLE

They look at each other, then turn and run. HOGGLE tries to get
through the wall the way the WORM showed them.

HOGGLE (quoting the worm): Just forget what you think you know and ...

He smacks headlong into the wall. He stops to rub his nose and SARAH
flies by him.

SARAH: Come on!

33	INT: CASTLE - DAY

FREDDIE is now sitting on the lap of a GOBLIN, happily bopping it on
the nose. JARETH snaps his fingers and a GROUP of sleepy MUSICIANS in
the corner stumble over themselves to pick up their instruments. They
begin to play and JARETH looks out the window and begins a song. He
sings about the labyrinth; what it is -- his domain, and what it is
to OTHERS -- a test, a proving-ground, not for the faint of heart.

34	INT: MAZE MONTAGE - DAY

While JARETH sings, SARAH and HOGGLE try to escape from the GOBLINS.
They get a lead on them for a while and come to another corridor with
crumbling walls. They scamper up to get a look at their position and
see dust rising from several parts of the maze. The GOBLINS are
everywhere.

In another corridor, they are stopped in their tracks by DOZENS OF
LITTLE FUZZY CREATURES who scurry towards them out of the way of the
oncoming GOBLINS. They turn and run back the way they came and as
they do WALL CREATURES chatter nervously and then disappear into the
cracks between the bricks.

In a corridor with very short walls they are able to see the tips of
spears on either side of them, going in the opposite direction.

They enter a corridor with several arches curving over it, forming
small, intermittent bridges. Thinking they are safe, they stop for a
breath, and soon realize that a BATTALION is right behind them. They
scurry up the walls, and as the song comes to an end, they each lie
across an arch hopefully out of sight of the GOBLINS below.

35	INT: ARCHED CORRIDOR - DAY

SARAH and HOGGLE huddle above the corridor on their arches as TWO
GOBLINS bring up the rear.

GOBLIN 1: I can kill better than you can.

GOBLIN 2: But I'm better at maiming. Everybody says so.

And they are gone. Shaken, SARAH and HOGGLE slide down from their
hiding places.

SARAH: Do you think they're gone?

HOGGLE: Sure they are. Goblins ain't known fer their intelligence, ya
know. They has as much trouble findin' their way through the maze as
you do.

He folds his arms and leans against the wall.

SARAH: I'm not sure, but I think you just called me stupid ...

Suddenly HOGGLE yells and disappears. He has accidentally leaned on
another secret wall opening. SARAH quickly follows.

36	INT: CORRIDOR 5 - DAY

HOGGLE and SARAH are now in the long circular corridor that divides
the maze from the beginning of the second ring of the labyrinth --
the Garden Maze.

HOGGLE (excited): I think I know where we are!

SARAH: That'll be a nice change.

He ignores her and looks around excitedly.

HOGGLE: This place is the end o' the maze! That means we're near the
entrance ta the second ring o' the labyrinth.

SARAH: The second ring? What's that?

HOGGLE starts down the corridor.

HOGGLE (happily): The Garden Maze!

SARAH (gloomy): Sounds like a great place ... what's it like?

HOGGLE: Don't know, I ain't never made it this far before.

He is skipping happily down the corridor when SARAH hears something.
It is a strange clanking sound.

SARAH (frightened): Hoggle! What's that sound?!!

HOGGLE stops skipping and sighs.

HOGGLE: Now don't go gettin' all girly on me, Missy, now that we's
finally safe ...

SARAH: So you think we're safe, do you?

HOGGLE (annoyed): Didn't I just say so?!!

SARAH: Then tell me what you think of that.

SARAH points behind them where the clanking noise is coming from. It
is now much louder. HOGGLE comes over to her and takes a better look.
He screams.

ANOTHER ANGLE

THEIR POV - A SLASHING MACHINE is coming right towards them. (A
slashing wall is made up of rows of furiously spinning knives, and
chopping cleavers, and has brushes along the bottom to clean up
whatever it encounters in its path.) And there is no way around it
because it completely fills the corridor.

ANOTHER ANGLE

HOGGLE desperately tries to walk through the wall the way they came
in, but it is to no avail. He just keeps smashing his face. SARAH
starts to run for it.

SARAH: Come on!

HOGGLE follows, every so often trying, and failing, to get through
the wall.

ANOTHER ANGLE

SARAH, who is far ahead of HOGGLE, comes to a door! And hanging on a
hook next to it is a bunch of keys. She looks back at HOGGLE.

SARAH: Hoggle, hurry!

ANOTHER ANGLE

SARAH'S POV - HOGGLE running toward her, and making slow but steady
progress toward them BOTH -- the slashing machine.

ANOTHER ANGLE

SARAH fumbles with the keys, furiously trying key after key in the
door but to no avail. She is terrified.

SARAH: None of the keys work!

Desperate, she starts banging on the door. HOGGLE is just a few yards
away from her.

HOGGLE: Why don't you just try it?

He then tries once more to walk through the wall. SARAH tries the
knob and sure enough, it opens. She is delighted. What she doesn't
see is HOGGLE suddenly disappearing through the floor.

SARAH: It's open! Hog ...

She turns around and he is gone! And the slashing machine is just a
few yards away! She screams and, in her terror, falls backwards
through the door. It slams shut just as the slashing machine reaches
it WE CAN SEE that FOUR GOBLINS in sanitation workers' uniforms have
been pushing the machine all along. They grunt and strain, cranking
the wheels that turn the knives and pushing all at the same time.

37	INT: PICTURE GALLERY - DAY

SARAH emerges into a large room. The walls are covered with large
paintings in ornate gilt frames. She is a bit stunned by the clone
call with the slashing machine as she approaches the first painting.

SARAH (to herself): What in the world ...

She stops short in front of the first painting and cannot believe her
eyes. It is a painting of the watch with 13 hours on it. The hour
hand is on the 9. SARAH fumbles into her pocket and finds the watch
that Jareth gave her. It also has the hour hand on the 9.

SARAH: Only 9 hours left!

The next picture is of a BABY surrounded by gruesome GOBLINS. On
closer inspection, the BABY is obviously FREDDIE. She chokes back a
sob and runs over to the next one, it is a picture of a rotunda with
staircases going off in all different directions on different planes
of gravity. It is an Escher room, and a closer look shows a GOBLIN
happily standing on the ceiling. She shakes her head and goes by the
next painting and gasps involuntarily. It is a compelling portrait of
JARETH, and she moves even closer. Then she shakes herself out of it.

ANOTHER ANGLE

THE PORTRAIT'S POV - SARAH wills herself away and moves on, and we
hear the sound of JARETH's breathing.

ANOTHER ANGLE

SARAH is nervous and eagerly looks for a way out. She rushes by
another painting, giving it merely a glance. But something makes her
go back for a better look. It is of a lovely, manicured hedge maze.
In the distance WE CAN SEE the turrets of JARETH's castle. And in the
sky nearby flies a beautiful WHITE BIRD. And then SARAH is amazed by
what she sees. A closer look at the painting reveals that the WHITE
BIRD is flying! It moves over the hedges and WE SEE a FIGURE waving.

SARAH: Hoggle!

SARAH, disturbed, backs away from the painting. And then, because it
really is as wonderful as it is scary, she goes back for another look
and over her shoulder WE CAN SEE HOGGLE waving and we hear his tiny
voice.

HOGGLE: Missy! Over here! This is the way to the castle!

And SARAH strains to hear, and leans toward the painting, stretching
her hand out and touching the painting, which makes it turn into a
shimmering wall that her hand goes right through. And then she
disappears right through the painting.

ANOTHER ANGLE

THE GALLERY. And JARETH's portrait is now blank.

38	EXT: HEDGE MAZE - DAY

SARAH rushes up to HOGGLE and throws her arms around him.

SARAH: What happened to you? I was afraid I'd never see you again!

HOGGLE: Ya know that trick with the wall? Damn, if it don't work with
the floor, as well!

SARAH laughs and hugs him again.

39	INT : HEDGE MAZE - DAY

SARAH and HOGGLE have been walking through the maze a long time. They
are tired and bedraggled. SARAH pulls the watch out of her pocket and
sighs.

SARAH: An hour's gone by and I don't think we're more than four feet
from where we started.

HOGGLE: That's 'cause ya won't do what I tells ya. It's clear as day
we should be goin' this way ...

He turns a corner and walks smack into a hedge dead end. He howls in
pain and SARAH sighs and follows him.

ANOTHER ANGLE

HOGGLE disentangling himself from the hedge.

SARAH: Got any more suggestions?

Before HOGGLE can answer they are interrupted by a terrible
gut-wrenching scream. It is positively unearthly. SARAH whirls around.

SARAH: It sounds like it came from over there!

HOGGLE points in the opposite direction.

HOGGLE: Then let's go this way.

SARAH frowns at him as the scream begins again.

SARAH: Hoggle! It sounds like someone's being hurt!

HOGGLE: Exactly why we should be headin' in the othermost direction!

SARAH shakes her head in disgust and runs off as the screams become
more unbearable.

ANOTHER ANGLE

SARAH, running through the hedge maze. Driven by the sound of the
screams, she has an unconscious ability to find her way through.
HOGGLE, trying to keep up with her, keeps running into dead ends.

ANOTHER ANGLE

SARAH emerging from the maze. She is stopped in her tracks by what
she sees and quickly covers her mouth to prevent herself from
screaming. HOGGLE emerges a moment later, barely pauses before he
heads right back into the maze.

40	EXT: CLEARING - DAY

SARAH'S POV - FOUR GOBLINS are torturing a huge creature (LUDO) that
they have hung by his ankle from a tree limb. They have also taken
pains to bind the CREATURE, who it is obvious could take an most of
them and win in a fairer fight. He is about nine feet tall,
powerfully built, and his screams of frustrated agony are truly
unbearable. The GOBLINS have devised a unique method of harassing
him. They ALL carry long sticks which have small, fierce, biting
CREATURES on the end of them. The GOBLINS bat their sticks at LUDO,
who bellows and tries to swat back. Since he is tied, the NIPPERS are
free to bite him whenever they get near.

ANOTHER ANGLE

SARAH, distraught, peeking out from behind a hedge.

SARAH: The poor thing!

HOGGLE peeks out from behind SARAH, then quickly ducks back. SARAH
looks for a way to stop the torture. She picks up a rock and
carefully aims it at the nearest GOBLIN. It hits his head and knocks
his helmet visor over his eyes. Blinded, the GOBLIN lurches around,
swinging his nipper stick at the OTHER THREE.

BLINDED GOBLIN: Hey! Who turned out the lights?

The OTHER GOBLINS see a new target and poke their nipper sticks
towards him. He takes off and runs blindly into the hedge maze. The
OTHER THREE chase him, carrying the nipper sticks upright no that WE
CAN SEE their progress in the BG.

ANOTHER ANGLE

SARAH desperately tries to untie the huge knot that holds LUDO
suspended upside down. She can't undo it and yells for HOGGLE

SARAH: Get out here, you coward!

HOGGLE appears from behind his hedge. He hesitates, then pulls a
dagger from his belt and joins SARAH. He cuts through the rope in one
hack, and LUDO falls to the ground with a thud.

ANOTHER ANGLE

The nipper sticks start yammering away as they see SARAH and HOGGLE
freeing LUDO over the top of the hedge. The GOBLIN chase stops and
they head back to the clearing. HOGGLE dives for the bushes but a
determined SARAH stays and pulls off the ropes. When LUDO is free, he
picks up a huge log. As the FOUR GOBLINS come roaring back into the
clearing, LUDO waves the log over his head. The GOBLIN charge
immediately shifts into a GOBLIN retreat, the nipper sticks yipping
in fear.

ANOTHER ANGLE

LUDO puts down the log and sits, his big shaggy head hanging down. He
taken one hand and wipes away a tear.

LUDO: Ludo ... hurt.

SARAH's heart breaks. This thing is the ultimate stuffed animal.

SARAH: Is that your name? Ludo?

He nods and wipes away another tear.

LUDO: Goblins ... mean to Ludo.

SARAH: Oh, I know! They were terribly mean to you. (she moves closer
and pats his arm) But it's all right now.

LUDO sniffs and then breaks into the most endearing big dumb smile
you have ever seen.

LUDO: Friend!

SARAH: That's right, Ludo! I'm your friend. I'm Sarah.

LUDO: Sarah ... friend!

HOGGLE has come out from hiding during this exchange. He finds the
whole scene a bit nauseating. And an unnecessary nuisance. If there's
one thing he doesn't want, it's competition for SARAH.

HOGGLE: I think I'm about ta be sick.

They ignore him and LUDO grins for all he's worth as SARAH beams up
at him. HOGGLE pulls her over to one side.

HOGGLE: I hope yer not thinkin' o' lettin' the beast traipse along,
Missy. He'll just slow us up.

SARAH: Are you kidding?! He'll be a great help! The goblins are
scared of him because he's so fierce ...

Just then LUDO shyly offers SARAH a flower that he has just picked
for her. She takes it and smiles at him.

HOGGLE (sarcastically): I sees what ya mean.

SARAH shrugs and gives LUDO a pat. HOGGLE sighs with frustration.

HOGGLE: I just thinks we was doin' fine on our own.

SARAH: And we can do even better with Ludo. (turns to Ludo) You want
to help me save my baby brother, don't you, Ludo?

LUDO: Save ... baby. Good!

SARAH nods with satisfaction and strides into the hedge maze. LUDO
right behind her. HOGGLE follows, clearly unhappy.

41	EXT: FOREST GATE - DAY

SARAH, HOGGLE and LUDO come out of the hedge maze and see a wall with
two SARAH-sized doors in it.

HOGGLE: This is it, the entrance ta the Forbidden Forest. All we
gotta do is pick a door ...

SARAH: What difference does it make? Let's just go!

LUDO quickly steps between SARAH and the doors.

LUDO: One door ... good. One door ... bad.

HOGGLE: Well, that's great news. (to Ludo) Don't suppose ya know
which is which?

SARAH skirts around LUDO and goes up to the doors for a closer look
at them.

LUDO: One door ... good. One door ...

HOGGLE: All right, ya walkin' mountain! Ya made ya point.

ANOTHER ANGLE

SARAH ignores the bickering behind her and examines the doors. Each
one has a door knocker on it. Both knockers are carved into faces,
except one has the ring going through its ears and the other has it
stuck in its mouth.

SARAH (to herself): I guess once you choose a door ... all you have
to do is knock.

The KNOCKER with the ring through its ears speaks.

KNOCKER 1: Are you addressing me?

SARAH jumps back, stunned.

SARAH: You can talk!

KNOCKER 1: What? What? You'll have to speak up!!

KNOCKER 2: mmffn ... grnth ... sminvl ...

SARAH turns to the OTHER KNOCKER.

SARAH: You too!

KNOCKER 2: ... gmft ... bmble ...

SARAH shakes her head in amazement.

ANOTHER ANGLE

The BOYS are still at it.

HOGGLE: If yer so smart why not show us another way inta the forest?

LUDO: Ludo ... not ... know.

HOGGLE: That figures, don't it? (he turns his back on Ludo, fuming)
Why the Missy wants an overgrown hill o' hair fer a friend is beyond
me.

LUDO tries to make HOGGLE feel better and pats him on the shoulder.
HOGGLE shakes his hand off with a growl.

ANOTHER ANGLE

SARAH is excited.

SARAH: I love it! Talking doors!! (to Knocker 1) Are you the right
door to the forest?

KNOCKER 1: It doesn't do to ask me. For some reason I can't hear a
thing.

SARAH turns to KNOCKER 1.

KNOCKER 1: No use asking him, either. All he does is mumble.

KNOCKER 2 gets very excited.

KNOCKER 2: thgt ... vrnf ... lcl ...

SARAH: I get it! You can't talk with that ring in your mouth!

She removes the ring and looks at the FACE triumphantly.

SARAH: Now, tell me which one of you is the right door to the forest.

KNOCKER 2: Oh, I am. No question about it.

SARAH: Great! How do we get you to open up?

KNOCKER 2: One merely has to knock.

SARAH: Of course, why didn't I think of that.

She tries to get the ring back in its mouth.

KNOCKER 2: Oh no you don't, young lady! I've had just about enough of
that awful thing, thank you very much!

SARAH: But how are we supposed to get through this door if you won't
let me knock on it?

KNOCKER 2: Well, I really couldn't say now, could I?

SARAH throws up her hands in disgust.

KNOCKER 1: Oh do speak up, both of you? I can't hear a thing!

ANOTHER ANGLE

HOGGLE and LUDO are still at it.

HOGGLE (conspiratorially): Ya know ... even if she does get the door
open, ya won't be able ta fit through. Why not make it easy on us all
and take a hike?

LUDO: Ludo ... Stay!

HOGGLE is disgusted.

HOGGLE: Yer quite the speechifier, ain't ya?

ANOTHER ANGLE

SARAH suddenly gives KNOCKER 2 an evil grin.

SARAH: Are you sure there isn't anything I can do to change your mind?

KNOCKER 2: Absolutely not! My lips are sealed!

SARAH: That's what I thought!

The KNOCKER presses its lips firmly together. SARAH deftly squeezes
its nose shut. It sputters for air and finally has to open its mouth
before it suffocates. SARAH shoves the ring in with a gleeful cry of
triumph. She knocks, and the door swings open.

SARAH: Let's go!

She goes through the door and HOGGLE and LUDO race to follow. They
BOTH try to get through the door at the same time and get into such a
tangle that the door closes before they can straighten themselves out.

HOGGLE: Now you've done it!

In a frenzy, HOGGLE starts banging on both doors.

HOGGLE: Missy! Missy, wait!

42	EXT: FORBIDDEN FOREST - DAY

SARAH on the other side of the door. Except on this side, there is no
door, just a long expanse of wall. The forest is very dark, and as
its name suggests, very forbidding. SARAH can hear HOGGLE calling,
but it is very faint.

SARAH (scared): Hoggle?

43	EXT: FOREST GATE - DAY

HOGGLE is beating on the doors with such a frenzy that the other door
swings open.

HOGGLE: I'm coming ...

He rushes through the door and disappears. We can tell from his voice
that he is falling down a deep hole.

HOGGLE (echoed): ... Miiiiiiiiissy!

We hear a huge splash. Then that door shuts and LUDO is all alone.

LUDO: Sarah ... gone. Hoggle ... gone.

He is sad and confused. A FIGURE emerges from the hedge maze and
begins to walk along the wall, away from LUDO. It is the WISE ONE.
LUDO brightens and chases after them.

LUDO: Wait!

The WISE ONE stops and the HAT looks LUDO up and down.

HAT: This ought to be a good one!

LUDO: Ludo ... need ... door!

WISE ONE: You have need of a door, do you? Ah, yes. A very useful
thing, the door; also known as a portal or threshold -- and that
which gives access, a gate or gangway ...

He continues walking and LUDO walks with him, listening intently.

WISE ONE: ... also an entrance or entry, often accompanied by a
propylaeum ...

HAT (sighs): If only I had hands I could cover my ears ... that is,
if I had ears ...

WISE ONE: ... not to be confused with a window, or fenestration ...

44	EXT: FOREST - DAY

SARAH has waited long enough.

SARAH: Hoggle, Ludo ... where are you?

She reaches into her pocket and looks at the watch. The hour hand is
on the 7.

SARAH: (whispers) Oh, Freddie! (she shoves the watch back into her
pocket) Well, you guys are going to have to catch up with me 'cause I
can't wait.

Then determined, she strides off.

45.	INT: HOLE - DAY

HOGGLE is in a pool at the bottom of a deep hole in the ground. There
is a ledge just above him and he splashes violently trying to reach it.

HOGGLE: Somebody help me! I can't swim!

46	EXT: FOREST - DAY

SARAH is in a very thick, creepy part of the woods. She is clearly
lost. She gets herself tangled in a thorn bush, and struggles with it
to get herself free. Finally she does, and then, frustrated, sits
down on the ground.

SARAH: Why does everything have to happen to me?

But there's no time to think about that because she hears the sound
of a driving drum rhythm and then a wild-looking, spindly, leering
LITTLE CREATURE comes scampering through the trees and into the
clearing; and then ANOTHER, and ANOTHER and ANOTHER. SARAH is
terrified as they approach her, but then not so terrified because the
CREATURES aren't doing anything except dancing; wild, loose-limbed,
frenzied dancing. SARAH laughs, and can't help but be taken in by the
wild spectacle. And then they begin to encircle her, still moving to
the wild rhythm.

SARAH (laughing, moving): What are you?

WILD THING 1: We're Wild Things, baby! Wild!

WILD THING 2: Wild and free!

WILD THING 3: Get down!

And then more WILD THINGS appear, and these produce instruments. As
and turn the drum rhythm into a frenzied upbeat number.

WILD THING 1: You call that wild! I'll show you wild!

And then he does an amazing thing, to say the least. He takes his
head off and rolls it along his arms from hand to hand like a
juggler, then tosses it high in the air and deftly catches it on his
shoulders. SARAH gasps and tries to get sway but another WILD THING
pushes her back into the middle of the melee.

WILD THING 2: Cut me some slack and move on back!

And they do, and, moving to the pounding rhythm, he takes his eyes
out of his head and waves them at SARAH. He then tosses them on the
ground as if they were a pair of dice. They land at SARAH's feet
looking straight up.

WILD THING 2: Snake eyes!

SARAH is fascinated and repelled. And the beat gets hotter and the
frenzy more frenzied and she can't help getting a little wild
herself. She begins to really dance.

WILD THING 3: That's it, baby, get wild and free! But you'll never be
as wild as me!

And to prove it he takes his head off and begins to dribble it like a
basketball. WILD THING 1 leans over to SARAH and whispers
conspiratorily.

WILD THING 1: I wouldn't call that really _wild_, would you?

SARAH: Well, it's ... uh ... sort of ...

WILD THING 1: I'd call _this_ wild ...

And he takes off his head, puts it on the ground as if it were a golf
ball, and then removes a leg and uses it as a golf club. The head
goes flying, right to SARAH. SARAH catches the head, then tries to
get it back to its body but the body dances into the middle of all
the other WILD THINGS and she can't find it. So there's SARAH,
running around like a chicken with two heads when suddenly the ears
start to flap and the head flies out of her hand. A WILD THING grabs
her hand and turns her around.

WILD THING 2: That was _wild_, baby. (he starts to dance) Now how
'bout gettin' wild with me?

But SARAH has had enough.

SARAH: I think I'll sit this one out ...

WILD THING 1: Not with us you don't ...

WILD THING 2: 'Cause we're _wild_!

And then they're all over her, like a bunch of hyper puppies, and
it's really too much.

SARAH: Enough! I've got to find the castle!

WILD THING 2: Well, why didn't you say so, baby!

WILD THING 3: That's a _wild_ idea!

And then his head flies off and he has to quickly grab it and put it
back and meanwhile the OTHERS start pushing and pulling on SARAH and
propel her into the woods.

WILD THING 1: They got some wild goings on at the castle, baby!

47	INT: HOLE - DAY

HOGGLE is holding on to the ledge with his fingertips. He doesn't
have the strength to hold on much longer and he looks down at the
water in mortal terror. He begins to slip just as a door opens in the
sheer rock and JARETH enters, accompanied by GOBLINS.

JARETH: Well, what have we here ... if it isn't little _Piggle_!

HOGGLE screams and slips into the water. He tries to struggle back to
the ledge but the GOBLINS push at him with poles, laughing maniacally.

JARETH: Did the girl decide she doesn't need you, now that she has
that beast?

HOGGLE (angry): She wouldn't do nuthin' like that!

JARETH leans over the water, laughing.

JARETH: Don't you know she could never care for a repulsive thing
like you!

HOGGLE splashes and tries to stay afloat.

HOGGLE: She does care! Me 'n Sarah is friends!

JARETH: Only until something better comes along ... and I've
definitely got something better in mind!

HOGGLE: Don't you hurt her!

HOGGLE grabs on to the ledge and the gleeful GOBLINS push him back
down into the water.

JARETH: What I do to her is my business ... and it is _inevitable_.

He grabs HOGGLE by the shirt front and lifts him out of the water.

JARETH: You can be with me or against me.

HOGGLE (terrified): Wh ... what do I gotta do?

JARETH: I doubt if she can make it to the castle in time ...

He leans down and speaks directly into HOGGLE's face.

JARETH: But just in case, I want you to deliver her to me.

HOGGLE: Never! I'd rather die!

JARETH sneers scornfully.

JARETH: Then so you shall.

He drops HOGGLE back into the water. The GOBLINS shriek with delight.
HOGGLE goes under and comes up sputtering.

HOGGLE: Wait!

JARETH was about to leave. He turns back to HOGGLE, a look of
amusement on his face.

HOGGLE: I gotta know what ... what you'll do to her!

He splashes pathetically in a desperate attempt to stay above water.

JARETH: I will do what ever amuses me ...

He reaches into his cloak and brings out a perfect peach.

JARETH: All _you_ have to do is give her this.

He tosses HOGGLE the peach. HOGGLE catches it and immediately the
water starts to recede.

JARETH: You've made a very wise decision.

He leaves, followed by the GOBLINS.

HOGGLE: I didn't decide nuthin'!

HOGGLE stares forlornly at the peach, and soon the water is gone and
he is sitting on cold, damp ground.

48	EXT: FOREST - DAY

The WILD THINGS are leading SARAH on a rocky path. She stumbles along
but they couldn't care less.

SARAH: Are you sure this is the way to the castle?

WILD THING 1: Oh, did you say "the castle"?

WILD THING 2: I thought she said hassle!

WILD THING 3: I thought she said rassle!

WILD THING 1: Rassle! That's a _wild_ idea!

He leaps on SARAH and she flings him off.

SARAH: OK, guys, fun's over.

She starts to leave and they pull her back.

WILD THING 2: Over! It's just begun!

And then the musicians are back and the dancing gets wilder than
ever. The WILD THINGS totally surround SARAH, and though they aren't
hurting her, they are definitely not letting her out. What they do is
start throwing their heads at each other and switching them.

WILD THINGS 1, 2 & 3: Now this is _really_ wild!

ANOTHER ANGLE

A door opens in a nearby boulder and LUDO appears. In the background
WE CAN SEE and hear the WISE ONE as he wanders off.

WISE ONE: ... very often preceded by a porch, or portico, also
verandah, and followed by a vestibule, otherwise known as an
antechamber or foyer ...

HAT: Why me?!!

The door closes. LUDO sees SARAH in the middle of this weirdness and
is just a bit confused. SARAH sees him amidst the flying heads and
cries out in relief.

SARAH: Ludo!

LUDO: Sarah ... not ... want ... castle?

SARAH: Are you kidding?!! Get me out of here!!!

LUDO approaches the WILD THINGS and grabs a head before it reaches
its target and calmly tosses it into the trees.

WILD THING 3: Hey, big fella! That's a little _too_ wild ...

But there's no time to talk because LUDO calmly catches the other
heads and tosses them away. The bodies go scurrying after their
heads, followed by the MUSICIANS. SARAH is free.

SARAH: Oh, Ludo! I'm so glad you're here!

She gives him a kiss and he beams.

SARAH: Where's Hoggle?

LUDO: Hoggle ... in ... bad ... door.

SARAH: We've got to find him! Do you think we can?

LUDO is very confident. He spent a lot of time with the WISE ONE.

LUDO: Ludo ... knows ... doors ...

He ambles off with SARAH following.

LUDO: also ... portal ... or entrance ...

49	INT: HOLE - DAY

HOGGLE is more depressed than ever. The peach is nowhere to be seen.
Suddenly LUDO's head appears above.

LUDO: Hoggle ... all ... wet.

HOGGLE almost jumps out of his skin and then is totally outraged.

HOGGLE: Ain't that the clever observation, ya feeble excuse fer a
thinkin' creature!

SARAH appears from behind LUDO.

SARAH: Be nice, Hoggle. Or we won't get you out.

HOGGLE's face lights up and all thoughts of anger are forgotten.

HOGGLE: Missy!

50	INT: FOREST - DAY

SARAH, HOGGLE and LUDO march through thick, overgrown forest. They do
not know that they are being spied on by JARETH'S GOBLINS.

51	INT: CLEARING - DAY

The THREESOME emerge into a clearing and see that they have come to a
wide fissure that goes off in either direction as far as the eye can
see. It is spanned by a rickety bridge held by two thick wooden posts
on either side of the gap. SARAH eyes the bridge warily.

SARAH: It doesn't look too strong but we don't have much choice ...

Suddenly they are interrupted by a high-pitched, but powerful voice.

VOICE (VO): Halt! Halt or be slain forthwith!

At first they don't see a thing and look around for the source of the
voice. Then, the imposing 18 inch high figure of DIDYMUS, resplendent
in rakish hat and swashbuckling sword, emerges from behind one of the
posts and stands in front of the bridge. LUDO and SARAH are
dumbstruck. HOGGLE, however, is not at a loss for words.

HOGGLE: Out of our way, ya wretched little rodent ...

DIDYMUS looks directly at HOGGLE.

DIDYMUS: You, sir, shall be the first to feel the point of my sword!

HOGGLE snorts with derision and SARAH tries a more sensible approach.

SARAH: Please, we really have to cross this bridge. It's a matter of
life and death!

DIDYMUS shrugs elegantly.

DIDYMUS: Under any other circumstances I would hasten to oblige you,
fair damsel, for your mission sounds a worthy one.

SARAH: Oh, it is!

DIDYMUS: But I am sworn. Without my permission, none may pass.

SARAH throws up her hands and HOGGLE mumbles under his breath. It
appears to be up to LUDO to break the deadlock. He lifts DIDYMUS up
into the air and moves him to one side. They then start to walk
toward the bridge and DIDYMUS chases them, brandishing his sword.

DIDYMUS: You dishonor me, varlets! En garde!

To his chagrin they ignore him and keep walking.

DIDYMUS: Rapscallions! Duel ... or _die_!

This gets their attention and they turn to look at him, annoyed.

HOGGLE: What _is_ this weasel babblin' about?

It is too much for DIDYMUS. He flings himself at HOGGLE with a mighty
war cry. HOGGLE tries to run for it but DIDYMUS is right behind him,
administering more than a few pinpricks in embarrassing places.
HOGGLE dives behind a bush and DIDYMUS sniffs at his cowardice. He
comes back and faces LUDO.

DIDYMUS: It is you I want, rogue of rogues. You who dealt me the
gravest affront!

And with that he jabs LUDO in the foot! LUDO is stunned, and howling,
begins to hop on his good foot. DIDYMUS, his head thrown back for a
triumphant yell, goes after LUDO with his sword flashing and there is
nothing for LUDO to do but pick up a branch and defend himself. It is
the most mismatched duel in the history of chivalrous absurdity
DIDYMUS moving at an incredible speed, parrying the mighty swipes of
LUDO's branch with great skill -- and no small amount of difficulty.
And LUDO fending off the incessant pinpricks of the little sword,
leaping about with surprising agility -- and at a rate that exhausts
him totally. Finally, the two of them, breathing heavily, lower their
weapons. And, to everyone's surprise, DIDYMUS throws down his sword.

DIDYMUS: I no longer wish to slay you, for you are a truly noble
knight.

Then DIDYMUS strides up to him and, craning his neck, attempts to
look LUDO in the eyes.

DIDYMUS: Destroy me if you will.

LUDO quickly drops his branch in response. The whole thing has upset
his gentle nature terribly. DIDYMUS then holds out a tiny paw.

DIDYMUS: Never have I met my match in battle, yet you, noble knight,
have fought me to a standstill.

LUDO kneels and tentatively takes DIDYMUS' paw into his own huge hand.

DIDYMUS: Let us be brothers henceforth, and fight for the right as
one!

SARAH cheers and HOGGLE, unimpressed, rubs his sore rear. LUDO
smiles from ear to ear.

LUDO: Ludo ... get ... brother!

Then he and DIDYMUS exchange the ritual kiss on each cheek, which in
their case is not easily accomplished. SARAH then turns practical.

SARAH: Well, now that that's settled let's get going.

She heads for the bridge but DIDYMUS blocks her way.

DIDYMUS: You forget my sacred vow, my lady. I cannot let you pass.

SARAH is incensed.

SARAH: But you said Ludo was your brother! How can you refuse him?!!

DIDYMUS: I have taken an oath. I must defend it to the death.

HOGGLE, enraged, turns on LUDO.

HOGGLE: Some brother he turned out ta be!

LUDO: Brother ... good!

HOGGLE: Well, if he's so good, why won't he let us get on with our
business?

LUDO scratches his head. He has no idea. SARAH sits down beside the
crestfallen DIDYMUS.

SARAH: OK, let's handle this thing logically. What exactly have you
sworn?

DIDYMUS brandishes his sword.

DIDYMUS: I have sworn with my life-blood, no one shall pass this way
without my permission.

SARAH: Then may we ... _have your permission_?

DIDYMUS is stunned. HOGGLE and LUDO barely breathe. Slowly DIDYMUS
looks all around and then, with a courage greater than any he has
ever had to call on before, he says it.

DIDYMUS: Yes.

And the sky doesn't fall, and the earth doesn't heave, and everything
is exactly as it should be.

SARAH: Thank you.

DIDYMUS breathes a sigh of relief and steps aside to let them pass.
LUDO is the first one to go over and that is unfortunate. Because the
rickety bridge collapses under his weight. SARAH and HOGGLE jump back
on the ground near DIDYMUS just in time and poor LUDO swings over the
deep fissure, hanging on to one of the ropes that held the bridge.
With a mighty effort he hoists himself up on to the opposite side and
looks forlornly over at the others.

SARAH: Oh no!

SARAH crumples to the ground, and stares miserably at the broken
bridge.

HOGGLE: Now see what ya done, ya mush-brained mammoth!

DIDYMUS: I, Sir Didymus, take responsibility for the actions of my
brother, my lady. Lash out at me if you must.

SARAH: I'm not mad at Ludo, Sir Didymus. I'm just upset because time
is running out and I have to rescue my baby brother.

DIDYMUS is struck to the very roots of his chivalry.

DIDYMUS: You mean to rescue _a child_?!!

SARAH: The goblin king took him, and I've only got ...

She takes out the watch. The hour hand is on the 5.

SARAH: ... five hours to get him back.

DIDYMUS yells across to LUDO.

DIDYMUS: Is this your quest, too, my brother?

LUDO: Save ... baby.

DIDYMUS is overwhelmed.

DIDYMUS: Then I shall join you, lady. I am at your service, upon my
sword.

He bows low before SARAH and she smiles.

SARAH: I happily accept your fealty, Sir Didymus.

HOGGLE frowns with displeasure at this latest development.

HOGGLE: This is all well an' good, Missy. But we still got one little
problem.

They all look across the fissure at LUDO.

LUDO: Ludo ... friends.

HOGGLE: Yes, yes. We're friends. Very nice. What's that got ta do
with us gettin' over there without a bridge?

LUDO: Rocks ... friends.

HOGGLE: We're wastin' our time, Missy. Let's you an' me go find
another ...

He is interrupted by LUDO bellowing, which is followed by a
sympathetic rumbling. Suddenly rocks pile in from both directions
until there is a pile in the fissure high enough for them to walk
across.

LUDO: Rocks ... friends!

SARAH (laughing): They sure are, Ludo!

She skips happily across followed by a sullen HOGGLE. DIDYMUS
whistles and is quickly joined by a tail-wagging SHEEPDOG. SARAH
gasps, he is the spitting image of her own MERLIN.

SARAH: It's ...

DIDYMUS: Ambrosius! My noble steed.

SARAH laughs and shrugs. Nothing surprises her in the labyrinth.

52	EXT: FOREST - NIGHT

The edge of the forest. From here you can see the castle in the
distance, just across the dry, cracked plain. The sky is full of
stars. SARAH, HOGGLE, LUDO and DIDYMUS are sitting around a fire.

DIDYMUS: What will you do after we save the child, my lady?

SARAH: Take him home, of course! That is, if I can figure out how.

DIDYMUS: What is your kingdom like? Do you have many knights to
defend your honor?

SARAH: Not even one.

DIDYMUS: It cannot be! What bitter place is this that does such
dishonor to my lady?

SARAH: It's a place where ... where nobody really sees me.

LUDO: Ludo ... see ... Sarah!

SARAH: (laughs) I know you do, Ludo. (she turns to Didymus) And
thanks to you, Sir Didymus, I finally have a knight.

He bows graciously. HOGGLE, who has been watching this scene, feels
rejected and miserable. He gets up and wanders away from the fire.
After a moment, SARAH follows him.

SARAH: Don't you feel like resting?

HOGGLE: I ain't tired.

SARAH: Me neither. What I am is hungry.

HOGGLE winces but SARAH doesn't notice. SARAH looks back at LUDO and
DIDYMUS. LUDO lies on his back snoring loudly. DIDYMUS dozes against
AMBROSIUS' side.

SARAH: They're both wonderful, aren't they?

HOGGLE: They're alright.

SARAH: They're more than that! They're loyal and strong ... and with
their help I'm going to beat Jareth!

HOGGLE shakes his head sadly. SARAH speaks as an afterthought.

SARAH: And yours, too, of course.

HOGGLE: I ain't no fighter ...

She shrugs that off and wanders away to look out at the castle.
HOGGLE goes through agony for a moment, and then makes a decision.

HOGGLE: Missy ... if you're hungry ...

He holds out the peach that JARETH gave him: the world's most
delicious looking peach.

SARAH: Oh, great!

She happily taken the peach and bites. It takes everything HOGGLE has
to not put his hands over his ears. She takes another bite and then
stumbles.

SARAH (laughing): Everything's dancing ...

She looks up at the sky, exhilarated.

SARAH: Even the stars are dancing!

HOGGLE turns and walks back to the fire. SARAH stumbles about as she
gazes happily at the sky.

53	INT: CASTLE - NIGHT

FREDDIE is leading the GOBLINS on a merry chase. He crawls around the
room, pulling things off shelves. A GOBLIN is on his hands and knees
in front of JARETH polishing his boots. JARETH kicks the GOBLIN and
sends him flying across the room. This makes FREDDIE laugh and he
pulls a book off the shelf and throws it. It hits a GOBLIN on the
head. JARETH scoops up FREDDIE and puts him in his cradle. He sits
down next to him.

JARETH: Little goblin-to-be, I have something to amuse you.

He waves his hands in front of FREDDIE and suddenly beautiful
crystalline balls appear in them. He runs them over his fingers like
so many coins, their molten light so dazzling that FREDDIE kicks up
his legs with excitement. And WE CAN SEE that at the end of his
pajamas are two wizened goblin feet! JARETH laughs and flings the
balls into the air and they turn into bubbles, beautiful, mesmerizing
bubbles.

JARETH: Soon, little one. Very, very soon ...

And they both watch the bubbles as they fly out the window and over
the labyrinth, coldly beautiful against the darkening sky.

54	EXT: FOREST - NIGHT

SARAH's hand opens slowly and the half-eaten peach falls to the
ground. She stares out into the sky, mesmerized. The bubbles are
approaching; dazzling, dancing bubbles. And then she hears music,
haunting, spell-casting music. The bubbles come closer and WE CAN SEE
that each one contains a TWIRLING DANCER, a DANCER just like the one
in SARAH's music box. She gets up and follows them.

ANOTHER ANGLE

HOGGLE watching from the woods.

HOGGLE: Damn you, Jareth! (He turns and begins to walk away) And damn
me too!

ANOTHER ANGLE

A bubble, with SARAH inside it, floating through the sky. She appears
enchanted, and she begins to twirl, just like the OTHER DANCERS.

55	EXT: BALLROOM - NIGHT

A giant bubble, with a magnificent ballroom inside it. Tiny bubbles
rush to join it. In one of them is SARAH.

56	INT: BALLROOM - NIGHT

The music changes and now SARAH is inside the ballroom. It is a
magnificent spectacle with all the beauty and decadence of an 18th
Century Venetian ball. Magnificently dressed DANCERS swirl to the
music in an incredibly opulent setting. But when you look closer you
sense decay just beneath the surface; things are threadbare, faded.
The GUESTS wear masks that are elegant parodies of goblin faces,
giving them all a slightly sinister look. And there is something very
provocative about all of them; the WOMEN have bare shoulders and
daring decolletage, many of the MEN have their shirts open to the
waist. Some of them lounge against the wall indolently and there is
the feeling that the party has been going on all night. In this
setting SARAH is the picture of innocence. TWO WOMEN snickering
behind their fans as SARAH approaches, and she is suddenly terribly
self-conscious. How plain She feels amidst all this! She looks into
one of the many mirrors that line the ballroom and sighs at her
image. Then suddenly she sees something in the mirror that makes her
gasp.

ANOTHER ANGLE

The mirror, and in it the reflection of a resplendent JARETH dancing
with a particularly exotic-looking WOMAN. SARAH whirls around, trying
to get another glimpse of JARETH. She is so intent on trying to see
him that she doesn't notice that she is being stared at brazenly by a
YOUNG MAN leaning against the wall. He moves next to her and whispers
something into her ear. She hurries away, shocked; and the YOUNG MAN
throws back his head and laughs. And JARETH sees the whole thing.

ANOTHER ANGLE

SARAH is approached by a MIDDLE-AGED MAN who has a box hanging at
waist height from a ribbon around his neck. It looks like SARAH's
music box. She looks down at it with interest and he throws open the
cover. But there is no dancer inside, instead there is a stick carved
like a snake. It shoots out at SARAH and she cries out and backs
away. ALL THE PEOPLE around her laugh and she moves hurriedly on.
JARETH, who is dancing with an even more beautiful WOMAN than before,
watches SARAH.

ANOTHER ANGLE

SARAH is looking for JARETH. She spots him and sees him whisper
something to his partner who smiles knowingly from beneath her mask
and licks her lips. SARAH blushes and turns away and finds herself
looking into another mirror. But in the reflection, JARETH isn't with
a partner. He is standing alone, the DANCERS a whirling blur around
him, and he is looking straight at her. SARAH, whirling around to
face the crowd and she sees JARETH with yet a third BEAUTY. And then
she realizes that it is herself! In a trance-like state she moves
through the CROWD to get a better look.

ANOTHER ANGLE

SARAH'S POV - She is whirling in JARETH's arms, and she is the most
beautiful woman at the ball. JARETH smiles down at her and the
attraction between them is palpable.

JARETH: You look like a queen.

SARAH looks up at him, thrilled by his words.

SARAH: I ... I feel like ... I ... don't know what I feel ...

JARETH (smiling): Don't you?

And he whirls her around dizzyingly, so dizzyingly that she swoons in
his arms. He catches her before she can fall very far, tightening his
grip around her waist.

SARAH: Are we ... are we in a bubble?

JARETH: Yes, we are. A dream bubble ... where your dreams can come
true.

ANOTHER ANGLE

OUR SARAH is being jostled by the crowd. She stumbles and almost
falls on top of a COUPLE on a bench. The WOMAN is sprawled across the
lap of the MAN who wears a mask with a very phallic nose. SARAH backs
away from them, frightened.

ANOTHER ANGLE

JARETH and SARAH, dancing. She is smiling up at him, he has never
looked more handsome. There is something more open about him, as if
he, too, is caught up in the moment. He nuzzles her hair with his
lips and whispers in her ear.

JARETH (whispering): My Queen!

Then he begins a song. A song that tells SARAH he will give her
everything she wants, even things she doesn't know she wants. A song
that says forget it all; all the restrictions, all the powerlessness.
Forget and stay in the dream.

ANOTHER ANGLE

OUR SARAH watches, mesmerized. But every time she tries to get closer
to JARETH and SARAH she in jostled by a lascivious ADMIRER, pushed
out of the way by WOMEN laughingly being chased by MEN. She stumbles
against a wall and a door opens. Inside, pillow feathers are flying
and she can't make out what the SEVERAL PEOPLE are doing. A WOMAN
comes up to the doorway, winks at SARAH, and closes the door.

ANOTHER ANGLE

JARETH finishes the song and SARAH looks up at him, smiling. He moves
his face closer to hers and she closes her eyes. His face comes
closer, and closer.

ANOTHER ANGLE

OUR SARAH shrinks back from what she is seeing. She turns and runs,
pushing herself though the languid CROWD, right into the bubble
itself.

57	EXT: BALL - NIGHT

SARAH comes crashing through the bubble and the whole ballroom
crumbles. In seconds it resembles nothing so much as a junkyard.

58	EXT JUNK CITY - NIGHT

SARAH runs through the streets of a part-market, part-junkyard. There
are piles of rubble and junk everywhere, and between them are tents
from which PEOPLE hawk objects of all kinds. Some of them approach
SARAH and she pushes them away, sobbing.

ANOTHER ANGLE

SARAH'S POV - A RED TENT, and standing in front of it is an OLD WOMAN
stooped over from the objects piled high on her back. She beckons to
SARAH and pulls the tent flap aside.

JUNK WOMAN: 'Ere it is, Dearie. All the fings you want, all the fings
you need.

ANOTHER ANGLE

The flap opens wider and inside the tent WE CAN SEE SARAH's room!

ANOTHER ANGLE

SARAH gasps at the sight and runs headlong into the tent. She trips
over the threshold and lands face down on her bed.

59	INT: SARAH'S ROOM - NIGHT

SARAH sits up on the bed and looks around the room. She shakes her
head and laughs.

SARAH: What a dream!

She gets up and stretches, then walks over to the mirror. She smiles
at her reflection.

SARAH: Yep, you've got quite an imagination, kid, Just what a great
actress needs.

She walks over to the bed and picks up Lancelot the bear.

SARAH: How about a midnight snack, Sir Lance ...

She goes over to the door and opens it.

60	EXT: JUNK CITY - NIGHT

SARAH'S POV - THE MARKET/JUNKYARD TEEMING WITH ACTIVITY.
The JUNK WOMAN peers in.

JUNK WOMAN: 'Aven't you got everythin' you need, Dearie?

61	INT: SARAH'S ROOM - NIGHT

SARAH screams and slams the door. She buries her face in the bear.

SARAH: It _is_ just a dream!

She takes a deep breath and goes to the door again. She opens it very
slowly.

62	EXT: JUNK CITY - NIGHT

SARAH'S POV - THE SAME TEEMING ACTIVITY. The JUNK WOMAN peers in
again.

JUNK WOMAN: Best to stay in there, where it's safe, Dearie. Don't
know what might 'appen to you out 'ere.

63	INT: SARAH'S ROOM - NIGHT

SARAH clams the door again and rushes over to the window. A GROUP OF
REVELLERS peer in at her and laugh. She quickly pulls the curtains
closed and walks back to the center of the room. She stands clutching
the bear, then looks up at her reflection in the mirror.

ANOTHER ANGLE

SARAH'S reflection. Herself as a very old woman, clutching a teddy
bear.

OLD SARAH: Best to stay in here where it's safe. Don't know what
might happen to you out there.

SARAH steps back from the mirror and suddenly the floor becomes a sea
of mud and all the objects in the room come falling down on her. As
she tries to rise out of the muck more objects land on and around her
and pull her down.

SARAH: Help! Somebody help me!

64	EXT: JUNK CITY - NIGHT

LUDO and DIDYMUS desperately searching for SARAH, DIDYMUS riding his
DOG.

65	INT: TAVERN TENT - NIGHT

HOGGLE sits at a bar, drowning his sorrows. A JUNK MAN/BARTENDER
works behind the bar. HOGGLE slams his cup down.

HOGGLE: Another!

The BARTENDER holds out his hand greedily. HOGGLE pulls a treasure
off his belt and slams it on the bar. The BARTENDER pours.

66	EXT: JUNK CITY - NIGHT

DIDYMUS and LUDO approach the red tent. They spy the JUNK WOMAN.

DIDYMUS: Did you see a noble maiden pass this way?

JUNK WOMAN: A noble maiden, eh? What would she be doin' in a place
like this?

DIDYMUS: She's on a rescue mission ...

The JUNK WOMAN finds this hilarious.

JUNK WOMAN: A rescue mission, ha! You're in the wrong place, for
sure! The only fings we cares about rescuin' around 'ere is our
worldly goods!

She takes an oil lamp off her back and shines it on her sleeve for
emphasis.

67	INT: SARAH'S ROOM - NIGHT

SARAH is drowning in a sea of junk. She hears DIDYMUS and cries out
hopefully.

SARAH: Didymus, in here! Help me!

The door opens and the JUNK WOMAN peers inside.

JUNK WOMAN: Don't worry, Dearie. I sent 'im away!

SARAH groans.

JUNK WOMAN: Knew you wouldn't want to be leavin' your nice fings for
no rescue mission.

SARAH: Oh my god! Freddie!

JUNK WOMAN: Freddie? Is that one of them dolls over there ... or that
nice teddy?

SARAH struggles for the door in the sea of junk.

SARAH: No! He's my brother! And I've got to save him!

She continues pushing through the junk.

JUNK WOMAN: No you don't, Dearie. You can stay right 'ere with all
your pretty fings ...

SARAH knows what her choice has to be.

SARAH: I know I can. (joyous) But I don't want to!

She lifts herself out of the junk with a mighty heave and stands in
the doorway. She looks down at the JUNK WOMAN triumphantly.

SARAH: Now get out of my way!

68	EXT: JUNK CITY - NIGHT

SARAH runs out of the tent, a look of triumph on her face.

The JUNK WOMAN pulls something off her own pile and holds it out to
SARAH.

JUNK WOMAN: Wait, Dearie! Look at this!

She holds out SARAH's music box, opens it, and the little DANCER
twirls inside.

SARAH (grinning): Keep it!

And she is off. As SARAH goes the CAMERA LINGERS on the JUNK WOMAN.
And we begin to move around to her other side and even though we had
just seen her from all sides, we now see something very, very
different. Where the other side of the woman should be WE SEE a
cross-section of her, with JARETH inside. His head is beneath the
pile of junk and his hand is inside her head making it laugh. He is
the puppeteer operating the JUNK LADY, as indeed, she has been
operated. JARETH is mad.

JARETH: Damn.

69	EXT: CASTLE GATE - NIGHT

LUDO and DIDYMUS sit forlornly at the gate. SARAH appears out of the
night.

DIDYMUS: My lady!

LUDO leaps to his feet.

LUDO: Sarah ... safe!

SARAH rushes into his arms.

DIDYMUS: Is Hoggle not with you?

SARAH pulls away from LUDO.

SARAH: Hoggle made his choice, he's ... not part of the mission
anymore.

DIDYMUS (angry): The coward!

LUDO: Hoggle ... good!

SARAH shrugs, and smiles at him.

SARAH: Maybe. But there's no time to discuss it. We've got a baby to
rescue, remember!

She leads them through the gates.

70	EXT: GOBLIN TOWN - NIGHT

Streets full of hovels encircle the castle. This is where the GOBLINS
live. As SARAH, LUDO and HOGGLE walk through the dark, eerie streets
they are met by the slamming of shutters and the extinguishing of
lights.

DIDYMUS: Methinks they are expecting us, my lady.

A CHILD GOBLIN peers at them from an open doorway. A FEMALE GOBLIN
sees him and drags him inside and slams the door.

SARAH (grimly): Methinks you're right!

71	INT: TAVERN - NIGHT

HOGGLE is still at it. He pulls his belt off his body and WE SEE that
the only treasure left is SARAH's plastic circlet. He slowly pulls it
off and stares at it. The BARTENDER approaches, his eyes lighting up
at the eight of this treasure.

BARTENDER: Another?

HOGGLE hesitates, then hands the circlet over. The BARTENDER bites it
and his face lights up with glee.

BARTENDER: Plastic!

He goes to get the drink and HOGGLE puts his face down on the bar and
sobs.

ANOTHER ANGLE

At the other end of the bar sits the WISE ONE. The HAT looks over at
HOGGLE and shakes his head knowingly.

HAT: Drinkin' to forget, eh, buddy?

HOGGLE looks up.

WISE ONE: To forget, ah yes. To suffer a mental lapse, to obliterate
from one's consciousness, to suffer amnesia, a blank or fugue, to
drink the waters of Lethe ...

HOGGLE (drunkenly): What's Lethe ...

WISE ONE: The waters of forgetfulness. They remove from our minds
what is too painful to remember ...

HOGGLE looks thoughtfully at the drink in his hand.

WISE ONE: ... but with the memory goes our wisdom, or knowledge, that
which brings us understanding, also enlightenment ...

But there is no one to continue benefitting from the WISE ONE's
pearls. HOGGLE is gone.

HAT: You can cool it down there ... he's gone ...

WISE ONE: ... a grasp of things, a depth or profundity of thought ...

The HAT sighs and looks over at the BARTENDER who is still admiring
his plastic treasure.

HAT: Another one over here ... and make it a double ...

72	EXT: GOBLIN TOWN - NIGHT

SARAH, LUDO and DIDYMUS emerge into the vast courtyard outside the
castle. It in eerily quiet. Too quiet.

SARAH: We're going to make it!

DIDYMUS sniffs the air.

DIDYMUS: I am less than sure ...

They are interrupted by a high-pitched shriek as a GOBLIN jumps on
LUDO's back. Then the courtyard is filled with GOBLINS, what seems
like the whole army, coming right at them. DIDYMUS fends off the
VANGUARD PARTY with his sword and LUDO punches out the ones that get
by him. DIDYMUS unswords a GOBLIN and his weapon goes flying. SARAH
picks it up and does some parrying of her own. But there are too many
of them. The threesome turn and run.

73	INT: CASTLE - NIGHT

JARETH stands by the window, watching the battle. The WHITE BIRD sits
on his shoulder. JARETH looks over at FREDDIE who stands holding on
to the side of the cradle. JARETH smiles and turns back to the melee
below. The BIRD flies out the window.

74	EXT: GOBLIN TOWN - NIGHT

SARAH, LUDO and DIDYMUS race down the streets. The GOBLINS are in hot
pursuit.

75	EXT: STREET - NIGHT

They come careening around a corner and it seems that they have
escaped their pursuers. The sound of the GOBLINS seems to be getting
farther away.

SARAH: I think we lost them.

They turn and see that, unfortunately they have come full circle and
are right back in the courtyard. LUDO climbs part way up a wall and
looks over the streets.

DIDYMUS: What do you see, my brother?

LUDO gulps. What he sees is the GOBLIN ARMY coming down every street
right towards them.

LUDO: Ludo ... see ... trouble!

And then the trouble arrives and SARAH and DIDYMUS are heavily into
swordplay. LUDO tries clumsily to get down and is tormented by
GOBLINS who prick at him with their spears. SARAH looks up and sees
his predicament. She gets an idea.

SARAH: Call the rocks, Ludo! Call the rocks!

LUDO makes a heroic effort and gets to the top of the wall.

He then throws his head back and bellows.

76	EXT: GOBLIN TOWN - NIGHT

An enormous rumbling is heard and soon the streets are filled with
boulders, all careening towards LUDO. They knock GOBLINS out of their
path like so many bowling pins.

77	EXT: COURTYARD - NIGHT

SARAH and DIDYMUS fight bravely. LUDO keeps bellowing and throwing
off the occasional GOBLIN that is stupid enough to jump on him. Soon
the rocks reach the courtyard and form a barrier between the
THREESOME and their ATTACKERS. LUDO reaches down and lifts SARAH and
DIDYMUS on to the wall. They jump and disappear into the castle
enclave.

78	INT: CASTLE - NIGHT

A door opens in a dark part of the castle. LUDO, SARAH and DIDYMUS
enter. They look around and quickly tip-toe down a dark corridor.
They turn a corner and see some GOBLINS marching their way. They duck
out of sight.

79	EXT: CASTLE - NIGHT

The main entrance to the castle. TWO-GOBLIN GUARDS stand outside the
large wooden doors. The results of the THREESOME's escape can be
heard in the distance. A FIGURE staggers out of the dark, singing
drunkenly. It is HOGGLE.

HOGGLE: " ... it's so cold in the night with no gold to keep me warm
... "

He trips over his feet as he approaches the GUARD.

GUARD: Who goes there?

HOGGLE " ... so cold, oh so cold ... "

GUARD 2: Don't worry about him. He's on Jareth's payroll now.

HOGGLE falls to the ground, then picks himself up.

HOGGLE: Thash right. Jareth owes me sumthin' ... an' I'm here ta
collect ...

They laugh at him, then step aside and let him enter.

80	INT: CASTLE - NIGHT

A GROUP OF GOBLINS stand in a circle in a corridor. They torment a
tiny, fuzzy yapping CREATURE with their nipper sticks. The CREATURE
gets away from them and goes scurrying down the corridor. The GOBLINS
laugh. It turns a corner and starts yapping for all it's worth.

ANOTHER ANGLE

SARAH, LUDO and DIDYMUS pressed against the wall, trying to not be
noticed. Unfortunately the little CREATURE has no sympathy for their
plight. It stands at their feet, making a ruckus.

SARAH (whispering): Shut up, you little monster!

LUDO bends down to pet it in the hopes of quieting it.

LUDO: Nice ... thing ...

But the CREATURE doesn't want a pet. It sinks its teeth into LUDO's
hand. LUDO howls.

DIDYMUS: I fear that this means trouble.

The GOBLINS yell and start running down the corridor.

SARAH: Run for it!

They are off, the CREATURE and the GOBLINS at their heels.

81	INT: CORRIDOR - NIGHT

The THREE are running for all they're worth. SARAH pulls the watch
out of her pocket. It is on the 12:30.

SARAH: Only a half hour left! We've got to find Freddie!

ANOTHER ANGLE

Yet another GROUP OF GOBLINS running right toward them. They stop in
their tracks and start running in the opposite direction.

82	INT: INNER COURTYARD - NIGHT

The THREE come careening into the long narrow inner courtyard.
Balconies look down on it from the floor above. Opposite them is a
large ornate door. They have a lead on the GOBLINS chasing them, but
not for long.

ANOTHER ANGLE

On one of the balconies a particularly repulsive little GOBLIN laughs
sadistically. The THREE look up and see the GOBLIN with his hands on
a huge lever. He pushes it down gleefully and the floor opens up in
front of the THREESOME. It appears to be a bottomless pit, too wide
to leap across. Horrified they look behind them and see the GOBLINS
gaining on them. And they're throwing spears! Suddenly there is a
triumphant yell from the balcony opposite the repulsive GOBLIN, and
then a FIGURE leaps off it swinging on a rope.

SARAH: Hoggle!

It certainly is! He wrestles with the hideous GOBLIN and in the
struggle it falls screaming into the pit. HOGGLE then grabs the lever
and it is not a second too soon. The pursuing GOBLINS are entering
the courtyard.

ANOTHER ANGLE

The floor closes and the THREE run to the door. An enraged PURSUER
aims a spear at HOGGLE. He is hit. SARAH screams as LUDO struggles
with the door. It won't budge and he begins to smash his body against
it.

ANOTHER ANGLE

A seemingly half-dead HOGGLE staggers to his feet and throws his body
on the lever. He appears to faint from the strain but the weight of
his body pushes the lever and the floor opens again.

ANOTHER ANGLE

The enraged GOBLINS are stopped in their tracks by the yawning pit.
They hurl spears at the THREESOME but it is to no avail. LUDO smashes
down the door and they run in.

83	INT: JARETH'S QUARTERS - NIGHT

SARAH, DIDYMUS, and LUDO carrying HOGGLE enter the room where we have
seen JARETH and FREDDIE. They lock the door behind them. No one is
there and FREDDIE's cradle is rocking, as if someone had removed him
only moments before. LUDO places HOGGLE down and SARAH looks
feverishly around the room. She spots a door.

SARAH: That's the only way he could have gone!

She runs to the door and LUDO and DIDYMUS follow.

SARAH: No. I have to face him alone!

DIDYMUS: But, my lady ...

He is interrupted by the sound of GOBLINS in pursuit. They start
trying to smash down the door. LUDO runs to it and presses his body
against it. HOGGLE moans and DIDYMUS and SARAH run to his side.

HOGGLE: I don't expect ya to fergive me, Missy, but ...

She puts her finger to his lips.

SARAH: Forgive you for what? Saving our lives?

HOGGLE: But, I betrayed ya, I gave ya that damned peach ...

SARAH: Ssh! You did the only thing you could do ...

She looks down at his empty belt.

SARAH: ... and I see you lost all your treasures in the process.

HOGGLE: I don't care if I never sees another treasure again!

SARAH (smiles): Here. Just in case you change your mind.

She slips off her mother's ring and presses it into HOGGLE's hand. He
is overwhelmed and SARAH smiles at his pleasure.

HOGGLE: And Jareth said ya could never love me.

SARAH: Jareth doesn't know everything.

She leaps to her feet and HOGGLE moans.

SARAH: Take care of him, Didymus.

DIDYMUS: I'll guard the valiant Hoggle with my life!

The GOBLINS give the door a particularly loud smash and LUDO presses
against the door even harder.

LUDO: Ludo ... too!

She runs to the other door and stops to look back at them.

SARAH: No maiden could have wished for nobler knights.

And she is gone.

84	ESCHER ROTUNDA - NIGHT

SARAH enters an overwhelming room with many staircases, balconies and
doorways at different heights and at all kinds of strange angles that
obviously have no relation to what we know as gravity. Her knees
buckling from vertigo. Then she gasps.

ANOTHER ANGLE

JARETH is sitting on the wall with all the ease of a fly.

JARETH: I've been expecting you.

SARAH stumbles and falls into the room, ending up on the ceiling. She
tries to adjust to being upside down.

SARAH: Where's Freddie?!!!

She has to look down and sideways to see JARETH and it is clearly
grueling.

JARETH: He's right there.

And he points to one of the stairways that juts out at a right angle
from the wall. FREDDIE is climbing up the stairs happily, but from
SARAH's point of view it looks like he will fall when he gets to the
top.

SARAH (screaming): Freddie! No!!!

FREDDIE gets to the top but doesn't fall, instead he ends up crawling
up the wall. SARAH sighs with relief and closes her eyes. This sends
her reeling and she ends up in one of the archways. She tries to
orient herself but there is no up, no down, no sideways. And the BABY
is about to crawl off a balcony! SARAH screams and JARETH laughs. He
begins a song that tells SARAH she never really understood what was
gain on. Nothing is what it appears to be, not even things like "up"
and "down."

ANOTHER ANGLE

FREDDIE in the most precarious-looking situation yet, at the top of a
staircase. He hesitates to crawl down, and to lure him, JARETH
creates a ball out of thin air and throws it to the BABY. Of course,
it bounces up. And all the while his song is taunting SARAH. She
turns away from him and looks into the large mirror framed in the
archway. She sees endless SARAHS. And while she's looking, the first
reflection runs to the left, the reflection behind that to the right,
and so on all the way down the line. And SARAH's still standing
there! She falls backwards and ends up standing on the floor,
watching FREDDIE chase his ball across the ceiling. JARETH dances on
the wall now as he is about to finish his song. And there is FREDDIE
on one of the balconies facing out of the rotunda. If he falls off
that, he'll really fall! SARAH runs up the opposite wall and finds
that there is sheer space between her and the BABY. The only way to
reach him is to jump. She looks at JARETH who grins at her, then at
FREDDIE who is teetering on the edge. As JARETH comes to the end of
the song there is nothing to do but jump. She looks at JARETH and
can't repress a grin of her own.

SARAH: Like the man said, "nothing is what it appears to be!"

She jumps.

85	INT: JARETH'S CHAMBERS - NIGHT

SARAH falls right on to a magnificent huge bed. Opposite her JARETH
sits in a chair. FREDDIE, wrapped in a blanket, is gurgling on his
lap. SARAH reaches into her pocket and pulls out the watch. It is a
few minutes before 13. JARETH stands up.

JARETH: There's still time.

He gestures to a clock on the wall that shows the same time as her
watch. He places FREDDIE into a cradle and comes over to the bed. He
looks down at her.

JARETH: Besides, I'm no longer interested in having a little goblin
prince. I've decided I'd much rather have a queen.

He looks into her eyes for a moment. SARAH doesn't look away.
Instead, she slowly eases herself off the bed and stands facing him.

SARAH (archly): A queen? Have you chosen anyone I know.

She glides by him and walks to the window. JARETH chuckles
appreciatively.

JARETH: You've come a long way, little girl.

SARAH looks out at the labyrinth.

SARAH: I certainly have.

She turns to face him.

JARETH: Yes, I can see it in your eyes. (he moves closer to her) No
one else has ever made it this far in the labyrinth, no one else has
ever been worthy ...

He takes her hand and brings it to his lips. She smiles
down at him.

SARAH: What's your offer.

JARETH stands quickly and looks at her. She certainly has come a long
way!

JARETH: Why, everything ... you'll rule by my side.

SARAH: Everything? The chance to spend my life surrounded by
repulsive goblins ... the chance to torment innocent creatures ...

JARETH (shaking his head): ... the chance to never have a care in the
world, to never have to do anything that you don't want to do.

SARAH looks at him.

SARAH: Anything else?

JARETH (smiling): Why, me. Of course.

SARAH surreptitiously eyes the clock. There is about a minute left.
She glides away from the window and tries to position herself closer
to FREDDIE.

SARAH: And what if I'm not interested?

JARETH reacts with surprise for a moment, then shakes his head.

JARETH: Impossible. I know you, I know what you want ...

SARAH: Well, I've got news for you, Jareth.

She makes a beeline for the cradle.

SARAH: I don't want _you_!

She's almost at the cradle but JARETH grabs her arm and stops her.

SARAH (shocked, enraged): Why, you miserable creep!

JARETH has hold of her arms but she breaks away and hauls off and
punches him in the jaw. JARETH steps back, stunned. SARAH scoops up
the screaming FREDDIE.

SARAH: How could you do this to an innocent baby?!!

JARETH stands rubbing his jaw, snivelling, stunned.

JARETH: You hit me!

SARAH, FREDDIE in her arms, goes right up to him.

SARAH: And I'd like to do more ... you, you ... !

She is furious and wants to hit him again badly. Since she has the
BABY in her arms she makes do with kicking him hard in the shin.
JARETH howls and grabs his leg.

SARAH: I wouldn't want you if you were the last ... _goblin_ on earth!

The WHITE BIRD flies through the window and lands on SARAH's
shoulder. JARETH puts his hands on his ears.

JARETH: Don't say that!

But it is too late, he starts shrinking.

JARETH: Look at me! (whining) How could you do this to me!

Before SARAH's eyes JARETH turns into an undersized, ineffective,
snivelling little GOBLIN. The features are those of a goblin, but
still recognizably JARETH.

86	INT: CASTLE - NIGHT

JARETH's quarters, where DIDYMUS tends HOGGLE and LUDO still blocks
the door.

JARETH (VO) (whiney scream): Why does everything have to happen to me!

They look at each other and suddenly LUDO realizes that the GOBLINS
are no longer trying to break down the door. The THREE start to laugh.

HOGGLE (proudly): She did it!

They cheer.

87	INT: JARETH'S CHAMBERS - NIGHT

JARETH, the bratty little GOBLIN, is throwing a tantrum.

JARETH: Nobody ever cares about what I want!

The walls and floor shake so from his pounding fists and feet that a
crack opens up right in front of SARAH's feet. She looks at the clock
and the minute hand moves to the 13. She looks at FREDDIE. There's
nothing to do but jump into the void. The clock begins to strike.

SARAH: OK, Freddie. Time to go bye-bye!

She jumps.

88	EXT: SKY - NIGHT

SARAH and FREDDIE spinning through the dark, starry sky. The striking
of the clock continues.

ANOTHER ANGLE

CLOSE ON SARAH AND FREDDIE. SARAH pulls him closer, lovingly. And
they go on spinning.

89	INT: NURSERY - NIGHT

SARAH is lying face down on the floor. She comes to slowly and tries
to sit up. Groaning, she rubs her head where it bumped on the corner
of the open drawer. She tries to focus, blinking her eyes.

ANOTHER ANGLE

SARAH'S POV - Her eyes slowly focus on FREDDIE's crib. When she can
see, she gasps. FREDDIE's not there! The side of the crib is down and
the BABY is nowhere to be seen.

SARAH: Freddie!

She leaps to her feet woozily. Still rubbing her head she staggers
out into the hallway.

90	INT: RAILWAY - NIGHT

SARAH looks down the hallway and suddenly her face breaks out into a
delighted grin.

ANOTHER ANGLE

SARAH'S POV - LITTLE FREDDIE is crawling slowly, but determinedly,
into SARAH's room. When he gets to her bed he uses all his strength
to pull himself up on to his feet by holding on to the bedspread. Be
then holds his hand out, trying to reach something.

ANOTHER ANGLE

SARAH makes her way toward her room, delight and wonder on her face.

91	INT: SARAH'S ROOM - NIGHT

SARAH stands in the doorway looking down at FREDDIE.

SARAH (softly): That's quite a journey you took, Freddie.

FREDDIE looks up at her and makes a sound. He continues straining,
and WE SEE that what he is reaching for is Lancelot, SARAH's bear.
SARAH smiles, and lifts FREDDIE up. She sits on the bed, FREDDIE on
her lap, and hands him the bear.

SARAH: Here. It's yours.

FREDDIE takes it happily.

SARAH (smiling): You earned it.

She kisses his head and rocks him gently. Then she gazes out the
window at the stars.

92	EXT: HOUSE - NIGHT

The light shines from SARAH's window. The WHITE BIRD flutters down
from the starry sky. It perches in the tree beside the path.

THE LAST OF THE MOHICANS


                                Written by

                     Michael Mann & Christopher Crowe






	FADE IN

	The screen is a microcosm of leaf, crystal drops of precipitation, a stone, 
	emerald green moss. It's a landscape in miniature. We HEAR the forest. Some 
	distant birds. Their sound seems to reverberate as if in a cavern. A piece of 
	sunlight refracts within the drops of water, paints a patch of moss yellow. The 
	whisper of wind is joined by another sound that mixes with it. A distant 
	rustling. It gets closer and louder. It's shallow breathing. It gets ominous. 
	We're interlopers on the floor of the forest and something is coming. 

	SUDDENLY: A MOCCASINED FOOT
	
	rockets through the frame scaring us and ... 

	EXTREMELY CLOSE: PART OF AN INDIAN FACE
	running hard. His head shaved bald except for a scalp-lock. Tattoos. He's 
	twenty-five. He seems tall and muscled. Heavy, even breathing. We'll learn later 
	this man is UNCAS, the last of the Mohicans. 

	PROFILE: UNCAS' ARMS

	flash as he runs. One carries a flintlock musket. Sweat on the man's skin. A 
	calico shirt is gathered at the waist with a wampum belt of small white beads 
	over a breechcloth. He wears leggings to protect his legs. A long-handled 
	tomahawk is stuffed in his belt. 

	CUT TO ... 

	ANOTHER PART OF THE FOREST - MASSIVE WAR CLUB - DAY

	in the hand of another running man. He's heavier, older ... 
	
	CHEST

	A green bear claw is tattooed there. Silver armband. A snake is tattooed over 
	his left eyebrow. Silver rings in his ear. He's forty to forty-five. His head is 
	shaved into a scalp-lock. It says: "Come and lift this from me. Take it, if you 
	can ..." That prospect strikes us as extremely unlikely. This man is 

	CHINGACHGOOK.

	The French call him "Le Gros Serpent," the Great Snake, because 
	"he knows the winding ways of men's nature and he can strike a sudden, deathly 
	blow." 

	WIDE ANGLE: CHINGACHGOOK

	runs, disturbing no leaves, no branches; making no sound. He's running parallel 
	to Uncas through the cathedral of mature forest. It's heavily canopied. There's 
	very little brush. The girth of the trees is huge. Shafts of light illuminate 
	motes of dust and turn leaves emerald where the sun breaks through. Sometimes 
	there's ferns; rhododendron, sometimes pale grass and outcroppings of rock. 
	These men run the forest streams, over boulders, fallen trees and down into 
	ravines as if they own them. They do. 

	CUT TO ... 

	ANOTHER PART OF THE FOREST - LONG BLACK HAIR - DAY

	rocketing through trees. His torn buckskin shirt is tied at the waist with a 
	wampum belt holding a tomahawk and a large knife. A long rifle in which is 
	carved the name "Killdeer" is in his right fist. Indian tattooing on his chest. 
	His name is NATHANIEL POE. He's a few years older than Uncas. The French and 	the French-speaking tribes know him as La Longue Carabine (Long Rifle). Other 
	frontiersmen in New York colony and the Iroquois and Delaware-speaking tribes 
	know him as Hawkeye. Sweat stains his shirt. He flashes through the tree 
	branches disturbing nothing. Making no sound. 

	HAWKEYE'S POV: A PIECE OF TAN

	two hundred and fifty yards away, a few square inches buried in the foliage ... 

	SUDDENLY HE STOPS

	Killdeer's at his shoulder ... 

	HAWKEYE'S THUMB

	cocks the lock holding the piece of flint: click. 

	UNCAS

	stops dead, holding out his hand ... no sound. 

	CHINGACHGOOK

	slips through young trees and stops, shouldering his smoothbore musket. Is this 
	an ambush? 

	HAWKEYE'S POV: RACK FOCUS THROUGH THE GUN SIGHT

	Five feet and fourteen pounds of rifle is elevated a half inch and shifted left, 
	off target. It's a precise, smooth movement. No human quiver. 

	KILLDEER'S TRIGGER

	tighter ... 

	THE COCK

	holding the flint hits the iron file of the frizzen, shooting sparks into the 
	pan of priming powder which flashes and ... 

	TAN
	is a huge elk that leaps at the sound. 

	KILLDEER'S MUZZLE

	CRACKS like lightning. 

	AN ELK

	leaps where the .59 caliber round was programmed to intercept him. On the moment 
	of impact ... 

	WIDE

	three men approach the fallen elk and each other. We realize they're hunting 
	together. Hawkeye steps aside for Chingachgook. His massive war club is flat and 
	angles to one side with a stabbing blade. Hawkeye is stepson and stepbrother. 
	The two younger men treat Chingachgook with an easy deference and affection. 
	Hawkeye's a dialectic of two cultures. In his coloration and worldliness he's 
	more the Anglo-Saxon frontiersman. In his independent views and candid manner 
	and in his combat skills and woodsmanship, he's more native American (Mohican). 
	As Chingachgook takes out his long knife and they approach the fallen elk ...] 
	
					CHINGACHGOOK 
				(low Mohican; sub-titled)
			We're sorry to kill you, Brother. 
			Forgive us. I do honor to your courage and 
			speed, your strength ... 

	CUT TO ...

	EXTERIOR - INTERIOR CAMERON CABIN - JOHN CAMERON - NIGHT

	roasts potatoes on a stick in the stone fireplace next to CAPTAIN JACK WINTHROP, 
	an American in very worn quasi-military gear. On a rough table in the tiny cabin 
	ALEXANDRIA, his wife, is kneading bread. Three children climb on their father. 
	He grabs their wild seven year old son, JAMES, who shrieks laughter and dodges 
	away. The cabin has two primitive rooms, waxed paper windows, log walls. O.S. a 
	dog barks. Others pick it up. Cameron & Jack are suddenly alert, reaching for 
	weapons ... 

	CUT TO ...

	EXTERIOR CAMERON CABIN, DOORWAY - CAMERON - NIGHT

	appears warily, musket in hand. 

	FENCE: CHINGACHGOOK

					CHINGACHGOOK
			Halloo! John Cameron! 

	Doorway: Cameron towards the interior ... 

					CAMERON
			Alexandria! Set three more places.
				(to the fence)
			How is Chingachgook, then? 

	Behind him, emerging from the dark trees are Hawkeye, Uncas, cradling flint 
	locks, blankets and packs over their shoulders, leading a mule laden with skins 
	and the elk carcass. Crossing the splitrail fence ... 

					CHINGACHGOOK
			The Master of Life is good. Another year pass ... 
			How is it with you, John? 

					CAMERON
			Gettin' along. Yes, it is. 
				(warm) 
			Nathaniel. 

					HAWKEYE
			Hello John. Cleared another quarter, I see. 

					CAMERON
				(shakes hands with Uncas)
			Yes, I did. 

	JAMES CAMERON

	tears past his father & runs full bore. Just before he's going to collide into 
	Uncas, he leaps into the air and Uncas snatches him with one hand and swings him 
	up onto his shoulders. The kid screams with delight and rides back towards the 
	cabin that way. Alexandria comes to the door. 

	CUT TO ...

	INTERIOR CABIN - CHINGACHGOOK - EVENING (LATER)

	lights & smokes a clay pipe. The scene says: this is a rustic, frontier home and 
	these people have known each other & live in dangerous circumstances. 

					ALEXANDRIA
			If Uncas is with you, that means he has not 
			found a woman and started a family yet. 

					CHINGACHGOOK
			Your eyes are too sharp, Alexandria Cameron. 
			They see into my heart. 

					UNCAS
			Your farm good to you this year, John? 

					CAMERON
			It was a good year for corn. 

					UNCAS
			Mohawk field we saw was 5 mile long on 
			the river. Chief Joseph Brandt's field. 

					CAMERON
			You take much fur? 

					HAWKEYE
			That we did. John. But the horicane 
				(sic)
			is near trapped out. 

					JACK
			Tradin' your skins in Castleton? 

					UNCAS
			No, Schylerville. With the Dutch for silver.
			French & English want to buy with wampum 
			& brandy. 

	Pause, then ... 

					HAWKEYE
			So what is it, Jack? What brings you up here? 

					JACK
			A French & Indian army out of Fort Carillon's 
			heading south to war against the English. I'm 
			here to raise this county's militia to aid the 
			British defense. 

					HAWKEYE
			Folks here goin' to join in that fight? 

					JACK
			We'll see in the morning ... 

					CHINGACHGOOK
			Fathers of England & France, both, take more 
			land, furs, than they need. They're cold & full 
			of greed ... 

					JACK
			Few'd deny that? Where you headin'? 

					HAWKEYE
			Trap over the fall and winter among the 
			Delawares in Can-tuck-ee. 

					UNCAS
			So I can find a woman and make Mohican 
			children so our father will leave my brother 
			& me in peace. 

	Alexandria laughs. So do Hawkeye & Chingachgook. 

					JAMES
			A son like me? 

	Uncas grabs James & suspends him upside down.

					UNCAS
			No. You are too strong. Turn me old 
			too fast! 

	Hawkeye grabs the kid from Uncas. The kid's laughing & can't stay still. 
	Chingachgook watches, content, smoking his clay pipe.

					ALEXANDRIA
			That's what he's doin' to his mama ... 

	She ruffles his hair and lifts the heavy iron pot off the tibbet. Uncas goes to 
	help her, she shrugs his hand away and carries it to the table herself. The men 
	gather around. There's pan-baked bread, a dish of salt, and the pot has venison 
	and yellow cornmeal in a kind of stew. Everyone waits.

					CAMERON
			Dear Father, thank you for rewardin' the fruits
			of our labor with plenty. Amen. 

	As they start to eat ...

	CAMERON'S CABIN - (DAY)

	EXTERIOR CAMERON CABIN - MOHAWK BOY & JAMES CAMERON - MORNING

	slam into other kids as they battle through a Lacrosse game. In the background are
	sixty men, women and children. It's a community gathering held out of doors. 
	We've entered mid-scene. Captain Jack is standing on a box. Some women and kids
	mill around some tables and boards laid over barrels. Cooking fires. Smoke. 
	Most but not all around Captain Jack are men, nine settlers, 3 hunter/trappers, 
	eight Mohawk farmers in mixed European and native clothing. Off to the side are 
	an English Lieutenant on horseback and a ten-man escort from whatever regiment's in
	Albany. A man named HENRI speaks in French. His son, MARTIN, translates. 

					HENRI
				(O.S. in French)

					MARTIN
				(translates) 
			My father says he was driven out of France by 
			the black robe priests and he would fight them 
			now but he lost his arm and so I will go in his 
			place. 

	Meanwhile ... 

	ONGEWASGONE

	is an unusually large Mohawk in a blue match coat with a little girl holding his hand. He
	says something to Chingachgook who nods. Hawkeye and Uncas are a little apart in an
	outer grouping of the men. Ongewasgone is a war chief and wears a white plume and is
	tattooed. As Martin finishes, he steps forward. 

					ONGEWASGONE
			John Cameron, thank you for your hospitality ... 
			Twin River Mohawk got no quarrel with Les 
			Francais. Trade furs with Les Francais. Now Les 
			Francais bring Huron onto Mohawk hunting grounds ... 

	These people are English, Scots-Irish and Dutch farmers; some French Huguenot
	"mechanics" (craftsmen). They're in shirt-sleeves and Indian moccasins & leggings. The
	Mohawks' vast lands and corn agriculture border the settlement. They 've been
	acculturated for over a hundred years. Some wear European calico hunting shirts.
	Their heads are shaved to scalping locks and many are tattooed. They've politically and
	commercially played France & England against each other very adroitly for over a
	hundred years because of their military power and geographic position. Their relations
	with working farmers and settlers and their families has been mostly one of 
	co-existence because there's always been more than enough for all. This is a WPA
	 mural of ethnic diversity and plurality of frontier America. The Europeans are former
	indentured laborers, farmers exiled by economics or religious persecution, frontier
	hunters and trappers ... working people.

					ONGEWASGONE
				(continues) 
			Now Mohawk will fight Huron and Les Francais. 
			My brothers have asked me to lead them in this 
			war so I speak for the Twin River Council. 

	The importance of this commitment is apparent to the lieutenant. 

					LIEUTENANT
			His Majesty King George II is very grateful for 
			your support. 

					IAN
			How far up the valley? 

					LIEUTENANT
			To Fort William Henry. 

					COLONIAL #1
			... two days from here. 

	Some don't like this.

					LIEUTENANT
			It should be enough to remind you France is 
			the enemy. 

					HAWKEYE
			Your enemy ... 

	Heads turn to Hawkeye at the periphery of the crowd.

					LIEUTENANT
			What did you say? 

					HAWKEYE
				(loud)
			I said ... France is your enemy. Not ours. 

					LIEUTENANT
			Really? Do you want them to overrun all 
			New York colony? 

					HAWKEYE
			First place, you started it with the French over 
			fur-trapping claims to the head waters of the Ohio. 
				(smiles) 
			Now you're sayin' these people have a fight on 
			their hands ... 

					LIEUTENANT
				(ignoring Hawkeye)
			Will you men help us stop the French? 

					HAWKEYE
			... and while they are cooped up in your fort, 
			what if the French send war parties to raid 
			their homes? 

					IAN
			What then, Lieutenant? 

					LIEUTENANT
			For your own homes, for king, for country, that's 
			why you men ought to join this fight! 

					HAWKEYE
			You do what you want with your own scalp.
			Do not be tellin' us what to do
			with ours. 

					LIEUTENANT
				(furious; to Hawkeye)
			You, sir! You call yourself a loyal subject? 

					HAWKEYE
			... No ... Do not call myself much of a subject 
			at all. 

	Light laughter.

					COLONIAL #2
			Nathaniel's right. But if I got to fight, figure I'll 
			try and do it fifty miles north of here instead of 
			my bean field. 

					AD LIBS
			Yes. Yeah. No ... 

					CAMERON
			I am stayin' on my farm. And any man who goes,
			his family is welcome to fort-up with us 'til he 
			comes back. 

					JACK
			Boys. My sense of it is enough of us will join-up to 
			fill the county's levy. But only if General Webb 
			accepts a few terms I got in mind ... 

	HAWKEYE & UNCAS

	cross through the people. A few men drift off to their women at the tables. 
	It is apparent two-thirds of the men will join. A couple of jokes, light banter,
	no hostility. 

					AD LIBS 
				(O.S.) 
			Webb? what's that, Jack ...? 

	As they cross through they start removing their shirts and weapons.

					IAN
			You boys marchin' with us? What do you say? 

					UNCAS
			We had our say, Ian. 

	They approach the Lacrosse field. Chingachgook stands with Cameron in the
	background, watching. 

	LACROSSE FIELD

	Uncas joins James. Hawkeye goes on the other side. A couple of young Mohawks and
	a young blonde farmer shout hallo's and as the bodies crash into each other ...

	wig (?) and a gorget (large medallion) around his neck. He's 28-30 and tough. He is
	self-sure, principled reactionary. He believes human society is static & layered into
	hierarchies of class and they are absolutely impermeable. He opens a simple gold-
	clasped case & contemplates its contents ... 

	HEYWARD'S POV: CASE

	an enameled portrait of a dark-haired young woman. 

	HEYWARD

	as a soldier is militarily first-rate in his milieu: the open battlefields of Europe. 
	Right now, however, he is about to enter the forests of North America. He closes 
	his clasp and glances out the window as we enter Albany and as a facade of

	Four Grenadiers come to attention as Heyward enters mid-scene.

					JACK
				(O.S.)
			... if they are not allowed leave to defend their 
			families if the French or Hurons attack the 
			settlements, no colonial militia is goin' to Fort 
			William Henry.

					HEYWARD
				(low)
			You, there. Help my man outside with the baggage. 

	GENERAL JEROME WEBB sees Heyward and nods. Three of Webb's Adjutants are
	on either side. Three remaining Grenadiers in bearskin-covered mitred caps are at the
	door. Facing Webb are a half dozen colonial representatives, including Captain Jack
	Winthrop. Heyward watches Jack ... 

					LIEUTENANT
			They will report or be pressed into service! 

					LARGE COLONIAL REP
			Any of the boys worth havin' can disappear into 
			forest ... time it takes you to blink. Where's that 
			leave ya, then? 

	Heyward, preparing to hand over dispatches, is interrupted by the insubordinate tone.
	Equally wound tightly is the Lieutenant.

					LIEUTENANT
			They will be found! Arrested ... 

					WEBB
				(cuts in)
			I cannot imagine his Majesty, in his benevolence, 
			would ever object to his American subjects 
			defending their hearth & home, their women & children, 
			if threatened by the "scourge" of attack from savages, 
			aroused to such excess by our enemy, the 
			ever-perfidious French. 

					JACK
			Does that mean they will be granted leave to 
			defend their homes if the settlements are 
			attacked? 

					WEBB
			Of course. 

	Heyward's more amazed by what he's just heard from Webb. These Americans,
	including Jack, are streaming past him on their way out.

					JACK
			You got yourself a colonial militia, General. 

					HEYWARD
			Major Duncan Heyward reporting, Sir! 

	Webb's pouring gin.

					WEBB
			Duncan. How was your journey? 

	The door closes. Dispatches are passed. They are now alone except for the General's
	two Adjutants and a shadowy form waiting patiently in a corner. He's MAGUA. In the
	dim light, he's motionless. Webb slides a glass across to Heyward.

					HEYWARD
			I didn't experience anything so surprising from 
			Bristol to Albany as what I witnessed here today. 

					WEBB
			And what is that? 

					HEYWARD
			The Crown "negotiating" the terms of service? 

					WEBB
			I know.
				(assuming a co-commiserator)
			One has to give Americans "reasons" and make 
			agreements to get them to do anything at all. 
			Tiring, isn't it? 
				(throws up his hands)
			But that's the way of it here. 

					HEYWARD
				(tight)
			I thought British policy is 'Make the 
			World ... England', sir. 

	A chill. Majors don't upbraid Generals.

					WEBB
			You will take command of the 62nd Regiment 
			of Foot. At Fort William Henry under Colonel 
			Munro. I will march the 33rd to Fort Edward. 

					HEYWARD
			Sir! ... Might I enquire if General Webb has heard 
			from Colonel Munro's daughters? I was to 
			rendezvous with them in Albany and escort them 
			to the fort. 

					WEBB
			Yes. You may.
				(to Magua, after a glance at Heyward)
			You there. What does Munro call you?
				(to Heyward) 
			The "Scotsman" has sent one of his Indian allies 
			to guide you. 

	MAGUA

	rises and slowly walks into the light. He is reserved and over six feet tall. His head is
	shaved into a mohawk. Rings, beads & feathers pierce his ears. A blanket is worn as a
	shawl over his left shoulder exposing his right arm and heavy tattooing. A long
	tomahawk is in the belt of his breechcloth.

					WEBB
			The Scotsman's daughters are at the Poltroon's 
			house. A company of the 33rd will accompany 
			you and Magua will show you the way. 

					HEYWARD
			By your leave, sir. 

	Webb holds Heyward a moment

					WEBB
				(to Adjutants)
			Explain to the Major we care little about toying 
			with colonial militia because we have little to 
			fear from the French. They have not the nature 
			for war. Their Latinate voluptuousness combines with 
			their Gallic laziness and the result is: they would
			rather make love with their faces than fight. 

	Webb's Adjutants laugh uproariously at his wit. Heyward's stiff, perfunctory smile. He's
	been made the butt of the joke. He does not share Webb's derisive view of the French.
	Webb doesn't like Heyward's manner. We don't like Webb. Then:

					WEBB
				(continuing) 
			Dismissed. 

	Heyward stiffly salutes. Webb casually, perfunctorily salutes the younger man in
	return.

					HEYWARD
				(to Magua)
			Dawn. At the encampment. Six a.m. sharp. See 
			to it you're there.

	Beneath Magua's barely deferential manner we sense intelligence & menace. None of 	these Brits see it. We do.

	brushed clean, his wig freshly powdered, his tricorn in his hand with a crimson sash and
	sword and his cavalry boots, walks through the gate after knocking. He enters a small
	courtyard. Suddenly he hears ... 

					CORA
				(O.S.)
			Heyward! Duncan Heyward. 

	Heyward looks to the side. An inner light turns on. In this mode, this is a man we could
	like. 

	REVERSE: CORA MUNRO

	enters from the garden. She's vivacious, dark-haired, unconventional in that she's
	educated, but with conventional values and attitudes. She hugs Duncan to her and 
	then pushes him away to look at him.

					HEYWARD
			My God it's good to see you. 

	He takes her hand in both of his and kisses it. He is open and lit up. 

	CUT TO ...

	EXTERIOR POLTROON'S HOUSE, BACK YARD - CORA & HEYWARD - DAY

	A vegetable plot behind the Poltroon's house is a provincial substitute for a formal
	garden setting. Heyward and Cora sit on rough wooden chairs. Wind blows. In the
	background a servant hangs laundry. The white sheets billow. A table holds a tea
	setting. They're sitting close to each other, talking seriously and quietly. Duncan's
	jacket is removed. Time's passed. Long pause. Then:

					CORA
			I'm embarrassed to be so indecisive ... after so 
			long apart and after you've traveled so far ... 

					HEYWARD
			And by sea! 

					CORA
			You still have an aversion to the water? 

					HEYWARD
			Aversion? No. ... "Hatred" ... "Loathing" ... 

	Cora laughs.

					HEYWARD
			But it was worth it all to end in a garden by 
			your side.

	She looks askance at him. Then the banter drops.

					CORA
				(difficult)
			Dear Duncan, my affection is as towards a closest 
			friend. Alice and I depend on you and respect 
			you immensely ... I wish they did, but my feelings 
			don't go beyond that. Do you see? 

					HEYWARD
			Isn't respect and friendship, a reasonable basis 
			for a man and woman to be joined? And all 
			else may grow in time ...? 

					CORA
			Some say that's the way of it. 

					HEYWARD
			"Some"? 

					CORA
			Cousin Eugenie, my father, but ... 

					HEYWARD
				(interrupts)
			Cora, in my heart, I know once we're joined, 
			we'll be the happiest couple in England. Let 
			those whom you trust, your father, help 
			settle what's best for you. In view of your 
			indecision, why not rely on their advice and 
			judgment as well as mine? 

	Cora stares directly at Heyward. Then she looks away. She has no answer. Something
	subterranean disturbs her about delegating judgment over the fate of her life.


					HEYWARD
			Will you consider that? 

					CORA
				(pause; smiles)
			Yes. Yes, I will. 

	She's still unsettled.

					ALICE
				(O.S.)
			Duncan! 

	REVERSE: ALICE MUNRO

	eighteen years old, white-blonde hair, wide blue eyes. She's effervescent and runs 
	to hug him. Heyward is taken aback by her enthusiasm and laughs.

					HEYWARD
			My God, you've grown up. 

					ALICE
			We leave in the morning?! 

					HEYWARD
				(rises)
			Yes, miss. 

					ALICE
			I won't sleep tonight. What an adventure! 
			I absolutely cannot wait to return to Portman 
			Square, having laid eyes upon the full-blooded, 
			red men in the wild! 

					CORA
			My God, Alice. 

					HEYWARD
				(smiles)
			It can be dangerous ... 

					ALICE
			Nonsense. Papa wouldn't have sent for us 
			if it were dangerous. 

	Alice takes Hewyward's hand. Cora pours Heyward more tea. The white sheets billow.

	steps out. Rigid salutes. 

	HEYWARD

	climbs onto his white military charger. It's spirited. Cora & Alice are in riding dresses
	 and veils. The veil doesn't completely cover Alice's golden hair and blue eyes and the
	flush of her complexion. They're riding two sidesaddled Narragansetts. The tight
	 traveling dress reveals that Cora, two or three years older than Alice, is fuller and more
	mature. All three ride to the front of the column. The baggage horses and mule are in
	the gap between the two companies. 

	MAGUA

	cradling his musket. 

	REAR SHOT: THE COLUMN

	astonished at the deep beauty of the place. 

	CORA'S POV: FOREST CANOPY

	of trees is dark, except for spots where leaves are sparse, and there the light is golden.
	It's the forest of childhood. 

	In a ravine a buck disappears into a deeper stand of trees.

					CORA
			Alice? 

	Alice rouses from fatigue.

					HEYWARD
			Are you alright? 

					ALICE
			Can we rest soon? 

					HEYWARD
			Absolutely. 

	Heyward rides to the front of the column to Magua, who's twenty to thirty yards ahead
	of everybody else.

					HEYWARD
			You there, Scout! 

	Magua slowly turns towards Heyward.

					HEYWARD
				(overly articulated) 
			We must ... stop ... soon. Women are ... tired. 
			You ... understand? 

					MAGUA
				(perfect English)
			I understand. This is not good place to stop. 
			Two leagues from here. No water 'til then. 
			That where we stop. Better place. 

					HEYWARD
			No. Stop in the glade just ahead! When the 
			ladies are rested, we will proceed. Do you 
			understand? 

					MAGUA
				(in Huron: English subtitle)
			"Magua understand paleface is a dog to his women.
			When his women want to eat, he lay aside his

	EXTERIOR MOUNTAINS & FOREST - WIDE - DAY

	Silently entering on either side of us come Chingachgook, followed by Hawkeye and
	Uncas. Even relaxed, they carry themselves with a degree of alertness. They're
	eighteenth century Viet Cong moving through the rain forest. The Maxfield
	Parrish/Hudson Valley of tall trees, ravines and streams is idyllic in front of them. All
	three cradle their long guns and move silently on moccasined feet. 

	FRONTAL: CHINGACHGOOK

	- in a stream - relaxed but attentive, abruptly stops. The others freeze in their tracks.
	Chingachgook sees and then stoops to examine ... 

	ROCK

	under the water in the stream. It's been turned from its bed. Chingachgook finds
	another. Uncas, moving up on his flank, climbs the bank and moves off into the trees,
	searches and then he gestures ... he's found another sign of something. 

	CHINGACHGOOK

	has headed off further down the stream and discovers nothing. Rapidly he rejoins Uncas
	and Hawkeye who've become extremely alert. They move up the bank into the forest
	ninety degrees from their previous path. 

	TRACKING: HAWKEYE, UNCAS & CHINGACHGOOK

	moving. Fast. Nearly soundless. They hardly disturb a blade of grass. The impression:
	expertise, deadliness and an impression something's wrong.

	acclivity and on the other falls off into a forested ravine. Magua walking towards
	camera. 

	CLOSER - MAGUA'S

	slid his tomahawk out from the front of his belt that girdles his waist. He lets the shaft
	drop into his hand. He shrugs off his blanket. There is a solidity to his dark, tall figure
	we didn't see before. Magua turns about face and advances on the column. 
	TRACK WITH Magua.
	Heyward and the Munro girls pass the camera as does Sgt. Major Ambrose, marching
	in advance of the men. Magua is approaching the soldier on the left in the first row. 
	We see Magua has caught the Redcoat's eye.

	REDCOAT

	is curious, starts to smile. What does the Huron want to say to him? When Magua is
	two steps away he caves in the side of the infantryman's head at the temple with the
	spike end of his tomahawk and, backhanded, hacks the blade through the side of the
	neck of the center man in the first row. 

	SIMULTANEOUSLY

	thirteen muskets EXPLODE from the wooded rise. 

	FIVE REDCOATS

	are blown off the path, two others are wounded ...

	The regulars slam into a firing line, stepping over the bodies of their comrades. All
	thirteen face the incline. 

	FORESTED RISE - HURONS

	flash downhill through the trees. Partnered in two-man teams, one loads and prepares
	and fires while the other advances to the next cover. He, then, prepares and fires
	covering his partner's advance. Leaping fallen trees and boulders, they're athletic, fast
	and rapidly closing.
	Even though the disciplined English regulars are a killing machine, we now see their
	tactics in the dense forest are grossly inferior to the Hurons' ... 

					AMBROSE
			Present!! 

	CORA

	covers Alice with her body, holding the reins of their bolting horses. 

	HEYWARD

	from horseback aims his horse pistol, FIRES ... 

	AN ATTACKING HURON

	leaping at him past Alice & Cora drops. 

	MULE

	with baggage crashes off, down the ravine. Another two Redcoats drop. Nine left.
	Then eight. 

	AMBROSE

			Load! Prime! 

	The English rush to complete the reload. Will they do it in time? 

					AMBROSE

			Present! Present! 

	Suddenly, Hurons - en masse - CRASH down onto the Redcoats line with tomahawks,
	war clubs and point-blank musket fire. 

	ALICE

	and ... 

	HEYWARD'S

	horse shot from beneath him, the animal folding, falling straight to the earth, and ... 

	MAGUA

	shoots Ambrose in the chest, and ... 

 	HEYWARD

	by the Munro daughters spins, swinging his fusil like a ball-bat, upending one Huron
	and lunges with his bayonet in his left towards another. But this Huron easily slips the
	thrust and slams Heyward with his rifle butt. 

	BRITISH

	dead and dying. 

	AMBROSE

	blood gushing from his chest wound, fires his pistol, dropping a Huron; slashes a
	second with his sword. Then he's chopped down. Hurons begin scalping the British
	while four race towards Heyward and the two women. 

	HEYWARD & CORA & ALICE

	ready to die. Heyward has only his fusil as a bludgeon. He readies ... 

	THREE LOUD SHOTS

	BLOW three of the Hurons sideways, head over heels down the rise. 

	REVERSE: THREE MEN

	barely seen, running diagonally across the fall line of the ravine. In parts, we recognize
	Nathaniel, recharging Killdeer on full run, and Uncas. 

	HURON'S

	not sure where the shots came from. Suddenly Chingachgook slams him, head first into
	the ravine with the war club. He didn't even slow down. 

	HURON

	warrior spins. Uncas tomahawks his shoulder. The Huron swings downwards. Uncas
	ducks beneath the swing and slashes his throat, sending him downhill into CAMERA 
	as ... 

	HAWKEYE'S

	momentum and thrown tomahawk spread-eagles one Huron, near a couple of wounded
	Redcoats who fight on ... 

	MAGUA

	calmly sees the odds have changed. His attention becomes focused. He commits a very
	revealing act seen through the blurred foreground action of struggling bodies. We will
	remember it. He raises his musket and aims at ... 

	CORA MUNRO

	who's unaware she's a target. Why is he singling out a Munro girl to kill? 

	HAWKEYE

	sees. Killdeer's at his shoulder ... 

	TIME SLOWS: MAGUA

	senses Hawkeye. Moving through liquid, his eyes drift left. The moment is frozen.
 	Their eyes lock, each to the other's. Then ... 

	TIME UNFREEZES

	Magua swings at Hawkeye and FIRES ... 

	HAWKEYE

	shifts. The .65 caliber musket ball rockets past his ear and he's already squeezing
	Killdeer's trigger as ... 

	HAWKEYE'S POV OVER BARREL: SMOKE

	from Magua's musket blast clears. Magua's gone. He almost shape-shifted, it happened
	so quickly. It's nearly mystical. 

	HAWKEYE

	lowers Killdeer, impressed. 

	CORA

	glances back at Hawkeye. She doesn't know why he's looking at her. 

	CHINGACHGOOK

	pursues two fleeing Hurons up the incline. Two strides gain him the first man, who he
	hamstrings and runs over to pursue the second up the hill ... as ... 

	HEYWARD

	in the confused melee, grabs a found musket and aims it at an Indian. We recognize that
	he's aiming at Chingachgook pursuing the second Huron up the hill ... 

					CORA
			No, Duncan! 

	Duncan ignores her. 

	HEYWARD'S MUSKET

	is jerked from his hands.

					HAWKEYE
			 ... case your aim is any better'n your judgment. 

	He's drawn his sword, reflexively. Hawkeye flips the musket around one-handed. It's
	pointed at Heyward's chest. And Hawkeye FIRES, killing an attacking Huron behind
	Heyward. As Heyward spins ... 

	CHINGACHGOOK'S WAR CLUB

	flashes up the hill. It cleaves the second man's back and bowls him over. Chingachgook
	retrieves his club as his scalping knife slashes down ... 

	UNCAS

	scalps the man he killed. Chingachgook dispatches the Huron he hamstrung. 

	WIDE

	Sudden silence. Heyward's motionless. The women are frozen, as terrified of the
	savages and apparent half-breed rescuers as they were of those who attacked them. 

	ALICE

	Cora, holding her, is stunned but functioning. Moments ago both women were clean
	and demure. Now their riding dresses are torn, mud-stained, blood-spattered and their
	baggage is gone. 

	HEYWARD'S

	crossed to his slaughtered soldiers. Moments ago they were a testament to British
	military power. Now they're dead meat. Ambrose's body is against a tree. In the B.G. 	two of the wounded start to rise ... 

					ALICE
				(O.S.)
			Stop it! 

	Heyward spins. 

 	UNCAS

	just cut the throat of the second Narraganset. It drops into the brush. Alice attacks
	him.

					ALICE
			We need them to get out of here! 

	Uncas gently restrains her. Cora reaches Alice and grabs her away from the "savage".
	Heyward runs in to protect the women ...

					HEYWARD
				(to Nathaniel)
			... why the bloody hell he do that to the horses?! 

	Uncas, all business, is now reloading, lifting powder horns, scanning the trees.

					UNCAS
				(matter of fact) 
			... too easy to track ... they can be heard for 
			miles ... find yourself a musket ... 

	Cora's surprised by Uncas' easy English. Hawkeye's scanning the forest.

					HAWKEYE
				(to Heyward)
			Your wounded should try walkin' back to Albany. 
			They'll never make a passage north. 

					HEYWARD
				(breathless)
			We were headed ... 

					HAWKEYE
				(appropriating a knife)
			... Fort William Henry. 

	CHINGACHGOOK

	to Hawkeye: let's go ... Then a fast exchange of Delaware. Cora's surprised to see it's
	Chingachgook's decision. Chingachgook looks at the survivors, gives his assent, starts
	off.

					HAWKEYE
			... take you as far as the fort. 

	Hawkeye throws Heyward a musket. Cora & Alice look towards Heyward. He looks at
	them: the women are totally terrified and do not move.

					HAWKEYE
			If we are goin' to take you, we need to move. 
			Fast ... And the fort is well off our course. 
			So if you all rather wait for the next Huron 
			war party to come by, we'll be on our way. 

	Heyward quickly decides to go. The women follow. Hawkeye starts off after Uncas and
	Chingachgook. 

	CUT TO ...

	EXTERIOR FOREST - HAWKEYE - DAY

	moves through the trackless forest. Uncas is far out on the left flank. Cora, Alice &
	Duncan Heyward follow in Hawkeye's and Chingachgook's steps ... 

	HAWKEYE'S FEET

	walking through a creek, stepping in the stream bed instead of on stones. The others
	follow. Hawkeye looks at Heyward. 

	HEYWARD

	conforms. He's ill at ease not being in command, following the lead of some half-Indian
	frontiersman through a foreign wilderness.] 

					HEYWARD
			How far is it, scout? 

					HAWKEYE
			Day and a half 
				(pause) 
			Where did you get ... the guide? 

					HEYWARD
			Colonel Munro sent him. He was one of our 
			Mohawk allies. 

					HAWKEYE
			He is Huron and nothing else. 
				(checking the Munro girls are 
				not too close)
			Why would he want to murder the girl? 

					HEYWARD
			What?! 

					HAWKEYE
			Dark haired ... 

					HEYWARD
			Miss Cora Munro. He never set eyes on 
			her before today. 

					HAWKEYE
			No blood vengeance? No re-proach or insult? 

					HEYWARD
			Of course not! 
				(pause) 
			And how is it you were nearby? 

					HAWKEYE
			Came across the war party, tracked 'em. 

					HEYWARD
			Then you're assigned to Fort William Henry? 

					HAWKEYE
			No. 

					HEYWARD
			Fort Edward, then? 

					HAWKEYE
			No. Headin' west. To Can-tuck-ee. 

					HEYWARD
			I thought all our colonial scouts were in 
			the militia? 

	Off to the side, Uncas smiles at the idea.

					HAWKEYE
			I ain't your "scout". And I am in no damn 
			militia. 

					HEYWARD
				(stops) 
			Then you are one of those who would allow 
			England to fight alone while she protects 
			you from France? 

					HAWKEYE
			England does not protect me and does not 
			war against France on our account. She uses 
			us to war against France on her own account ... 
			of greed for land and furs. 

	CORA'S

	appalled.

					HAWKEYE
				(turns) 
			Clear it up any? 

					HEYWARD
				(loud) 
			I owe you gratitude or I'd call you out! 

					HAWKEYE
				(low)
			Do not let gratitude get in the way ... 

	Cora's hand holds back Heyward's sword arm because suddenly Chingachgook looms
	over him.

					CHINGACHGOOK
				(to Hawkeye) 
			Yengeese no good in woods. Make more 
			noise, I kill him. 

	Heyward spins. Hawkeye coolly watches Cora. Her attitude is hostile; aligned with
	Heyward. He turns away. Meanwhile ... 

	UNCAS

	stops, alarmed. Something in the air bothers him. Hawkeye smells it, too. 

	CHINGACHGOOK

	is already moving out front, low and fast ... 

	CUT TO ...

	EXTERIOR FOREST, TREE LINE - GREEN BRANCHES - DAY

	After we HOLD, we realize Chingachgook's been there all along. Hawkeye and Uncas
	join him where the branches meet the ground. Smoke drifts through the trees. 
	Hawkeye sees and dips his head, then looks again ... 

	EXTERIOR CAMERON CABIN - WIDE - DAY

	Burned, smoldering, having fallen in on itself. TRACK LEFT past what was the
	doorway. A dead child's hand protruding from the ruin. A fragment of a dress. Charred
	and smoldering wood. John Cameron's body in the wreckage. And then, through the
	collapsed posts and timbers, Hawkeye, Chingachgook and Uncas have advanced and
	are seeing what we've just seen; and then Cora and Alice. 

	ALICE

	approaches and is frozen in horror. Cora shields her from the sight. Cora is affected but
	confronts it directly.

					HEYWARD
				(O.S.) 
			Anything to be done? 

	UNCAS

	returns from under one part of the wreckage, ashen, stoic, as they all are. We know the
	degree of their inner pain.

					UNCAS
			All dead ... 

	HAWKEYE

	bends over a moccasin print that Chingachgook's examining. They look at each other
	grimly. Heyward joins them.

					HEYWARD
			Who were these people? 

					HAWKEYE
				(re: print) 
			Ottawa! 

					HEYWARD
			Excuse me ... 

					CHINGACHGOOK
				(to Hawkeye) 
			Ottawa. 

	UNCAS

	enters, very careful where he places his feet ... Hawkeye gestures to Heyward to stay
	where he is: on the periphery with the women.

					UNCAS
			Mirrors ... tools ... clothes ... all inside. 

					HAWKEYE
				(to Chingachgook)
			Movin' fast, not able to carry much ... 
			this was a war party? 

	Chingachgook nods confirmation and indicates a direction in Mohican. The significance
	is very ominous to them. We don't know why yet. Chingachgook starts away ... 

					HEYWARD
			Let us look after them ... 

	He starts approaching the bodies.

					CHINGACHGOOK
			Leave them. 

	Heyward stops. Hawkeye and Uncas follow Chingachgook, leaving the cabin.

					CORA
				(hasn't moved)
			Though they are strangers, they are at 
			least entitled to a Christian burial! 

					HAWKEYE
				(shaking his head) 
			Let us go, miss. 

					CORA
			I will not. I have seen the face of war 
			before, Mr. Poe, but never war made on
			women and children. And almost as 
			cruel is your indifference. 

	Hawkeye turns back and rapidly approaches her. She takes a step back, fearful.

					HAWKEYE
				(contained)
			Miss Munro.
				(pause)
			They are not strangers .... 
			And they stay as they lay ...! 

	CORA

	realizes Hawkeye knew these people and is deeply affected. She also realizes for the
	first time this is a whole new world with dynamics and complexities, behavior and
	rhythms she doesn't understand. He turns away from her and walks on. She hesitates a
	moment. 

	WIDE ON THE SMALL CLEARING IN FRONT OF THE FARMHOUSE

	as Chingachgook and Hawkeye, extremely alert and cradling their cocked flintlocks,
	walk to camera, eyes sweeping the forest perimeter; they're followed by Cora, Heyward
	helping Alice and Uncas as rearguard.

	The ruined cabin and the dead dream of a family smolders behind them. 

	CUT TO ...

	EXTERIOR GLADE - PROFILE: HAWKEYE - NIGHT

	moves through to where the trees seem sparse and are unnaturally white birch and
	some thin grass grows. The land rises into a mound. Chingachgook and the others
	avoid stepping on the grass and cross to the other side of it. 

	CHINGACHGOOK

	mutters something to Uncas. He nods and disappears amongst the white birch,
	soundlessly. 

	HAWKEYE

	throws Heyward a blanket. Heyward spreads the blanket below the top of the mound
	and - maintaining silence - he gestures for Cora & Alice to rest there. 

	ALICE'S HEAD

	hits the blanket. She curls into a fetal position and she's out. Heyward is nearby on
	watch.
	Hawkeye has taken a position two-thirds of the way around the crescent shaped
	mound.
	Cora has sought him out. 

	HAWKEYE

	doesn't react as Cora enters. He's scanning the trees; not looking at her. 
	They whisper ... 

					CORA
			Why didn't you bury those people? 

					HAWKEYE
			Anyone lookin' to pick up our trail, would 
			see it as a sign of our passing ... 

					CORA
			You knew them. 

	Hawkeye looks at her and nods.

					CORA
				(stiffly)
			You were acting for our benefit. And I 
			apologize. I misunderstood you. 

					HAWKEYE
			Well that is to be expected. My father ... 

					CORA
			Your "father"? 

					HAWKEYE
			Chingachgook. He warned me about 
			people like you. 

					CORA
			He did? 

					HAWKEYE
			Yes. He said ... "do not try to make them 
			understand you." 

					CORA
			What?! 

					HAWKEYE
			Yes. And "do not try to understand them. 
			That is because they are a breed apart and 
			they make no sense ..." 

	Cora's indignation is cut off because ... 

	UNCAS

	moving fast. He gestures back the way he came and it means they're in jeopardy. Uncas
	disappears around the mound. 

	CUT TO ... 

	EXTERIOR BIRCH FOREST - TREES - NIGHT

	Nothing. Imperceptibly we move closer and start to see shapes blocking out part of the
	white birch. 

	RED-PAINTED FACE

	white eyes. A ruff of red hair stands straight up at the back of the large man's head. 
	Slit and monstrously elongated earlobes are weighted with silver. He's followed by
	others. Wary, silently, they hunt. 

	DEEPER: MORE OTTAWA

	Towards the rear are two French Rangers ("Coureurs des Bois") from Le Regiment de
	la Sarre. They're bearded, dirty, dressed Indian-style in moccasins, leggings and
	breechcloths with hooded hunting shirts. There's nothing clumsy about them. They're
	the 18th century version of Special Forces who've gone indigenous. If they and the
	Ottawa find our people, it's all over. 

	ALICE

	seeing the red-painted Ottawa approach, starts to panic. Her hyperventilating and
	involuntary small sounds of fear will reveal their position. A hand covers her mouth and
	silences her struggling. WIDEN. It's Uncas. His other arm is around her, holding her,
	looking towards the advancing Ottawa. 

	HAWKEYE

	on his back, his tomahawk within reach on the ground. 

	OTTAWA & FRENCH

	are fifty yards away from the crescent mound behind which lie our people. Mist
	envelops them ... 

	CHINGACHGOOK

	His massive arms spread revealing his war club in his left fist; his fusil in his right hand. 

	HAWKEYE

	waiting for the attack. Cora's eyes are anxious, but there's no terror there. Nathaniel's
	impressed with her cool. He hands her a pistol. She takes it. He listens for the soft drop
	of moccasined feet ... 

	OTTAWA

	through the grass. Thirty feet away they stop. They're motionless. Then their leader
	gestures and they start backing out. The French Rangers continue towards the crescent.
	The Ottawa chief takes one's arm and stops him. The French Ranger whispers
	something inaudible. The Ottawa chief shakes his head, "Non. Pas possible ..." 
	And means it. They retreat. 

	SEPERATE SHOTS: HAWKEYE, UNCAS, CHINGACHGOOK, CORA

	tensely monitor the Ottawa retreat. 

	UNCAS & ALICE

	He slowly removes his hand from her mouth. She's a little shy, then she looks up,
	catches his eyes. Then she averts her face. 

	CHINGACHGOOK

	sees all of it; doesn't like it. 

	HAWKEYE

	The Ottawa are gone.

					CORA
				(quietly)
			Why did they turn back? 

	In answer Hawkeye looks behind & above her head.

	CORA

	turns and makes out stilt platforms of skeletons and torn strips of buckskin silhouetted
	against the night sky in the distance. They have camped on sanctified ground, a burial
	place. 

	CORA & HAWKEYE

	She thinks it would be a mistake to ever underestimate the skill of these men or the
	danger & complexity of this place. She hands the pistol back to him. Their hands almost
	touch.

					CORA
				(still pissed off)
			"We're a breed apart and we make no 
			sense" ...? 

					HAWKEYE
				(smiles) 
			In your particular case, miss, I would 
			make some allowance ... 

					CORA
				(sarcastic)
			Thank you so much. 

	Cora is angry. Hawkeye, staring at the trees, glances at her. She settles, looking at him.
	Her mood changes. Then ... 

					CORA
			You called Chingachgook your "father"?
			Where is your real family? 

	Hawkeye's surprised by her question.

					HAWKEYE
			They buried my ma & pa and my sisters.
			And Chingachgook - who found me with 
			two French trappers - raised me up as his 
			own. 

					CORA
			I'm sorry. 

					HAWKEYE
			I do not remember them. I was one or two. 

					CORA
			How did you learn English? 

					HAWKEYE
			My father sent Uncas & I to Reverend 
			Wheelock's school when I was ten. So
			we would know both worlds ... though 
			we were told only bother learning readin' &
			arithmetic from yous. 

					CORA
			And what were the consequentialities of 
			European culture you didn't bother with? 

					HAWKEYE
			The Bible. Monarchy. Many wrong ideas 
			about the government of men. My father's 
			people already know each man is his own 
			nation. And only he can have dominion 
			over himself. Not kings. No man is better 
			than any other man. 

					CORA
			In London those radical ideas could land 
			you in Newgate prison. 
				(changing the subject)
			Why were those people living in this 
			defenseless place ...? 

					HAWKEYE
			'Cos frontier land's the only land affordable
			to poor people. So after seven years 
			indentured service in Virginia, they headed
			out here where they are beholden to none
			and not livin' by another's leave ... 
			Their name was Cameron. John & Alexandria.

	Cora sees the slate grey clouds and, in between, the fields of stars. She looks at 	Hawkeye; then again up at the night sky. 

					HAWKEYE
				(continuing; looking up)
			My father's people say ... at the birth of the 
			sun and of his brother, the moon, their 
			mother died ... so the sun gave to the earth 
			her body, from which was to spring all life.
			And he drew forth from her breast the stars.
			The stars he threw into the night sky to 
			remind him of her soul. 
				(the sky)
			So there is the Camerons' monument ... 
			my folks', too, I guess. 

	CORA'S

	pensive. Hawkeye's watching her. Her reaction is enigmatic. After a pause ... 

					CORA
				(low)
			You are right, Mr. Poe. We do not 
			understand what is happening here.
			And it is not as I imagined it would be, 
			thinking of it in Boston and London ... 

					HAWKEYE
			Sorry to disappoint you ... 

					CORA
				(eyes downcast)
			On the contrary. It is more deeply stirring ... 
			to my blood ...
				(then up into his eyes)
			... than any imagining could possibly have 
			been ... 

	She closes her eyes, turns slightly and prepares to sleep. Hawkeye is the one left staring
	into the birch forest, a little surprised. Some of his assumptions about her were 
	wrong ... 

	CUT TO ...

	EXTERIOR FOREST - WIDE - LATE AFTERNOON

	Deep fog has set in. A hand entering the frame scares the hell out of us. It moves a
	branch aside. It's Uncas. Spread to the right is Chingachgook, far to the left is
	Hawkeye. They hike up a steep forested slope in the heart of the Adirondacks.

					CORA
			Much further? 

					HAWKEYE
			Top of this ridge. Fort and Lake George are 
			downhill of it. 

	ALICE

	Re-energized, her spirits pick up.

					ALICE
			Will we be able to bathe? 

	Before Cora can answer they hear a deep, rolling roar. Alice is alarmed.

					CORA
			Thunder ... Papa will arrange something. 

	UNCAS

	looks over his shoulder, sees something in the far distance, gestures to Hawkeye and
	Chingachgook. 

	HAWKEYE'S POV: DISTANT HILLS

	and the band of red-painted Ottawa and Coureurs des Bois, who have now split into
	two groups, are still on their trail. Meanwhile, oblivious ...

					HEYWARD
			The men of the regiment will fetch water from 
			the lake, build fires and provide every comfort 
			you desire, Alice ... 

					ALICE
			Duncan, you are absolutely gallant. If Cora 
			doesn't marry you, I shall. 

					CORA
			Alice! 

	Heyward laughs. Hawkeye sees them. It bothers us: will these Europeans, including
	Cora, shed their frontier experience?

					ALICE
			I can't wait to see Papa ... 

					CORA
			And you, Duncan? What are you looking 
			forward to? 

					HEYWARD
			Posting to a different continent. 

	He and Alice laugh. Cora does not.

					CORA
			I think it's very important and exciting. 

	Heyward looks at her. She's not kidding. 

	ANOTHER ANGLE: HEYWARD

	helps Alice. As he does, he stares at Cora's seperation and now her proximity to
	Hawkeye, who's walking on ahead, is something Heyward doesn't like. His dark
	thoughts are distracted by a FLASH of light and more ROLLING THUNDER. 

	WIDE FROM THE FRONT - HAWKEYE

	drops and pulls Cora to the ground.

					CORA
			Lightning? 

	Hawkeye doesn't answer as he, Chingachgook, Uncas and Heyward make their way to
	the top of the ridge. 

	CLOSER ANGLES: CORA & ALICE

	join them and look down upon their expectation of a secure piece of England in the
	wilderness, a safe harbor, a father's warm welcome. 

	THEIR POV: FORT WILLIAM HENRY

	is none of those things. The thunder is the roar of French siege cannon clouded in dense
	smoke. The flashes of light are mortar bombs exploding and illumination rockets' red
	glare. Fort William Henry is under a massive siege by a French and Huron army. 

	UNCAS

	looks over his shoulder. 

	HIS POV: OTTAWA

	pursuing them. There's no way back. They're propelled forward. 

	DISSOLVE TO ...

	EXTERIOR BATTLEFIELD, FRENCH BATTERY #1 - CLOSE SHOTS - DUSK

	French cannons roar black smoke and gouts of red flame. 

	TRENCH

	dug by sappeurs behind the cover of a huge gambio pushed toward the fort by two
	poles and fascis on the sides. 

	ENGLISH GUN CREW

	searching the night. 

	POV: BATTLEFIELD

	is black. 

	ENGLISH ROCKETS

	light the battlefield revealing the French trenches. 

	ENGLISH GUN CREW

	excited. Colonial militia and Mohawk snipers fire their rifles. The British gun crew
	scrambles to adjust their 18 pounders. 

	FRENCH BATTERY #1 

	FIRES. 

	FRENCH BATTERY #2

	FIRES. 

	EXTERIOR FORT, WEST BATTERY

	TRACKING. French cannon FIRE rips into the fortifications, exploding wood and
	earth, shredding the English gun crew with cannister. The English fight stubbornly, but
	we feel they're outgunned. Meanwhile ... 

	WIDE ANGLE FROM THE WATER

	A new artillery duel erupts. The action is to the west side of the fort. On the north, the
	fire fight is reflected on the black water of Lake George in our foreground. Then a dark
	shape wiping to the right cuts off those reflections. We see in silhouette the outline of a
	birch canoe moving silently, barely rippling the mirrored surface of the lake. 

	EXTERIOR LAKE GEORGE BANK - DEBRIS

	Behind it, two Canadiens and a Huron alternately snipe at the ramparts. 

	LOW & WIDE: SNIPERS

	Behind them is black water. Its surface is broken by the rising mass of Chingachgook,
	followed by Uncas and Hawkeye. Muzzle flashes from the cannon reveal the canoe and
	the forms of the girls further out. Chingachgook's war club is held low. The Huron
	senses and turns and Hawkeye's thrown tomahawk knocks him back. Hawkeye's knife
	flashes in the night. Chingachgook drives the war club up, smashing a Canadien onto
	the debris. The second Canadien jabs bayonet at Uncas, slashing his side. Uncas jerks
	him forward by the musket, folds him over and tomahawks him. 

	CUT TO ...

	EXTERIOR FORT WILLIAM HENRY, NORTH WALL - SALLY-PORT TUNNEL
	- NIGHT

	Amidst the cannonade roar, ad-libbed shouts from Hawkeye and Heyward convince
	battle begrimed soldiers to open the sally-port. Our people rush in. 

	TORCH LIGHT

	the group moves through the long, dank, tunnel. Enlisted men escorting them. Another
	torch from the other direction: CAPTAIN BEAMS is revealed.

					HEYWARD
			I'm Major Duncan Heyward! 

					BEAMS
			Captain Jeffrey Beams. We didn't think 
			you'd make it through! 

					HEYWARD
			Where's Colonel Munro? His daughters are 
			here, too. 

	Beams raises his torch, sees the muddied, soaked women. He is shocked that they
	traveled with Heyward. 

	CUT TO ...

	INTERIOR FORT WILLIAM HENRY, PARADE GROUND - GROUP - NIGHT

	emerges from a sally-port tunnel. It's smokey. NOISE is deafening. The group has
	traveled through a nightmare, only to arrive in hell. 

	HEYWARD WITH BEAMS, CORA & HAWKEYE, ALICE, UNCAS &
	CHINGACHGOOK

	run diagonally past pyramidal stacks of cannon ball, smoldering beams and shrapnel,
	wounded men. Just then a mortar is fired and explodes, killing the gun crew. On the
	ramparts Mohawks and Colonial Militia, sniping at the French. Women huddle in 
	corners next to the sick and dying. 

	UNDER RAMPARTS: MILITIA

					AD LIBS
				(shouts over roar)
			Uncas! Nathaniel ... 

	HAWKEYE

	waves. One wounded man, IAN, intercepts Uncas.

					IAN
			Thought you and Nathaniel weren't 
			joinin'-up. 

					UNCAS
				(on the run) 
			Didn't! 

					HAWKEYE
			Dropped in to see how you boys is doin'. 

	COLONEL MUNRO

	running from his quarters is shocked to see them.

					ALICE
				(hysterical) 
			Papa, Papa!! 

					MUNRO
				(enraged) 
			Why are you here?! 

	Cora is stunned. Alice is decimated by her father's anger. Munro sees and whips off his
	coat to cover them and takes Alice under his arm. Bombardment resumes. Alice clings
	while they race for the cover of his quarters:] 

					MUNRO
				(to Heyward; re: Alice & Cora) 
			Why did you allow them to come? ... And
			where the bloody hell are my reinforcements!! 

	They race into the yellow lantern light of Munro's quarters and slam and bolt the heavy
	door. Heyward's confused ... 

	CUT TO ...

	INTERIOR MUNRO'S QUARTERS - NIGHT

					MUNRO
				(embracing his daughters; softer) 
			Told you to stay away from this hell hole!
			Why did you disobey me? 

					CORA
			When? How? 

					MUNRO
			My letter ... 

					CORA
			There was none! 

					MUNRO
			What? 

					CORA
			There was no letter. 

					MUNRO
			I sent three men to Webb! 

					HEYWARD
			One called Magua arrived. 

					CORA
			He delivered no such message. 

	Munro's stunned.

					MUNRO
			Does Webb not even know we are besieged? 

					HEYWARD
			Sir. Webb has no idea. And he certainly does 
			not know to send reinforcements! 

	Munro has nowhere for his rage to go. Meanwhile, Alice clings to her father. At 45-55,
	the British Army has been his life. He blindly believes in its institutions, though officers
	like Webb would disdain his Scots origins. 
	From under his fury: 

					MUNRO
				(flat)
			What happened to you? 

					HEYWARD
				(suddenly tired) 
			Ambush ... on the George Road. This
			Magua led us into it.
				(pause)
			... eighteen killed. It's these men who 
			saved us. They guided us here ... 

					MUNRO
			Thank you. How can I reward you? 

	No answer. Then ...

					HAWKEYE
			Help ourselves to a few horns from your 
			powder stores. 

					MUNRO
			What else? 

					UNCAS
			Some food. 

					MUNRO
				(to Uncas)
			I'm indebted to you. And get your side sewn up, 
			young man. 

	MUNRO

	sees his exhausted and bloodstained surgeon in the doorway that leads to the next
	rooms. 

					MUNRO
				(bellows) 
			Mr. Phelps! 

	PHELPS' face lights up when he sees Cora Munro.

					PHELPS
			Miss Cora! How are you? 

					CORA
				(smiles) 
			Fine, Mr. Phelps. Have you cat gut and a 
			suturing needle? 
				(for Uncas)
			And we could use some rum, clothes, and 
			a place to wash ... 

	Cora tries to remove Alice from her father, but she clings to him. Munro holds her
	tighter. Then he whispers something to her. She nods her head. And Cora takes her.
	They exit. 

	MUNRO

	is moved beyond words by his daughters' presence. There's a break, a pause ...

					MUNRO
				(to Heyward over table map)
			What a place for them ... 


					HEYWARD
			Might I enquire after the situation, sir, given 
			that I've seen of the French engineering from 
			the ridge above? 

					MUNRO
				(perfunctory)
			 Logistics are his guns are bigger than mine 
			and he has more of them. They keep our heads 
			down while his sappers make thirty yards of 
			trench a day. His thirteen inch mortars have a 
			two hundred yard range, so when they're close 
			enough, they'll move them in, lob explosive 
			rounds over our walls and pound us to dust. 

					HEYWARD
			They look to be three hundred yards out. 
			You have three days. 

					MUNRO
			Bloody murderers. 

					HAWKEYE
			A man, here, can make a run straight through 
			to Webb. 

					MUNRO
			... not enough time to get to Albany and back 
			with reinforcements ... 

	A Sergeant enters, snaps to attention, says something to Beams, exits.

					HEYWARD
			Webb's not in Albany. He marched the 33rd to 
			Fort Edward two days ago. 

					MUNRO
			Webb's at Edward? 

					HEYWARD
			Yes, sir. 

					MUNRO
			Only twelve miles away! He could be here day 
			after tomorrow. 
				(to Hawkeye)
			Find your man, sir! Captain Beams will give you 
			the message. 

	Beams nods. Munro turns back to the map. Hawkeye has something else to say.

					HAWKEYE
			John Cameron's cabin. We come upon it last 
			night. Burned out. Everyone murdered. And 
			it was Ottawa. They're allied to the French. 

	Munro looks at him.

					MUNRO
			Yes, Mr. Poe? So? 

					HAWKEYE
			It was a war party. It means they're on the 
			attack up and down the frontier. 

	Munro turns to look at him for a long beat. Munro doesn't like what his response must
	be to this news. He turns to Heyward and the map.

					MUNRO
				(cold)
			Thank you. 

	Hawkeye's dismissed, frozen out.

					HAWKEYE
			Many men here, their homes are in the path. 

					MUNRO
			That's all, sir. 

	Hawkeye is furious. Chingachgook gestures Hawkeye out. He leaves Munro's quarters
	almost knocking over an entering Adjutant who backs way up to let Chingachgook
	pass.

					HEYWARD
			Things were done. Nobody was spared ... 

					MUNRO

	INTERIOR MONTCALM'S MARQUEE - CHORAL GROUP - NIGHT

	of three Seneca women and five boys, led by a Jesuit, sing the Te Deum in the Iroquois
	language. This is a large tent that could sleep twenty. Montcalm's four personal guards
	are at the entrance as well as COMTE DE LEVIS in dirty lace, a facial wound and a
	braceful of pistols on a sash. Inside is simple campaign furniture and a six by eight foot
	battle standard and flag of France. 

	MONTCALM

	stands with a huge and fearsome elaborately tattooed and robed Seneca chief in a silk
	turban ...

					SENECA CHIEF
				(low)
			... and the Black Robes of Michilimackinac left 
			us no time to put our cabins in order before telling 
			us our French father had need of our aid. We rolled 
			our blankets and were the first to be here. Yet we 
			are not the first and closest to my father's campfire. 

	The Marquis de Montcalm is forty-five, wears a large wampum belt as a sash over his
	waistcoat. He has an acute intellect, an elegant manner. He is more aristocratic than
	Munro, but a consummate professional soldier. Over the Seneca's shoulder, Montcalm
	sees and nods to ... 

	MAGUA

	entering with four Huron braves. This is not the Magua we saw on the trail. In his scalp
	lock, now red-stained and cut to a Huron roach, are three blacl plumes. A match-coat
	blanket drapes his left shoulder. 

					MONTCALM
				(to Seneca Chief)
			For my children and the children of the true 
			faith, my friendship and esteem is boundless ... 
			I will give you three oxen for a feast and tomorrow 
			I, myself, will sing the war song with you in the 
			great council house. 

	The Seneca Chief is satisfied and his people, plus the Jesuit, exit. The look on Magua's
	face and the wry expression on Montcalm's allows us to understand their relationship is
	based on realpolitik.

					MONTCALM
			Le Renard Subtil, how are things with your 
			English friends? 

	Magua exhales in derision as he brings a chair to face Montcalm and sits, European
	style ...

					MONTCALM
				(over his shoulder)
			Louis Antoine, join us. 

	LOUIS ANTOINE DE BOUGAINVILLE enters. He wears a functional melange of
	Indian moccasins over white linen breeches and an officer's waistcoat. 

					MONTCALM
			Hear what le Subtil has to tell us ... 

	Bougainville published a book on integral calculus at twenty-five, at twenty-six was a
	secretary to the French Ambassador in London, in January 1756 at twenty-seven he
	was elected a member of the British Royal Academy of Science and at age twenty-eight
	he's aide de camp to the Marquis de Montcalm with the rank of captain. Later in life, he
	brought "bougainvillea" from Tahiti to Europe to America.

					MAGUA
			English war chief, Webb goes to Fort Edward 
			with 33rd Regiment. He does not know my 
			father's army attacks Fort William Henry. 

					BOUGAINVILLE
			But by now Munro knows his couriers didn't 
			get through. He'll send another. 

					MAGUA
			The Grey Hair will try. 

					BOUGAINVILLE
			Four or five, including two women entered the 
			fort ... 

					MAGUA
			The Grey Hair's children were under Magua's 
			knife but escaped. They'll be under it again. 

					MONTCALM
			Why do hate the Grey Hair, Magua? 

					MAGUA
			When the Grey Hair is dead, Magua will eat 
			his heart. Before he dies Magua will put his 
			children under the knife so the Grey Hair will 
			see his seed is wiped out forever. 

	Montcalm won't get a direct answer.

					MONTCALM
			My sappeurs are advancing the trenches through 
			the night, now. You may have your opportunity 
			soon.

	exhausted, sitting on a low stool, taking a breath.

					HAWKEYE (O.S.)
				She know what she's doin'? 

	Phelps looks up, then he looks over his shoulder at Cora. She's in a borrowed
 	launderess dress/blouse ... She looks different. He's a little indignant.

					PHELPS
			First assisted me in Austria when she was 
			fourteen. I would say she does ... 

	Her apron is stained. Hawkeye sees this may be her first time in the New World, but it's
	not her first military campaign. Still angered at Munro's dismissive response, he's
	nevertheless falling for Cora.

					HAWKEYE
			She does not shy away from much ... 

					PHELPS
				(elsewhere) 
			What's that? 

					HAWKEYE
			Nothin'. 

	Alice Munro has caught Hawkeye's attention. Outside the surgery where a casement
	meets a wall, she sits, withdrawn. A catatonic older woman in a fine dress sits next to
	her.

					PHELPS (O.S.)
			Miss Cora? Gentleman looking for you. 

	HAWKEYE

	enters. Cora's sewing up Uncas.

					CORA
				(looks up) 
			Mr Poe? 

					HAWKEYE
			Miss. 
				(re: cotton) 
			May I? 

	Cora, curious, nods. Hawkeye cuts some pieces from her ruined and discarded dress
	that she now uses to bandage Uncas. We don't know why; neither does Cora.

					HAWKEYE
				(to Uncas) 
			You 'bout done holdin' hands with Miss Munro? 

	Uncas laughs, looking from her to Hawkeye. Then he's up and he hurts. Cora starts to
	tend another wounded man. As they start out, Hawkeye hesitates. Sensing it, Cora
	turns.

					CORA
			What are you looking at, Mr. Poe? 

					HAWKEYE
			Why, I am looking at you, Miss. 

	Cora measures the directness of Hawkeye's manner. It's not insolent, only unsettling.
	Feeling foolish; she turns. He leaves.

	Each rifle is within reach of Hawkeye's hand. Hawkeye is taking extra care loading
 	Killdeer. He charges it once, then overloads the powder by a quarter charge.

					UNCAS
			You told him about the raid?

			But he is gonna have to.

	Hawkeye uses the fine cotton he took from Cora. Uncas sees it.

					UNCAS
			Tight weave. 

					HAWKEYE
			Another forty yards? 


	Uncas nods. Hawkeye wets it to make a tighter gas seal and rams it home. The tighter
	fit requires more effort. 

	HAWKEYE

			Cora ... I wanted to talk to you, but I'll 
			come back another time ... 

	Alice looks at the two of them and rises out of the bed.

					CORA
			Alice ...

			I'll see if Mr. Phelps needs anything ...

					HEYWARD
			I'm sorry, I didn't mean to ... 

					CORA
			Her nerves are shattered. She's trying 
			to be brave. 

	There's a lot going on under Cora's surface. We don't know what it is, but it's
	disconcerting.

					HEYWARD
			Cora, I adore you and, when we come together, 
			we will be the happiest couple in England ... 
			I am certain of that. More than ever before. 
				(softens)
			I believe you must trust the judgment of others 
			who hold your welfare so close to their hearts ... 

					CORA
			Duncan ... 
				(pause)
			Duncan, I promised you an answer. You 
			have complimented me with your persistence 
			and patience ... But the decision I've come 
			to is I'd rather make the gravest of mistakes 
			than surrender my own judgment. 

	Heyward is stunned.

					CORA
			And it's been unfair to you, while I search 
			myself for feelings, which, if they were
			there and as strong as they ought to be, 
			would've made themselves known long ago ...
				(pause)
			Take my admiration and friendship, Duncan.

	Heyward nods. He's speechless. He's errect as he leaves the room.

					HAWKEYE (O.S.)
			... it was no raidin' party out for pillage. The 
			cabin was attacked by a war party. They are 
			sweeping south down the frontier spreading 
			terror among farms and Mohawk villages 'cos 
			all the men are here. 

					IAN (O.S.)
			And my cabin's not thirteen miles south of 
			Cameron's! 

	Cora, passing the open door to Munro's crowded office, now hesitates. 

	CORA'S POV: THE ROOM

	Hawkeye, Captain Jack Winthrop, Ian, seven or eight other militia spokesmen, Munro,
	Heyward, two adjutants, one lieutenant of Rangers.

					MUNRO
				(to Jack)
			I must receive proof more conclusive than 
			Mr. Poe's opinion before I weaken our 
			defenses by allowing militia to withdraw. 

					JACK
			Chingachgook's of the same opinion. Taken 
			together, that's gospel. Your fort will	 stand 
			or fall depending on Webb and reinforcements, 
			not these colonials' presence. 

					MUNRO
			I judge military matters, Captain Winthrop, not 
			you. 

					HAWKEYE
			That judgment is not more important than their 
			right under agreement with Webb to defend their 
			farms & families ... Major Heyward was at John 
			Cameron's. He saw what it was. 

					MUNRO
				(looking to Heyward for 
				confirmation of his point of view) 
			What did you see, Major? 

	Heyward looks around the room. And he catches the doorway ... 

	CORA

	beyond the periphery of men, staring at him. 

	HEYWARD

	Munro is expecting him to be the good soldier in defense of British military interests.
	At the same time ... 

	CORA

	examines him with a cool, level stare. 

	HEYWARD

	looks at Munro. More French rounds detonate O.S. What if Webb gets here and they
	need to launch a counter-attack? They need every man they have. It's his moment of
	decision ...  

					HEYWARD
				(to Munro)
			I saw nothing that would lead me to the 
			conclusion it was other than a raid by savages 
			bent on thievery. 

	Jack Winthrop grabs Nathaniel.

					HAWKEYE
			You're a liar! 

	CORA'S

	saddened. Heyward's stature has fallen irrevocably in her eyes. 

	HEYWARD

	can't help it. He turns to look at Cora ... 

	HEYWARD'S POV: DOORWAY

	She's gone. 

	HEYWARD

	suffused with an inner sadness, turns to Hawkeye.

					HAWKEYE
			And the blood is on your hands! 

	Heyward reaches for his sword. 

					MUNRO
				(to Heyward) 
			I'll have none of that! 
				(to colonials) 
			Montcalm is a soldier and a gentleman. 
			Not a butcher. 

					HAWKEYE
			Easy for you to suppose. While it is their 
			women and children, not yours, alone in 
			their farms! 

					MUNRO
				(exploding)
			You forget yourself! 

					JACK
			We are not forgettin' Webb's promise! 

					MUNRO
			British promises are honored. And the militia 
			will not be released. Because I need more 
			definite proof than this man's word! 

					JACK
			Nathaniel's word been good on the frontier a 
			long time before you got here! 

					MUNRO
			This interview's over! The militia stays! 

					JACK
				(to Munro) 
			Does the rule of English law no longer govern? 
			Has it been replaced by absolutism? 

	This is very dangerous talk.

					HAWKEYE
			And if English law cannot be trusted, maybe 
			these people would do better makin' a peace 
			with the French! 

					HEYWARD
			That is sedition! Treason! 

					HAWKEYE
			That is the truth! 

					HEYWARD
				(restaining himself) 
			I ought to have you whipped from this fort! 

					HAWKEYE
			Major! 
				(changes down)
			Some day I think you and I are gonna have 
			a serious disagreement. 

					MUNRO
				(steel) 
			Anyone fomenting or advocating leaving 
			Fort William Henry will be hung for sedition. 
			Anyone leaving will be shot for desertion. 
				(pause)
			 My decision is final. Get out. 

	Hawkeye and the others are not intimidated. Their rage smolders. The look on
	Hawkeye's face says this is not over.

	Sparks shower skyward. Impromptu music. Some Celtic proto-bluegrass played on

	ANOTHER ANGLE: SOME WOMEN

	laundresses, dance from soldier to soldier - English foot and American Rangers. A few
	people lit by the firelight are solemn. Most are stirred to lift their morale for a while. 

	THEIR FACES

				(low)
			But we are under English military authority. 

					JACK
				(low) 
			I believe if they set aside their law as and when 
			they wish, their law no longer has rightful 
			authority over us. All they have over us is 
			tyranny, then. And I'll stay here no longer. 
			No force on earth will keep me here ... Anyone 
			caught leavin' the fort could be shot. So each 
			man make your own decision ... Those who 
			are goin', be back here in an hour. 

					HAWKEYE
			Out the northern sally-port. Strike for the east 
			side of the swamp until you clear the French 
			picket line. Head north over the ridge, then 
			come about southeast and fork left in Little 
			Meadow and you're free of the outpost and 
			skirmishers ... 

					A COLONIAL
				(grumbles)
			 Should've skinned outta this long ago. 

					COLONIAL #2
			Got no families, Captain. Figured we'd stay 
			and give 'em a hand even though ... 

					HAWKEYE
				(to Colonial #2)
			I'll cover them from the top of the casement. 

					JACK
				(in amazement)
			You're not coming with us? 

	Hawkeye shakes his head. 

					HAWKEYE
			Got a reason to stay. 

					JACK
			That reason wear a blue dress and work 
			in the surgery? 

	Low laughter

					HAWKEYE
				(dry)
			 It does and it is a better lookin' reason 
			than you, Jack Winthrop. 
				(more laughs) 
			Push hard, 'cos you got to clear the French

	for him. He comes up to her. She turns in surprise. 

	CLOSER

	Somehow she breathes easier because he's there. She's in a white shirt with the sleeves
	rolled up. Hawkeye leads her away from some of the people. 

	CORA & HAWKEYE

	Hawkeye takes Cora's hand. Cora is awakening to a new spirit, a new wind blowing
	through a new land, a new self-determination ... She's drawn to this rough yet graceful
	man with his direct manner. Hawkeye settles against a wall. She leans next to him.
	Their shoulders touch. 

	CORA

	To her everything about him seems to be somehow right. She's discovered that the
	passions and outrage that move him, move her ... And her readiness to give herself to
	what stirs the deepest resonances of her soul is the same as his. 

	HAWKEYE

	looks at her. She's beautiful in the firelight. Cora's eyes find his and she folds into his
	arms. His lips find hers and tears stream down her face. She's suffused with an elation
	she can't explain. In the night before doomsday a romance is born in rebellion amid the
	huddled people in this small stockade ripped from the black earth of the forests of a

	WIDEN:

	Heyward, Munro, Cora. We've entered mid-argument. An adjutant comes and goes.
	Heyward and Munro are sensitive to appearances in front of the adjutant. Cora couldn't
	give a damn. 

					MUNRO
			The man encouraged the colonials to desert 
			in this very room, in my presence. He is 
			guilty of sedition and must be tried and hanged 
			like any other criminal, regardless of what he 
			did for my children. 

					CORA
			He knew the consequences. And he stayed. 
			Are those the actions of a criminal? 
			... Duncan, do something. 

					HEYWARD
			He knew the penalty for breaking regulations. 
			He ought to pay without sending you to beg. 

					CORA
			You know he wouldn't send me ...! You 
			misrepresented what you saw and caused
			this. 
				(frustrated)
			I, too, was at that farm. It was as he said ... 

					MUNRO
			Not with enough certainty to outweigh British 
			interests in this fort. 

					HEYWARD
			And who empowered these provincials to pass 
			judgment upon England's policies in her own 
			colonies? To come and go without so much as 
			a "by your leave." 

					CORA
			They do not live their lives "by your leave." 
			... They hack it out of the wilderness with 
			their own two hands, burying their dead and 
			their children along the way. 

					HEYWARD
				(distant)
			 You are defending him because you've become 
			infatuated with him.

	Cora is having her intelligence written off as a hormone attack. She contains her fury. 

					CORA
			Duncan, you are a man with a few admirable 
			qualities. But taken as a whole, I was wrong 
			to have thought so highly of you. 

	Heyward's shot through the heart.

					MUNRO
			But the man is guilty of sedition and subject 
			to military justice and beyond pardon. 

					CORA
			"Justice"? If that's "justice" ..., then the 
			sooner French guns blow the English army
			out of America, the better it will be for 
			these people. 

					MUNRO
			You do not know what you are saying! 

					CORA
				(explodes)
			Yes I do! I know exactly what I am saying. 
			And if it is sedition, then I am guilty of

	Heavy timbered door. A sentry. They stand at attention when Cora passes as opposed
	to barring her entry. 

	INTERIOR CELL - HAWKEYE

	comes to the door, grips the bars with his hands and looks at Cora. 

	THROUGH THE BARS TO CORA

	They are silent for a moment, then ... 

					HAWKEYE
			Sorry ... can't ask you in. 

	Cora's pale smile. 

					CORA
			They're going to hang you. 
				(pause; soft)
			Why didn't you leave when you had the
			chance? 

					HAWKEYE
			Because what I am interested in is right 
			here ... 

					CORA
			What would you have me do? 

	He touches her hand. 

					HAWKEYE
			Webb's reinforcements will arrive or not. 
			If they do not arrive, the fort will fall. If 
			that happens, stay close to your father. 
			The French will protect the officer class 
			among the English. 

					CORA
			No. I will find you. 

					HAWKEYE
			Do not. 
				(pause)
			Promise me. 

	Cora drops her forehead to Hawkeye's hands wrapped around the bars. She acquiesces,
	nods. Then HEAVY SHELLING commences. Cora & Hawkeye look up. Mortar
	bombs begin striking the fortress. Still dark. The final French bombardment has
	started. 

					CORA
			The whole world's on fire, isn't it? 

	A pause.

					HAWKEYE
			This part of it sure is ... 

	Reaching through the bars set in the thick door, their hands clasp each others. On that
	image ... 

	CUT TO ...

	EXTERIOR FORT WILLIAM HENRY - VARIOUS CUTS - DAWN (2ND UNIT)

	French cannoneers in Batteries #1 and #2 fire again and again. They work like precision
	drill teams. 

	FRENCH TRENCH

	ending in Battery #3 is complete and surprisingly close to William Henry's walls. Crews
	reload the squat and massive newly arrived thirteen inch mortars. 

	MORTAR ONE

	The flash-hole is primed. The burning fuse is jammed into the bomb. The primer charge
	is lit off and the crew ducks as the crude iron belches red flame and black smoke into
	the lightening sky. The second mortar ROARS. Then a THIRD. 

	CUT TO ...

	INTERIOR FORT WILLIAM HENRY - ENGLISH CANNON CREW - NIGHT

	tries to return fire but can't under the heavy French bombardment. The French mortar
	bomb arcs in and EXPLODES smoke, flame and shrapnel, wiping out most of the
	crew. The fortress is under the heaviest attack we've seen. Wounded are in shock or
	terrorized. Another mortar bomb arcs in and explodes part of a building and casement,
	starting a fire.
	Another lands in the grounds. People scatter. It doesn't explode. One soldier dashes to
	rip out the fuse. As his hand is inches away ... EXPLOSION. 

	CUT TO ...

	INTERIOR STOCKADE - HAWKEYE - DAWN - LATER

	thundering stops. Hawkeye seperates himself from her and crosses to the window. 

	EXTERIOR FORT, MAIN GATE - HAWKEYES POV: CHEVALIER DE LEVIS

	bows deeply to Major Beams. A French honor guard of five men is behind him. A white
	scarf is on his sword tip. The fresh destruction of the fort is apparent. Debris smolders. 

	INTERIOR FORT - STOCKADE - HAWKEYE

	crosses to an awakened Cora. He touches her face. He's desperate to drill these next
	words into her brain. 

					CORA
			What is it? 

					HAWKEYE
			I don't know. Whatever happens you stay 
			with your father. You stay among the officers. 

	Cora looks up at Hawkeye. We feel forboding. O.S. are heard drums ... 

	CUT TO ...

	EXTERIOR FRENCH LINES - MUNRO, HEYWARD, BEAMS - DAY

	The drums are from Munro's honor guard. They stop. 

	REVERSE: FRENCH SOLDIERS

	Marquis de Montcalm, immaculate, backed by his guard of honor in white, grey and
	medium blue with six foot by eight foot regimental colors and the French flag (gold
	fleur-de-lis on a field of blue). 

	FACES

	They carried two hundred and forty-five bateaux across a ten mile portage, all their
	supplies and artillery, and then rowed down the length of Lake George to get here. To 	them, assaulting this fort is the easy part. The drummers of the honor guard play a
	tattoo behind them. 

	INDIAN FACES

	Huron, Ottawa, Osage, Choctaw, Fox ... hear the drum of the honor guard and wait.
	They're in war paint. Many tattoos. Split ears. The Osage scalping locks are hennaed
	red. Canadiens among them are bearded, dirty, half savage ... At their head ... 

	MAGUA

	in full war paint, with a coterie of Huron warriors, silent, waiting. Drums. 

	INTERIOR FORT - ENGLISH TROOPS (TABLEAUX)

	grim, silent, watchful. 

	COLONIAL MILITIA & MOHAWK INDIANS IN WAR PAINT (TABLEAUX)

	watching the parlay from a blown apart battery. Silent. 

	WIDE: FRENCH & ENGLISH

	and their honor guards. Montcalm steps forward and sweeps his plumed hat to the
	ground in a courtly bow. Munro bows coldly. 

					MONTCALM
			Colonel Munro, I have known you as a gallant 
			antagonist. I am happy to make your 
			acquaintance as a friend. 

					MUNRO
			And I to make yours, Monsieur le Marquis. 

					MONTCALM
			Please accept my compliments for the strong 
			and skillful defense of your fortress. Under 
			the command of a lesser man it would have 
			fallen long ago given the superior numbers and 
			material ... mere chance has allowed me to 
			array against you ... 

					MUNRO
			Monsieur le Marquis, I am a soldier, not a 
			diplomat. You called this parlay for a reason. 

					MONTCALM
			You have already done everything which is 
			necessary for the honor of your Prince. I 
			will forever bear testimony that your resistance 
			has been gallant and was continued as long as 
			there was hope. But now, I beg you to listen 
			to the admonitions of humanity. I beg you to 
			consider my terms for your surrender. 

					MUNRO
			However I may apprise such testimony from 
			Monsieur Montcalm, Fort William Henry is 
			strong and stands. 

					MONTCALM
			Honor that is freely accorded to courage, may 
			be refused obstinacy ... These hills afford to 
			us every opportunity to reconnoiter your 
			works and I am possibly as well acquainted 
			with your weak condition as you are yourselves. 

	Is Webb really en route and Montcalm hopes to take the fort by duplicity before British
	reinforcements arrive? 

					MUNRO
			Perhaps the General's glasses can reach to the 
			Hudson and he knows the size and imminence 
			of the army of Webb ...? 

	Montcalm takes a moment to reply and appears genuinely sympathetic to Munro. 

					MONTCALM
				(quietly)
			My scouts intercepted this dispatch intended 
			for you. 

	Munro is puzzled, suspicious. 

					MONTCALM
				(to Bougainville)
			Read the dispatch. 

	HEYWARD & MUNRO]

					BOUGAINVILLE 
				(O.S. - reading)
			"Colonel Munro - Fort William Henry. I have 
			no men available to send to your rescue. It is 
			impossible. I  advise you to seek terms for 
			surrender. Signed Webb." 

	Munro is rocked, as if struck by a blow. Bougainville hands Heyward the letter. 

					HEYWARD
				(confirming)
			This is the signature of Webb. 
				(to Munro)
			And I know the temper of our men. Rather 
			than spend the war in a French prison hulk 
			in Hudson Bay, they'd fight to the end. 

					MUNRO
				(to Montcalm)
			 You have heard your answer, Monsieur le 
			Marquis. 
				(salutes) 

	Munro starts off. Montcalm stops him. 

					MONTCALM
			Sir. 
				(challengingly)
			I am incapable of mistreating brave men. 
			I beg you not to sign the death warrant 
			of so many until you have listened to my 
			terms. 

	Munro turns. 

					MUNRO
			Such as ...? 

					MONTCALM
			My master requires the fort be destroyed. 
			But, for you and your comrades, there is 
			no privilege that will be denied. None of 
			your men will see the inside of a prison
			barge. They're free to go so long as they 
			return to England and fight no more on this
			continent, and the civilian militia return to 
			their farms. 

					MUNRO
			Their arms? 

					MONTCALM
			They may leave the fortress fully armed, but 
			with no ammunition ... Other than that, ask 
			what you wish. 

	Munro's impressed with Montcalm's generosity. 

					MUNRO
			The honors of war? 

					MONTCALM
			Granted. 

					MUNRO
			My colors? 

					MONTCALM
			Carry them to England to your King with pride. 

					MUNRO
			Allow me to consult with my officers. 

	As he turns away something's been disconnected inside Munro that can never get put
	back together. As the men move away from the French ... 

					MUNRO
			I have lived to see two things I never expected. 
			An Englishman afraid to support a friend. And 
			a Frenchman too honest to profit by that advantage. 

					HEYWARD
			General Webb can burn in hell. We'll go back 
			and dig our graves behind the ramparts! Our 
			mission is to fight. 

					MUNRO
				(flares)
			Death and honor are sometimes thought to be 
			the same. Today I have learned that they are not. 

	Munro looks at the fortress behind him. 

					HEYWARD
			Sir! 

					MUNRO
				(stops him with his eyes)
			The decision is final. 

	A beat. Then Munro turns toward Montcalm. Their eyes meet across the churned,
	scarred earth of the battlefield. 

					MUNRO
			I am deeply touched by such unusual and 
			unexpected generosity ... The fort is yours 
			under the condition that we be given until 
			dawn to bury our dead, prepare our men and 
			women for their march and turn our wounded 
			over to your surgeon. 

					MONTCALM
			Granted, Monsieur. 

	And Montcalm bows deeply and as he does so ... 

	CUT TO ...

	EXTERIOR FRENCH LINES - CLOAKED MAN - NIGHT

	passes away from the little city of tents in the direction of the beach and towards
	William Henry. He seems to head towards a vantage point from which to observe the
	fort. As he approaches a sentry: 

					SENTRY
			Qui vive? 

					MONTCALM
			France. 

					SENTRY
			Le mot d'ordre? 

					MONTCALM
			La victoire. 

					SENTRY
			C'est bien, vous vous promenez bien matin, 
			monsieur! 

					MONTCALM
			Il est necessaire d'etre vigilant, mon enfant. 

	The cloak parts. By the light of the moon the man's face is dimly perceived by us and
	the soldier as General Montcalm. The soldier snaps erect as Montcalm continues
	walking out beyond the line to a small stand of trees. 

	ANOTHER ANGLE: MONTCALM

	The moon is broken into pieces of light on the water and behind Montcalm; from the
	front of the stand of trees emerges a tall figure.

					MAGUA
			Is the hatchet buried between the English 
			and my French father? 

					MONTCALM
			Yes. 

					MAGUA
			Not a warrior has a scalp and the white men 
			become friends. 

					MONTCALM
			My master owns these lands and your father 
			has been ordered to drive off the English 
			squatters. They have consented to go. So 
			now he calls them enemies no longer. 

					MAGUA
			Magua took the hatchet to color it with blood. 
			It is still bright. Only when it is red, then it will 
			be buried. 

					MONTCALM
			But so many suns have set since Le Renard 
			struck the war post. Is he not tired? 

					MAGUA
			Where is that sun?! It has gone behind the hill. 
			It is dark and cold. It has set on his people, 
			they are fooled and kill all the animals and sell 
			all of their lands to enrich the European masters 
			who are always greedy for more than they need. 
				(threatening)
			And Le Subtil is the son of his tribe. There have 
			been many clouds and many mountains. But now
			he has come to lead his nation. 

					MONTCALM
			That Le Renard has the power to lead his people 
			into the light, I know well. 

	Magua grabs the hand of the French commander. Imperceptible surprise in Montcalm's
	eyes. Magua jams Montcalm's fingers to his chest. 

					MAGUA
			Does my father know that? 

	MAGUA'S CHEST

	A deep indentation and scar. 

					MONTCALM
			That's where a lead bullet has torn you. 

					MAGUA
			And this? 

	Magua turns his naked back to Montcalm and puts Montcalm's hand on his back ... 	deep ridges of a scar a half inch wide.] 

					MONTCALM
			My son has been sadly injured. Who did 
			this? 

					MAGUA
				(laughs; sardonic)
			Magua slept hard in the English wigwams. 
			And the sticks left their mark ... 
				(pause; for real)
			Magua's village and lodges were burnt. 
			Magua's children were killed by the English. 
			Magua was taken as a slave by the Mohawks 
			who fought for the Grey Hair. Magua's wife 
			believed he was dead and became the wife of 
			another. The Grey Hair was the father of all 
			this. 
				(pause)
			In time Magua became blood-brother to Mohawk 
			to become free. In his heart he always was Huron. 
			And his heart will be whole again on the day 
			when the Grey Hair and all his seed are dead! 

					MONTCALM
			My son Magua's pain is my pain. 

					MAGUA
			Does the chief of the Canadas believe the 
			English will keep the terms? 

					MONTCALM
			Munro would. But General Webb will not
			send their soldiers across the salt lake. 
			Having let them go, I fear I will only fight 
			the same men again when I move south.
				(pause; shrugs)
			And yet, I cannot break the terms of the 
			capitulation and sully the lilies of France ... 

	Long pause, wheels turn. Then: 

					MAGUA
			Many things my French father cannot do, 
			Magua can. 

	Montcalm reacts as if he hadn't thought of that. 

					MONTCALM
			As the English march away, our soldiers 
			and the Canadiens will be drawn to the 
			looting of the fort ... except for a small 
			guard ... 

	Magua abruptly leaves Montcalm. 

	CUT TO ...

	EXTERIOR WOODS - MAGUA - NIGHT

	walking back to the Huron camp. Reveal a Huron sub-chief has been in the woods,
	waiting for Magua. Now he joins him. They walk in silence. Then ...

					MAGUA
				(in Iroquois; re: Montcalm)
			I wonder at the blindness and pride of the 
			white man. He believes only he knows 
			how to speak falsely to make other men do 
			his bidding. 

	Magua exhales in derision. 

	CUT TO ...

	EXTERIOR FORT, MAIN GATE - MUNRO - DAY

	at the end of the column, rides out on his horse. Both sides of the gate are jammed with
	armed French troops standing at attention. The French colors and honor guard are just
	outside the gate along with Bougainville, Chevalier de Levis, both on horseback as 
	is - at the head - Montcalm. 

	CLOSER: MUNRO

	trots past his walking column out the gate. He does not look at the French. 

	MONTCALM

	salutes Munro and bows gravely from the saddle. 

	CLOSER: MUNRO

	salutes Montcalm.

					MUNRO
				(eyes forward)
			Monsieur, the fort is yours. 

	MID-COLUMN - ON HEYWARD

	marching with his 33rd Regiment of Foot well beyond the fort. The French troops have
	thinned out. Repressing shame, his backbone is rigid, his face is straight ahead. The
	33rd marches in perfect cadence to the drum. In the B.G. Munro on his horse passes
	Heyward as he rides towards the front of his column. Heyward does not look at him. 

	FRONT OF COLUMN - CORA WITH ALICE

	on the back of a mare. Alice, living through a wide-awake nightmare, is huddled under
	the arm of her sister. They ride behind the standard bearers. In the B.G. her father is
	seen approaching and takes his position at their side. Cora looks down the column,
	sheilding her eyes against the sun. We know who she's looking for ... Hawkeye. 

	CORA'S POV: THE COLUMN

	The 62nd and 42nd Highlanders including Heyward ... thirty to forty women and a
	number of children - for safety - in the middle, some frontiersmen, Ongewasgone and
	many Mohawk, walking wounded. The column is still snaking its way out of the fort.
	No Hawkeye. 

	CORA

	straining to see. 

	EXTERIOR FORT - PRISONERS

	being assembled, their hands shackled. Hawkeye is among twelve or thirteen. He stands
	erect, walking out of the gate. The French are starting to pour in to loot the interior.
	Hawkeye looks to his left about twenty paces in front of him and sees ... 

	UNCAS & CHINGACHGOOK

	on the other side of the column. Chingachgook cradles Killdeer as well as his own
	musket. They fall back to walk beside the prisoners on the other side of Hawkeye.
	Their eyes connect... We don't expect Hawkeye to stay shackled for the duration. 

	RANK AND FILE FRENCH

	A few insults. The British soldiers answer. Nobody breaks rank. It's just talk. 

	EXTERIOR ROAD - HAWKEYE

	His eyes sweep the column snaking its way into the v-shaped valley. The path cuts
	through the forested hills ahead. He sees ... 

	HAWKEYE'S DISTANT POV: CORA

	riding near the front where there are no more French soldiers. Only a few scattered and
	curious Huron and Ottawa. She does not see him. 

	PROFILE OF COLUMN - HIGH & WIDE

	as it passes left to right below like a long snake through the narrow valley. We're
	shooting from inside the dark woods. Lower, in the light, we see a scattering on both
	slopes of a couple of hundred Ottawa and Huron. They are in no order, are spread out
	and don't constitute a threat. They watch the column. 
	SLOWLY THE CAMERA ... slides across the shoulders and back of a large man
	wearing black plumes in his scalp-lock and other than a breechcloth is almost naked. He
	is heavily war-painted ... 

	FRONTAL - MAGUA

	and the left two-thirds of his face is painted red. The right third is painted black. Much
	silver is in his ears. His tomahawk is in his left hand. His cut-down musket in his right
	fist. Magua's attention is all focused to one point. 

	MAGUA'S LONG & TIGHT POV: MUNRO & CORA & ALICE

	at the head of the column. This is the focus of Magua's attention. 

	WIDE FRONTAL: COLUMN, STANDARD BEARERS & MUNROS

	Cora turns again to look for Hawkeye. 

	CLOSER: CORA

	doesn't see him, but something else has caught her eye. 

	YOUNG HURON

	running toward the column. Just one man. No musket. He's running and whooping like
	a dog charging from his master's front yard. Why? 

	CLOSER

	the Huron arrives at the column, his tomahawk swings into his hand and he brains a
	British trooper who falls dead. The single Huron never breaks stride. He simply runs off
	again ... 

	CORA

	horrified, holds Alice tighter. 

	MUNRO

	has seen it too. And now he sees ... 

	62ND REGIMENT OF FOOT

	fixing bayonets. A large sergeant unsheathes a two-handed claymore, facing the Hurons
	and other Indians ... 

	TROOPERS

	of the 33rd present arms. Did they violate the surrender by carrying ammunition? Locks
	are cocked. There's the answer. 

					MUNRO
			Steady! No one fires! 

	EXTERIOR FORESTED HILLSIDES - OTHER TRIBES

	are watching what happens. 

	HEYWARD

	scanning them. 

					HEYWARD
				(to Sergeant Major)
			Men are to stay in file, Sergeant Major! 

					SERGEANT MAJOR
			Yes sir! 

	Drums beat the cadence.

	TROOPERS

	step over the fallen soldier. Heads turn, they're on edge ... 

	END OF COLUMN - HAWKEYE, UNCAS & CHINGACHGOOK

	watching. They exchange looks. This is not good. Chingachgook cocks both Killdeer
	and his own musket. 

	HAWKEYE'S POV: FORESTED SLOPES

	Hold. We start to make out details in the shadow. Tree trunks. We become accustomed
	to the dimness. Now in the lower light we see deeper in the forest. 

	CLOSER

	Many Huron and Ottawa are hidden in the shadows. They're moving along parallel to
	the column, stalking it. Waiting ... 

	ANOTHER BRAVE

	racing down the hill from the opposite flank towards the 62nd. 

	TWO SOLDIERS

	look at their sergeant. He nods. They wait until he's within ten feet of the column. Both
	bayonet the Indian. He's dead. 

	EXTERIOR HILLSIDES - HURON & OTTAWA

	saw what happened. But, they hold their ranks. 

	MOHAWKS

	among the British are slipping tomahawks into their hands, surreptitiously. Some are
	cocking flintlocks. 

	MUNRO

	gallops his horse away from Cora and Alice towards the scene of the last attack. We
	hear him from the distance ordering ...

					MUNRO
			Do not break ranks! I want these ranks 
			to hold ...! 

	Cora's frightened.

	HAWKEYE'S

	frustrated. He saw Munro leave Cora. He knows events have a momentum and it's
	accelerating. 

	CHINGACHGOOK & UNCAS

	move next to the sergeant with the shackle keys who looks at them curiously as ... 

	WOMEN

	with children nervously search the threatening trees, hoping against hope these are
	isolated incidents. 

	HEYWARD

	draws his sword and is passing orders to his sergeant major, scanning the hills ... 

	EXTERIOR FORESTED SLOPE - MAGUA

	His eyes see Munro. 

	WIDER & LOWER: MAGUA

	raises his musket in his fist and emits a war whoop. WE NOW SEE ... hundreds have
	been stalking the column, hidden in the trees, maybe thousands. Then ... 

	WIDE: ALL HELL BREAKS LOOSE

	FIRE from the trees crescendos within seconds revealing a spontaneous and massive
	ambush of mostly Hurons. They appear from behind every tree and it turns to a ROAR
	of musket fire, war whoops and screams as ... 

	SOLDIERS & CIVILIANS

	dropping like flies and seemingly thousands of Hurons attack down both slopes. 

	HAWKEYE

	is being unshackled by Uncas. The sergeant is rising from the ground where
	Chingachgook knocked him. Chingachgook throws Hawkeye Killdeer and Hawkeye
	shrugs into his pouch and powder horn as he races with Uncas for the head of the
	column ... 

	EXTERIOR FORESTED SLOPE - MAGUA

	charging down the hill ... with his coterie of twenty Huron warriors, heading for the
	area in which he saw Munro. 

	CORA & ALICE

	at the head of the disintegrating column. Cora's holding Alice's head to her bosom,
	covering her ears as if to protect her from the sounds. 

	HEYWARD

	shouting orders. 

					SERGEANT MAJOR
			Right - about face! March! First rank present! 

					HEYWARD
			Fire! 

	REVERSE:

	The volley knocks down fifteen of a horde of attacking Hurons. 

					SERGEANT MAJOR
			Prime! Load! Second rank six paces forward! 
			Present! 

	Hurons are twenty yards away and closing.

					HEYWARD
			Fire! 

	As the line of muskets belch smoke and fire ... 

	WIDE: THE HILLS & PATH

	We're shooting into the "v" of the valley with Hurons and other tribes pouring down
	from both sides. (IMPORTANT: the combined musket fire of Hurons, English and
	Mohawks generates tremendous clouds of smoke which obscure action, close off
	views, isolate pockets of combat into surreal tableaux that we'll move in and out of.

	BRITISH TROOPERS

	using their useless muskets as clubs or with fixed bayonets - as the smoke and fog
	swirls among the men - fighting for their lives ... 

	MAGUA

	glides through the scenes, striking and hunting. Some of his coterie of braves near him.
	He sees ... 

	BLONDE WOMAN

	hugging the ground in fear. Magua throws her over. It's not Alice Munro. It's a woman
	protecting her baby. Magua walks on. One of the braves behind Magua raise his
	tomahawk. On his downswing ... 

	HAWKEYE

	running through surreal patches, thinks he glimpses Cora two hundred yards away. 

					HAWKEYE
			Cora! 

	Chingachgook, on Hawkeye's left, slams down two Hurons with his war club. 

	CORA & ALICE

	running through the chaos and murder and British troopers and Mohawks locked in
	struggle with Hurons. Cora's dress is torn. She holds Alice to her. There's a pistol in
	Cora's hand. 

	ONE HURON

	scalping a prone soldier, rips the trophy from his head, turns and faces us. 

	CORA

	shoots him in the face. 

	EXTREMELY CLOSE: ALICE

	and her eyes take it all in. And her affect starts to flatten. A blankness suffuses her
	expression and the girl withdraws from this reality into a deep dark cave inside her
	head. 

	HAWKEYE

	locked in combat. He tomahawks one Huron's arm with a slashing downstroke and
	comes right back into the face of the second with his backswing while his right hand
	fires Killdeer at ... 

	HURON

	six feet from Uncas and about to shoot him in the back. 

	HAWKEYE

	free for a moment, spins. He has no idea of direction any more. Everything is death in
	strange tableaux. Meanwhile: 

	MUNRO

	hollering

					MUNRO
			Cora! Alice! 

	He cuts down a Huron with his sword who is trying to leap at him from the right. An
	Osage warrior with red scalp-lock leaps on the back of Munro's horse, reaching over to
	stab down into Munro's neck. The old man's left hand grabs the warrior's knife hand in
	an iron grip. His right hand pulls his horse pistol and under his upraised arm fires
	backward, point blank, blowing the Osage off the back of his horse. 

	WIDER

	Just then Munro's mount is shot. His horse rears up, throws Munro and falls on him. 

	HEYWARD

	shouting orders over the deafening noise.

					HEYWARD
			Second rank fire! Six paces back! Prime! 
			Load! Third rank! Present! 

	A well-oiled, well-drilled fighting machine, but there are fewer of them. They're getting
	cut off. They close ranks automatically as a man drops. They're retreating in perfect
	order. 

	HURON WARRIOR

	about to strike a downwards blow is pushed aside by Magua. 

	CLOSER: MAGUA

	His eyes drop to what's in front of him. The field goes quiet. 

	OVER MAGUA'S SHOULDER: MUNRO

	his lower body is trapped under his dead horse. Magua leans in towards him. 

					MAGUA
			Grey Hair. I will cut your heart from your 
			living chest in front of your eyes. As you die, 
			know that I will put under the knife your 
			children and wipe your seed from this earth 
			forever ... 

	Magua pulls his knife and as he leans down towards Munro ... 

	MOHAWK & HURON

	spin and flail furiously at each other with tomahawks and knives. The Huron goes down
	and then the Mohawk is shot. The Huron who shot him is cut down by a Ranger with
	tomahawk in one hand and bayonet in the other. Two Mohawks and three Rangers
	fighting back to back. They become an island swamped by Huron and Ottawa: amidst
	bodies and ground slippery with blood. As smoke obscures their image. 

	CORA & ALICE

	in a group of civilian militia. Two of the militiamen are shot down. The third engages a
	Fox warrior. Cora & Alice run. 

	MUNRO'S FACE

	frozen in agony by shock. 

	MAGUA

	reaching down and up into something, emerges and jams an object we barely see into
	the air. But his arm and shoulder and half his chest are splashed red with blood. 

	LONG SHOT: MAGUA

	seen from far away, holding aloft the heart of Munro. 

	REVERSE: HAWKEYE

	saw him and fights his way to attack when ... 

	WHITE HORSE

	crazed, CRASHES through men, knocking Hawkeye over ... 

	CHINGACHGOOK

	protecting Hawkeye, slams his war club into one Huron, breaking his attack, his arm
	and his skull and swings the other way burying the bladed end into the chest of an
	Ottawa who's behind him. Then ... 

	HAWKEYE'S

	up, looking wildly ... 

	CAMERA JAMS INTO CLEARING SMOKE:

	33rd Regiment of Foot and Heyward. They FIRE into our face. 

	CLOSER: HEYWARD

					HEYWARD
			Six paces back! Prime! Load! Rank two, 
			present! Rank two, hold! 

	He grabs a partially loaded musket, the ramrod still in the barrel. They're taking fire.
	Men are dying. They're being pushed back. 

	AN ABNAKI

	wearing a large cross, attacks Heyward from the side. One-handed, Heyward fires the
	musket into the man's chest, sending the ramrod through him. Then Heyward's shot in
	the thigh and a thrown tomahawk hits him in the head and knocks him sideways.
	Dazed. Barely able to stand. He uses the musket as a cane and ...

					HEYWARD
			Rank two, six paces back! Rank one, 
			present! 

	Rank two did not retreat six paces. They stand in confusion. Heyward looks to see
	what's wrong. 

	HEYWARD'S POV: THE REMNANTS OF THE 33RD REGIMENT OF FOOT

	are standing in water. They're up against Lake George. Their backs are to the wall. Last
	stand. Heyward straightens. 

	TWO FRENCH OFFICERS

	on horseback try to intercede in the slaughter of five women. One French officer is shot
	by a Huron. The other French officer runs through that Huron and shoots the second.
	Then his horse is shot out from under him and he goes down ... 

	JESUIT

	pleads with an Abnaki to give up a child he's holding by the legs in one hand. He offers
	his cross. The Abnaki throws the baby to the Jesuit, Pere Roubaud. 

	UNCAS

	sees a flash of something yellow. So does Hawkeye. They charge into the swirling
	chaos of attacking bodies. As we lose sight of them ... 

	ALICE

	on her hands and knees. A massive Ottawa pulls her upright by her hair about to take
	her life and her scalp. He's struck by a rock in the hands of Cora which barely phases
	him. He bats her aside and returns to Alice, when suddenly ... 

	OTTAWA WARRIOR

	is spun, punched and tomahawked into the ground by Hawkeye. Uncas has Alice and
	Cora ... 

	TWO RANGERS AND A MOHAWK WARRIOR

	from the earlier group are nearby. They combine with Hawkeye to fight their way out
	 with bayonets and tomahawks. 

	HAWKEYE, UNCAS, CHINGACHGOOK, TWO RANGERS, A MOHAWK &
	MUNRO'S DAUGHTERS

	back through the swirling smoke. There seems to be a lull. Then they're hit from the
	side by musket fire. One of the Rangers is shot, the other wounded. Hurons attack. The
	Mohawk supports the wounded Ranger. 

	HAWKEYE

	shields Cora as they back up. 

	CHINGACHGOOK

	smashing his war club straight down on a Huron, reaches for the man's musket and
	shoots another. Then he sees ... 

	SMOKE DRIFTING OVER WATER

	It's glass-smooth. And the bows are barely visible of three or four Huron war canoes. 

	THE SHALLOWS - HAWKEYE, CHINGACHGOOK, UNCAS, CORA, ALICE,
	THE RANGER & THE MOHAWK

	back into the water. They're pursued by Ottawa and Hurons as they fight their way to
	the canoes. 

	CORA

	held up by Hawkeye, suddenly screams. 

	ANGLE

	something underwater is pulling her down. An Ottawa brave rockets out of the
	shallows. Before he's erect, Hawkeye slams him back into the water and FIRES. 

	WOUNDED RANGER

	has shoved a large birch canoe at them. 

	HAWKEYE

	Suddenly, the Mohawk fighting with them is shot and spins to face Hawkeye. His hands
	rest on Hawkeye's shoulders. Hawkeye looks into his face. Tries to hold him up, tries
	to rescue him. A frozen moment. Hawkeye's staring into his eyes and the man is staring
	into Hawkeye's as the light goes out ... Hawkeye lets him slide into the water and float
	away. He moves Cora and Alice towards the canoe ... 

	CUT TO ...

	EXTERIOR LAKE GEORGE - WATER & SWIRLING SMOKE - DAY

	The bottom of the frame is water like glass. Smoke obscures the background. Fingers
	tendril towards us. Out of the mist we HEAR small splashing and then the high bow of
	a war canoe defines itself. It's paddled towards us. 

	HAWKEYE, CHINGACHGOOK & UNCAS

	Cora's behind Hawkeye. Alice and the wounded Ranger are near Uncas. 

	CLOSER: HAWKEYE & CORA

	Cora looks left. Her eyes go wide. 

					CORA
			No! 

	HAWKEYE

	spins. 

	HEYWARD & TWO TROOPERS OF THE 33RD IN A SECOND CANOE

	have emerged from the smoke ten feet from them. Heyward's aiming a horse pistol at
	Hawkeye. 

	HAWKEYE

	is non-plussed. He doesn't stop paddling. 

					HAWKEYE
			You got nothin' better to do today on 
			Lake George than shoot me, Major,
			then go ahead ... 

	Heyward's a hair's breadth from firing. Suddenly they hear the boom of muskets and
	rounds come in. 

	WIDE

	They're being pursued by three boatloads - and then a fourth and fifth - of Huron. 

	HEYWARD

	is indifferent to Huron musket balls. Hawkeye hasn't stopped paddling and pays
	Heyward no heed.

					CORA
			Stop it!! 

	Heyward comes to his senses. His head is gashed. A scarf, as a tourniquet, is tied
	around his leg. He lowers the gun. 

					HEYWARD
			When you fall into British hands again, 
			Nathaniel Poe, I will have you hanged. 

	HURON CANOES

	paddle hard and deep and the canoes power across the lake. 

	HAWKEYE & HEYWARD'S CANOES

	with less paddlers, plus wounded, are slower and will be overtaken. 

	HAWKEYE

	looks to Uncas. They both realize the same thing. Hawkeye nods and he, Uncas &
	Chingachgook begin to paddle furiously. The others match the doubled pace. They're
	sprinting ahead but the effort is exhausting. 

	HURON CANOES

	maintain their steady pace. Three or four Hurons fire. 

	HAWKEYE'S CANOE

	Musket balls ricochet on the water's surface. One rips a hole through the bow.
	Hawkeye sees one of the Redcoats in Heyward's canoe is giving out ... 

					REDCOAT #1
			Can't ... keep it up ... 

					HAWKEYE
			Pull! 

	He renews the attack on the water with the paddle.

					HEYWARD
				(shouts)
			How long? 

					HAWKEYE
				(shouts)
			Only chance we got is ... 
				(breathless)
			 ... to get more distance on 'em and go 
			to ground! 

	Heyward digs in. Like firecrackers in the distance, Huron muskets sound. A new hail
	of musket balls cut the fabric of the canoes. One Redcoat is shot in the back. He falls
	overboard.

					HAWKEYE
				(shouts)
			Pull!!

	HAWKEYE CANOE

	sprints forward. 

	CLOSE: HAWKEYE

	looks over his shoulder. 

	THE HURON CANOES

	They're pulling away from them.

					HAWKEYE
			Pull ...! 

	More Huron musket balls hit water nearby. 

	REDCOAT

	in Heyward's boat is shot. BUT ... the .65 caliber ball didn't penetrate his skin. The
	Redcoat - amazed - picks it off the floor of the canoe. 

					REDCOAT #2
			Spent. 

	Distance caught up with eighteenth century ballistics. They're out of smoothbore
	musket range. 

	HAWKEYE CANOE]

					HAWKEYE
				(to Heyward)
			Head for ... for the white water. 

					HEYWARD
			Do you hear me, sir! 
				(exhausted)
			If you ever fall ... into British hands ...
				(breathes)
			What white water? 

	HEYWARD & REDCOAT'S POV: LAKE

	divided by a spit of land. The right fork becomes a river with white water rapids. 

	HAWKEYE CANOE - HAWKEYE

	paddling now, too, as they furiously jam for the white water that will shoot them way
	ahead of the Hurons. 

	UNCAS

	leaps off the stern of Hawkeye's canoe and climbs up the stern of Heyward's and takes
	control. He roughly gestures to the Redcoat and the Major to stop paddling. He and
	Hawkeye will pilot the two canoes. 

	EXTERIOR WHITE WATER - WIDE - DAY

	The canoes enter the white water and they're so light, they're jet-propelled. 

	CANOE POV: EIGHT FOOT WAVE

	racing in the same direction they are. They hit it straight on and it shoots over them and
	they're drenched by two waves coming from the sides. 

	HAWKEYE & CHINGACHGOOK

	paddle like fiends to get momentum and control. 

	UNCAS' CANOE

	Same thing. When they crested the wave Uncas hollers at them to "pull" and they do.
	As soon as they're through it, Uncas slams the paddle in the water and makes the canoe
	revolve a hundred and eighty degrees in a vortex so that now it's going through 
	stern-first or the stern becomes the bow, so that Uncas could pilot it a different way
	through a hazard of ... 

	EXPOSED ROCKS

	jutting out of the water. 

	WIDE - BOTH CANOES

	Hawkeye didn't have to turn because Chingachgook, at the bow, uses his paddle to
	shove the canoe away from jutting rocks. Uncas does the same. Past the jutting rocks,
	Uncas swings it back around while ... 

	WHITE WATER

	smashes into the camera. 

	ALICE & CORA

	as the canoe roller-coasters and water bursts the bow. Then suddenly it's through and
	the water is miraculously smooth. 

	CANOES

	The Ranger, the Redcoats and even Heyward feel the exhilaration of the ride. That's
	because they think they're home free.

					HAWKEYE
			Here's where it gets tricky ... 

	Heyward turns to look in front of him. He doesn't know what the hell Hawkeye's
	talking about. 

	HEYWARD'S POV: THE RIVER AHEAD

	looks glass-smoth. Although there is a distant ROAR of sorts. Then Heyward realizes:
	something's wrong with this picture. 

	CLOSER: HEYWARD

	The look on his face starts to change. 

	HEYWARD'S POV: TIGHTER

	The glass surface of the river continues to a line then falls off the end of the world. The
	river just ends ... 

	BOTH CANOES: HEYWARD, REDCOATS, THE RANGER

	realize they're heading for the lip of a waterfall. There's a couple of outcroppings of
	rock in the center at the very edge. We are at Glen Falls.

					HAWKEYE
			Don't move ... 

	AERIAL SHOT

	from the other side of the falls. It's a two hundred foot high, death-defying cataract.
	The canoes - slightly above us - will go right over. 

	TWO CANOES

	At the last moment, Hawkeye & Uncas land both on either side of the larger rock
	outcropping. It is literally at the lip of the falls. 

	HEYWARD

	grabs a rock to anchor the bow of the canoe. He loses his grip. The canoe rockets for
	the edge. 

	UNCAS

	lurches sideways, grabs a tree root. He is the only link of the canoe to earth. The bow,
	with Heyward, is literally hanging over the edge. Uncas strains and pulls the canoe to
	the rock. He gestures to Heyward. 

	HEYWARD

	crawls forward and makes the island. Then the two Redcoats. Finally Uncas. The canoe
	rockets over the falls. Meanwhile ... 

	THE OTHER SIDE OF THE ISLAND

	Hawkeye has beached his canoe and is camouflaging it with driftwood and brush. As
	they clamber over the high pieces of broken limestone, we see Hawkeye is slipping into
	a crevice. He motions to Cora. Uncas carries the wounded Ranger. Heyward helps
	Alice ... 

	CUT TO ...

	INTERIOR GLEN FALLS CAVES - FISSURE - TWILIGHT

	The irregular opening of medium blue sky is obscured by the black silhouetted forms of
	Hawkeye, Cora and then the others entering.

					HEYWARD
			Where do we go from here? 

					HAWKEYE
			We don't. 

					HEYWARD
			I don't understand! 

					HAWKEYE
			This is it, as far as we can go ... If we're 
			lucky, they'll be figurin' we can't have 
			come this way and must've beached our 
			canoes and headed cross land. If we're 
			very lucky, they'll figure we went over 
			the falls. 

					HEYWARD
			Then what? 

					HAWKEYE
			Then we take the south rim down the 
			mountain and it's 12 miles cross country 
			to Fort Edward. 

					HEYWARD
			And if we're unlucky? 

					HAWKEYE
			You will have to forego the pleasure of 
			hangin' me. 

	REVERSE: WIDE

	Hawkeye helps Cora; Heyward, the Ranger. Chingachgook carries Alice, down the
	rockface into a cave. We hear a distant ROAR reverberating off the walls. 

	ANOTHER ANGLE: THE WALLS

	are scooped out, bone-like hollows eroded by tumbling water. At an earlier time the
	formation was part of the falls. 

	HAWKEYE & CORA

	reach the irregular floor of the chamber. The ROAR is louder. 

	WIDEN TO REVEAL

	a curtain of falling water. They're behind the cataract, probably a third of the way down
	its height. Light through the water stikes them with a silver luminescence. They're
	exhausted. The others join them. They almost have to shout to be heard. 

	CHINGACHGOOK

	followed by Uncas, takes stock of their supplies. They check their powder. They have
	almost none. Uncas shares his with Hawkeye. The Redcoat's cartridge case is soaked,
	the paper cartridges a soggy mess. Heyward has none. The Ranger has two left. In
	Mohican, Chingachgook decides some things. Hawkeye and Uncas nod. Heyward
	approaches Hawkeye.

					HEYWARD
			Any powder? 

					HAWKEYE:
				(crossing to Cora)
			Only one or two loads. 

	CORA

	is soaked to the bones. Hawkeye strips off his buckskin hunting shirt and wrings it out.
	Cora turns her back, strips off her white blouse and puts on the faster-drying chamois. 

					CORA
			Are we safe? 

					HAWKEYE
			Maybe ... 

					CORA
			Our father? Did you see my father? 

	EXTREME CLOSE UP: HAWKEYE

	The look on his face tells it all 

					CORA
			Tell me! 

	TWO SHOT

	Hawkeye takes Cora away from the group and turns her by her shoulders and whispers
	to her. We don't hear what he says. Cora drops to her knees and places her hands over
	her eyes and face like a little girl trying to make something bad go away. 

	HAWKEYE

	Leads her to a depression, his arm around her shoulders, her face covered and she cries
	softly into his shoulder. 

	EXTREME CLOSE UP: CORA

	says into Hawkeye's ear, after she looks O.S. ...

					CORA
			Say nothing to Alice ...! 

	Hawkeye nods.

	ALICE

	stands in the chamber not far from the wall of water, fascinated with its shimmer. She's
	oblivious to all the events and everything going on around her ... 

	HEYWARD

	sees Cora & Hawkeye together and turns away. 

	GROUP

	Uncas watches Alice. The wounded Ranger has fallen asleep. The Redcoat is
	exhausted. Hawkeye & Cora against the wall. 

	CUT TO ... 

	EXTERIOR RIVER BANK - RIVER FALLS ARE IN MIST & RED SKY -
	TWILIGHT

	A landscape with mist rearlit by the red light of the sun that's already behind the
	mountains. The blues are turning purple and the greens are turning black and the white
	highlights of the foaming water are going rose. Reflecting the darkening sky, where the
	surface isn't broken, the water is fast-moving metal ... SUDDENLY: a shaved head and
	muscled back stands into the foreground. It moves down the shore away from camera.
	He's followed by other Huron warriors. They're two hundred yards away from Glen
	Falls island. 

	HURON

	looks at the island of rock & trees and tilts his head curiously ... 

	CUT TO ... 

	EXTERIOR FOREST ABOVE CANYON & FALLS - GREY WOLF - TWILIGHT

	watches the Hurons below make their way towards the edge of the falls. 

	OVER HIS SHOULDER: THREE MORE WOLVES

	join him, moving frenetically, uneasily ... The leader of the pack looks up & howls as
	his eyes go white reflecting the new moon. 

	INTERIOR GLEN FALLS CAVE - HAWKEYE -NIGHT

	hears the distant howl. He's now lit silver blue by the moonlight through the falling
	water. Hawkeye knows it means Hurons are out there. He exchanges worried glances
	with Uncas & Chingachgook. 

	UNCAS

	immediately starts up the right acclivity to one fissure, and Chingachgook moves
	carefully to the first fissure. Hawkeye follows. 

	HAWKEYE

	His countenance gives way momentarily. All his experience seems of no avail. He
	touches the side of Cora's face. Grabs Killdeer and follows Chingachgook. 

	ALICE

	sensing new danger, slips away on her own. 

	CORA

	crosses to the Ranger who's semi-conscious, feverish and getting delirious. She can't do
	a thing except hold his hand and think of her father. 

	CUT TO ... 

	INTERIOR SOUTH FISSURE - HAWKEYE & CHINGACHGOOK

	below the edge, listen & wait, testing the environment with all their senses ... 

	NORTH FISSURE - UNCAS

	against one wall, has his ear cocked, monitoring, facing away from the sky ... 

	ALICE

	looks at the sky through the fissure. She sees the starfields and feels silver moonlight
	pull her forward. She starts out onto the island, oblivious, unaware she'll expose them.
	Suddenly ... 

	UNCAS

	yanks her down next to him. He pulls her head into his chest, looking out over the
	edge, his tomahawk in front of him, his musket near his right hand. There is no sign she
	was seen. 

	UNCAS & ALICE

	He relaxes, looks at her and puts his finger to his lips telling her to be silent.
	Languorously, she lies back, closes her eyes and lays a hand on his shoulder, palm up,
	as if he were a prince in a romantic fantasy. Uncas tries to restrain her. 

	ALICE'S

	eyes slowly open. Oblivion disappears. It's replaced with escalating fear. She holds onto
	Uncas with desperation. Her fingers claw his shoulders. She buries her face in his
	chest. 

					ALICE
			Uncas ... 

	Her body shudders. Her terror's total. He tries to restrain and calm her. She won't let
	him. Then her mouth seeks his and in the passion of despair and fear and wanting life,
	she holds him between her thighs. And Uncas is confused, but Alice whispers his name
	and he responds. He loves her in the half-light. 

	UNCAS

	his hand buried in her hair irradiated by the moon, then she seems to reach some
	emotional climax and begins to cry softly, and Uncas stops making love to her and
	holds her. Then she's flooded with shame. He reaches for her. She jerks away. He
	reaches for her again and clutches her to him. And she breaks down. Then he turns her
	face to him, but her expression has completely flattened. 

	WIDER ANGLE

	She's not a lover to Uncas now. She's pitiful & stricken and he comforts her. 

	CUT TO ... 

	EXTERIOR RIVER - MAGUA - NIGHT

	beaches a canoe on the bank. He and eight braves ease out. His war paint is fresh:
	green handprints on his chest and black and green on his face. Black plumes are affixed
	to his scalp-lock and his shawl is over his left shoulder. The right arm carrying his
	musket is exposed. Many scalps are tied to his tomahawk. He walks towards us
	approaching the island, two hundred yards away ... 

	CUT TO ... 

	INTERIOR SOUTH FISSURE - HAWKEYE - NIGHT

	checks his powder horn. Nearly empty. He looks at Chingachgook. 

	CUT TO ... 

	INTERIOR GLEN FALLS ISLAND, CAVE - CORA - NIGHT

	with the Ranger, looks up. Hawkeye enters. The look on his face. Then hers. They've
	been discovered. Now they're backed into a hole in the ground with no powder and no
	way out.

	CUT TO ... 

	INTERIOR GLEN FALLS, CAVE - HAWKEYE & CHINGACHGOOK - NIGHT

	Chingachgook talks to him in Mohican. Momentarily the anger and frustration is seen
	on Hawkeye's face. All his experience & craft has been to no avail. He looks at Cora.
	Back to Chingachgook. Chingachgook states something terse in Mohican. Hawkeye
	agrees. Heyward's confused. He doesn't know what they're talking about. Cora has
	understood Chingachgook's intent perfectly.

					CORA
			Yes. Go ahead. 

					HEYWARD
				(explodes)
			What the bloody hell plan is this? 

					HAWKEYE
				(to Cora)
			In this there is a chance. If I live, I can 
			try to free you. If we don't go, there is 
			no powder, there's too many of them. 
			Though my heart would keep me here, 
			in that there is no chance. None. I can do 
			nothing. Do you understand? 

					CORA
			Yes. I want you to go. 

					HEYWARD
			Coward! Coward back at the fort. 
			Coward here. 

	Hawkeye uses discipline not to kill the man. 

					CORA
			You try. With all you have. To save 
			yourself. If the worst happens, and 
			only one of us survives, something of 
			the other does, too ... 

	CUT TO ... 

	INTERIOR NORTH FISSURE - UNCAS - NIGHT

	Listens. Hears. Then he inches above cover to see ... 

	UNCAS' POV: THE RIVER & SIX WAR CANOES

	of Hurons approach to assault the island carrying torches. 

	CUT TO ... 

	INTERIOR GLEN FALLS CAVE - CORA & HAWKEYE - NIGHT

	She's holding him. In the rigid language of her body is the struggle to contain her fear. 

					HAWKEYE
				(very close)
			 If they don't kill you, they may take you 
			north up into Canada. A warrior may take 
			you for a wife. 

	CORA

	turns aside. Hawkeye insists. 

					HAWKEYE
				(continues)
			Listen. Submit. You hear me? You're 
			strong. You stay alive. I will find you ... 
			no matter how far, how long it takes ... 

					CORA
				(nods, low)
			 ... never doubt what you are doing. 

	RANGER

	conscious now, arranges his crushed body to face the direction from which will come
	the attack as ... 

	HEYWARD

	puts Alice, who's entered, behind him as ... Uncas hits the floor of the cave. Now the
	first glow from Huron torches starts to light the walls. They're coming ... 

	CHINGACHGOOK

	has their weapons slung over his back. He says something in Mohican. Uncas spins
	looks at Alice: her expression's vacant. 

	HAWKEYE'S KNIFE

	cuts a lock of Cora's hair. He folds it into his shirt. The orange light from Huron
	torches, now closer, plays on the wall behind her. We hear many Huron approach. 

	CHINGACHGOOK & UNCAS

	now run out of the cave and throw themselves into the curtain of water. This is their
	exit. 

	HAWKEYE

	engraves her image in his memory one last time and then sprints across the floor
	towards the water ... 

	WHAT HAWKEYE SEES: JAMMING AT THE WATERFALL

	and then through it into ... 

	SUBJECTIVE CAMERA: UP

	An awful crushing roar. We explode out the front of a white cataract a third of the way
	from the top and we fall down away from the world. 

	EXTERIOR GLEN FALLS - HAWKEYE - NIGHT

	tumbles down the falls; rolling, tumbling through the white water; then through air;
	then back into cascading white water again, disappearing ... 

	THE RIVER BELOW - UNCAS & CHINGACHGOOK'S

	bodies hit, disappear and don't surface. It looks unsurviveable. 

	HAWKEYE'S POV: FALLING

	Sheets of water fall with us. The bottom races towards us at a hundred miles an hour ...
	Just before we hit ... 

	CUT TO ... 

	INTERIOR GLEN FALLS, CAVE - FLAMING TORCH - NIGHT

	WIDEN. The cave is filled with Hurons. The Redcoat is dead in the corner. A group of
	braves moves away from the body of the Ranger. 

	HEYWARD'S

	surrounded. The women are behind him. He slashes at one Huron with his sword and is
	clubbed down by a giant. 

	MAGUA

	enters. His blanket, like a shawl, over his left shoulder, black plumes in his hair. He's
	imperturbable. 

	MAGUA'S HAND

	reaches out and touches Cora's hair. Cora is frozen to the spot. His hand drops away
	from the hated Munros and as Magua turns to go, he says something low in Huron and
	the two women are jerked towards the fissures. Heyward is dragged by the arms. 

	CUT TO ... 

	EXTERIOR RIVER - WHITE WATER - NIGHT

	miles from the falls. We see a figure. It's Chingachgook, nearly spent, rolling and
	tumbling through the fast-moving white water. He submerges, then surfaces again. He
	appears exhausted by the fall and ride. 

	CHINGACHGOOK'S POV: WATER

	rocketing at us, battering and drowning us. We glimpse something downstream ... 

	CHINGACHGOOK

	tries to focus, slammed against rocks, he's striking out towards the right, swimming
	against the current. He's grabbing for something. 

	KILLDEER'S MUZZLE

	and leather shoulder-strap. Chingachgook's hand grabs it. The current rushing past tries
	to steal him from Uncas and Hawkeye, who're also beaten, bloodied, exhausted. They
	pull the older, larger man from the water and ... 

	ON THE ROCK

	all three lie there, almost devoid of energy. Then Hawkeye rises, looks at the others.
	Chingachgook nods. He's up. Then Uncas, and they're moving off into the calm eddy
	between the rock they landed on and the shoreline. 

	CUT TO ...

	EXTERIOR FOREST - HURONS - DAY

	move along animal paths. 

	CORA & ALICE

	struggle through the branches of trees. No one helps them. When they fall behind, they
	are pushed forward. 

	HEYWARD

	badly beaten, bound, staggers ahead to get behind Maqua. Then:

					HEYWARD
			If Magua give women to Yengeese soldiers 
			... will receive many gifts. 

					MAGUA
				(as if considering)
			Gifts? 

					HEYWARD
			Three, four oxen ... much wampum. 

					MAGUA
			Wampum? 

					HEYWARD
			Yes. 

					MAGUA
			Does Yengeese Major have property 
			across salt sea? 

					HEYWARD
			Yes. 

					MAGUA
			Yengeese Major give all property to Magua. 
			Magua give Yengeese Major much wampum, 
			many gifts, maybe three, four oxen. 

	Magua looks at Heyward derisively. Does this white man think he's an idiot?

					HEYWARD
			Gold could be arranged. 

					MAGUA
			For Munro children? 

					HEYWARD
			Yes. 

					MAGUA
			How much gold has the master of the 
			Yengeese? 

					HEYWARD
			The King? The King has mountains of 
			gold! 

	Long pause as if Magua and King George II were seriously considering this 	transaction.

					MAGUA
			Not enough. 

	Heyward is first realizing with whom he's playing.

					HEYWARD
			What is enough? 

					MAGUA
			Heart. Give Magua new heart. 

	Magua totally disdains the Englishman and walks away from him, starting up a steeper
	forested hill. 

	CUT TO ...

	EXTERIOR FOREST - HAWKEYE, UNCAS & CHINGACHGOOK - TWILIGHT

	running cross-country after the Huron column. They leap over fallen logs and keep
	going. 

	FRONTAL: HAWKEYE

	breathing hard, his lips are drawn back, sweat stains his buckskins. 

	PROFILE: UNCAS

	runs. Then sees something.

	tied to her neck. 

	MAGUA

	HURONS

	move quickly down into a ravine. 

	HEYWARD

	is shoved forward. 

	CUT TO ...

	EXTERIOR FOREST - RUNNING FEET - DAY

	Long, loping strides. 

	HAWKEYE & UNCAS

	cover ground like long-distance runners. No noise except their hard, even breathing.
	They're moving down a clear trail. 

	CHINGACHGOOK

	out on the flank. Running hard. 

	CLOSER: HAWKEYE

	lips are drawn back, determined, flashing through the hard verticals of the forest, now
	leaps down an embankment into the soft loam and keeps going. 

	CUT TO ...

	EXT. HURON VILLAGE - ORNATE CHAIR - DAY

	on a rude platform. The entire village is crowded in a large circle. They all wait for
	someone. They've been waiting a long time. In the perimeter warriors keep Huron at
	bay for some reason. We see Magua. He stands apart. They wait. Then ... 

	ANCIENT SACHEM

	is led to the dais by three women down the main street between the neat rows of birch
	bark lodges. Many scalps and trophies from the massacre are in evidence. He sits on the
	raised platform. He looks to be in his nineties. His dark wrinkled face is contrasted by
	his long white hair. His robe is painted in hieroglyphical representation of combat. He
	wears numerous silver & gold medals, gifts of French, English and Dutch governors.
	Most startling is his face. His dark & lined skin is enhanced by delicate lines of
	tatooing. He looks up to Magua. 

					SACHEM
				(in Huron; subtitled)
			The tomahawks of your young men have 
			been very red. 

					MAGUA
				(in Huron; subtitled)
			Many of the Yengeese are dead, great 
			Sachem. 
				(sound dissolve to English)
			I have brought three of my prisoners, 
			to honor you. Two are the children
			of Munro. Whose scalp hangs on my 
			lodge pole. And whose heart I cut from 
			his chest. 

	Now we see Cora on the ground. Defeat & fear are held in place by her determination.
	Alice looks around, in another place. Heyward's hands are bound between his back with
	a piece of wood wedged through his elbows.

	WIDE OVER THEIR SHOULDERS: THE HURON "CASTLE"

	seen in the distance through the sparse trees. They have dropped at the very periphery
	of the forest where the woods end. (The lay of the land is important for action that
	follows: the village is built in a meadow. To the left is a cliff face that rises to a rocky
	promontory. On the right is a path that winds up to the promontory and beyond, across
	the mountains.)
	Hawkeye sees ... 

	HAWKEYE'S POV: THE VILLAGE, CAPTIVES & HURON CROWD

	in the center, outside the largest lodge. 

	HAWKEYE

	slams the earth with his fists. They didn't intercept them in time. Difficult odds just
	became impossible. 

	CUT TO ... 

	EXTERIOR HURON VILLAGE - MAGUA - DAY

					MAGUA
			... the earth was pale. Our tomahawks 
			were bright. Now they are dull from war. 
			And the Huron rich with the trophies of 
			honor ... Magua will sell the English 
			officer to Les Francais and the reward is 
			my gift to you, wise one ... The women - 
			children of the white war chief - will burn 
			in our fires so all can share in this. 

	The sachem considers this. Then he looks up and sees something beyond Magua. 

	MAGUA

	senses the sachem's eye line ... 

	HAWKEYE

	unarmed, walking through the Hurons. A young boy rushes at him. Hawkeye, at the
	last possible second, dodges. Others catch and restrain the boy. The Hurons are
	astounded a European would simply walk into their camp. 

	CORA

	sees him enter, doesn't believe he's there. 

					CORA
			Nathaniel! 

	Hawkeye glances at her, doesn't respond. The situation is a stick of dynamite ready to
	go off.
					HAWKEYE
				(to Heyward; low)
			Translate for me, Major. Into French. 
			Every word ... as I say it. 

	Magua starts towards Hawkeye, his tomahawk slipping into his hand.

					HAWKEYE
				(to Sachem)
			I come to you unarmed and in peace to 
			unstop your ears, wise one. Because the 
			Hurons are mislead by the words of the 
			wolf who's never spoken the truth.

	Sachem gestures with his hand to Magua. Magua reluctantly stops advancing on
	Hawkeye. Heyward's French translation has faded to a murmur. We hear Hawkeye's
	English.

					HAWKEYE
			Let the children of the dead Colonel Munro 
			go free and take the fire out of the English 
			anger over the murder of their helpless ones. 

					MAGUA
				(to Sachem)
			Our father, Montcalm, is greater than the 
			Yengeese in the arts of war. The Huron 
			do not fear English anger. 

					HAWKEYE
				(to Sachem)
			Wise one, the French fathers made peace 
			and swore to their honor not to break the 
			friendship. Magua broke it. It is false that 
			the French would not be friends, still, to 
			the Huron. 

	Sachem reacts.

					MAGUA
				(laughs)
			It made our French father happy to never 
			have to fight the same Yengeese again. 
			He told me this without telling me this. 

	Hawkeye realizes this is true.

					HAWKEYE
			So the Huron are the servants of the French? 
			To do what the French are shamed to do? 

					MAGUA
			No. 
				(to Sachem)
			Huron serve no one. The French father 
			believes he fooled Magua because he is so 
			proud of his cleverness, he is blind. But it 
			is the Huron path that Magua walks down, 
			not the French one ... Now, Les Francais, 
			also, fear Huron. That is good. When the 
			Huron is strong from their fear, we will make 
			the terms of trade with Les Francais. And we 
			will trade as the white man trades. Take land 
			from the Abnakes; fur from the Osage, Sauk 
			& Fox. And make the Huron great. Over 
			other tribes. No less than the whites, as strong 
			as the whites. 

	Hawkeye appears to be losing his debate with Magua.

					HAWKEYE
				(to Sachem)
			Magua would use the ways of Les Francais 
			and the Yengeese ... 

					MAGUA
				(to Sachem)
			The red man put down the bow, picked up 
			the fire stick and became the best warrior 
			in the forest. Yes. It is the only way. 

					HAWKEYE
			Would the Huron make his Algonquin brothers 
			foolish with brandy and steal his lands to sell 
			them for gold to the white man? Would the 
			Huron have greed for more land than a man 
			can use? Like Francais Black Robes do? 
			Would Huron kill tribes with disease? Would 
			the Huron fool Seneca into taking all the 
			animals in the forest for beads & brandy? But 
			sell the fur to the white man for gold? ... 
				(to Sachem)
			 Those are the ways of Yengeese and Les 
			Francais masters. Are they the ways of Huron 
			men who hunt & work the land? Or of dogs? 
			... Magua's heart is twisted. He would make 
			himself into what twisted him. A Dog, become 
			Master of Dogs. But are Hurons dogs? 
			... Magua's way is false. It is like the white 
			sickness. Magua's way will bring only sadness 
			and shame. Is there another way? I don't know. 
				(pauses)
			I am Nathaniel of the Yengeese; Hawkeye, 
			adopted son of Chingachgook, of the Mohican 
			people ... Let the children of the dead Munro go 
			free ... I speak the truth. 

	Magua starts to rebut. Sachem holds up his hand and stops him. Nobody talks. Sachem
	whispers to the older men on either side of him. 

	MAGUA

	waits for the decision. 

	CORA

	looks to Alice, then to Hawkeye. 

	HAWKEYE

	exchanges a desperate look with Cora and then senses the Sachem is staring at him
	from the perspective of nearly a century of laws & judgments. Then ... to every word. 

					SACHEM
			The white man comes like a day that has 
			passed. And night enters our future with 
			him ... 
				(pause)
			Our council talks since I was a boy: 
			What is the Huron to do? 
				(pause)
			But Magua would lead Huron down paths 
			that make us not Hurons. 
				(the judgment)
			Dark girl burn in fire to heal the twisted 
			heart of Magua. 

	Cora, hearing the sentence ... Hawkeye's losing her.

					SACHEM
				(continuing)
			Munro daughter with moon in her hair 
			must be Magua's wife so Munro's seed 
			doesn't die. 

	Alice is gone, living in some dark recess of her mind.

					SACHEM
				(continuing; dissolves 
				back to French)
			 ... and Yengeese officer not go to Les
			Francais, but back to Yengeese so their 
			hatred burns less bright. La Longue Carabine, 
			go in peace. 

	People move, start to implement the sentence. Hawkeye's panicked. Cora is jerked
	upright. She looks at Hawkeye in terror: Sachem is starting to depart.

					HAWKEYE
			No! listen. 
				(to Heyward)
			Tell him I'll trade him! Me for her! Tell him!! 

	Heyward translates into rapid-fire French. 

					HAWKEYE
				(shouts)
			I am La Longue Carabine! My death is a 
			great honor to the Huron. Take me! 

	Cora is jerked forward by three Hurons. Magua grabs Alice. Cora strikes at Magua. He
	knocks her aside. Chaos & confusion. Meanwhile: 

					MAGUA
				(French; subtitled)
			This is not the voice of wisdom. I go to 
			the Hurons of the Lakes! You are women. 
			Send your arrows and guns to the Seneca, 
			beg from them venison to eat, corn to grind. 
			Slaves, dogs, rabbits, thieves ... I spit on you! 

	Those Hurons who hear, do so in deadly, boding silence. Magua and his fourteen hard
	core braves start out as ... 

	SACHEM

	heard Heyward's translation. He looks at Heyward, then looks at Hawkeye and he nods
	his head. 

	HAWKEYE

	sees this. His eyes go to Cora. They've stopped dragging her towards the fire pit.
	Hawkeye steps forward to surrender. Cora is thrown at him. Cora looks around wildly.
	Instead of taking Hawkeye, two warriors grab Heyward. 

	HEYWARD

	is immediately hamstrung and his legs collapse. He gasps. He's caught under the arms
	and dragged forward.

					HAWKEYE
			I said to trade me! 

	Hawkeye's holding Cora. Heyward struggles to be seen.

					HEYWARD
			... compliments, Mr. Poe. 
				(pause)
			Take her and get out. 

					CORA
				(standing)
			What are they doing to Duncan? 
			Duncan! 

	He's gone. They start to ease away from the mass of Hurons.

					HAWKEYE 
				(low to himself)
			And my compliments to you ... 

					CORA
			Alice? 

	Hawkeye's concentration is on backing out of the Huron mob. Will the Sachem's
	judgment be honored? Will some warriors hack down Hawkeye & Cora? As they go ... 

	CORA

	moves towards her sister. But Hawkeye holds her tightly as they retreat. 

	CORA'S POV: ALICE

	with Magua's group crosses the path. He drags Alice behind him like baggage. She
	regains her feet. Magua is oblivious to her. He's heading towards the plateau. 

	CUT TO ... 

	EXTERIOR FOREST, TREE LINE - CHINGACHGOOK & UNCAS - DAY

	Uncas sees Magua's direction. Uncas touches his father, grabs his musket and races off.
	Chingachgook reaches to stop him, but he's too late. Chingachgook's hand in the air ... 

	TWO-SHOT: HAWKEYE & CORA

	near the tree line. Hawkeye has eyes only for ... 

	HAWKEYE'S POV: HURONS

	moving towards fire pit. One turns to watch Hawkeye & Cora depart. Will he arouse
	others to attack? Behind him, others are doing something to Heyward and flames leap
	up. 

	CORA'S EYES

	are on Alice, off to the right in the meadow. 

	HAWKEYE

	tense. They're almost there. 

	CHINGACHGOOK

	holding Killdeer. 

	CHINGACHGOOK'S POV: MASSED HURON

	Sky & flames. Suddenly, Heyward's stood upright into the fire, bound to a bracket by
	his arms. As the flames start devouring him ... 

	HAWKEYE & CORA

	close to Chingachgook and the tree line ... 

	CHINGACHGOOK

	tosses Hawkeye Killdeer. As fast as he jams it into his shoulder he FIRES. 

	HEYWARD

	among the hollering Hurons, is shot dead. It goes unnoticed. 

	CUT TO ...

	EXTERIOR PROMONTORY - UNCAS - DAY

	pound across the (sic) to the meadow towards Magua's path ... 

	CORA

	trying to stay with them, scrambles up ... 

	EXTERIOR PROMONTORY - UNCAS

	reaches the overhang. It juts away from the face six feet. 

	THE CEILING OF THE OVERHANG

	Uncas' hand jams into a crack in the granite, forms a fist and twists, making a wedge.
	He swings out, dangling in space by the hand wedged into the rock. His right hand
	reaches out and up, searching the vertical face for ... 

	UNCAS' HAND

	... a rock flake. An indentation. Anything ... His fingers find a diagonal crevice and ... 

	UNCAS

	swings out, now hanging by the vertical face above the overhang. His features are
	distorted with determination. Nothing will stop him. His right hand grabs another rock.
	His arms snap him up. Then push. He's on the ledge. Moving fast ... 

	CUT TO ... 

	EXTERIOR PROMONTORY - HURONS - DAY

	on point are approaching the path above the promontory. Five warriors are ahead of
	Magua. One behind him drags Alice. 

	FIRST

	Huron starts up the narrow path. Suddenly ... 

	UNCAS

	slams him off the rock with the butt of his musket. 

	WIDE ANGLE

	Two's musket coming up. Uncas swings. FIRES. Before he's fallen, Uncas bayonets
	Three. 

	FOURTH

	FIRES, misses, swings. Uncas slips the swung musket, but it catches his elbow. Uncas'
	musket falls. Before it hits the ground his tomahawk is out and hacks Four over the
	edge ... 

	MAGUA

	running forward past Five, confronts Uncas head on. It's incredibly fast. 

	UNCAS'

	three tomahawk swings are dodged by Magua whose own knife streaks like silver
	flashes. Uncas, gashed on arms and chest, feints right and slams Magua with an open
	hand, closes and the men are intertwined steel and muscle ... and Magua throws Uncas.
	Going with him and rolling off Uncas, Magua's knife flashes into his armpit. Uncas'
	right arm is useless. He scrambles up. Next to the expertise of a mature warrior like
	Magua, Uncas' raw, young determination may not be enough. 

	EXTERIOR - MEADOW - CHINGACHGOOK

	freezes. 

	EXTERIOR PROMONTORY - UNCAS

	closing, swings. Magua moves inside, stabs Uncas twice, turns him to face the edge,
	ripping his head left to expose the right underside of his throat. 

	CLOSE: MAGUA'S

	knife arm punches forward. 

	WIDE: PROMONTORY

	Uncas falls down the face onto to the rocks. 

	CHINGACHGOOK

	EXTERIOR PROMONTORY - ALICE

	backs to the edge. 

	MAGUA

	moves on Alice. His knife is low, about to strike. She stares at him. Her eyes are like
	pools of deep water, calm, open, almost beatific. It stops Magua ... 

	MAGUA

	inexplicably, drops his knife hand. He's riveted by her. About him, there's a glimmer of
	something else. He wears a human face for this one moment. He reaches out with his
	other hand to offer her safety. To bring her back from the edge ... 

	ALICE

	looks down at Uncas, her lover, dead on the rocks below. She turns to Magua with
	enigmatic calm. Her eyes seem to see into him. She steps off the edge. She falls to her
	death next to Uncas ... 

	EXTERIOR MEADOW - CORA

	collapses to her knees on the ground and her face falls forward into her hands ... 

	HURON WARRIORS

	are running down the path to intercept Chingachgook, charging uphill, fueled by a
	father's rage, and Hawkeye. One Huron aims at the center of Chingachgook's chest ... 

	HAWKEYE

	FIRES past his father's side. The Huron's blown off the path. Hawkeye races to reload
	on the run ... 

	EXTERIOR PROMONTORY - MAGUA

	sees the approach of Chingachgook. 

	TO CHINGACHGOOK

	Huron warriors are an irrelevance. He slams one aside with his musket. 

	HAWKEYE FIRES. 

	HURON

	with tomahawk, about to blindside Chingachgook, is SHOT DOWN. 

	MAGUA

	charging Chingachgook. 

	VERY WIDE

	Two men, like dots, race to collide at the center of the promontory. Now the others fall
	back... It's one-on-one. Hawkeye slows ... 

	COMBATANTS

	Magua - confident, pumped up - feints with his left, his tomahawk appearing in his
	right, sweeping backhand, while his left, magically holding his blade, is jamming up to
	gut Chingachgook. Chingachgook's dead. Except ... 

	CHINGACHGOOK

	isn't there. He rolled and, on one knee with his back to Magua, his arm slams rearward.
	The massive war club crashes into Magua's back. 

	MAGUA

	stunned, turns to hatchet Chingachgook ... 

	CHINGACHGOOK

	now up and towering - slams his club right into Magua's assault ... destroying it,
	 breaking Magua's right arm. And ... 

	CHINGACHGOOK

	... with his momentum, spins like a shot-putter and the next blow cripples Magua's left
	side and crushes part of his chest. 

	ANOTHER BLOW

	destroys Magua's collar and shoulder. 

	MAGUA

	amazed. His body is broken and crippled, but he still stands. He looks into the eyes of
	the last warrior of the Mohicans. 

					CHINGACHGOOK
			UNCAS!!! 

	And he spins and swings. The blade side of the war club punches into Magua's chest,
	caving him in two. 

	WIDE

	Magua dies in the dust. 

	HAWKEYE

	watching Chingachgook's heaving back. It's over. 

	CORA

	alone, kneeling in the meadow. Her eyes downcast ... 

	FADE OUT ...

	FADE IN 

	EXTERIOR - MOUNTAIN TOP - WIDE REAR SHOT - NEXT DAY

	Chingachgook's at the edge, facing the endless rolling forests to the west. A haze of
	sunlight illuminates silver and lead clouds. Hawkeye is a little apart, watching his father. 

	HAWKEYE'S POV: CHINGACHGOOK

	speaks to the sky.

					CHINGACHGOOK
				(Mohican)
			Great Spirit and the Maker of all Life ... 

	ON HAWKEYE & CHINGACHGOOK

	We HEAR Hawkeye's English translation in VOICE OVER: 

					CHINGACHGOOK/
					HAWKEYE (V.O.): 
				(in English)
			... a warrior goes to you swift and straight 
			as an arrow shot into the sun. Welcome him 
			and let him take his place at the council fire 
			of my people. 
				(pause)
			He is Uncas, my son. 
				(pause)
			Bid them patience and ask death for speed; 
			for they are all there but one
			- I, Chingachgook - Last of the Mohicans. 

	Chingachgook's hands drop to his sides. He lets out his breath with a weariness. His
	eyes seek Hawkeye's. They hold ... 

	CORA

	is standing, her back to us, in front of a rock-covered grave with a wooden cross. Next
	to it is Uncas' burial platform. Cora [says a] silent prayer. Then she pauses, crosses
	herself. Her emotions are spent. She moves next to Hawkeye. He takes her hand. 

	HAWKEYE & CORA]

					HAWKEYE
			Will you go back to England? 

					CORA
			I have nothing to go back for. 

	Long pause. 

					HAWKEYE
			Then will you stay in America? 

	She turns to face him.

					HAWKEYE
			And will you be my wife? 

	Pause. 

					CORA
			Yes. 

	They hold each other's eyes. She searches his face.

					CORA
			Where will we go? 

					HAWKEYE
			Winter with the Delaware, my father's 
			cousins. And in the spring, cross the 
			Ohio and look for land to settle with my 
			father in a new place called Can-tuck-ee. 

	They move next to Chingachgook. He senses they're beside him. Hawkeye's arm is
	around her shoulders.

					CHINGACHGOOK
			The frontier moves with the sun and pushes 
			the red man of the wilderness forests in front 
			of it. Until one day there will be nowhere left. 
			Then our race will be no more, or be not us ... 
			The frontier place is for people like my white 
			son and his woman and their children. 

					HAWKEYE
			That's my father's sadness talking. 

	Hawkeye puts a hand on his shoulder.

					CHINGACHGOOK
			No. It is true ... One day ... there will be no 
			more frontier. Then men like you will go, too. 
			Like the Mohicans. 
				(pause)
			And new people will come. Work. Struggle 
			to make their light ... One mystery remains. 

					HAWKEYE
			What is that? 

	Cora, listening to Chingachgook, takes Hawkeye's hand. 

					CHINGACHGOOK
			Will there be anything left to show the world 
			that we ever did exist? 

	REAR SHOT

	Cora stands next to her man. Hawkeye puts his arm around his father. They stare out
	over the wilderness.

Fade In:

A BRIGHT BLUE TIGER

Surrounded by a pack of dogs, ten of them snarling and gnashing their teeth.
The TIGER'S, eyes burn with fury as he wheels in a circle, lunging at one
dog clawing at another, keeping them all at bay.

Suddenly, the TIGER leaps over the dogs and transforms into a WHITE
BIRD, soaring majestically into the sky.


THE FACE OF A JAPANESE MAN


Sits up into frame, sweating, waking from a dream. He is KATSUMOTO.
We will come to know him later.

Fade to black. CREDITS OVER.

THE FACE OF AN AMERICAN MAN

As he smokes a cigar, barely listening. CAPTAIN _NATHAN ALGREN,
U.S. Army, ret, 36 years old and looking every da y of it. His eyes are lined
and saddened. He takes a swig from a flask. He is BACKSTAGE at:

INT. CONVENTION HALL              SAN FRANCISCO          DAY

Where a trade show is in progress. Scantily clad lovelies in red-white-and-
blue undies demonstrate the nation's most important new export: arms.
Every weapon imaginable is on display: rifles, pistols, even howitzers. Banners
declaim the virtues of Winchester and Springfield. Of Colt and Remington
and Smith & Wesson. Crowds mill around a stage. where:

                           I hope you will join us in welcoming ...Late of
                           the U.S. Cavalry. The Savior of Sutter Hill ...
                           Captain Nathan Algren!

A last swig. Algren steels himself, then strides onstage as we reveal a banner:

                                                                                     2.
WINCHESTER PRESENTS: THE MIRACLE AT SUTTER'S HILL!

Garish limelight from a row of foot lights illuminates Algren.

                                            ALGREN
                            My thanks, Mr. McCabe... Ladies and Gents.

He looks down at the little metal soldiers and begins to tell the story of the
battle that made him famous. His narration is halting, unsteady:

                                                ALGREN
                            ... On that fateful day, Johnny Reb had us in a
                            spot, perched on the lonely top of Sutter's Hill,
                            nothing but grey as far as the eye could see:
                            Unhorsed and out of ammunition, I gazed down
                            into the, um, mael... mael...
                                      (squints to see better)
                            -maelstrom below us, and saw them moving up.

We realize he is reading from cue cards. The little Rebel soldiers begin sliding
up the metal hill.

                                                ALGREN
                            I knew it was fight or die. Into the teeth of the
                            enemy or we would all be buried... buried ...
                                      (loses his place, under his breath)
                            Shit...
                                      (finds it again)
                            ...on the same hill with our comrades a1ready
                            gone to Merciful Heaven...

A sudden flash:

Algren's mind. The real battle of Sutter's Hill. The grim reality is ver y
different from the dashing tale. Union soldiers scream in agony. Those
horses still alive buck and froth at their tether.                      .

Algren, a lieutenant then, moves among the panicked, bloody men. He stops beside a
PRIVATE, his brother, DAVID ALGREN, 19, blonde, not much more than a boy.

                                             DAVEY
                            They're coming, Nate.

He looks over the wall. Rebel troops are moving up the hill.

                                            ALGREN
                            Keep your head down.

                                              DAVEY
                                    (smiling)
                            Papa alwa ys said we should've joined the navy.

                                             ALGREN
                            What'd he know?
                                    (looks fondly at his brother)
                            You watch me now. Do whatever I say. .

                                                                                   3.

                                             DAVEY
                           Aye-a ye, lieutenant.

Algren punches his shoulder and moves on down the line. Nearby, Algren's
friend, SERGEANT ZEBULAH GANT, though severel y wounded, reloads
his revolver with the last of his ammunition.

                                            GANT
                           How're the horses?

                                              ALGREN
                           Better than you. Smell better, too.
                                    (looks at him)
                           Can you hold on, Zeb?

                                              GANT
                                     (fighting the pain)
                           I got I choice?

Algren smiles sadly. His mend will die loon without medical attention.

Algren moves down the line, bullets whizzing overhead. He kneels beside
COLONEL BAGLEY, his commanding officer.

                                            BAGLEY
                                  (panicking)
                           We need a flag. Find me a goddamn white flag!

                                            ALGREN
                           What are you talking about?!

                                            BAGLEY
                           Surrender, damn it! That's an order!

Back to the convention hall:


                                                ALGREN
                           No thought of surrender among those boy.
                           Better to die as God made us, we thought, as
                           soldiers... So I gave the order. Mister Bugler,
                           sound mount up. Mister Bugler, sound prepare
                           arms. There were only thirty of us, but we had
                           fire in us yet. I looked down the hill at the destiny
                           ordained for us. And gave the order. Mister
                                                             .
                           Bugler, charge!

The little Union cavalry soldiers begin moving down slots in the hill.

On Sutter's Hill:

Algren leads a chaotic cavalry charge down the hill toward the advancing rebel
infantry -- artillery explosi ons - bullets snapping, trees shattering.

Algren's brother, Davey, rides beside him.

                                                                                      4.

The wounded Sergeant Gant pulls himself up, waves his cap and yells.

Bagley remains cowering behind the stone wall.


Back to the convention hall:

                                              ALGREN
                           And straight into them we went...

On Sutter's Hill :

Carnage. Union and Confederate soldiers slam together, falling, drowning in mud
and blood, stepped on by panicked hones.

Algren wields his saber in one hand and his revolver in the other, serving
death on all sides.


A soldier riding next to Davey is shot. A horse falls into a shellhole.

Back to the convention hall:

                                              ALGREN
                           "Hip-hip hurray" we shouted, for we
                           had spirit in us yet--

More flashes:

Algren slices right and left with his saber. He is a truly gifted swordsman.

A tree branch knocks Davey from his horse. He sits, dazed, on the ground.
Algren kills a rebel soldier just as be is about to fire on him.

Single-handedly, be rallies his men, screaming orders, then lifts his wounded
brother onto the saddle beside him.

He leads them downhill toward safel y, Davey clinging to him for dear life.

Back to the convention hall:

                                             ALGREN
                           Before they knew what hit them, we had broken
                           through into the rear of the rebel army.

On Sutter's Hill:

Algren and his men gather in a copse of trees. They are giddy with the exhilaration
of having survived.

                                             DAVEY
                           We did it, bro', WE DID IT! Whoeeeee!!

Algren's smile is shortlived, though.

                                                                                   5.

SUDDENLY, the woods ERUPT with gunfire. Trees are shredded.


Algren's men are literally cut to pieces-

Davey is riddled with bullets, his dead body shielding Algren from harm until
he slides, lifeless, to the mud.

                                                ALGREN
                            Davey---!!!!

Men and horses are torn apart -- they contort and writhe in agony ­ jerking
grotesquely as the bullets rip into them. Algren frantica1ly tries to locate the
source of this firepower. Then he sees:

A Gatling Gun.

Six barrels glisten like steel teeth. This early machine gun is the pinnacle of
current military might -- 60 rounds a second -- a triumph in engineering.

                                        ALGREN
                            AHHHHHHH--!!!!!

With insane courage, he wheels and charges the gun.

Bullets rip into horse and rider alike. Algren falls, lifeless, into the mud.

Back to the convention hall:

                                             ALGREN
                            And the 23rd rode on to glory.

Applause.

At the back of the hall three elegantly dressed JAPANESE MEN watch
Algren's performance. They wear Western frock coats and top hats

                                               ALGREN
                            Now let me: tell you, gentlemen, if there's one
                            thing on earth I could have had with me on that
                            glorious day, it would have been this beauty...

Algren holds up a Winchester repeating rifle.

At the back of the audience we note someone else watching Algren.
SERGEANT ZEBULON GANT, whom we last saw on Sutter's Hill.

                                               ALGREN
                            The Winchester Model '73 lever-action rifle.
                            15 shot capacity, one round-per-second,
                            accurate at 400 yards. You'll note the
                            patented loading port just beneath the
                            cartridge chamber and the smooth
                            cocking action. ...Lets' just see here--

                                                                                          6.

He peers into the ejection port as he cocks the weapon and sights out over the
crowd.

KA-BOOM!!! The report echoes among the screams of the ladies. Dust and
glass fall from a rear chandelier.

                                            ALGREN
                           Smooth trigger action, too.

Audience-members murmur nervousl y.

                                             ALGREN
                           This is, gentlemen, The Gun That Is Winning The
                           West... Step on up and take a look. Mr. McCabe is
                           here to answer any question and take orders. I thank
                           you.

Later...


A Winchester representative is handing Algren an envelope.

                                            WINCHESTER REP
                           What the hell was that?

                                              ALGREN
                           Got their attention, didn't I?

                                            WINCHESTER REP
                           Boston in three weeks. And sober this time.

He goes. Algren immediately starts counting the cash.

INT.           SEEDY HOTEL ROOM                      NIGHT

Algren sits alone on the bed. He takes out a leather-bound journal and begins to write.

                                             ALGREN (V.O.)
                           June 17th, 1876. The dead are with me tonight.
                           They return each time I am obliged to tell their
                           story.

INT.            SQUALID BAR                NIGHT

Algren sips absinthe. He stares at the milky, green liquid before him.

                                                 ALGREN (V.O.)
                           I can almost see them in the shadows, their
                           bodies whole and beautiful once more. Sometimes
                           it's as if they call to me in a sweet invitation --

                                                                                    7.
EXT.                   GAS-LIT STREET              NIGHT


Algren walks in the fog. Sputtering gas lamps give an unearthly glow.


                                             ALGREN (V.O.)
                            "We are dead," they whisper, "and we are happy."


INT.           SEEDY HOTEL ROOM                     NIGHT

Algren is back in the hotel room. From his small suitcase, he takes the
Medal of Honor, looks at it for a long moment.

                                              ALGREN (V.O.)
                            "Do not be afraid," they whisper. "You have been
                            dead, too."

A sudden flash:

We are back on Sutter's Hill. Algren's slaughtered cavalry litter the bloody
ground, dead to the last man. A rebel army surgeon gives a cursory look at
each body before it is loaded onto a wagon.

Algren's turn is no different than the others. He is declared dead and hoisted
unceremoniously onto the pile of corpses.

Back in the. hotel room.:

Algren sits, staring into the middle distance.

                                              ALGREN (V.O.)
                            Is this why they gave their lives? So that I might
                            disgrace their memory?

He reaches into the suitcase and takes out a Colt revol ver. Stares at it, cracks
the cylinder to make sure it's loaded. His finger wraps around the trigger,
the barrel makes its wa y toward his head.

And then, unaccountabl y, he is laughing.

                                             ALGREN (V.O.)
                            And why, after taking so many lives, do I find
                            myself incapable of taking just one more?

A KNOCK on the door. Algren shuts his eyes, then calls out.

                                                 ALGREN
                            Go awa y.

                                              GANT (V .O.)
                            Not exactly the greeting I imagined.

                                                                                                                  8.
Algren looks up. He knows that voice. He carefully puts the revolver back into the suitcase and shuts it before
opening the door.


                                            GANT
                           Thought you'd seen the last of me, I expect.

Algren is filled with emotion, which he tries to hide.


                                              ALGREN
                           Zeb...

They embrace.

                                              ALGREN

                           Sit. Please.


Gant moves to the proffered chair with a pronounced limp.

                                               GANT
                           ... Saw your little melodrama         toda y.
                           Very inspiring... .

                                            ALGREN
                           Given up soldiering to become a critic?

Gant smiles and shakes his head.

                                             GANT
                           Got a job for you, unless you're running for
                           office...

                                              ALGREN
                           I have I job.

                                              GANT
                           I mean a real job. Back in uniform.

                                              ALGREN
                           I' m retired.

                                             GANT
                           I don't mean a U.S. uniform.

Algren looks at him. Curious despite himself.


INT.           RESTAURANT                  NIGHT

Gant leads Algren into a lush San Francisco restaurant. Flickering gaslight
and trays of lobster. COLONEL BENJAMIN BAGLEY (whom we saw in
flashback) sits with the three Japanese men. Bagley's hair has greyed. He

                                                                                  9.
has his eye on a political future.

                                             BAGLEY
                            Nathan, good to see you.

                                              ALGREN
                                    (stunned)
                            Colonel Bagley...

                                              BAGLEY
                            Sit down. This is Mr. Omura, from Japan, and
                            his two associates who, so far as I can tell, don't
                            have names...

OMURA 40, is a handsome and intelligent man. He watches Algren closel y
as Algren pours a glass or whiskey from a decanter.

                                                BAGLEY
                            They're looking to hire real American soldiers to
                            create the first Japanese Imperial Army.

Algren looks at him.

                                               BAGLEY
                            Japan's got it in mind to become a civilized
                            country and they're willing to spend what it takes
                            to hire white experts to do the job right.

Algren takes a slow lip of whiskey.

                                             BAGLEY
                            Sergeant Gant has already agreed to serve. You
                            would be m y second-in-command.

                                             ALGREN.
                            With approval from Washington, of course.

                                               BAGLEY
                            Both governments prefer to consider our mission
                            unofficial. We'd be there as non-combatants
                                               BAGLEY
                                               (MORE)
                            only, advisors to the Japanese officers. Help
                            them with training, ordinance and the like.

                                              GANT
                            You ought to think about it., Captain. Unless
                            you intend to take up a career in the theater.

                                              ALGREN
                            I have an agreement with the Winchester
                            Corporation -- I'm sure these people have some
                            concept of what an agreement is.

                                                                               10.

Omura suddenly speaks. His English is flawless.

                                             OMURA
                            You are paid seven dollars for each performance.
                            You do, on average, fourteen performances a
                            year. We will pay you 400 dollars.

                                               ALGREN
                            A year?

                                               OMURA

                            A month.

Algren looks at him. The figure, in 1876, is staggering.


EXT              SHIP--OCEAN                     DAY

A steamship chums its wa y across the great Pacific. Algren leans on the
ship's rail and looks out into an endless processi on of wa ves.

                                               ALGREN (V.O.)
                            June 23, 1876. It is impossible, standing here,
                            not to appreciate one's, own insignificance.

A dolphin crests the surface, arcing into the air.

                                               ALGREN (V.O.)
                            Here there is neither past, nor future. Only an
                            oblivion of water.

In his tiny cabin, Algren finishes writing in his journal and takes out a
daguerreot ype of a HAUNTINGLY BEAUTIFUL BLOND WOMAN.

                                              ALGREN (V.O.)
                            And yet I ask myself, will the dead follow me
                            across the ocean to this strange new land?

He stares at the woman in the picture.


INT.            SHIP ­ CABIN                 DAY


In the main cabin, Algren sits with Gant and Omura. Algren is drinking.


                                              OMURA
                            ...After the Shogun gave up power, the daimyos ­
                            you would call them warlords --knew that Japan
                            needed a centralized government. So they asked

                                                                                      11.
                                            OMURA (CONT'D)
                           the hereditary Emperor, His Highness the
                           Enlightened Meiji, to lead the country.

                                            ALGREN
                           And these warlords just ... gave up hundreds of
                           years of power?

                                             OMURA
                           Economic incentives were offered. Most
                           provincial leaders saw the financial benefits of
                           modernization.

                                            ALGREN
                           What about those that didn't?

                                             OMURA
                           To deal with those who have resisted, the
                           Emperor has decided to create an Army with
                           allegiance only to him... We considered hiring
                           advisors from Germany, but your Ambassador
                           reminded us of your experience in suppressing rebellious
                           elements in your Civil War.

This evocation of the Civil War is not lost on Algren.

                                          ALGREN
                           Who are we supposed to be fighting against?

                                            OMURA
                           His name is Mori Katsumoto. He is samurai.

                                             ALGREN
                           Samurai?

                                              OMURA
                           The word you might use it "warrior". But that
                           does not quite capture it ... Katsumoto once served
                           the Emperor but he is now a traitor who leads a
                           band of traitors. He must be punished.

Algren looks pointedly at Bagley.

                                               ALGREN
                           You told them about our experiences together
                           on Sutter's Hill, did you, Colonel?

                                           BAGLEY
                           They know I was your commanding officer.
                           Yes.

Algren glares at Bagley, then stands.

                                                                                 12.



                                             ALGREN
                           Excuse me, gentlemen. I need some air.
                                    (to Omura)
                           I'm sure Colonel Bagley can amuse you with
                           more stories of patriotic gore.

He walks away.

                                                 OMURA
                           He is insolent.

                                             BAGLEY
                           Get him in front of the troops, you'll see. Top
                           of his class at West Point. Brilliant tactician.
                           Even wrote a book.

                                            OMURA
                           Why did he leave your army?

                                             BAGLEY
                           What's a hero to do when there's no more great
                           battles?

                                              OMURA
                           Is that an evasive answer?

                                               BAGLEY
                           Sir, this man was left for dead at Sutter's Hill.
                           Doct ors swore his heart had stopped beating,
                           but before they could bury him, he came back to
                           life. After the war he fought the Sioux, the Cree,
                           and the Blackfoot.
                                   (leans closer)      .
                           Point him at the enemy. He was born for it.

INT.                SHIP -- ALGREN'S BERTH                      NIGHT

Algren lies in his cramped berth. Can't sleep.

A sudden flash:

On the wagon of dead bodies, Algren's eyes open to stare into the unblinking
eyes of his brother, Davey, half his face shot off. He tries to move but be is
buried beneath the weight of those piled on top of him. Blood drips down
into his eyes and mouth, blinding and choking him.

Back to the ship:

Algren awakens, bathed in sweat. Terror. A silhouette in the doorwa y.

                                                                                 13.
Colonel Bagley stands looking down at him.

                                                BAGLEY
                            I hope you realize the kind of second chance
                            this is for you. I won't tolerate insubordination.

Algren reaches for a nearby glass, drains it.
                                                ALGREN
                            Court-martial me.

                                              BAGLEY
                            Would you rather I hadn't recommended you
                            for the medal. Nathan? Is that it?

                                             ALGREN
                            We both know why you helped me, Colonel.
                            Don't expect me to go all weepy with gratitude.

                                              BAGLEY
                            I expect you to do your job. Save the self-pity
                            for your own time.

He turns and walks out, leaving Algren to stare at the empty glass.


EXT.                 SHIP                       DAY

Algren and Gant stand at the rail.

                            Hate boats. If the Lord bad wanted man to sail
                            he wouldn't have created infantry.

                                           ALGREN
                            How many rimes you puke today?

                            I'm down to two.

Omura comes up next to them.
                                                OMURA
                            I understand you are a scholar, Captain Algren.
                                     (to Gant)
                            Have you read his book., Mr. Gant?

                                                GANT
                            Can't say I have.

                                              OMURA
                            An analysis of the triumph of weapons technology

                           A real page-turner. Sold twelve copies.

                                               OMURA
                           Nonetheless, I was impressed. I enjoy reading
                           military history. I spent two years studying
                           English at Princeton University.

                                           ALGREN
                           And where did you learn to speak Japanese?


Omura is perplexed by Algren's remark, then realizes he is being kidded. He
laughs heartily. Algren laughs with him. A connection is made.

                                              OMURA
                           Yes, and in Japanese there are twenty-seven
                           words for "war." I will be impressed if you learn
                           only half of them. .

He walks away. Algren watches him go. His face darkens.

                                             ALGREN
                           I got twenty-seven words too - Reb, Sioux,
                           Pawnee, Blackfoot, Jappo. Only one language
                           when it comes to war.

Like all Japan, Yokohama is at the cusp of a new era.

Ancient sampans and wooden schooners beside freighters and steamships.

EXT.                YOKOHAMA ­ DOCK                            DAY

After 23 days at sea, they are all glad to climb down the gangplank. The
Yokohama docks are a frenzy of languages and looks and smells and sounds.
Japanese competes with German and English and French and Russian.
Warehouses fl y the flags of a dozen countries.

One striking Japanese character dominates: the symbol for, Omura. It is seen
on buildings, warehouses, and the headbands of scores of laborers.

A series of palanquins, litters carried by bearers, await our voyagers.

As does SIMON GRAHAM, a dissipated Englishman who has lived in Japan
for many yean. Slender and pale, with an occasional consumptive cough, in
his 50's, he wears a white linen suit, a bit worse for wear.

                                              OMURA
                           Captain Algren, this is Mr. Simon Graham. He
                           will be your translator.

                                                                                   15.
                                            GRAHAM
                          Pleasure, Captain.

                                            BAGLEY
                          You'll be quartered at the Embassy for now.

                                          OMURA
                          The Emperor will summon you at his pleasure.

Graham ushers Algren and Gant into their own less-ornate version.

                                            GRAHAM
                          If you please, Captain...

                                           ALGREN
                           They're gonna carry us?

                                            GRAHAM
                          You're guests of the Emperor. You cannot walk.

Algren notes the hoods covering the faces of the palanquin bearers.

                                            ALGREN
                          Why the hoods?

                                             GRAHAM
                          So you won't have to burden your eyes by looking
                          at slaves. Oh, excuse me, they're servants now.
                                    (coughs, wipes a bit of blood)
                          This wa y, gentlemen...

INT /EXT            PALANQUIN - YOKOHAMA STREETS                             DAY

Their bearers maneuver them through the bustling streets of Yokohama.
White face painted geishas walk alongside bearded Russians. Traditional
Japanese kimonos alongside European suits and hats, schizophrenic world
of ancient Japan versus modern commercialism.

                                            GRAHAM
                          Twenty years ago Yokohama was a lovel y little
                          port. Then your Commodore Perry arrived and
                          changed all that.

                                             ALGREN
                          All this in twenty years?

                                             GRAHAM
                          Japan has...embraced... Western wa ys. Hired
                          lawyers from France, doctors from Germany,

                          course, warriors from the United States.

INT.            GUEST QUARTERS                       DAY

A shoji screen is opened by a bowing servant to reveal the clean, classic lines
of a Japanese room. Algren is about to enter when Graham stops him,
indicating for Algren to remove his boots.

Algren scowls, confused, and struggles to pull off the high, filthy boots. He takes
in the foreigness of the room, an arrangement of fl owers on a low table.

                                             ALGREN
                           No chairs? . .

                                               GRAHAM
                           Correct. And this--
                                     (points to a mat)
                           ..is your bed.

                                             ALGREN
                           And this?


He points to a block of wood.

                                             GRAHAM
                           Your pillow.

                                            ALGREN
                           You mean to say there are no real beds in Japan?

                                               GRAHAM
                           For its entire history Japan his been completely
                           aakoku, I "closed country." Thirty years ago, if
                           you had washed up on Japanese soil... you would
                           have been beheaded on sight. Now, they let you
                           keep your head... and give you a wooden pillow.

EXT.           AMERICAN EMBASSY-. GARDEN                     DAYS LATER

In the pristine grounds of the Embassy, a garden party is in progress.
Incongruous lilting Yankee tunes are heard from the Japanese band.

Algren and Gant, now in their dress uniforms wander through the party with Graham.
Liveried servants pall trays of canapés.

Elsewhere we see diplomats representing all the powers currently trying to devour
Japan: Russia; England; Germany; France; Spain; etc.

                                                                                                     17.
                                           GRAHAM
                          I remember when it was just America and the
                          Dutch. Now ever ybody' s getting into the game.

They pass two German diplomats. The Germans glance to Algren and Gant with suspicion, bow tersely.
Graham greets them in German.

                                          GRAHAM
                          The Germans are particularly eager.

                          What do they want?

                                           GRAHAM
                          Same thing your country wants. Most favored
                          nation status.

                                          ALGREN
                          How long have you been in Japan?

                                               GRAHAM
                          Oh, western time quickly loses its meaning here
                          ... I first came as part of the British legation in 1857.
                          But I was soon relieved of m y position, as a result
                          of various...disagreements with the
                          Crown's attitude toward the locals.


Omura separates himself from his entourage and approaches.


                                             OMURA
                          Gentlemen. I hope you are enjoying a taste of
                          home.

                                           ALGREN
                          I've done with worse, believe me.

                                             OMURA
                          America has much to offer us, though. Its'
                          industry and ingenuity are without peer.
                                   (ingratiating)
                          I have spoken to the Emperor about you. He is
                          interested in the most modem theories of warfare.

                                             ALGREN
                          I look forward to the opportunity of meeting
                          him someday.

                                           OMURA
                          You will have that chance sooner than you think.
                          He has requested an audience.

Graham is open-mouthed at this turn of events.

                                                                                       18.

EXT.                  IMPERIAL PALACE                          DAY

Algren and Bagley sit with Graham in an ornate carriage as they cross the
moat and enter the ancestral palace of the Shoguns.

INT.                   IMPERIAL PALACE ­ ANTECHAMBER                            DAY


Algren waits with Bagley and Graham outside the throne room.


                                            GRAHAM
                          Remember that he is arahitogami. A god in
                          human form. During the last two hundred years
                          no emperor was even seen by commoner. You
                          may look at him, with deference, but do not speak
                          unless you are spoken to.

EXT.          IMPERIAL COURT -- THRONE ROOM                      DAY

Algren and Gant are surprised to discover the living god is barely in his
twenties. The divine EMPEROR MEIJI is an intelligent and curious young man,
yet there is a tentativeness about him.

His throne is surrounded by ADVISORS, principal among them is Omura.
Nearby, the American AMBASSADOR SWANBECK a cagey diplomat

The throne room itself is sweeping, beautiful, and extremely restrained. Everywhere,
tasteful displays of the traditional flower of the monarchy: chrysanthemums.
The vibrant yellow bl ossoms haunt the chamber.

As the Emperor considers his guests, Omura whispers into his ear. Then:

                                              OMURA
                          The Emperor bids you welcome. He wishes you
                          to know that he is most grateful for the assistance
                          your country offers ours, in order to rid ourselves
                          of the brutality of the provincial warlords - and
                          to accomplish the same national harmony which
                          you enjoy in your homeland.

The Emperor speaks in Japanese. The advisors are non-plussed, and Omura leans down
for a moment to confer with him, then smiles indulgently:

                                           OMURA
                          The Emperor is most interested in your American
                          Indians, and wishes to know if you have seen
                          them firsthand.

Algren looks at Graham, who nods. He may speak.

                                                                                   19.
                                             ALGREN
                           I have seen many of them, and have fought them,
                           too. They are very brave.

Graham translates. The Emperor nods and smiles.

                                              EMPEROR
                                    (accented English)
                           Thank... you... very ...much.

He stands. Everyone else hurries to follow suit. The audience is over.


EXT.               PALACE GARDEN                       DAY

A1gren, Graham, and Bagley walk through the palace grounds.

                                            BAGLEY
                           That young pup runs this country?

                                             GRAHAM
                           That "pup" runs the country no more than I do.
                           He was installed as a figurehead at age twelve
                           when the warlords realized Japan needed a central
                           government. But don't be fooled -- he may be a
                           powerless god, but to these people he's a god
                           nonetheless.

GENERAL YOSHITAKA appears. He is a seasoned soldier in his 40's. A
decent man. He stops before them, bows quickly.

                                             GRAHAM
                           Gentlemen, may I present General Yoshitaka.
                           He will assist you in training the army.

                                             ALGREN
                           General.

Algren offers his hand. General Yoshitaka does not take it. He bowl his head and
speaks a few words. Graham translates:

                                             YOSHITAKA/GRAHAM
                           He greets you with extreme courtesy and asks if
                           you are ready to meet the Imperial Army.


EXT.           PARADE GROUND                            DAY

About a thousand Japanese soldiers in baggy uniforms are milling around a large
parade ground. Each has an old single shot rifle. Algren, Gant, and Yoshitaka
look down on them from a reviewing stand.


                                             GANT
                           Jesus....

                                                                                          20.

                                             ALGREN
                            Ask the General what training they' ve had.

Graham speaks to General Yoshitaka, then translates his response.

                                                YOSHITAKA/ GRAHAM
                            He sa ys... We have trained them not to shoot
                            their ...asses off.

Algren glances to General Yoshitaka, who looks back wr yl y.


                                               ALGREN
                            Sergeant Gant, have the men stand to attention.

                                            GANT
                            Imperial Army, Atten-tion!

Graham translates, rather mildly.

                                              ALGREN
                            For God's sake, let's not keep it a secret who's in
                            charge here ... Mr. Gant.

                                           GANT
                                   (roars)
                            ALL RIGHT YOU SLANTY-EYED LITTLE
                            BASTARDS STAND UP STRAIGHT OR I
                            WILL SHIT-KICK EVERY ONE OF YOU
                            COCKSUCKERS!!

As the soldiers immediately stand to attention, we begin a montage of the training
of the first Imperial Army:

We see Gant drilling the men. Shouting at his translator. Trying to get them to march
in formation. Algren is nearby, watching.

                                               ALGREN (V.O.)
                            August 4,1876. As I watch this new army train,
                            I cannot help but think of those who rode with
                            me in me 23rd cavalry.

Algren sits in his tent, writing in his journal. Outside, the Japanese are being taught
the basics of firing tactics.

                                              ALGREN (V.O.)
                            For four years they had survived, never once
                            shrinking from the fire. And so, when given my
                            order to charge the advancing rebel infantry,
                            they never hesitated. ...And they all died.

We see Algren showing the Japanese how to fire in formation. The old single-shot
rifles they carry make reloading a painfully slow process.

                                                                                    21.


                                            ALGREN (V .O.)
                           Now I am training another army. In another
                           civil war.

Algren and Gant spar with sabers - Algren's expertise far exceeds Gant's, a
fact which Gant accepts with good humor.

                                             ALGREN (V.O.)
                           Is this why I was spared? Once again to lead
                           men to their death?

It is sunset Algren, Graham, and General Yoshitaka watch the training.
General Yoshitaka speaks.

                                               YOSHlTAKA/ GRAHAM
                           ... the problem is they're peasants. They have
                           never had this sort of responsibility or power.

Algren watches Gant march beside the Japanese. They are illuminated by the
majestic red sunset

                                            ALGREN
                                   (to Graham)
                           Ask him if they have a flag.

Graham translates. Genera1 Yoshitaka responds.

                                               GRAHAM
                           No flag.

                                               ALGREN
                           They need a flag.

EXT.                TOKYO ­ STREET                           EVENING

Tokyo is a city in chaos. Everything seems out of balance. Dystopic. A
collision of Eastern and Western. Algren and Gant watch as Graham prepares
to take a photograph of an old merchant in front of his store.

                                                GRAHAM
                           ... I've been doing this for years. Trying to capture
                           it before it's all gone. Afraid I'm losing the battle.

Algren silently watches the passers-by. Something draws his attention:

Across the street. a man is striding down the crowded sidewalk. His martial
bearings, two swords, traditional dress and unique top knot of hair instantly
identify him to us as a samurai.                                       .

We will meet him again later, he is UJIO. A terse, grim man in his 40's. His
proud gait and rigid, imperious manner intrigue Algren.

                                                                                                        22.
Most of the people on the sidewalk instantly step out of the wa y, bowing in deference. But two young
Japanese in Western dress do not.

Ujio stands before them, waiting for them to move. They don't.
Tense words are exchanged. Ujio glares at them. Algren watches.

                                              ALGREN
                           Mr. Graham...

                                             GRAHAM
                           Ah... now this should be interesting... He's
                           waiting for them to show deference.

Across the street, Uji o barks out some harsh commands to the two
Japanese men. They laugh in response. Then one of the men raises a hand
and barks some clearly disrespectful words back--

Like lightning-- Ujio pulls out his long samurai sword - it flashes --

Cleanly beheading the disrespectful Japanese man --


The beheaded corpse begins to fall--

In one smooth motion, Ujio wipes his blade clean of the corpse as it falls
and sweeps it back into its scabbard. The other man immediately drops to
his belly, prostrating himself.

Without another glance, Ujio walks awa y. His face is completely impassive.

                                            GANT
                           What the hell was that?

                                              GRAHAM
                            That...is a samurai.

INT.          RESTAURANT                         NIGHT

Sergeant Gant gazes unhappily at his dinner: glistening raw fish; tepid
beancurds; boiled rice. Algren, Gant, Graham, and General Yoshitaka sit
cross-legged on the floor. Gant finds this extremely uncomfortable.

                                              GRAHAM
                           ... Before the edicts ever y citizen had to prostrate
                           himself in the presence of a samurai.

                                             ALGREN
                           What edicts are those?

                                            GRAHAM
                           The Council of State has been passing a series
                           of laws designed to eliminate the samurai.


                                              GANT
                           Why?

                                                                               23.

                                             GRAHAM
                           Because you are here now, Sergeant... For the
                           last 800 years guarding Japan and fighting her
                           wars was the exclusive occupation of the samurai.

The next course arrives. Thick, black eel. Gant groans.

                                              GRAHAM
                           Men like Mori Katsumoto were the most elite
                           caste in Japanese societ y until the Council of
                           State -- led by your friend Omura - decided the
                           whole class had to go ...
                                     (munching eel)
                           ... Most of the samurai accepted the new laws.
                           But some didn't. Or couldn't. Like Katsumoto.

General Yoshitaka speaks up. Graham translates:

                                             GRAHAM
                           General Yoshitaka bids you to remember that
                           the word samurai means "one who serves." Their
                           whole existence is based on serving their
                           country as warriors.

Graham finishes translating, then continues on his own:

                                              GRAHAM .
                           Your Imperial Army is taking awa y their only
                           reason for being ... So what are they to do now?

Algren considers this as he pours another cup of sake.
                 .
                                             ALGREN
                           This is sake?

                                              GRAHAM
                           Sake. Rice wine.

                                              YOSHITAKA
                           Hie! Sake.

                                              ALGREN
                           Sake..
                                    (to Yoshitaka)
                           Good.

Yoshitaka nods. Enthusiastically tries an English word.

                                              YOSHITAKA
                           Good!

                                                                               24.
                                              GRAHAM
                           Vexing people, the samurai. Blood-thirsty,
                           honorable, cruel, fabulousl y artistic. Wanted to
                           write a book about them for years, but no
                           Westerner can get close enough.

                                            ALGREN
                           Ask him if he ever saw a samurai in battle.

Graham looks at A1gren.

                                               GRAHAM
                           He is samurai.


Algren looks at Yoshitaka with new eyes.

EXT.                TOKYO ­ STREET                 NIGHT

Later that night.

Algren and Gant, a little drunk by now, wander Tokyo's bustling red light
district. Like Amsterdam, the geishas sit in windows facing the street.

INT.                 GEISHA HOUSE                    NIGHT

This is certainly not the whorehouse they expected. Elegant Japanese
furnishings. Lovel y flute music. The MADAM lowers her head and speaks
quietly in greeting.

                                            GANT
                           My friend and I were looking for some
                           companionship...

The Madam speaks no English. Gant speaks louder, as if to a deaf person.


                                             GANT
                           Ladies of the evening? Hootchie-contchie?
                           Boom-Boom?

                                            ALGREN
                                    ( embarrassed)
                           Zeb.
                                     (tries a bow to the madam)
                           ...so sorry.

Gant flashes a fistful of Japanese currency.

                                            GANT
                           Universal language. boyo.

The Madam nods and bows. Almost magically, two beautifully-dressed
GEISHAS appear, their faces are painted pure white.

                                                                                     25.
One of the Geishas smile. Her teeth are blackened, to better set off the
whiteness of her face paint

                                                GANT
                            That one's yours.

INT.             GEISHA HOUSE ­ ROOM                        NIGHT

Algren and Gant are led into an elegant room with paper screens, and a table
set for the Japanese tea ceremony.                                               .

Gant tries to take the arm of one of the geishas - but she moves awa y,
gesturing for him to sit The other begins the tea ceremony.

                                                ALGREN
                            No tea... Sake.

A musician plays a traditional lute. The geisha begins a graceful fan dance.

                                             GANT
                            Fan dance. Saw this once in Chicago.

Algren smiles at the Geisha preparing the. She smiles back. Algren pours
himself a cup of sake.

Later...

The sake bottle is empty. The interminable lute music continues.

Gant is increasingly agitated as the geisha continues her dance. Algren can't
help but laugh at his frustration. Finally Gant has had enough. He rises, a
bit unsteady from the sake.

                                              GANT
                            Okay, darlin' time to get down to business:

He shoos the musician out of the room, then approaches the geisha, who
shrinks from his intention.

                                               ALGREN
                            Zeb. I don't think she --

                                               GANT
                            She's just shy. Who knows what we white devils
                            have got in our trousers, eh, darlin'?

He takes her arm. She resists - her voice rising.

                                                GANT
                            Come on, now.

He tries to pull her along. Her kimono tears. She calls out in terror. Two men

appear, bouncers presumably, but alight of build.

                                                                                    26.

                                             ALGREN
                           Oh, shit.

The Madam yells angrily at Gant in Japanese. Pushing him out roughly.

                                            GANT
                           Now, hold on there, sister. I paid good money.

One of the bouncers puts his hand, politely, on Gant's arm.

                                             GANT
                           Back off, short-stuff.

This time, the bouncer is more insistent. Gant takes a swing at him. Wrong
move. Before Gant knows what hit him, the little man uses Gant's
momentum in an akido move to flip him to the mat, hard.

Algren can only stare, in awe, at the lethal move. As the second bouncer moves
to confront him, bowing apologetically, Algren speaks in English, smiling,
knowing they can't understand a word he's saying.

                                            ALGREN
                           Obviousl y you can kick the shit out of people
                           much larger than you, so we'll be leaving now...

EXT.               _PARADE GROUND                             DAY

The training continues. We see Gant, now sporting a black eye. Algren
walks with General Yoshitaka and Graham. Graham translates:

                                           YOSHITAKA/ GRAHAM
                           The General wishes to know if you bad a pleasant
                           evening?

Algren looks at Yoshitaka, who gives him. wry look..

                                              ALGREN
                           It was... educational
                                     (Yoshitaka nods)
                           Would the General mind telling me more about
                           our common enemy?

Yoshitaka looks at him. Has Algren deliberately used the word, "enemy,"
knowing that Yoshitaka, too, is a samurai? Algren gives nothing awa y.

                                              YOSHITAKA/GRAHAM
                           ... Mori Katsumoto is an extremely charismatic leader.
                           To those who honor the old ways, he's a hero. His
                           force is estimated at about five hundred and growing
                           by the day. All samurai.

                                           ALGREN
                           What kind of man is be?

Graham translates. General Yoshitaka considers his words.

                                                                              27.

                                              YOSHITAKA/GRAHAM
                           Katsumoto has no fear. He has no pity. He is
                           kotsutai-- the soul of old Japan ... He is my
                           honored kinsman.

                                             ALGREN
                           Kinsman?

                                             YOSHITAKA/GRAHAM
                           We grew up together in Yoshino. Marched
                           together and fought together. He is Kaishaku
                           the brother of my spirit.

Algren considers this as they observe rifle practice. Erratic but
improving. Algren notes Yoshitaka's reaction. The rifles seem to make
him unhappy.

                                           ALGREN
                           Ask him what kind of guns Katsumoto has.


                                            GRAHAM
                           The samurai don't use guns.

                                            ALGREN
                           No, ask him what kind of firearms they have.

Graham obliges. Yoshitaka responds, with disdain:

                                            YOSHITAKA/GRAHAM
                           The samurai no longer dishonor themselves by
                           touching firearms.

Algren is surprised at this bit of information. A servant approaches, bows.

                                            GRAHAM
                           Colonel Bagley requires you.

INT.               TENT              DAY


Colonel Bagley and Algren stand at a map. Omura sits.

                                             ALGREN
                           They're not a fighting unit yet

                                               BAGLEY
                           We have no choice.
                                (refers to the map)
                           --the railroad has been stopped here. Just as it
                           entered Yoshino, Katsumoto's province.

                                                                                   28.

                           Captain, we     cannot govern a country in which
                           we cannot tr    avel freel y. ... Katsumoto's
                           provocation     is strategic. His defeat will
                           demonstrate     to the other disloyal samurai that
                           resistance is   an act devoid of honor.

                                             BAGLEY
                           The rebels don't have a single rifle. They're
                           savages with bows and arrows. You get up there
                           and show 'em how it', done.

                                              ALGREN
                           With respect, sir, I need more time.

                                             OMURA
                           With all due respect. this railroad cannot wait.

         He bows and leaves them alone. Bagley spins on A1gren.

                                             BAGLEY
                           You think we're the only country interested in
                           Japan?! You don't think the Germans and the
                           French would like to oversee the new army?

                                                ALGREN
                           Colonel--

                                              BAGLEY
                                     (brutally)
                           Why do you think we're here, Captain? Because
                           Remington and Colt and Winchester have
                           powerful allies in Washington. We're here to
                           sell a shitload of American guns...and steel...and
                           timber. That shouldn't be bud for a Winchester
                           whore like you to understand.

Algren looks at him, murderously.

                                                ALGREN
                           Yes, air.



EXT.                    RUINED VILLAGE                               DAY

A STEAM ENGINE lends plumes of smoke into the air as it waits. Algren,
Bagley, and General Yoshitaka ride along the railroad line.

The Imperial Army follows, with Sergeant Gant, on foot.

A traditional Japanese village is being torn aside to make room for the railroad
line. Houses are being leveled and black smoke drifts up. The displaced
villagers gather belongings. Omura guards herd them about rather bruta1ly.

                                                                                 29.
Railroad workers are laying a new spur, building a brick station. A1gren notes
the by now familiar Omura symbol on the new water tower and on the
headbands of the guards and workers.

                                            ALGREN
                          What is that sign?

                                             GRAHAM
                          It's the symbol for the Omura Zaibatsu.

                                            ALGREN
                          Zaibatsu?

                                            GRAHAM
                          Old family businesses that own ever ything worth
                          owning. The molt powerful is the Omura
                          Zaibatsu. That's your friend, Omura.

                                            ALGREN
                          They own all of this?

                                            GRAHAM
                          They do now.

SEVERED HEADS on pikes line the road, a warning to those who continue
to resist

                                           ALGREN (V.O.)
                          October 24,1876. Today we entered Kansai
                          province. Here the local warlords have all been
                          convinced to accept the emperor's rule.

They pass a particularly wrenching sight. Villagers kneeling outside what
used to be a Shinto temple. The railroad tracks cut straight through it.

                                            ALGREN (V.O.)
                          Our destination is Yoshino, home of the rebel
                          Katsumoto. Protected by high mountain passes,
                          it can be reached only during the summer
                          months, and even then with great difficulty.

The Army moves on. Ahead are towering mountains.


EXT.                    MOUNTAIN PASS                          DAY


The Imperial Army winds its way up I steep mountain pass.

                                             ALGREN (V.O.)
                          A long march. And then a battle. A new enemy,
                          but the same feeling I had in my guts at twenty-one,
                          in the cornfield at Antietam -- men will die
                          here, today, and will I be among them?

                                                                                  30.

EXT.                    MOUNTAIN PLAIN                        MORNING

Fog. Obscuring everything.

Algren and Bagley, on horseback, wait with Graham. General Yoshitaka and
a few Japanese Commanders are mounted as well. The thousand strong
Japanese Army is on foot They stand, rifles ready.                            ,

                                        ALGREN
                                   (to Graham)
                           Ask him how they'll come at us.

Graham speaks to General Yoshitaka. Yoshitaka responds:

                                             YOSHITAKA/ GRAHAM
                           They'll come straight on. They will push forward
                           and keep on attacking... And he adds that there
                           is no samurai word for "retreat."

Algren prepares himself.

They wait.

General Yoshitaka is suddenly alert. He speaks quietly to Graham.

                                              YOSHITAKA/GRAHAM
                           He sa ys they're coming...

Algren gazes into the thick fog ahead, sees nothing. Bagley looks worried.

                                             BAGLEY
                           Captain Algren, have you posted a rear guard to
                           protect our supply train?

                                             ALGREN
                           Yes.

                                           BAGLEY
                           Who is overseeing their deployment?

Algren is somewhat confused by the question.

                                             ALGREN
                           No one.

                                              BAGLEY
                           Mr. Graham, you will accompany me to the rear.
                           I want to be certain we are protected from any
                           surprise assault.

                                             GRAHAM
                           Yes. Of course.

Before Algren can respond, Bagley has left the front lines with Graham in

                                                                                    31.
tow. Gant watches as they head out of harm's wa y.                      .

                                               GANT
                            Son of a bitch.

                                                ALGREN
                                      (almost to himself)
                            ...I'm going to kill him.

                                            GANT
                            Waste of good ammo.

Gant checks his two revol vers. The methodical clicking of the chambers as
he checks his rounds is the only sound.                                         .

Then absolute silence. A light SNOW begins to fall.

Algren continues to peer into the fog. Nothing.

Then a sound ... distant ... building through the fog...

The steady rumble of horses. Slowl y approaching. Closer and closer...

Algren notes some of the Japanese soldiers are literally shaking in fear.

Algren peers again into the fog. Nothing. But the sound is closer.

Then the sound abruptly stops.

Silence broken only by the murmured prayers of some of the soldiers.

                                              ALGREN
                            Sergeant Gant, order the troops to assume
                            staggered firing positions.

                                             GANT
                            Imperial Army, assume staggered firing positions.

His order is translated. The Japanese soldiers prepare to fire, one
row kneeling, the other standing behind them.

One of the Japanese soldiers faints from sheer tension.

Algren can see nothing through the dense fog. The tension is unbearable.

Then a form on horseback... ghostly... like lame sort of medieval
monster. An elaborate, horned helmet. Sweeping samurai armor.

All we can see it the eerie silhouette in the fog.


Like something from a nightmare.

And then another figure... and another ... as 500 mounted samurai warriors
slowl y move into position.

                                                                                     32.
The Japanese troops are terrified


                                              GANT
                                   (quickly)
                           Hold the line ... hold the line...

The order is translated.

A terrible, beautiful moment of absolute stasis.

Nothing moves.

The Japanese soldiers wait.

The ghostly silhouettes wait.

Silence.

Then -- as if a silent signal were given -- the samurai suddenly CHARGE,
emerging from the fog in a great wave--! The force of a tsunami.

The silence is shattered as the charging samurai roar out ancient war-
cries that chill the blood -- sweeping forward on their hones like
lightning -swords and spears flashing

                                               ALGREN
                           FIRE!

The Japanese troops fire then quickly begin trying to reload their single shot
rifles -- others fumble at the ask and then break and run--

Panic and chaos--

                                               ALGREN
                           Hold the line!

Too late-- the samurai are on them--

They attack with an intensity few have ever seen -- many of the Japanese
soldiers try to escape, turning and running in blind panic -- they are butchered--
run through by the ashigaru, cut inhalf by the naginata.

Those soldiers who laboriousl y try to reload their rifles are quickly
mowed down by ferocious clouds of samurai arrows, fired by mounted
Samurai.

                                             ALGREN
                           Sound fall back! Sound fall back!

A bugler sounds the order. The Army begins to retreat.

But suddenly they are attacked from behind as well! Arrows shoot from the
fog and more mounted samurai appear.

                                                                                     33.

They are surrounded.

Algren, Gant, and the Japanese Offi cers call out orders but all discipline
soon breaks down -- it is every man for himself--

The battle swirls ever ywhere around us. Fleeing soldiers are run through by
lances, run down and trampled by horses.

Each samurai wears individual, vibrantly col ored armor. Various battle
flags sweep through the fog.

Gant uses his two cavalry revolvers -- firing constantly -- finally out of
ammo he drops from his horse in the cavalry st yle and pulls a Winchester
repeating rifle, crouching and quickly firing--

Algren uses his revol ver first -- firing as he turns on his horse -- when
the revol ver is empty he pulls his cavalry saber. He manages to parry
the lethal blows as the Samurai hurtle past --

But one Samurai, his armor all in black, comes at him on a collision course
and SLAMS INTO HIM, sending both horse and rider to the ground.

Algren scrambles to his feet, his saber nowhere to be found as another
rider heads toward him carrying a lance.

Algren manages to grab it and throw the rider to the ground, wrestling the
lance from his grip and running him through.

In the midst of the battle we notice a peculiar thing. One samurai is just sitting
on his horse. Watching Algren. This samurai wears a BLACK MASK.

The MASKED SAMUARI watches Algren fight.

Algren now wields the lance to battle the horsemen as they sweep past. He
spears one and then unseats another. When a third samurai cuts his lance in
half, Algren uses the remaining half as a club to take him down.

The Masked Samurai continues to watch Algren. Algren's tenacity is amazing.
He continues to fight with heroic passion, refusing to give an inch, long after
Those around him have fled.

Then a blaze of bright yellow ­ a samurai in yellow armor galloping past, firing
arrows steadily from horseback. His control and speed are astounding.

We will come to know him as YORITOMO, a handsome young samurai.

Yoritomo fires arrow upon arrow ­ the speed is breathtaking ­ Two arrows
slam into Gant, knocking him to the ground.

The battle, meanwhile, has become a rout. Those Imperial soldiers who fight
are easily cut down. Those who flee are run down like prey.

Left alone, Algren finds himself confronted by ashigaru ­ samurai foot
soldiers carrying pikes. He turns to discover his retreat cut off by other

                                                                                                         34.
samurai wielding katana ­ the lethal long sword.

But rather than give any quarter, Algren launches an attack. He kills one
samurai before he is RUN THROUGH, at the shoulder, by a lance.

In agony, Algren SNAPS OFF the hilt of the lance, leaving its tip buried
deep in his chest, and fights on.

He manages to parry a blow ­ which SLICES into his side. The next blow
takes off a piece of his scalp. Blood fl ows down his faces and into his eyes.

Algren is now surrounded by ten samurai. A man's heroic stand against
certain death is of great interest to them. As they begin to close in, Algren
whirls the lance around, a tattered battle-flag with TIGER INSIGNIA still
dangling from the end.

The MASKED SAMURAI removes his mask. It is the JAPANESE MAN,
whose dream of the tiger we glimpsed at the beginning of the story. His
eyes wide in surprise, he watches his dream come to life--the blue tiger
holding the dogs at bay.

In SLOW MOTION Algren whirls the lance, as one samurai, wearing
BLOOD-RED ARMOR, advances. With a murderous smile, he draws his
katana.
Algren seems spent ­ he drops to one knee, swaying, on the brink of losing
consciousness.
                                                                      .
But as the RED SAMURAI, lets out a battle cry and propels himself forward for the death blow - Algren
suddenly LEAPS UP and propels the jagged wooden end of the broken lance into the unprotected throat of his
attacker.

As the samurai falls, the rest of his comrades close in to cut Algren off.

A harsh COMMAND stops them in their tracks.

The Masked Samurai leaps from his horse. Everyone steps aside deferentially
so that be might pass by without being jostled.                    .

He looks down at Algren, then removes his battle helmet.

And we meet _MORI KATSUMOTO, the leader of the samurai. He it an
imposing man of about Algren's years.

Sensing that he is about to be killed, Algren pulls himself t o his knees, and SWINGS his saber at Katsumoto.
With blinding speed, Katsumoto pulls his katana from its scabbard.

Algren's saber is SNAPPED CLEANLY IN TWO.

Katsumoto looks down at Algren.

Then Gant appears behind Katsumoto -- limping toward him, cocking his
rifle, urgently trying to save Algren--

Ujio, (the Samurai we saw earlier on the streets of Tokyo) leaps to
protect his Lord. His sword flashes--

                                                                                                      35.
Gant is eviscerated. Algren watches in horror.

A dreadful beat as Gant stands, pathetically trying to hold his guts in. Then he
sinks to his knees.

Katsumoto turns, leaps back onto his horse and trots off.

Algren finally wrenches himself from under his horse. He crawls to Gant,
blood pouring from his own injured back and shoulder.

Gant is dead.

Algren looks up to see the battle is lost. The Japanese soldiers have fled.
Or are surrendering, injured or dead.

And he sees one other thing. General Yoshitaka is still on his horse,
head down. He has not pulled his sword. He has not been hurt.

Katsumoto rides to Yoshitaka. A few serious words are exchanged. Katsumoto bows his bead in respect, seems
to agree to something.

Both men climb from their horses. General Yoshitaka pulls out a small b1ade and hands it to Katsumoto, who
holds it out firmly.

General Yoshitaka quickly and calmly pulls himself on to the blade, plunging
it into his stomach, embracing Katsumoto.

It is seppuku -- the traditional form of samurai suicide.

Algren watches, stunned.

Then a terrible scream cuts through the battlefield.

Algren sees samurai calmly walking among the injured and captured Imperial
soldiers .. killing them one by one with a single stroke.

Algren looks over the slaughter.

And then passes out, bill wounds overcoming him.

Fade to...

EXT.                    MOUNTAIN PASS                               DAY

Algren is unconscious, tied to a horse.

The mounted samurai move up a treacherous mountain pass, disappearing
into the soaring mountains of Yoshino.

EXT.              VILLAGE                                    SUNSET

Katsumoto's village is the other Japan. The Japan we have not yet seen.

The gorgeous mountain scenery of Yoshino envelopes the village. Snow-
capped mountains soar in the distance. A valley below with rice fields.

                                                                                    36.

After the turmoil of Tokyo, this place seems a bucolic paradise. Traditional,
wooden Japanese architecture. Farming. The sense of harmony so markedly
absent from the cities.

Algren, barely conscious, hunches over his horse. He has lost a lot of blood.

Katsumoto leads his samurai into the village. As he passes, ever y person in
the village touches his or her forehead to the ground to show respect.

Most of these villagers have never seen a white face and gaze at Algren with
curiosity. And suspicion.

Katsumoto dismounts in a large square, the rest of his men follow suit. A samurai
helps Algren painfully slide from his horse.

Katsumoto moves to the steps of the largest house. His officers fall
into formation around him. Algren notes Ujio - the grim samurai who killed
Gant -- in jet black armor, glaring at him coldl y.

Ujio walks forward and SCREAMS at Algren in Japanese. Algren doesn't
move. This only makes Ujio more angry. He paces back and forth like a
caged panther spitting invective at Algren.

Algren doesn't move. He watches Uji o evenly. This takes incredible will.
His wounds are so bad that- he can barely stand.

SUDDENLY - Ujio draws his long sword -- it slashes through the air - the
blade singing -- and stops an inch away from Algren's face!
Algren doesn't move.

Ujio brings the cutting edge' into contact with Algren's check. Blood runs
where even this feather-light touch cuts Algren's skin. Algren doesn't move.

Ujio glares at him. Then sheathes his sword and walks away.

Katsumoto looks at Algren deepl y, gauging him. Then be speaks. In English.
Algren is surprised.

                                            KATSUMOTO
                           You cannot escape. We are deep in the mountains
                           and winter is coming.

Katsumoto turns and walks into his house. Uji o follows him. Algren collapses.

Fade to black.

As Algren begins his time at the heart of the samurai world.


INT.                        YORITOMO'S HOUSE                           NIGHT

Algren'. eyes open...

A WOMAN is leaning close, her eyes intent on the task of sewing up his
wound. She is beautiful, but he is not really conscious enough to notice, or

                                                                                      37.
even feel the pain. He blacks out again.

INT.                    YORITOMO'S HOUSE                      NIGHT

Algren wakes again. He is lying on a simple mat. His injuries are such that
he can barely move his head. He takes in the traditional Japanese furnishings.

A red ball rolls across the floor. And after it... TOSHIIE, a little boy. around
four. The boy l ooks at Algren. offers him the ball. Smiles.


A1gren blacks out...


INT                      YORITOMO'S HOUSE                       ANOTHER DAY

Algren's eyes open...

Through the archway he can see Toshiie and his older brother HIGEN, around
ten. Also the beautiful WOMAN who earlier was stitching his wound.

From his recumbent position, Algren watches as she ministers to the boys,
who are dearly her sons. Algren is fascinated by her grace and the sweet
attention she gives them.

She seems to sense him. Her eyes raise, meet bit. She speaks to someone,
and YORITOMO appears. He is twenty-one, too young to be the woman's
husband. Yoritomo comes into Algren's room. Speaks to him.


Algren shakes his head. Doesn't understand


Yoritomo speaks to the woman, who approaches and places bowl of soup
in front of Algren. He ignores it

The boys stand in the doorwa y. Yoritomo shoos them awa y.


Algren glances up at the: woman. Her eyes avoid his, her expression is opaque.


INT.                      YORITOMO'S HOUSE                              ANOTHER DAY

Algren now sits in the main room. The woman is changing the dressing on
his wounded right shoulder and arm.

Yoritomo kneels across from Algren. He is impressed at the many battle
wounds on Algren's body; the old bullet wounds and scars. In Japanese, he
indicates his admiration.

Algren his no idea what Yoritomo is saying. Finally he interrupts with the
only Japanese word he has bothered to learn:

                                               ALGREN
                            Sake.

                                                                                 38.

Yoritomo's face breaks into a wide smile.

                                             YORITOMO
                           Sake?

                                             ALGREN
                           Sake.

Yoritomo glances to the woman. She nods, and brings A1gren a saucer of
sake. He drinks it down. Holds out the saucer for a refill

Smiling, Yoritomo indicates for the woman to comply, but before she can
pour another saucer, Algren takes the jug out of her other hand. Yoritomo
laughs as Algren drinks it down.

EXT.                       VILLAGE                               NIGHT

Autumn leaves fall to the ground. In a tiny hut, the village swordsmith begins
work on a samurai blade.

INT.                   YORITOMO'S HOUSE                        NIGHT

Algren writhes on his mat. Trapped in his recurrent nightmare.

A sudden flash:

The wagonload of the dead. Davey's bl oody corpse closes in on Algren
suffocating him.

Back in the house

Yoritomo and the woman are asleep in separate rooms.


A piercing SCREAM shatters the night


EXT.                 VILLAGE                        FOLLOWING

The screaming continues. Lamps are lit around the village...


INT.                YORITOMO'S HOUSE                   FOLLOWING

Yoritomo and the woman hurry to Algren's room --

Algren in the throes of his recurring nightmare - awakens, disoriented.


                                             ALGREN
                           Sake.

Yoritomo and the woman confer. Yoritomo looks It Algren and shakes his
head, no.

                                                                                      39.

                                              ALGREN
                           SAKE!

Yoritomo refuses -- Algren roars and tries to rise. Laughing at Algren's
ferocit y in his weakened condition, Yoritomo easily pushes him back down.

Algren folds in on himself, rocking like a feral animal.


EXT.                  YORITOMO'S HOUSE                              NIGHT

Katsumoto stands outside the house, drawn by the commotion. Ujio stands
with him, shaking his bead.

                                             UJIO
                                   (subtitles)
                           My lord, why do you spare the barbarian? He is
                           shamed in defeat, be should kill himse1f.

                                             KATSUMOTO
                                   (subtitles)
                           The barbarian doesn't know hit shame.

                                              UJIO
                                   (subtitles)
                           Then I will kill him.

                                             KATSUMOTO
                                   (pats him; subtitles)
                           Ujio-San, he will still be shamed tomorrow or in
                           a month. For now there are things I wish to learn.

EXT.                      VILLAGE                      DAY

A glimpse of village life -- fish are hung on lines to dry, children chase each
Other, clothes are washed in the river, and in the rice fields below, farmers
squat as they have for thousands of years. In his hut, the swordsmith
continues to hammer and fold the blade.

INT.                YORITOMO'S HOUSE                       NIGHT

Algren sits hunched in a dark corner. His body is convulsed with shivering.
His withdrawal from alcohol, his wounds, his isolation and his imagined sins
are devouring him.                                                                .

Then we see he is not alone. The woman stands in the doorway, watching
him closel y. Finally she enters with a bowl of soup.

He glances up, something like panic in his eyes.

She kneels and attempts to hand him the soup, but be knocks it out of the
wa y and grabs her by the throat.

                                                                                     40.
                                               ALGREN
                            Sake!

She stares at him, the breath being squeezed out of her, but there is not even
a whisper of fear in her eyes. She is utterly impassive. Shaken, he lets her
go, and crumples to the floor.                         .

                                             ALGREN
                                      (mumbling to himself)
                            Sake...

The woman leaves the soup and wa1ks away.


INT.                    YORITOMO'S HOUSE                           DAYS LATER

Daylight streams in, finding Algren lying on his back. The worst of the detox
is past. As be lies there, these first moments of repose lead to:

A sudden flash of memory:

The beautiful blond WOMAN from the picture laughs merrily, and falls
back languorousl y in a grassy fi eld.

Back in the room

Algren shakes off the memory as harsh SOUNDS from outside draw him to
the window.                  .

EXT.                    YORITOMO'S HOUSE                      MORNING

Algren watches from the window as the samurai train. It is like nothing else
in the world. Part sacred ritual, part martial preparation, samurai training
com bines athletic prowess and graceful artistry into one effortless whole.

Finally well enough to walk, Algren comes out onto the porch to watch the
spectacle. In front of him, is a Kendo (The Way of the Sword) master
practice with their long and short swords. They have incredible control.

NAKAO, a mountain of a man, is a Karate master. He stands unarmed,
four samurai facing him. They attack with wooden swords. He effortlessly
defeats them -- the agility of the huge man is shocking.

Kyudo ("The Way of the Bow") masters use their bows for target practice.
Yoritomo holds a bundle of arrows. In the distance, a line of plums.

Algren watches. Yoritomo just seems to stand there, his eyes hall-open.

And then -- in a stunning blaze of movement -- Yoritomo fires the arrows --
one after another, amazingly fast -- cleanly hitting each plum. The final arrow
splits the previous one as it buries itself in the tree.

A wooden sword leans against the porch.

Algren idly picks it up, feeling its balance. In a flash, Uji o has raced over and
grabbed it from him. Algren stands motionless as Ujio screams at him.

                                                                                  41.


The training stops, as everyone watches Uji o berate Algren.

Even as Ujio continues screaming. Algren simply shakes his head, turns
awa y, and walk back into the house.

INT.               YORITOMO'S HOUSE                         DAY

As the sounds of training resume outside, Algren explores the house.

He comes upon Higen and Toshiie playing with the red ball. They are
embarrassed to encounter him alone. There's a moment of suspension, and
then Higen throws the ball to Algren.

Algren looks back and forth between the two boys, fixes his gaze on Higen
but throw the ball to Toshiie, causing both boys to laugh and run awa y.

Algren walks on.

INT.                SMALL ROOM                           DAY


Algren opens a sliding shojii screen and discovers a small room that has been
made into a kind of shrine.

Cand1es and incense burn, a small Buddha sits on a dais, and Algren's eyes
are drawn to what seems like an apparition standing in the corner.

The BRIGHT RED ARMOR of the warrior Algren killed in the fog, is held
upright by an unseen stand. It is almost as if the dead warrior himself is
swing back at him.

Algren senses someone behind him and turns. The woman is standing across
the hall. Their eyes meet. She turn, and walks away.

EXT.               VILLAGE                            NIGHT

A first, light snowfall has covered the ground. A1gren walks out into the still
night. He turns a corner and confronts curious sight:

Ten warriors kneel, motionless in the snow, their eyes closed in concentration.

As Algren puzzles over this, he becomes aware that Katsumoto is now
standing next to him.

                                                   KATSUMOTO
                              They are training.

                                                   ALGREN
                              Training what?

                                                 KATSUMOTO
                              Their minds. It is called bushido...

                                                                                   42.

Algren looks at him. He has never heard the word.


                                           KATSUMOTO
                       The wa y of the warrior. We study from when
                       we are young. Are my words correct?

Algren does not respond.

                                              KATSUMOTO
                            I will practice my Eng1ish with you.

                                            ALGREN
                            Why do you learn English?

                                            KATSUMOTO
                            To know m y enemy.

                                             ALGREN
                            If I am your enemy, why have you not killed
                            me?

Katsumoto doesn't answer.

                                           ALGREN
                            Was General Yoshitaka your enemy?

                                             KATSUMOTO
                            No, I honor his memory as my kinsman.

                                            ALGREN
                            That why you helped him kill himself?

                                                KATSUMOTO
                            If a samurai is defeated in battle, he must take
                            his own life to spare himse1f the shame of capture.
                            It is required that his kaishaku his trusted friend,
                            help him. I was honored to by his kaishaku.

                                                ALGREN
                            Hell of an honor.

                                               KATSUMOTO
                            It was his destiny. He knew it, he died at peace.

                                            ALGREN
                            Who was the warrior in the red armor?

                                            KATSUMOTO
                            My son-in-law. His name was Hiroshi.

                                           ALGREN
                            And the woman who cares for me?

                                                                               43.
                                           KATSUMOTO
                           My daughter, Hiroshi's wife. Her name is Taka.

         Algren is incredulous.

                                             ALGREN
                           I killed her husband?

                                            KATSUMOTO
                           It was an honorable death.

Katsumoto walks awa y.


INT.             YORITOMO'S HOUSE                       DAY

Algren it now well enough to kneel at the table with the others. Taka treats
him with utter politeness and dignity. He watches her intently, seeking any
sign of the animosity he's certain she must feel.

She hands him a bowl of rice.

                                           ALGREN
                                  (smiling politely)
                           You hope I choke on it, don't you?

She bows, uncomprehending.

                                             ALGREN
                           You want to poison it and watch me fall over
                           the table and foam at the mouth.
Yoritomo bows in response to Algren's new willingness to communicate.

                                             YORITOMO
                                   (to Taka, subtitles)
                           I promise I'll make him take a bath.

                                             TAKA
                                   (subtitles)
                           Soon. Please.

.EXT.             VILLAGE -- BATHING TUB                            DAY

Yoritomo leads Algren to a large, wooden bathing tub in I secluded part of
the village. A banked fire smolders beneath it.

Embarrassed, Yoritomo indicates to Algren that be needs to bathe. Algren
strips off his filthy uniform then lowers himself into the steaming water.

Yoritomo begins taking off hit own kimono. A1gren is taken aback. Used to
Western privacy, he is a bit disquieted about bathing with another man.

Yoritomo, unconcerned, climbs into the tub. He chats pleasantly as they
bathe, showing off his old battle wounds.

                                                                                      44.
Algren's discomfort turns to outright alarm when a toothless old grandmother
appears. .She happily strips and joins them in the tub!

Algren sinks a little lower into the water. The old grandmother smiles at
him with her toothless grin.

EXT.            VILLAGE                          DAY

Algren. feeling self-conscious in the clean kimono he's wearing for the first
time, walks back with Yoritomo. Kids start walking with them, pointing at
his Japanese garb, laughing as he stumbles in his wooden clogs. They pass
by Ujio training a group of samurai using wooden kendo swords.

Nearby, Higen and Toshiie are imitating the grown-ups, sparring with wooden
swords that are much too big for them. Yoritomo watches his nephews proudly,
murmuring details of their prowess to Algren, who has no idea what he's talking
about.

Higen charges his little brother, but goes careening past, right toward Algren,
who deftl y dodges out of the wa y. This causes gales of laughter from the
boys, one of whom takes Toshiie's sword and offers it to Algren.

Algren looks at the sword in his hand and unthinkingly twirls if with a f1ourish --
causing the boys to applaud. Yoritomo bows, and encourages A1gren in
Higen's direction. Algren shakes his head politely, but Higen is already on
the attack.

Algren dodges one thrust, then parries another, as the boys begin to cheer.

Suddenly, ever yone goes silent. Algren turns.

Ujio is standing behind him, arms folded.

Ujio barks a command in Japanese. He wants Algren to drop the sword.
It is obvious to Algren what it must mean, but he does nothing.

Ujio approaches Algren slowl y. Algren holds the wooden sword casually,
only his eyes betraying the tension of the moment.

Ujio's wooden sword FLASHES, quicker than the eye can follow. Algren's
sword is knocked from his hands, then, somehow in the same fluid
movement, Ujio brings the sword around and cracks Algren across the
chest hard enough to knock the breath from his body and lend him to his
kneels.

Satisfied with himself, Uji o starts to walk away, but the expressions of the
bystanders cause him to turn back: .

Algren is standing again, and again holding the sword.

With grim purpose, Uji o returns to Algren, who has assumed a ready pose.

Again Ujio's SWORD FLASHES. Algren manages to parry one blow, before
he is cracked across the face, and blood begins to flow free1y from his nose.

                                                                                          45.
 Ujio knocks Algren's legs out from under him, and while Algren is sprawling
on the ground, Ujio kicks Algren's sword out of his hand, and starts away.

Again, Algren manages to stand up, and before Ujio can turn, charges him.

But Uji o doesn't need to turn. In a sliding move, he dodges and cracks Algren
in the side, then the legs, then the neck. Gasping for breath, at least one rib broken,
Algren writhes on the ground. Ujio digs the point of his sword into
Algren's hand until he releases his grip. Again Ujio kicks the sword away.

The ever-enlarging crowd gasps as Algren once again struggles to his feet.
This time without hesitation, Uji o runs back and rains blows upon Algren's
now defenseless body. First the wrist, then the back, then the stomach, then
finally the head.

Algren hits the ground, unconscious, his fingers still clutching the sword.
Ujio reaches down, pries it from his fingers, and breaks it across his knee.

INT.              YORITOMO'S HOUSE                                   EVENING

Algren lies painfully on a mat, his eyes unfocused.


A sudden flash of memory:

The lovel y blond woman, tears in her eyes, looks up to Algren's shining face,
the epaulets on his crisp officer's, uniform gleaming gold in the sun.

The reverie is broken.

As Taka kneels to swab the cuts on his face. He stares at her darkly.

                                            ALGREN
                         Who are you people anywa y?

She makes no attempt to understand or respond.

                                               ALGREN
                         You have no God, you have no mercy, you don't
                         even have any fucking walls. Your walls are
                         made of paper, what's the matter with you?

She pushes his head aside so she can attend to his neck.

                                                 ALGREN
                         This man tries to kill me and I've done nothing
                         to him, and you, I kill your husband and you act
                         like, what? Like I'm a guest in your house.
                         What is wrong with you?

This last said so intensely that she glances at him before picking up a bowl
of soup she had brought for him, and bringing it to his lips...

                                               ALGREN
                         Do you have a soul at all?

                                                                                  46.

He stares at her for a moment, then knocks the soup out of her blinds.

Her eyes FLASH for one moment, before resuming their usual mildness.
But that flash is enough to satisfy him, and he calms down. She walks away.
He sighs, exhausted, only to see her approach again with a new bowl. Their
eyes meet, and hold for a moment. She does have a soul. He takes a sip.

INT.                 SHINTO SHRINE                        DAY

Algren is led past baldheaded monks into an ancient shrine. Katsumoto
kneels before a small altar. He doesn't seem aware that Algren is present.

                                             KATSUMOTO
                           Ujio is teaching you the wa y of the Japanese sword.

                                              ALGREN
                           Is that what he's doing?

                                            KATSUMOTO
                           At what age did you become I soldier?

                                              ALGREN
                           Nineteen.

                                             KA TSUMOTO
                           To fight in your American civil war.

                                              ALGREN
                           Yes.

                                             KA TSUMOTO
                           Tell me about that war'.

                                              ALGREN
                           What about it?

                                              KATSUMOTO
                           Everything.

                                            ALGREN
                           Everything about the civil war?


Katsumoto sits impassively, staring at the altar.

                                            ALGREN
                           That would take a year.

                                           KATSUMOTO
                           You have pressing business elsewhere?

Shaking his head, Algren sits down.

                                                                                             47.


                                              ALGREN
                           The civil war began on April 12. 1861 when the
                           rebs attacked Fort Sumter. Well, actually, it
                           probabl y began three years earlier when the
                           Supreme Court decided a runaway slave had to
                           be returned to his master

                                                                               DISOLVE TO:

The TWO OF THEM, hours later--

                                              ALGREN
                           --and Pickett says he wants to do it, over
                           Longstreet's objections and Lee doesn't know
                           what to think, but he lets him. So 15,000 men
                           go up that hill. And most of them die.

                                                KATSUMOTO
                           Was that wise?

                                                ALGREN
                           No, it was stupid.

                                                KATSUMOTO
                           Why?

                                             ALGREN
                           The point of a battle is to win, or at least have
                           enough men survive to fight another day.

                                             KATSUMOTO
                           You did not try to survive when we took you
                           prisoner.

Algren eyes him, frustrated.

                                          ALGREN
                           What do you want from me?

                                          KATSUMOTO
                           What do you want for yourself?

                                           ALGREN
                           You know they're not going to ransom me.

                                             KATSUMOTO
                           We have little use for money.

                                                                                   48.
                                              ALGREN
                                     (mounting fury)
                            Then what are you doing, why are you asking me
                            these questions, what is going on here?

                                               KATSUMOTO
                            The snows will melt in May, and the passes will
                            open, and the events of the world will unfold.
                            Until that time, you are here.
                                     (smiles)
                            I enjoyed this conversation in your English. I
                            hope you will honor me with more tomorrow.

Katsumoto stands, bows, and leaves.


INT.                  YORITOMO'S HOUSE                             DAY

Young Toshiie sits near Algren. He labors over a scroll with a brush, the
gentle brush strokes are hypnotic as they sweep across the rice paper.

Algren tries to indicate that he would like pen and paper for himself. Toshiie
gives him what he asks. Algren begins to write:

                                              ALGREN (V.O.)
                       Day unknown, month unknown, 1876. I continue
                       to live among these strange people.

EXT.                        VILLAGE                            DAY

Katsumoto watches Ujio bark orders to the men he is training. A sudden
Movement of their eyes, causes Uji o to stop. He turns to find:

Algren standing at the end of the line, holding I wooden sword.

An almost imperceptible look passes bet ween Ujio and Katsumoto, but Ujio's
Resentment is over-ruled. Without a word, he continues.


Algren does his best to follow the exercise.


Katsumoto, the slightest hint of a smile on his face, walks away.

                                              ALGREN (V.O.)
                            Each day I am confounded by their strange customs
                            and contradictions, savagery followed by
                            mildness.

INT.            YORITOMO'S HOUSE                          NIGHT

Algren now kneels at the table with the rest of the family as they eat. He is
in considerable pain from the rigors of training. He tries to roll the stiffness
out of his neck, when be notices that Higen it imitating him. Toshiie laughs.

                                                                                                     49.
                                               ALGREN (V.O.)
                            They seem to value nothing more than their
                            families, and yet they kill defenseless wounded
                            men without a shade of remorse..

Yoritomo sternly tells Higen not to make fun of their guest. Yoritomo
apologizes to Algren, who shakes his head unnecessary.

                                               ALGREN
.                           Raisu? [Rice?]

They stop, shocked. He has spoken!

Yoritomo calls for Taka to serve him more rice, then begins yammering
enthusiastically in Japanese. Algren holds up his hand.

                                              ALGREN
                            Not so fast Ko...toba? [Words?]
                                     (bolds up chopsticks)
                            What is this?

                                               YORITOMO
                            Hashi.

                                               ALGREN
                            Hashi.

Yoritomo is hysterical with glee now.

                                               YORITOMO
                            Hail!

The boys are suddenly dervishes, pulling various objects from the table and around the room, shouting the
Japanese words for each.

Algren shakes his head, and smiles for the first time in this stor y.

Yoritomo manages to quiet the boys. He points to himself.

                                               YORITOMO
                            Yoritomo.

                                                ALGREN
                                      (points to himself)
                            Algren.

                                               YORITOMO
                            All-gren.
Algren nods, and the boys start screaming "All-gren!"

                                              YORITOMO
                                    (points to each in rum)
                            Higen. Toshiie. Taka.

                                                                               50.

                                            ALGREN
                                  (bowing)
                          Higen. Toshiie.
                                  (turns to Taka)
                          Taka.
She meets his eyes for the slightest moment, then looks down and walks away.


INT.              KATSUMOTO'S HOUSE                            NIGHT

Katsumoto is arranging flowers. Algren watches in confusion, as this
powerful lord goes about doing something so feminine and delicate. Finally:

                                           KATSUMOTO
                          The parliament of your country has two houses.
                          Why is that?

                                           ALGREN
                          To keep either one from being too powerful.

                                           KATSUMOTO
                          Does not a people need a powerful ruler to
                          protect them?

                                           ALGREN
                          We believe the opposite.

Katsumoto thinks about this.

                                             ALGREN
                          I have a question. How do you come to speak
                          English?

                                               KATSUMOTO
                          Members of the Council were required to study
............              it. ........Yes, I was a member of the government.
                          I helped restore the Emperor to the throne.

                                            ALGREN
                          So that Japan could have a powerful ruler to
                          protect it.

Katsumoto understands Algren's irony, but doesn't smile.


                                         ALGREN
                          And now you must hate him for what he's done.

                                            KATSUMOTO
                          He is my blood. I serve him with my life.

                                            ALGREN
                          By fighting his army?

Katsumoto looks at A1gren.

                                                                                                             51.

                                              KATSUMOTO
                           I do not fight the emperor. I fight those who
                           seek to influence him, those who betray the soul
                           of my country.

He slowl y draws his long samurai sword, and places it next to the flowers on the table in front of him.

                                              KA TSUMOTO
                           The Emperor gave this blade to my ancestors
                           400 years ago. It has been used only to defend his
                           sacred honor.

Katsumoto hands the sword to Algren. Algren studies it.

                                             KATSMUOTO
                           It takes many years to make a sword. It is a holy
                           Act. A samurai's sword is his soul.

                                             ALGREN
                           This sword is flawed. What is this uneven line
                           near the edge?

Katsumoto smiles at Algren's ignorance.

                                              KATSUMOTO
                           One man is flexible and compromises too much
                           to avoid conflict. Another man is so fierce he
                           wins ever y battle, but so rigid he can never know
                           peace. A man who knows both is the perfect
                           warrior. The lame is true of a blade .. one steel
                           bends, and the other cuts. And where they
                           meet is never perfect Hold the blade up. .

Algren holds the sword, cutting edge up. Katsumoto takes a silk cloth and drops it. It gently billows down -- and
splits evenly on the edge.

                                            KATSUMOTO
                           Some believe a blade is thirsty until it tastes the
                           blood of its enemy.

Algren hands the sword back. Suddenly, Katsumoto swings the sword, cleanly splitting the table in two.
Silence.

                                           ALGREN
                           The crew at Winchester can produce one rifle ever y
                           seven minutes.

                                            KA TSUMOTO
                           We gave up firearms two hundred years ago. It
                           takes no courage to kill. A man from half a mile
                           awa y. You must look into the eyes of your enemy
                           to know who you have killed.

                                                                                                       52.
                                             ALGREN
                          I'm not sure an artillery officer would agree.

                                             KATSUMOTO
                          Do you?

                                              ALGREN
                          I think all killing's a filthy business.

                                              KATSUMO
                          TO Taking a man's life is
                          nothing. It is his honor you
                          can never take awa y.

                                           ALGREN
                          In other words you have no respect for human life.

                                              KA TSUMOTO
                                   (fierce) .
                          What do you know of human life? You come here to kill for
                          money Where is your family? Where is your wife, your sons?
                          What is your legacy?

                                             ALGREN
                                   (undaunted)
                          And what is yours? To rebel against the future? I fought the
                          South in our civil war. Their leaders believed they were fighting
                          for "honor" just as you do. And their people died by the thousands!

Katsumoto simply looks at him.

                                           ALGREN
                          And my wife is dead.

                                             KATSUMOTO
                          Mine, too.


They look at each other. Some unexpected recognition has taken place.

                                            KATSUMOTO
                          Tomorrow we will discuss your country's wish for
                          dominance in the..."Far East."

                                             ALGREN
                          ...I look forward to it.


Algren turns to go.


EXT.VILLAGE SQUARE DAY

We see the village swordsmith at work. He has been forging the same long samurai blade for months... Algren
watches him as he works.

                                                                                                               53.
                                            ALGREN (V.O.)
                          March 9. 1877. I have never known such a disciplined
                          people.

EXT. VILLAGE DAY

Algren trains with the other men. He attempts an attack, which is easily brushed aside by Nakao. Algren ends
up in the dirt again.

                                             ALGREN (V.O.)
                          From the moment they wake, they devote themselves
                          to the perfection of whatever they pursue--

EXT. VILLAGEDAY


Algren walking with Katsumoto -- they are deep in conversation.

                                           ALGREN (V.O.)
                          And yet the more time I spend here, the less I understand them.

EXT.               VILLAGE                      DAY
Two women are bowing repeatedly, chattering in smiling, earnest argument.

                                            ALGREN (V.O.)
                          Everyone is polite, every nuance of behavior seems to
                          have a great meaning, and increasingly I am convinced
                          that the lower they bow, the leas they mean it.

EXT.              YORITOMO'S                         HOUSE

Algren, holding the wooden sword in 1870'5 baseball manner, is coaxing Higen to throw the ball at him. The
children laugh as Algren hits it onto the next porch.

Taka watches her sons impassively. It is dear how much they like Algren.

                                           ALGREN (V.O.)
                          And I am sure they regard my wa ys to be as confounding
                          and unfathomable as I find theirs.

AN ICE CRYSTAL ON THE END OF A BRANCH


Starts to drip. SPRING bas begun.

BXT.                 VILLAGE                         DAY

Villagers laugh as they go about the business of life. A man throws a sack of rice to another. Two women hurry
awa y from a farmer who is teasing them.

Algren is once again among the training warriors. He and another man face off, each waiting for the other to
attack with his wooden sword.

                                                                                                                54.
Algren moves first, but his opponent counters, and strikes him easily. They wheel around and engage again,
and again Algren is bested. Furious, he throws himself at his opponent, reverting to classic saber technique.

In a flurry of movement, his opponent manages to deflect the blows and also knock Algren to his knees.
Yoritomo approaches and bows.

                                            YORITOMO
                           A1gren -San. Please forgive. Too many mind.

                                             ALGREN
                           What?

                                           YORITOMO
                                  (pointing as he explains)
                           Mind sword, mind face, mind people watch, too many mind.
                                  (on Algren's confused expression)
                           No mind.

                                             ALGREN
                           No mind?

                                           YORITOMO
                           Hai! No mind. You try.

Algren nods, uncertainly, and picks himself up. Again he faces the opponent, shaking off the tension and trying
to stay calm.

This time the opponent charges first, and Algren manages to parry one blow, before he is again bested.

Yoritomo bows happily and begins yammering in Japanese, clearly taking credit for Algren's progress.

Across the square, Katsumoto watches.


EXT.                     IMPERIAL PALACE GARDEN                                   DAY

The cherry blossoms have emerged, creating a scene of intense col or, beauty,
and serenity. The Emperor sits cross-legged next to a shrine. He is approached by Omura and two other
advisors.                                                                        .

                                             OMURA
                           Your majest y, beg permission to approach.
                                    (the Emperor nods)
                           Your humble servants are most anxious to know if his
                           Majest y has signed the order regarding the railroad progress.

                                               EMPEROR
                                   (after a long moment)
                           I am most impressed at the wa y the blossoms float
                           upon the air, as if held by unseen hands.

                                             OMURA
                           Yes, they represent the highest form of gyoko.
                           About the order, your Majest y.

                                                                                                                 55.
                                              EMPEROR
                            This railroad must go through Yoshino Province?

                            It is absolutely necessar y your Highness.

                                                EMPEROR
                            If you sa y so, I shall sign.

EXT.                                VILLAGE                          DAY

Algren walks through the village, past the swordsmith who is now honing the blade, carefully sharpening it.

.EXT.                    CHERRY TREE FOREST                              DAY

Algren makes his way through a stunning cherry forest near the village. The pink and red blossoms are dazzling
and abundant. Other villagers can be seen gathering cherry bl ossoms.

It is a place of otherworldly beaut y.

It is all so beautiful that Algren just stops. Takes it in for a moment. He reaches out and touches a blossom.

                                             KATSUMOTO (O.S.)
                            A perfect blossom is a rare thing...

Algren turns. Katsumoto is kneeling nearby, meditating.

                                             KA TSUMOTO
                            You could spend your life looking for one.
                            And it would not be a wasted life.

                                            ALGREN
                            Were you praying?

                                                KATSUMOTO
                            Just sitting... I do not think I have the word.
                            Satori it means, maybe, awareness.

                                               ALGREN
                            Of what?

                                              KATSUMOTO
                            This moment alone, apart from all others ... You
                            know this?
                                     (Algren shakes his head)
                            I am writing a poem about this time we hive spent.
                            I have only written one line on "His eyes were like my
                            own but seen through a deep and troubled ocean."
                            Can you suggest a second line?

                                             ALGREN
                            I'm not much of a writer.

                                              KA TSUMOTO
                            Is this why you spend so much time with your journal?

                                                                                     56.

                        .                     ALGREN
                             How do you know that?
                                      (no answer)
                             She told you.

Katsumoto appraises Algren.

                                              ALGREN
                             Did you love her husband as your own son?

                                             KA TSUMOTO
                             You have sent men to their deaths, just as I have.

                                                ALGREN
                             The difference is, you feel nothing.

                                              KA TSUMOTO
                             Before you were a soldier, you were a farmer.

                                              ALGREN
                             What does that have to do with anything?

                                               KA TSUMOTO
                             You lived on a farm. Or in a forest of trees.

                                            ALGREN
                             How do you know?

                                              KA TSUMOTO
                             The wa y you look at the cherry blossoms.

                                               ALGREN
                                      (reluctantly)
                             We lived in a place called Connecticut. My...brother
                             and I climbed the maple trees.

                                              KA TSUMOTO
                             Were they beautiful?

                                               ALGREN
                             Yes.


                                              KATSUMOTO
                            And you were sad to see them die in the winter.

A beat. Something flickers in Algren's eyes.

                                             KATSUMOTO
                             You were something before you were a soldier. You
                             were a boy who was sad to see the leaves fall and the
                             trees die.

Katsumoto looks at him deepl y.

                                                                                              57.
                                                KA TSUMOTO
                             Like those trees, we are all dying. The future is
                             an illusion, our plans are an illusion, our fears an illusion.
                             We live life in every breath. Eat, drink, fuck. Now. Every cup
                             of tea. Every word we write... Every blossom we hold.

He smiles sadly.


                                               KA TSUMOTO
                             Every life we take.

A beat. He stands, takes in the beautiful cherry orchard.


                                               KATSUMOTO
                             Life in every breath. That is bushido. The wa y of the
                             samurai.

He goes. Algren stands for a moment deep in thought

INT.                      YORITOMO'S HOUSE                               NIGHT

Algren is asleep. And then we note that the ground is vibrating .. he slides
across his mat .- wakes with a start

An unholy rumbling-

Algren bolts up ... just as a paper wall rips open, the wooden framework to the room splits
and the roof collapses--

An earthquake. Common for this part of Japan.

EXT.                     VILLAGE                            NIGHT

Yoritomo appears. He and Algren crawl out of the house just as the ground lurches
violently-

Part of the house contorts and caves in

Around the village, the wooden frame houses are swa ying and lurching they have some
torque, but not enough

Ujio directs the villagers as they battle a fire-

Taka appears, calling frantically for Toshiie.

Then an even larger seismic tremor suddenly TEARS THROUGH THE
VILLAGE

Houses are ripped apart -- the whole world shifting.

Though the smoke, Algren sees Toshiie cowering under an eave

                                                                                               58.

A heavy ceiling beam breaks loose, threatens to crush Toshiie

Algren dives forward, grabs Toshiie and pulls him out of the wa y... the front
of the house collapses, the beams smashing to the ground..

Taka and Higen race to Algren and Toshiie. The boy is safe.

Taka grabs the child and cradles him. Her look to Algren is fierce, protective,
almost feral -- as if he were the threat instead of the rescuer.

EXT.                       VILLAGE                               DAY

Algren watches the villagers rebuild. Yoritomo and Higen strugg1e with a large
wooden framework.

                                                   ALGREN (V.O.)
                            I am str    uck by these people and their acceptance of Fate
                            in a1l it   s variations. At a time like this, they seem utterly
                            without      sentiment. Even the children have a gravity
                            beyond      their years.

Algren goes to them. Silently begins to help them.


INT.                 YORITOMO'S HOUSE                                    DAYS LATER

Algren works with Yoritomo, binding the wooden framework. Higen prepares
the paper walls nearby. He does this with considerable skill.

Taka is getting water from a rain barrel she observes Algren helping
rebuild her home. Yoritomo is working nearby.
Algren's Japanese is rough but improving:

                                             ALGREN
                                    (in Japanese, subtitles)
                            Would last longer ... if stone.

                                             YORITOMO
                                   (subtitles)
                            No. House fall. House go back easy with wood.

Algren shakes his head. Taka appears with cups of water. Algren looks at her
For the first rime, she holds his gaze.


EXT.                  YORITOMO'S HOUSE                               EVENING

Torches illuminate a small stage in the center of the village square. Several
samurai perform a ritualistic Noh drama. (A form which, by the wa y, the
samurai invented.) Others play flutes and large steel drums.

                                               ALGREN (V.O.)
                            And yet I have never seen a people with more capacity
                            for the joy found in the simplest things of life.

                                                                                                59.

Katsumoto himself plays the lead role. An enthusiastic actor, he plays to the children in
the audience. They are delighted with his broad theatrics.

INT. YORITOMO'S HOUSE

Taka is carrying in a huge lack of rice. Algren goes to help her.

                                               TAKA
                                     (subtitles)
                             No, please.

                                                    ALGREN
                                        (insistent)
                            Hai.
He carries the rice for her into the pantry area.

                                              TAKA
                                    (subtitles)
                            Japanese men do not help with this.

                                                  ALGREN
                                        (subtitles)
                            I know.

She looks at him, a little surprised.

                                               ALGREN
                                     (subtitles)
                            I am not Japanese.

In spite of herself, she smiles a little. There is an awkward moment.


                                                ALGREN
                                      (subtitles)
                            1... didn't know he was your husband.

                                              TAKA
                                    (struck; subtitles)
                            He did his duty. You did your duty.

                                              ALGREN
                                    (subtitles)
                            And you do yours.

                                                    TAKA
                                        (softl y)
                            Hai.

They look at each other for a long moment. She starts to move, but he stops
her. They are close enough to smell each other's hair, to feel the warmth of
the other's breath. She looks up at him, pleading with her eyes not to take this any further.

                                                                                                  60.

He lets her go.

EXT.                 VILLAGE                   DAY

Algren stands across from Ujio, ready again for the ken-jutso.

They stand frozen for a long time, hands on the hilts of their wooden swords.
Other samurai watch.

Algren and Ujio stare at each other.

But there is something different about Algren's expression. Not as much
fury and competition, more a sense of balance and alertness. He studies Ujio's eyes, his hands,
the folds of his kimono, the attitude of his body.

We watch A1gren closel y.

Gradually all SOUND drains away. We hear only Algren's steady breathing. He is
aware of everything. A bird in a tree. A woman grinding rice. A plum about to fall.
A gently swa ying battle flag,

Slow-motion as:

Algren attacks -- no fury, just control-- Ujio tries to deflect the blow, Algren
anticipates - he swings his sword elegantly - -Ujio blocks it -- Algren counters --

Algren presses forward, his sword slashing masterfully, forcing Ujio back
Ujio counters with complex moves as he retreats --Algren keeps moving
forward, calm -- finally Ujio's sword is swept aside in one clean
movement. Algren ends with the edge of his wooden sword It Ujio's throat.

The other samurai watch. Amazed.

Algren twirls his sword in a fancy cavalry "fl ourish." The pride he has alwa ys taken in his
swordsmanship has been restored. He bows to Uji o.

Ujio nods his head, slightly, in respect


The other samurai, led by the hearty Nakao, congratulate Algren.

EXT. MEADOW                            DAY

Algren carries water from the river through a riot of spring wild-flowers. Something
makes him stop, and see the sunlit clouds in the deep blue sky, the colors around him, hear the
buzzing of the bees, feel the kill of the air.

A sudden flash of memory

His beautiful wife, in green field not unlike this one, laughing, tossing her hair, falling
back into the long grass.

Back to Algren

                                                                                                  61.

The force of the memory causes him to link to the ground.

Another flash of memory, longer this time:

His wi fe leans over and kisses his mouth, and his cheek, and his forehead. He holds
her al tightly as be can.

Back to Algren

As tears begin to course down his face, and he sinks down into the flowers and the grass,
looking up into the impossibl y beautiful sky. He gives in to the sobs wracking his body.

EXT.          VILLAGE                              DAY

As Algren returns with the water, he sees Katsumoto approaching with Ujio and several warriors.

                                           KATSUMOTO
                           The Emperor has requested my presence.
                           We leave tomorrow. You will be released in Tokyo.

He goes. Algren stands, not sure how to react.

INT.             YORITOMO'S HOUSE                         NIGHT

Algren writes on parchment by the light of an oil lamp.

                                             ALGREN (V.O.)
                           April 13, 1877. Tomorrow we return to
                           civilization. As eager as I am to be among my
                           own kind, I confess to a curious reluctance.

EXT.         KATDUMOTO'S VILLAGE                     DAWN

Algren stands overlooking the village as the sun rises over the misty peaks.

                                           ALGREN (V.O.)
                           These months have marked me, and I don't fully
                           know yet wh y.

EXT.                 YORITOMO'S HOUSE                     DAY

Algren prepares to mount up. Yoritomo says goodbye to his family.

                                              ALGREN (V.O.)
                           I do know it is here that I have known my first
                           untroubled sleep in many years.

Taka comes to Algren, bows her head.

                                             TAKA
                                   (subtitles)
                           You are alwa ys welcome in our home.

                                             ALGREN
                           Domo Arrigato.

He glances at the unfinished house.

                                                                                        62.
                                              ALGREN
                                   (subtitles)
                           ...You will finish it soon.

                                                TAKA
                                      (subtitles)
                           If that is my destiny.

She bows her head again. Toshiie hands him a scroll: it is a picture of the
Family. Algren is included. Japanese characters list all their names.

Toshiie bows. Algren bows and tucks the scroll into his coat.

Algren and Yoritomo move out with Katsumoto, Ujio, Nakao and his bodyguard of several
dozen Samurai.

The villagers bow and honor the warrior as they pass.


EXT.                    MOUNTAINOUS LANDSCAPE                             DAY


Algren trots alongside Katsumoto.

                                             ALGREN
                           ... The Emperor sends a message for you to return
                           to Tokyo, and you go?

                                             KATSUMOTO
                           Yes.

                                            ALGREN
                           Even though you're in rebellion against him.

                                             KATSUMOTO
                           Against the Emperor? Never. I serve him. As
                           I have alwa ys done.    .

                                             ALGREN
                           I don't understand.

                                            KATSUMOTO
                           Our Emperor is young, and there are things I must
                           sa y to him.

                                             ALGREN
                           But ever yone around him wants you dead.

                                           KA TSUMOTO
                           And if the Emperor desires, I will take my own life at his
                           command.

He spurs his horse and rides on. A1gren watches him.

                                                                                                       63.
EXT.         MOUNTAIN VALLEY                               SUNSET

They approach a large inn.

A boy working in the fields see Katsumoto approaching. He doesn't believe
it -- the Great Katsumoto. He drops his hoe and races awa y, calling out.

                                              KATSUMOTO
                             We will stop here for the night.

EXT.                      MOUNTAIN VALLEY                              SUNSET

Samurai guards have been posted around the perimeter.


INT.         KATSUMOTO'S RQOM                              NIGHT

Algren is escorted in. Katsumoto kneels at a table. Preparing the traditional Japanese tea ceremony.

                                                KATSUMOTO
                             Sit, Captain.

Algren sits. By now he has learned how to sit on the ground. Katsumoto begins the exacting, delicate and
precise tea ceremony.

                                              KATSUMOTO
                             Do you drink tea?

                                                  ALGREN
                             I've had little else for some time...

Katsumoto continues with the tea ceremony.

                                            ALGREN
                             How's your poem coming?

                                              KATSUMOTO
                             I am having trouble. The truth is I am not a very
                             good poet.
                                     (Algren smiles)
                             Do you know wh y you were sent here? To
                             Yoshino.

                                                ALGREN
                             To protect the railroad.

                .                              KATSUMOTO
                             Why is the railroad here?

                                             ALGREN
                             So Tokyo can control the whole country.

                                                                                                       64.
                                           KATSUMOTO
                           You have seen my province. All mountains.
                           Far from Tokyo. Yet the rail line must come
                           here?

Katsumoto tosses a tiny bit of coal on the simmering brazier on the table. Algren watches carefully.

                                           ALGREN
                           You have something they want

                                           KATSUMOTO
                           What do they want in my mountains?

                                                ALGREN
                           Minerals ... Gold.

                                                KA TSUMOTO
                                    (smiles)
                           There is no gold in Japan.

Katsumoto gently blows on the coal brazier. The coal flares a bit.

                                                ALGREN
                           Coal?
                                    (Katsumoto looks at him)
                           For steamships.

                                          KA TSUMOTO
                           And why would steamships be so important?

                                                ALGREN
                           ...China.

Katsumoto looks up at him. Impressed.

                                            KATSUMOTO
                           Japan has nothing. China has ever ything.

                                              ALGREN
                           Mine the coal to create a way station for the trip to
                           China ... Freeze the Europeans out and Japan and
                           America have a monopol y on the China trade.

                                            KATSUMOTO
                           Add to this the Omura Zaibatsu. You know the
                           Zaibatus?

                                           ALGREN
                           The wealthy families.

                                                                                                       65.


                                              KATSUMOTO
                           As patron of the railroad, Omura owns all land within
                            four hundred feet of ever y new rail line. As my country
                           grows, so will his wealth.
                                    (looks at him)
                           This is why you are fighting.

Katsumoto completes the tea ceremony. He pours a cup for Algren. Bows his head and offers it to him.

                                              ALGREN
                           And you will tell the emperor to stop them?

                                              KATSUMOTO
                           I do not tell the emperor what to do.

                                           ALGREN
                           Then what do you hope to accomplish?

Katsumoto looks at Algren, the slightest gleam in his eye.

                                             KATSUMOTO
                           Will you return to America?

Algren watches him -- why didn't Katsumoto answer?

                                              ALGREN
                           ...I have a job here.

                                            KATSUMOTO
                           You should return to your home.

                                             ALGREN
                           Why?

                                            KATSUMOTO
                           Because I do not wish you to be m y enemy again.

Katsumoto returns to his poem, he does not look up.

                                           KATSUMOTO
                           Go home Captain ... Anshinritsumai. I wish you peace.

Algren waits but Katsumoto just continues to work on his poem.

EXT.                      AROUND THE INN                                 NIGHT

The samurai guards are alert, their senses heightened to almost superhuman proportions.

But there is another way. Another way of learning combat. A wa y without the
beaut y, the philosophy and the moral code.

They are almost imperceptible at first... their head-to-toe black clothes a perfect
camouflage... their silence and stealth are otherworldly.

                                                                                                     66.

They were then known as Shinobi, masters of stealth and spying.

We know them as Ninjas.

They float across the ground ... creeping an inch ever y hour... complete
physica1 control. One black-gloved finger moves. Then the next...

They crawl and then wait


Poised on their fingertips and toes.

There is no sound as they strike.

The samurai guards are garroted in an instant. Other Ninjas catch the
samurai's weapons as they fall. No sound disturbs the peaceful night.

EXT.                  INN -- FRONT DOORWAY                                  NIGHT

Silence.

Two samurai guards are in position.

One of them glances up at the stars.

A Ninja throwing star instantly slices into his jugular-- blood sprays -- the other
guard turns ­ a series of Ninja slice into him...

EXT.                    INN--WALLS                                  NIGHT

Silence.

The Ninjas use mew claws to crawl up the walls like spiders.

EXT.               INN ­ ROOF                               NIGHT

Silence.

A samurai guard stands at the edge of the roof. A Ninja silently moves
toward him. Stops. Ten feet awa y.

He pulls out a shuriken -- a small needle-shaped projectile, dips it into a sack of
poison. Places it carefully into the palm of his hand. And with the flick of his
wrist--

The needle flies -- stabbing into the samurai -- he crumples.

Other Ninjas immediately pour over the edge of the roof -- catching the samurai before he falls...

INT.                          INN -- KATSUMOTO'S ROOM                         NIGHT

Silence.

                                                                                                        67.
Katsumoto cannot sleep. He stares out the window at a nightingale.


INT.                       INN--UJIO'S ROOM                   NIGHT

Silence.

Ujio sits in his room. He is unblinking. Alert. Swords at the ready.

INT.                           INN ­ ALGREN'S ROOM                       NIGHT

Silence.
Algren cannot sleep either. He sits leaning against a wall. Thinking.

INT.                       INN -- MAIN HALL                     NIGHT

Silence.

Yoritomo drinks tea with Nakao, the huge martial arts master.


INT.                         OUTSIDE KATSUMOTO'S ROOM                         NIGHT

A guard stands sentinel. Above his head, unbeknownst to him, two Ninjas descend on ropes.
One of them swings a long chain - to which I barbed-knife is attached.

As it lodges in the guard's chest, the second Ninja swings down just in time to catch the dead guard,
silently, before his body hits the ground.

INT.                          INN -- KATSUMQTO'S ROOM                      NIGHT

Silence.

Katsumoto lies in bed listening to the night bird. It stops singing. Katsumoto smiles sadly. He
decides to give up on sleep, leans forward to rise.

This act saves his life.


For when the Ninjas come, they come all at once--

A Ninja suddenly comes TEARING STRAIGHT THROUGH THE PAPER WALL, his sword
slashing down .- just missing Katsumoto.

Katsumoto calls out an alarm, diving and rolling across the floor for his sword. He instantly
kills one Ninja using his steel-tipped "war fan" to slash his attackers throat. Another smashes
in through the window.

INT.                  INN -- MAIN H ALL                      NIGHT

Ninjas EXPLODE into the main hall. Samurai who come out of their rooms are cut down by a
variety of weapons -- one takes a throwing star in the face, others are felled by the traditional
ninja-to, short swords ideal for fighting in confined spaces, chain-knives, nun-chaka and others.

                                                                                                         68.
More Ninjas drop from the rafters on ropes.


INT.                          INN -- ALGREN'S ROOM                              NIGHT

A Ninja SMASHES through the paper wall -- Algren grabs the nearest object, a low tea table.
and swings it at his head. The Ninja dodges the blow and slices at Algren with short-sword.

Algren barely avoids the blow by ducking behind a post as the sword LODGES
deep in the wood. Algren flings himself, bodily, at his attacker.

INT.                      INN-- MAIN HALL                           NIGHT

Ninja throwing stars spin across the room, killing a samurai.

Yoritomo emerges from his room, readying his bow, but the dead samurai falls back
blocking his wa y. From behind the rice wall, Yoritomo lets fly an arrow without even
looking.

It passes THROUGH the wall, killing the Ninja on the opposite balcony.


INT.                         INN-- FIRST FLOOR                    NIGHT

Ujio screams a war cry and begins to battle his way up the stairs. With breathtaking moves, he slashes
hands and limbs, forcing the Ninja back.

Nakao fights his wa y up beside him, desperately trying to reach Katsumoto's room. Using
only his bare hands he catches a Ninja's wrist and hurls him over the railing.

INT.                         INN -- ALGREN'S ROOM                      NIGHT

Algren and the Ninja are in a death struggle, kneeing, gouging, butting. They awkwardly smash
through a paper wall into the next room.

INT.                     INN -- KATSUMOTO'S ROOM                      NIGHT

Katsumoto wields his long sword in one hand and his short sword in the other. It is the first time
we have seen him in action and his movements are both beautiful and deadly.

But more Ninjas are pouring in through the window, threatening to overwhelm him.

INT.                            INN -- ALGREN'S ROOM                    NIGHT

Rolling on the ground, Algren manages to grab a chopstick and STAB his adversary through the eye.
He picks up the fallen short sword and steps out into the hall.

ARROWS whiz past, thudding into the wall beside his head.

INT.                     INN-- KATSUMOTO'S ROOM                          NIGHT

Katsumoto, breathing heavily, his kimono shredded and bloody, is fending off the Ninjas' increasingly
savage attacks as Algren enters.

Algren SCREAMS, distracting them just long enough for Katsumoto to take advantage and kill one.

                                                                                                               69.
Then, just as a Ninja it about to kill Algren, Katsumoto FLINGS his short sword ... it pin-wheels across the
room, hitting Algren's attacker in the chest.

Without missing a beat, Algren pulls the short sword from the dying Ninja's chest and uses it to stab
another Ninja who, thinking Algren defenseless, has launched an attack.

INT.                         INN -- MAIN HALL                       NIGHT

Ujio and Nakao are back to back, a perfect fighting machine as they fight their wa y to
Katsumoto's rescue. They battle Ninjas wielding lethal kusarigamas, the Ninjas swing chains,
the attached blades slice the air--Nakao catches the chains and flinging the Ninja
over the balcony.

INT.               YORITOMO'S ROOM                           NIGHT

Yoritomo is pinned down. Darts and throwing stars shred the rice paper wall above him. He
picks off another Ninja before changing his position.

INT.                   INN-- KATSUMOTO'S ROOM                          NIGHT

The blazing sword battle continues.

Algren throws a beautiful painted standing-screen in front of an attacking Ninja,
momentarily confusing him. Then he stabs THROUGH THE SCREEN -as a blood-
stain SPREADS across the pastoral painting.

But another Ninja catches Algren off-guard and slices at him with his short sword. As
Algren lifts his sword to parry the blow, HIS LITILE FINGER IS CHOPPED OFF.

He drops the sword, momentarily defenseless.

Across the hallway

Yoritomo has been watching the shadowpla y on the rice-paper walls.
Algren's attacker raises his blade to deliver the death blow.

In Katsumoto's room

Algren flinches involuntarily beneath the raised blade. Suddenly the Ninja JACKKNIFES
as if punched by an unseen hand. As he spins, dead, to the ground, we SEE an ARROW
lodged bet ween his shoulder blades. Yoritomo has FIRED blindly, through the wall ­
killing Algren's attacker.

Nearby, a Ninja hurls a throwing star at Katsumoto. With blind instinct Katsumoto
turns and takes the blade in the meat of his arm.

Algren, meanwhile, has ripped the sleeve of his kimono into a tourniquet for his maimed hand.
He uses the rest of the fabric TO TIE HIS HAND TO HIS SWORD before launching himself
back into the fray -- slicing an attacker just as he is about to impale Katsumoto.

Together, he and Katsumoto force the last two Ninjas through a paper wall to the next room.
They fight all the wa y through that room and BLAST through another paper wall to the next.

                                                                                                    70.
INT.                  INN ­ STAIRWAY                           NIGHT

The battle continues unabated on the stairs -- the Ninjas spring for position with
incredible grace --perching and fighting on banisters, leaping from one level to the next.


It is a mayhem of flashing swords and flailing limbs and flyi ng arrows and spinning Ninja stars.

Sprays of blood splatter against the white rice paper walls.

Some of the fighting is less than elegant. Men bite and wrestle and gouge to
survive in close quarters.

All of them arc bloody and sweat y and dirty and tired, heaving for breath, their skin flayed
open, their kimonos ripped, their hands and arms and faces blood-stained.

But more samurai reinforcements follow Ujio up the stairs: Together with Yoritomo
and Nakao, they have begun to gain the upper hand.

Ujio flings both his swords through the air -- killing two Ninjas -- and dives to
fight others - his martial arts skills are dazzling.

Algren and Katsumoto are fighting sidc by side

And we cut to --

EXT.                INN                             NIGHT

Outside of the inn, we slowl y pull away...

The sounds of the battle gradually fade...


Soon it is nothing more than a lovel y rustic inn nestled in the mountains.

INT.                          INN ­ STAIRWAY                        NIGHT

Later. The battle is over.

Ninja and samurai corpses litter the inn.

We slowl y move up the long stairwa y from the bottom...

Yoritomo pulls a Ninja star from Nakao's_shou1der. Then one from his own.

We move up another level, past more bodies...

Ujio moves through the Ninjas. Making sure they are dead. Before sheathing
his sword, he angrily FLICKS it at the rice paper wall, spattering it with the bloody spray.

Katsumoto wipes his sword on a nearby corpse, replaces it in its sheath. He sits beside
Algren on a stair. Both men are exhausted. Bloodied. Alive.

A long beat as we watch the two warriors.

Slow fade to...

                                                                                        71.

EXT.                TOKYO -- IMPERIAL PALACE                     DAY

Algren, Katsumoto and the others are nearing the palace. Algren slows to a
stop -- his path is toward the city. Katsumoto stops, looks at him, then does
something absolutel y extraordinary.


He kneels and bows before Algren. Quickly touching his head to the dirt.


Then he rises, turns and walks toward the palace.


Algren stands, stunned.

EXT.                  PARADE GROUND                              DAY

Algren walks onto the parade ground. The change he sees could not be more remarkable.
Thousands of new Japanese troops are drilling with new bolt-action Mausers. They
are precise, exact and frighteningly mechanistic, their uniforms new and crisp.

New German advisors are barking commands. Colonel Bagley sees him.

                                          BAGLEY
                           Algren? My God, you never cease to astonish.

Bagley runs over, hand extended, but Algren turns to look at the troops.

                                          ALGREN
                           They have new weapons.

                                              BAGLEY
                           The Kaiser was only too happy to help. Along
                           with his friends at Mauser and Krupp. Thank God we
                           Americans still have a few teeth in our head.

And they come to the "teeth." Howitzer cannons. A row of them. Artillery
officers in US Army uniforms arc instructing Japanese offi cers.

                                             BAGLEY
                           The ambassador and I have spent eight months
                           kissing Omura's ass so he'll sign the damn trade
                           pact with us. You spent all this time living with
                           those savages?
                                    (A1gren looks at him)
                           He's going to want to talk to you...

                                              ALGREN
                           I need a bath.

                                           BAGLEY
                           And your back pay, I imagine.

Algren starts walking away.

                                                                                                    72.

                                             BAGLEY
                           They got their flag. ...See?

And we see it... snapping on I flagpole high above the parade ground.


It is immediately familiar. A red circle on a white field. The Rising Sun.

The Howitzers fire in sequence. Thundering blasts that shake the heavens.


EXT,               ROYAL TEMPLE                               DAY


Omura stands above Emperor Meiji respectful but persistent.

The Emperor is kneeling, tending to his iris garden. It is one of the wonders of the Palace: a
sea of white, pink, blue, and purple blossoms.

Retainers and servants stand at a distance. One holds a standard with the Imperial seal: a yellow
chrysanthemum.

Omura sees Katsumoto making his way toward them. He talks a bit more quickly to the Emperor.

Katsumoto begins to prostrate himself before the Emperor, the usual sign of extreme
respect -- but the Emperor stops him:

                                             EMPEROR
                                   (subtitles)
                           No, Mori-san. We arc "civilized" now.

Katsumoto stops prostrating himself. The Emperor offers his hand.

                                              KATSUMOTO
                                    (subtitles)
                           I cannot touch the Sacred One.

                                             EMPEROR
                                   (subtitles)
                           You can.

It is a difficult moment for Katsumoto. He simply cannot do It.

                                             OMURA
                                   (subtitles)
                           Did you have a pleasant journey, Minister Katsumoto?

                                              KATSUMOTO
                                    (subtitles)
                           It was uneventful.

Omura appreciates Katsumoto's droll response. He assumes that Katsumoto is aware of
his part in the assassination attempt.

                                                                                          73.

                                              EMPEROR
                                    (subtitles)
                         If it is not a great imposition. I desire a moment alone with
                         Minister Katsumoto. Omura-San.

                                           OMURA

                                   (subtitles)
                         Enlightened One, perhaps I can be of service in a conversation
                         of state.

                                            EMPEROR
                                  (subtitles)
                         So kind of you, but I fear my old teacher wishes to upbraid
                         me in private for neglecting my studies.

Omura bows his head quickly and goes.


Silence. The Emperor gazes at Katsumoto. Then:

                                           EMPEROR
                                 (subtitles)
                         You rise against me, my teacher.

                                           KATSUMOTO
                                 (subtitles)
                         No, Highness, I rise against your enemies.

                                           EMPEROR
                                 (subtitles)
                         They are my teacher, my advisers, like you.

                                           KATSUMOTO
                                 (subtitles)
                         They advise in their own interest.

                                             EMPEROR
                                   (subtitles)
                         The world is changing, Mori -- you have not seen what
                         goes on beyond our borders, the inventions, the science.
                          I need men who can look outward, or soon we will be
                         left behind, and defenseless.

                                           KATSUM OTO
                                 (subtitles)
                         I am sworn to defend you even to my last breath.

                                            EMPEROR
                                   (subtit1es)
                         The samurai live in the past. You cannot defend against
                         a future you don't understand.

                                                                                         74.
                                            KATSUMOTO
                                  (subtitles)
                         If I am no use, then I will happily end my life,

                                            EMPEROR
                                  (subtitles)
                         No, Mori. It is my wish that you rejoin the Council of State.
                         I need your voice.

                                             KATSUMOTO
                                   (subtitles)
                         It is your voice that needs to be heard, Highness. You
                         are a living God, you can do what ever you
                         think is right.

The young emperor is silent a moment.

                                             EMPEROR
                                   (subtitles)
                         I am a living God only as long as I do what they
                         think is right.

                                            KATSUMOTO
                                  (subtitle)
                         Your Highness, may I beg forgiveness for saying
                         what a teacher must, that such a statement is pathetic
                         drivel not worthy of an ignorant stable boy, let alone
                         a young man I know to have some modest intelligence.

The emperor laughs warmly, almost happy to be scolded as he once was.

                                              EMPEROR
                                   (subtitles)
                         Is it possible a living God can be too afraid to make
                         his voice heard?
                                   (Katsumoto's look is not unkind)
                         Tell me what to do, Mori-San?

                                           KATSUMOTO
                                 (subtitles)
                         You are emperor, my Lord, not me. You must find
                         the wisdom for all of us.

EXT.                YOKOHAMA WHARF                             DAY

A series of warehouses, beyond which we see warships in the harbor. A1gren walks
with Bagley and two other OFFICERS.

INT.                      WAREHOUSE                            DAY


The cavernous warehouse piled high with huge crates.

                                                                                             75.
                                                BAGLEY
                             As soon as they sign the agreement, they're obligated
                             to buy the entire weapons package, from Colt revol vers
                             to Ha1liwell twelve-pounders. Plus this particular item
                             you might recognize.

A few stevedores tear open one of the crates. Algren hides his astonishment:
A Gatling Gun is revealed.

                                              BAGLEY
                             They've been calibrated to fire 200 rounds a minute,
                             The new copper cartridges cut down on jamming.

Algren closes his eyes, trying to keep his memories at bay.

EXT.                           TOKYO STREETS                          DAY

Algren fights the crowds with Colonel Bagley And Ambassador Swanbeck..

                                             ALGREN (V.O.)
                             May 15, 1877. The city I return to is immeasurabl y
                             changed

New construction ever ywhere. Telegraph wires strung next to an ancient
temple. A modern European hotel is going up, dwarfing the traditional Japanese
buildings. Huge billboards advertising Western goods. A new invention, the rickshaw,
has replaced many of the palanquins.

                                             ALGREN (V.O.)
                             As though Tokyo were determined to become
                             another New York or Chicago .- all in one
                             headlong rush.

Spider's web of telegraph cables spread from a tall new brick building.
It is like a New York office building stabbing into the heart of old
Japan.

The familiar Omura character is emblazoned on the side.

Aside from the occasional bit of Japanese decor, this could be a buzzing Wall Street firm.

Telegraph operators click away. Accountants use adding machines. Secretaries
use pneumatic tubes to send documents back and forth. Engineers plot out
railway lines. All are dressed in Western clothes.

Algren, Colonel Bagley, and Ambassador Swanbeck enter.

                                               AMBASSADOR SWANBECK
                                      (to Algren)
                             If he asks, you can talk about ordnance and tactics.
                             But remember, this has to do with a lot more than
                             just weapons.

                                                                                                        76.

An anteroom holds waiting delegations from the various European powers.
A babel of language. ... French ...Dutch ...Russian ...German.

A pretty American secretary looks up from her desk.

                                         SECRETARY
                           Ambassador Swanbeck, if you'll follow me.

Some of the delegates arc craning forward, watching Algren and the others hungrily
as they head into the final office.

INT.             OMURA'S OFFICE                            DAY

Omura stands like an industrial titan before large picture windows offering a dramatic view of Tokyo.
The only decoration in the room is an enormous Caravaggio.

                                             OMURA
                           Please, sit down, gentlemen.

Omura removes a gold cigarette case and lights up. Cigarettes are the newest Western fad
Sweeping Japan.

                                               OMURA
                                     (re: cigarette case)
                           A gift from Czar Alexander... Captain Algren,. it seems
                           you have endured your captivity with little ill-effect.

                                             ALGREN
                           Yes, sir.

                                             OMURA
                           He's an extraordinary man, isn't he?

                                             ALGREN
                           He is samurai.

Omura gazes at him. Slowl y takes I puff from his cigarette.

                                             AMBASSADOR SWANBECK
                           Mr. Omura, my people have been drawing up the documents
                           we discussed. I have a draft--

                                             OMURA
                           We're not quite ready to announce the treaty, Ambassador.

                                             AMBASSADOR SWANBECK
                           Excuse me?

                                              OMURA
                           The Emperor is...sentimental. Katsumoto was his old mentor--
                           he is not eager to offend him. It will take I few more days.

                                                                                      77.
                                         AMBASSJ\DOR SW ANBECK
                         How many da ys is " a few?"

                                           OMURA
                         I assure you the Samurai will not stand in the
                         wa y of our agreement. You are prepared to make deliver y?

                                        AMBASSADOR SWANBECK
                         Soon as your emperor signs on the dotted line.

                                           OMURA
                         Captain Algren you are the expert. Will this array of
                         ordnance be sufficient?

                                         ALGREN
                         Depends on what you're trying to accomplish.

                                          OMURA
                         I want my country to take its place as a modern power.

                                           ALGREN
                         Then they will set you well on your way.

                                           OMURA
                         I am pleased.



                                          AMDASSADOR SW ANBECK
                         Mr. Omura, you assured us you had the influence
                         with your emperor to make this deal come to
                         pass. With all due respect perhaps there is someone
                         else we should be speaking to.

                                           OMURA
                         With all due respect, Ambassador, perhaps there is
                         someone else we should be speaking to, for instance the
                         French. Or the English. Or any of the legations waiting
                         in the next room.

Ambassador Swan beck stands swallowing his rage.

                                          AMBASSADOR SWANBECK
                         Yes, we1l, we look forward to hearing from you.

                                          OMURA
                         Good afternoon, gentlemen.

They start to go.

                                          OMURA
                         Captain Algren, perhaps you can stay a moment
                         And tell me of your experiences in our rebellious
                         provinces.

Bagley looks at Algren. Do as he asks. He leaves A1gren alone with Omura.

                                                                                       78.

                                            OMURA
                          Cigarette?

                                            ALGREN
                          Thank you.


Omura lights his cigarette. A moment as he takes Algren's measure.

                                             OMURA
                          You fought bravely on behalf of our army--
                          against the rebel Katsumoto.

Algren says nothing.                            .

                                           OMURA
                          And yet you helped save his life when attacked
                          by the Ninja.

                                         ALGREN
                          My role was much less significant than you may have heard.

                                           OMURA
                          Tell me about your role in Katsumoto's plans.

                                            ALGREN
                          I have none.

                                         OMURA
                          And your sympathies?

                                            ALGREN
                          Again, I have none.


                                           OMURA
                          I know you have little sympathy for Colonel Bagley.

                                           ALGREN
                          He is.... unsympathetic.

Omura smiles.

                                            OMURA
                          I thought it was we who are inscrutable.

Now it is Algren who smiles.

                                           OMURA
                          You have gained important knowledge of Katsumoto's
                          province, his army, and his rebellion. This is extremely
                          valuable to me.

He watches Algren to see how this lands.

                                                                                           79.

                                            OMURA
                           You also possess significant knowledge of m y army, my
                           weaponry, and my plans. This is extremely va1uable to
                           Katsumoto.

                                             ALGREN
                           Again, you flatter me.

                                               OMURA
                           No. I am a businessman. I recognize what is valuable.
                           And I buy it.
                                     (looks at him)
                           In this case, I value your loyalt y.

Algren considers the implications of what Omura is saying.

                                             ALGREN
                           I didn't know loyalt y was something that could be sold.

                                             OMURA
                           Then perhaps you will give it, as a token of future
                           friendship - for which, as a friend, I would be in your debt.

                                             ALGREN
                                   (stands)
                           Then I will consider it.

                                             OMURA
                           And I will be grateful.

INT.                    SHIPPING OFFICE                      DAY


Algren is in a shipping office. A clerk consults his schedule of departure.

                                              CLERK
                           All righteee, the ANDREW JACKSON leaves tomorrow ­
                           if you want a steamship you'll have to wait six weeks.
                                    (Algren is silent)
                           Gets ya to Frisco by the 28th. 14 dollars for a
                           private cabin, 8 for a shared or 3 for a lower berth.
                           What can I put you down for?

Algren is silent, concentrating on a calendar hanging behind the clerk. It
features a beautiful Hiroshigi watercolor of mountains.

                                              CLERK
                           Sir..?

                                              ALGREN
                                    (after a moment)
                           Private cabin.

                                                                                                  80.
EXT.                   TOKYO ­ STREET                             DAY


Graham walks with Algren.

                                             GRAHAM
                            Leave? Wh y would you leave now? No white
                            man has ever been in your position. Do you
                            have any idea what it will mean to have Omura
                            as your friend? You want land, you want women,
                            you want boys?

Algren starts to walk faster, but Graham Stops him.

                                                GRAHAM
                            Nathan. I wanted to leave, too. For three years.
                            You must believe me there is a majest y about
                            these people -- can you imagine what your own
                            country would be if it had half the drive and the
                            discipline and the belief and the bravery of these
                            ridiculous little people?

Then raised voices from across the street stop them.

They see Yoritomo surrounded by four Imperial Army soldiers. The soldiers
are rough and imperious, drunk with power. They carry gleaming rifle..

The soldiers bark orders. Yoritomo stands proudly, responding calmly.

                                               ALGREN

                            Whit is this?

                                              GRAHAM
                            My God, it's the edicts...

                                               ALGREN
                            What edicts?

Algren arrives as the situation is clearly growing volatile - the soldiers are
pointing to Yoritomo's head, screaming


Algren steps toward the soldiers--

                                               ALGREN
                            That's enough--

One of the soldiers SCREAMS at him -- raises his rifle -- all the soldiers raise their rifles ­
Yoritomo reaches for his sword -- Algren tries to push through -

                                                                                              81.
                                           ALGREN
                                 (subtitles)
                           YORITOMO, WAIT!

One of the soldiers smacks Algren in the chin with a rifle butt. Algren reels,
and by the time he stands straight again, four others are pointing their
ba yonets at his face.

Graham takes hold of Algren's arm.

                                              GRAHAM
                           Don't be stupid.

Algren makes eye contact with Yoritomo, who -- in deference to his friend --
puts his sword away.

The Japanese soldiers continue to scream at Yoritomo. They force him to his knees.
Rifles pressed to his head.

Yoritomo bows his bead, speaking quietly, as if praying.

Algren witches in horror all one of the soldiers removes his bayonet -- another grab.
Yoritomo's hair, jerks his head back and begins hacking off Yoritomo's traditional top-knot
of hair. Brutally. Blood.

Yoritomo remains kneeling, head down, blood flowing down his face.

The soldiers laugh and move off.

Algren kneels by Yoritomo. Yoritomo looks up at him. There are tears in
his eyes.

EXT.                  KATSUMOTO'S HOUSE                                    DUSK

Katsumoto's house on the outskirts of Tokyo is spacious and
harmonious. Utterly Japanese. Samurai guards in full regalia, stand
menacingly outside.

INT.                   KATSUMOTO'S HOUSE                                   DUSK

Ujio kneels with Yoritomo, dressing the wounds on his head.

Graham sits across the room talking quietly to the mammoth Nakao, taking
notes in a small notebook. Nakao has been brutally shorn of his top knot
as well. His shame is apparent.

INT.                     KATSUMOTO'S CHAMBER                          DUSK

Servants he1p dress Katsumoto in his exacting samurai wardrobe as Algren is ushered in.

                                             KATSUMOTO
                           Captain, I had not thought to see you again.

                                                                                      82.
                                             ALGREN
                          I'm leaving tomorrow. But before I go I need to
                          tell you what's going on here.

                                            KATSUMOTO
                          You mean the Gatling Guns and the howitzers,
                          is that how you sa y it?

                                             ALGREN
                          They're about to close a trade agreement that
                          will bring this country more weapons than
                          you can imagine.

                                            KATSUMOTO
                          Yes, if the emperor agrees - but Omura knows
                          the Emperor must be convinced there is cause to
                          need those weapons before be will sign.

                                           ALGREN
                                  (realizing)
                          And you are to be the cause...

                                              KATSUMOTO
                          Elegant, isn't it? Omura passes laws sure to cause
                          a samurai revolt, creating a need for the weapons.
                          The Emperor sees that the weapons are needed
                          so he agrees to the entire treaty, giving your
                          country what it wants and the Omura Zaibatsu
                          what it wants. And my country is sold to yours.

As Katsumoto dresses, Algren notes that Katsumoto's body it at battleground
of old scars, so like his own.

                                            KA TSUMOTO
                          Today the Council passed two edicts. The first called for
                          the elimination of our traditional topknots.

                                             ALGREN
                          I know.

                                          KATSUMOTO
                          The second banned the wearing of sword.

Algren stops. He knows what swords mean to the samurai.


                                            KATSUMOTO
                                  (re: his swords)
                          Hand them to me, will you?

Algren picks up Katsumoto's two swords. Looks at him deeply.

                                             ALGREN
                          If you do this, they will kill you.

                                                                                                         83.
                                                KA TSUMOTO
                           I am hard to kill.

                                           ALGREN
                           You don't know what their weapons can do. All
                           your men butchered ... Just for pride.

                                             KATSUMOTO
                           Not for pride. For the emperor.

                                            ALGREN
                           But the emperor is the one signing the agreement.

                                            KATSUMOTO
                           He has not signed it yet.

He holds out Katsumoto's two samurai swords.

                                                 ALGREN
                           Is it worth it? ... just for these,

                                             KATSUMOTO
                           I cannot live without my soul ... Can you?

They regard each other.


EXT.                      OUTSIDE KATSUMOTO'S HOUSE                           NIGHT

Algren leaves Katsumoto's gate and sets off on foot.


EXT.                        TOKYO STREETS                               NIGHT

As Algren walks, he becomes aware that he is being followed. Two dark figures
lurk some distance behind him. After a few moments, he whips around to face
them. They stand for a moment, then melt away into the shadows.

INT.                      COUNCIL OF STATE CHAMBER                          NIGHT

The Council of State meets in an august chamber. Many of the Council
members wear Western clothes. Cigarette smoke billows.

The young Emperor sits on a dais off to the side, as befits his
ceremonial role in the proceedings.

Omura is speaking ... be stops ... looking at something ... all the Council members turn ... and gape.


Katsumoto strides into the chamber, his swords proudly displayed.

                                              OMURA
                                    (subtitled)
                           Minister Katsumoto, you honor us.

                                                                                            84.
                                              KATSUMOTO
                                    (subtitled)
                          It is my honor to join again the men who are leading
                          Japan into her glorious future.

                                            OMURA
                                  (subtitled)
                          You arc perhaps unaware of this Council's edict
                          regarding the wearing of swords?

                                              KATSUMOTO
                                   (subtitled)
                          I read ever y edict with singular attention.

                                            OMURA
                                  (subtitled)
                          Yet you would bring weapons into this chamber?

                                            KATSUMOTO
                                  (subtitled)
                          This chamber was protected by m y sword for four hundred
                          years--

                                          OMURA
                                 (interrupting, subtitled)
                          We need no protection... We are a nation of laws now.

                                             KATSUMOTO
                                    (calm, subtitled) .
                          We are a nation of whores. Selling ourselves to our Western
                          "allies."

Katsumoto slowl y looks around at the Members of the Council, but his words are addressed
to the Emperor.

                                            KATSUMOTO
                                  (subtitled)
                          Does Japan no longer need its patriots?

Omura speaks with quiet conviction and honesty.

                                             OMURA
                                   (subtitled)
                          Who is the patriot? The man who would keep his
                          country trapped in the past, or the man who would help
                          his people into the future?

                                             KATSUMOTO
                                   (subtitled)
                          A future with no honor,

                                             OMURA
                                   (subtitled)
                          Honor means less to me than feeding our children. And
                          teaching them. And giving them modern medicine so
                          they will live.    .

                                                                                     85.

                                            KATSUMOTO
                           And lining your own pockets in the process.

They stare at one another with barely concealed hostility.

                                               OMURA
                                     (subtitled)
                           Minister Katsumoto, it is with great regret that I ask
                           you to remove your sword, as this body has declared
                           in its edict.

Katsumoto's hand closes on his sword hilt

                                            KATSUMOTO
                           This sword serves the emperor, and only he can
                           command me to remove it.


Katsumoto looks to the Emperor, as murmurs fill the room.

                                               OMURA
                                    (quickly)
                           Ah, but it is our tradition that the Emperor's voice is
                           too pure and great to be heard in such worldly
                           circumstance as the Council of State.

One last time, Katsumoto meets the Emperor's eye.

                                             KATSUMOTO
                           Then, with great regret, I must refuse to give up my
                           sword.

Omura looks to his associates, and a silent decision is made.

                                             OMURA
                           Minister Katsumoto, I must invite you to
                           accompany our soldiers to Himeji Castle, where
                           you will be our honored guest. I think you will
                           find the surroundings there quite harmonious.

Guards with Mauser rifles move into position around Katsumoto. He turns to
the other Council members. Looks at them.

                                              KA TSUMOTO
                                    (subtitled)
                           Brothers ... One day you will know what you have done
                           and feel what I never will ... shame.

Omura nods to the guards. The guards lead Katsumoto out.

                                                                                                  86.
EXT.                            LIVING QUARTERS                       AFTERNOON

A BEARER is loading the last of Algren's luggage on the back of a rickshaw.
Algren emerges from the building, sees the same two disreputable MEN
who followed him earlier lurking nearby.

He resists the temptation to confront them. Instead he climbs into the
rickshaw and it starts off.
But a moment later, Graham has jogged alongside, huffing and puffing.

                                                      GRAHAM
                                     Thought I'd missed you. Were you going to leave
                                     without even saying goodbye?

                                                        ALGREN
                                     I have a fear of sentimental Englishmen.

                                                       GRAHAM
                                     You sod.
                                              (trying to keep up)
                                     Christ, give us. . second here

Algren indicates for the bearer to stop. Graham tries to catch his breath.

                                                       GRAHAM
                                     You're making a mistake, I promise you.
                                     Katsumoto's under house arrest, Omura's made
                                     his move -- he'll need you more than ever --

Graham stops, sees the look on Algren's face, realizes.

                                                        GRAHAM
                                     Oh, my goodness. How silly of me.. All that
                                     time you were with him, up in those mountains,
..................................   ...I told you they were a remarkable people...

Algren doesn't answer, but isn't denying it either.

                                                     GRAHAM
                                     Then you should get out. Because Omura will
                                     become rather impatient with anyone who isn't on the team.

Graham notices Algren staring at his followers.

                                                       GRAHAM
                                     Case in point.

                                                       ALGREN
                                     Who are they?

                                                       GRAHAM
                                     Ronin would be m y guess. Disgraced samurai
                                     doing odd jobs for his Nibs.

                                                                                 87.

                                           ALGREN
                           What do they want from me?

                                            GRAHAM
                           To make sure you're on the side of God and
                           Country, or to make sure you get the hell out.

                                            ALGREN
                           You've been a great help, Graham. I thank you.

                                            GRAHAM
                           Look who's getting sentimental now.

A look bet ween them, then Algren nods for the bearer to continue.


EXT.                  HARBOR                             SUNSET

Algren stands at the gangplank. Porters wait with his luggage. Algren looks
back into the crowd and sees the ronin. They glare back, no longer trying to
keep out of sight.

A BLAST from the steam whistle.

Algren looks from the ship, to the ronin, to the bustling, chaotic city behind
them. Finally, he looks out at the harbor and the ocean, beyond which
used to lie his home.

He turns to the bearer.

                                             ALGREN
                                   (subtitles)
                           Take back to quarters. I walk.

And Algren starts back into the city.

EXT.             TOKYO STREETS               EVENING

Down a shadowy street, lit only by t orches. Slowl y we realize he is being
followed and that he knows it.

Up ahead, the street appears to dead-end.

The two Ronin step out from the shadows and face him, their hands on
their swords.

Behind him, Another dangerous looking Ronin joins the one who has been
following him.

They begin to close in.

Algren stands completely still. They grow closer.

Algren appears to close his eyes. And the sound of the approaching footsteps
fades as We HEAR ONLY the sound of his breathing.

                                                                                                             88.

The Ronin draw their swords.

Algren gently opens his eyes. Ever ything has SLOWED DOWN: a sign in
the breeze, a piece of rubbish on the street, the flame of a nearby torch.

A BLUR OF MOTION.

Everything happens so fast it is hard to tell just what has taken place. In the
strobing shadows, all we really know is that Algren has leapt to the attack.

Within seconds, four bodies lie in the street

Algren holds bloody sword.

His face is cut and a sleeve of his jacket is ripped, but other than that he is
unharmed. Ujio has taught him welt

As he stands, catching his breath, we HOLD on his face in CLOSE-UP.

A sudden flash:

We see Algren grab one of the torches and smash it across the ronin's face.

It is the attack ­ replayed in real-time.

Rolling to avoid a death-blow, he grabs the fallen man's sword and eviscerates attacker #2.

The two remaining Ronin strike.

He parries the blow of attacker #3, whirls to slice the legs of attacker #4,
whirls again to cut off the hand of attacker #1, who has returned to the attack.

Meanwhile, attacker #3 serums and charges -- just lit attacker #4 is trying to stand.

Algren steps back as attacker #3 impales attacker #4. Algren steps forward and cuts off the head of attacker #3.


Even now, it has happened too fast to be truly appreciated.

BACK TO THE STREET

We move, closer-still on Algren's face.

A sudden flash:

And so we watch the attack again. in super-slow motion now, so we can fully
appreciate it's terrible beauty.

A torch smashes across a face.

A sword slices the sleeve of a coat.

Sparks fly as two swords meet.

                                                                               89.
A severed hand falls in the dirt.

Blood sprays from a decapitated head.

A sword is wiped clean.

BACK TO THE STREET

In real time, Algren kneels to examine one of the dead Ronin. On his arm is
tattooed a familiar emblem:
The sign of the Omura Zaibatsu


EXT.                OMURA CASTLE                       NIGHT

Omura lives in a huge medieval castle on a promontory directly above Tokyo
Ba y. A testament to Japan's martial past.

INT.                  CASTLE ­ TOWER                       NIGHT

Two guards arc: standing at attention in a dank corridor high in one of the
towers of the castle. Cell doors line the corridor.

Katsumoto's samurai swords lean against the wall next to them.

INT.                       CASTLE ­ CELL                           NIGHT

Katsumoto kneels in a cramped cell. A sound draws his attention. He rises
and looks out a barred window.

Bel ow he sees two rickshaws moving up the twisting road to the castle.


INT.                       RICKSHAW                     NIGHT

Algren and Bagley, in formal dress uniforms, sit in one of the rickshaws.
Bagley looks him over.

                                            BAGLEY
                            Oughtta shave more often, Algren. Becomes you.

                                             ALGREN
                            Thought I would follow the Japanese fashion.

                                             BAGLEY
                            ...Heard you were leaving, actually?

                                            ALGREN
                            Why would I do that? Omura wants me to train his
                            personal guard.

                                             BAGLEY
                            Certainly seems obsessed by you. Why do you
                            think that is?

                                                                                               90.
                                           ALGREN
                          Could it be my nose isn't permanently lodged up
                          his ass?

Bagley shakes his bead, turns away. Algren stares up at the looming aide.


EXT.                       CASTLE- MAIN GATES                               NIGHT

The two rickshaws stop by the heavily-guarded main gates. Guards check the occupants. Motion
to other guards atop the gates.

The main gates slowl y swing open.


EXT.                   CASTLE - COURT YARD                 NIGHT

The bearers lower the rickshaws. Algren and Bagley climb from one.
Ambassador Swanbeck climbs from the other.

EXT.              CASTLE -- RECEPTION CHAMBE R                         NIGHT

Omura waits in elegant evening clothes. A woman plays a harp. The interior
of Omura's castle is heavy, oppressive. Old Masters paintings dot the walls.
Leather-bound boob. Chippendale furniture.

                                             OMURA
                          Gentlemen...

                                          AMBASSADOR SWANBECK
                          Omura, you have a lovel y home. It must be very old.

                                             OMURA
                          Nothing is "old" in Japan, ever ything is "ancient."
                          ... But the views are pleasant. Sit down...

They move to chairs by the roaring fireplace as Omura turns to Algren,
noticing the cut on his face, but saying nothing.

                                             OMURA
                          Do you know your Wagner, Captain? This is
                          the 'Leibestod' from Tristan and Isolde.

                                             ALGREN
                          I'm surprised you enjoy it. Literally translated it
                          means `love/death. '
                                   (looks at him)         .
                          A samurai concept, don't you think?

The two men take each other's measures. Servants appear with trays..


                                        OMURA
                          Champagne? And cigars, of course.

                                                                                       91.

Servants light their cigars.

                                                   BAGLEY
                                         (re: cigar)
                               A gift from President Grant?

                                                 OMURA
                                      (smiles)
                               Queen Victoria.

                                               ALGREN
                               Mr. Omura, may I use the necessit y?

                                                 OMURA
                               Certainly.


Omura summons a servant. The servant escorts Algren out.

                                                 OMURA
                               Now, Mr. Swanbeck, regarding our agreement, I noticed
                               a discrepancy in paragraph seven in reference to the
                               investment protocols for coal.

INT.                           CASTLE ­ CORRIDOR                          NIGHT

The servant leads Algren through a corridor, head bowed.

Then, stil1 puffing on his cigar, Algren taps the servant on the back, and as
the man turns, decks him. The servant falls.

Algren flicks hit cigar out onto the sloping roof. We FOLLOW the
BURNING EMBER as it rolls off the roof and lands at the feet of TWO
CURIOUS GUARDS.

EXT.                     CASTLE COURTYARD                        NIGHT

The guards look up, trying to determine where the cigar butt has come from.
But their curiosity lasts only a moment: ARROWS pierce their necks,
strangling any sound.

We REVERSE to discover that one of the rickshaw-bearers has fired the
arrows. As he peels back his hood, we SEE it is Yoritomo.

We realize the other bearers are Ujio, Nakao, and Simon Graham. They
hurry past the dead guards and up the stairs.

INT.                 CASTLE APPROACH                            NIGHT

The three samurai and Graham race up the winding parapets.

Three GUARDS round a corner. Swords flash as Ujio and Nakao dispatch
them without even slowing. They race on, Graham laboring to keep up.

                                                                                  92.
INT.                    CASTLE KEEP                     NIGHT

Algren rounds a corner--

Ujio, Yoritomo, Nakao, and Graham are moving toward him.

                                              ALGREN
                           This wa y...

Clearly, this has all been Algren's plan. They move up a stairwa y.

INT.                CASTLE KEEP (SECOND FLOOR)                           NIGHT

The three guards are still standing at attention outside Katsumoto's cell.
His swords are next to them.

Algren keeps the others out of sight and lowers his head to whisper with
Ujio. Ujio nods, then walks into sight and calmly approaches the guards.

Still hidden, Algren gestures for the others remain to silent. After a
moment, he gestures that they can proceed.

Algren and the others round the comer to discover the bloody remains of
the three guards - whom Ujio has dispatched in absolute silence. They unlock
the cell.

INT.                   CASTLE ­ CELL                         FOLLOWING

Katsumoto is shocked to see Algren enter. Algren tosses him his swords.

                                           ALGREN
                           How's the poem coming?

                                            KATSUMOTO
                           The ending is proving difficult.

INT.                      CASTLE -- RECEPTION CHAMBER                     NIGHT


Omura glances up from the documents.

                                            OMURA
                                What has become of Captain Algren?

INT.                       CASTLE ­ CORRIDOR                          NIGHT

Algren, Katsumoto, and the others race through an upper corridor.

                                           KATSUMOTO
                                   (re:Graham)
                           Who is this?

                                          ALGREN
                           Name's Simon Graham. Wants to write a book
                           about you.

                                                                                   93.

                                                GRAHAM
                           An honor. I have followed your activities with
                           great interest. I think the European public
                           would be fascinated by a book about your
                           adventures.

                                            KATSUMOTO
                           Not a book. A play!

Suddenly, from below, the raised voices of guards. They hurry a wa y.

INT.               CASTLE ­ STAIRS                     NIGHT

Guards carrying pikes race up the stairs--


INT.                CASTLE ­ CORRIDOR                  NIGHT

Algren and the others are moving swiftl y down a stone corridor.

The sound of the approaching guards is growing louder.

A silent WILD BUNCH moment of preparation as they stride down the
corridor, five abreast.

Algren pulls the cavalry saber from his dress uniform. Katsumoto prepares
his swords. Nakao stretches his huge arms. Yoritomo and Uji o draw their bows.

EXT.                   CASTLE - UPPER COURTYARD                        FOLLOWING

Ten guards with rifles patrol the upper battlements.

Yoritomo and Uji o crouch and fire. Arrow a fter arrow a fter arrow, as
fast as a repeating rifle, the arrows streak through the night.
Completely silent.

It is a dazzling display. They time shots to sail over walls, shoot through
tiny windows, shoot out torches. Multiple arrows. Perfect aim.

In a matter of seconds all ten guards are dead.

They continue across the courtyard, up some steps --

INT.             CASTLE--TIGHT CORRIDOR                         FOLLOWING

They stride through a tight, dark stone corridor.

Suddenly, a cadre of Omura guards emerge from the shadows.

Without hesitation, they launch into battle. Algren and Katsumoto wield
their swords. Yoritomo and Ujio fire arrows.

Nakao fights with his hands, dramatic martial arts from the huge man.

                                                                                                                 94.
But this corridor is just too tight -- it is a sea of combat.. the guards and
our warriors are slammed together --the swords and pikes sending up sparks
in the darkness as they strike the stone walls.

The right corridor echoes with samurai war cries and clanging swords.

Then...

More guards appear.

These guards have rifles.

Rifle blasts thunder --startling strobe-like bursts of light in the darkness --

Algren dives in front of Katsumoto to protect him-

Yoritomo is hit-

He jerks back -- blood--

Ujio fires arrows at the guards with rifles, hitting two -- but more guards with rifles are appearing, bullets
sending showers of debris and ricochets--

Algren sees a stairway leading to a higher 1evel, barks out a command. As Nakao drags
Yoritomo toward the stairs-- the others bolt a heavy SIEGE DOOR ­
designed to keep attackers at bay.

INT.                        CASTLE SIEGE ROOM                           NIGHT

Ujio fires arrows through the siege ports -- momentarily delaying the guards
as Algren leads them toward a rear stairs.

INT.                       REAR STAIRS                      NIGHT

Algren starts down -- only to discover MORE GUARDS blocking this means
of escape. He backs out of the wa y just in time as rifle blasts SPLINTER
the wooden stairwe11.

Meanwhile, an EXPLOSION from behind them indicates that the guards
have blown the siege door.

Algren, Graham, and Ujio have no choice but to continue upwards into the
castle keep. Nakao helps the wounded Yoritomo as they climb.

INT.                UPPER KEEP                    NIGHT

A narrow ladder leads to the final redoubt. They start to climb but Yoritomo
leans against the wall. He is gravely wounded.

                                                ALGREN
                            Come on.

                                              YORITOMO
                                    (subtitled)
                            You go, Algren-san. I will stop them.

                                                                                   95.

                                             ALGREN
                           No--

                                             YORITOMO
                           ...Please.

Yoritomo's determination is absolute. Finally, Algren nods.

Katsumoto moves to Yoritomo, leans in for a few final words, taking his
head and pressing his forehead to Yoritomo's.

Bullets begin ricocheting around them -- Yoritomo looks to Algren:

                                              YORITOMO
                                    (subtitled)
                           Tell my family.

Algren bows his bead in respect.

Then Algren leads them up the stairs. Ujio fires a final volley, nods with
respect to Yoritomo, then follows the others.


Yoritomo pulls himself erect. Draws his two samurai swords.

A beat. He closes his eyes. Smiles.

Then he opens his eyes and hurls himself down the stairs--

The guards fire hitting Yoritomo - but still he comes -- wading into them
swords flashing -- he is hit again and again -- but still he comes.

It is a glorious death.

EXT.                      SIEGE ROOM                     NIGHT

Algren leads them into the highest room of the castle, the siege room. The
echoes Yoritomo's death rings in their ears.                                   .

Katsumoto glances at Ujio and Nakao. Without a word, they kneel on the
floor, open their kimonos and unsheathe their short-swords, preparing to
commit seppuku.

                                             ALGREN
                           No. Wait...!

Katsumoto glares at him harshly, furious to have his concentration disturbed
at such a moment.

                                              ALGREN
                           There's a wa y out. Look--!

Reluctantly, Katsumoto joins him at the window.

                                                                                                        96.
                                                ALGREN
                             This place is designed to keep people from getting
                             in, not from getting out. We can make it

                                              KA TSUMOTO
                             This was your plan?

                                              ALGREN
                             Do you have a better one?

Nakao and Ujio look at Katsumoto, awaiting his response. He turns to Algren.

                                                 ALGREN
                             I may die. But I'll die trying.

And without another word he LAUNCHES himself out the window, onto the sloping roof.

EXT.                   CASTLE ROOF TOPS                          NIGHT

Like his cigar butt earlier in the sequence, he rolls, then falls, hits another
roof, rolls, slides, falls, hits again.

INT.                  UPPER KEEP                          CONTINUOUS

Katsumoto and the others share a look. Has he survived?

GUNFIRE begins to pepper the floorboards, bullets whistling past them.


EXT.                 CASTLE ROQF TOPS                          CONTINUOUS

Algren slides, bumps, rolls, falls, hits, then slides again. Until he finally plummets into the moat.

As his head rises above water, he lets out a scream of absolute joy.

INT.                  UPPER KEEP                    CONTINUOUS

Katsumoto hears the scream. A look of disbelief spreads over his face.
Then the beginnings of a smile. Without a second look, be leaps out the
window. Ujio follows.

Graham shrinks away in fear. Nakao lifts him bodily, throws him out, and then follows.

INT.                      CASTLE -- RECEPTION CHAMBER                        LATER

Omura stands, very calm, smoking a cigarette, listening to the report of his guards.
Colonel Bagley tries to apologize.

                                               BAGLEY
                             ... 1 don't know what to say, sir. I never would
                             have thought him capable of treason.

                                              OMURA
                             I would say Captain Algren's acts tonight have
                             assured our success.

                                                                                 97.
                                          AMBASSADOR SWANBECK
                           What do you mean?

                                             OMURA
                           Katsumoto will rejoin his kinsmen. They will fight.
                           We will destroy them with your new weapons.

                                             BAGLEY
                           What if he just goes off to the mountains and
                           becomes a damn sheep-herder or some such?

                                             OMURA
                           You still do not understand us ... Katsumoto can
                           do nothing but fight. It is his role in the drama.
                           He must act out his destiny. He knows it.

                                              AMBASSADOR SWANBECK
                           You trust a lot in destiny.

                                               OMURA
                           This story was written years ago. From the first
                           sight of your warships in our harbor...
                                      (stares out the window)
                           It is a1l inevitable.

EXT.             HILLS                           SUNSET

Algren, Katsumoto, and the others ride over rocky ground.

                                            ALGREN (V.O.)
                           June 1, 1877. Yesterday, I passed the field where
                           Zebulon Gant was killed by the man with whom
                           I now ride.
In the distance a steam train chugs along. Inevitable. Progress.


EXT.                 FOREST ­ MOUNTAINS                     DAY

They climb a steep trail. Beyond, the glaciers glow pink.


                                             ALGREN (V.O.)
                           I am beset by ironies -- trained to fight rebels
                           now I am one. And yet 1 ask mysel f... can a man
                           be reborn?:

Algren, Katsumoto, and the others ride through a dense forest Katsumoto
reins his horse. The others follow suit. They wait

                                            ALGREN (V.O.)
                           And if so, what would he make of it?

Mounted samurai emerge from the thick forest As it they were invisible.

                                                                                98.
The leader leaps from his horse and bows, touching his head to the dirt.
All the other samurai follow suit.

EXT.    CHERRY TREE FOREST--NEAR THE VILLAGE                       EVENING

Katsumoto rides at the head of his samurai as they pass through the cherry
orchard. Then he reins his horse and falls in beside Algren.

                                              KATSUMOTO
                                    (his voice troubled)
                           I was prepared to die in Omura's castle. And
                           yet here I am. I cannot help but ask why were
                           you sent into my life. What is the lesson you
                           were meant to give me?

                                            ALGREN
                           Maybe that neither of us is as smart as we
                           thought...

Katsumoto laugh. And then in a surprisingly deft imitation of Algren


                                              KATSUMOTO
                           You...ain't whistlin' Dixie...


He spurs his horse and heads off. Algren shakes his head and follows.

EXT.               VILLAGE                     EVENING

The returning warriors are warmly welcomed by the villagers.


Algren rides directly to Yoritomo's house, dismounts.

Taka and Toshiie are waiting.

He goes to them. His expression tells them all they need to know.

INT.          YORITOMO'S HOUSE                           NIGHT


Algren sits with the family. The boys sit next to their mother.

                                     (subtitles)
                           ... he gave his life to save us. He died bravel y.

                                   (subtitles)
                           Thank you, Algren-San.

                                                                                    99.

                           Will you fight the white men?

                                     (subtitles)
                           If they come here, yes.

                           Why?

                                   (subtitles)
                           Because they come to destroy what I have come to love.

Taka looks at him, moved and surprised. Suddenly, Higen jumps up and
bolts... out of the room. Algren looks to Taka.

                                              TAKA
                                    (subtitles)
                           The wa y of Samurai is difficult for children. He
                           misses his father.

                                            ALGREN
                           And he is angry because I am the cause of that.

She smiles ever so slightly at his obliviousness.

                                             TAKA
                           No. He it angry because he fears you will die as well.

EXT.             VILLAGE                    NIGHT

Higen stands, looking up at the stars.

                                              ALGREN
                           Higen.

                           My father taught me it is glorious to die in battle.

                                    (subtitles)
                           That is what he believed.

                           I would be afraid to die in battle.

                                             ALGREN
                                   (subtitles)
                           So would I.

                                                                                  100.

                            But you have been in many battles.

                                    (subtitles)
                            And I was always afraid.

Higen looks at him, tears welling in his eyes.

                                               HIGEN
                                     (subtitles)
                            I don't want you to go.

Algren has no answer. He can only gather the boy up in his arms and hold
him.

EXT VILLAGE DAY

Nakao is standing proudly, his massive arms folded across his chest. We
pull back: Graham is bunched behind his photographic equipment. A flash
of phosphorous and the moment is immortalized.

Meanwhile, Algren is working with Higen on the house.

Katsumoto silently watches Algren working with the boy.

                                                 KATSUMOTO
                            Algren-san.

Algren turns.

                                                 KATSUMOTO
                            They are corning.

EXT      MOUNTAINS          DAY

Algren and Katsumoto perch on a precipice, looking down into a valley.

It is a beautiful setting. Towering peaks and peaceful valleys. It is here that
the final act of the inevitable drama will play out.

Bel ow they see the Imperial Army, thousands strong, marching across the
valley toward them. Terrifying martial columns in strict formation.

                                                ALGREN
                            I call it five thousand troops. They'll come in
                            waves of about a thousand, a few minutes between
                            each wave.

Katsumoto listens carefully to Algren's expertise.

                                                                                101.
                                              ALGREN
                           German formations have the infantry staggered
                           with on1y light flanking. They'll come straight on
                           with rifles and fixed bayonets. Mausers are only
                           accurate to about 150 yards. They'll look to
                           overthrow us.

Katsumoto takes this in.

EXT.                  VALLEY                             DAY

Colonel Bagley, Omura, several German advisors and Japanese officers ride
at the head of the Imperial Army.                                         .

Bagley sees something, raises a hand. The troops halt.

Algren and Katsumoto ride up to them. Stop.

                                             ALGREN
                           Colonel.

                                              BAGLEY
                           Captain... (to Katsumoto)... Sir, the Imperial
                           Army of Japan demands your surrender. If you
                           and your fellows lay down your arms you will
                           not be harmed.

                                             KATSUMOTO
                           That is not possible. As Omura knows.

Omura meets Katsumoto's look, nods. Bagley turns to Algren.

                                             BAGLEY
                           Captain Algren, we will show no quarter. You
                           ride against us and you are the same as they are.

                                               ALGREN
                           I take that as a compliment, Colonel.
                                      (a deadly calm)
                           I'll look for you on the field.

Algren and Katsumoto wheel their horses and go.

EXT.                 MOUNTAIN RIDGE                      DAY


Algren and Katsumoto ride.

                                           ALGREN
                           They have the howitzers.

                                             KATSUMOTO
                           How many?

                                             ALGREN
                           About a dozen.

                                                                                              102.

Katsumoto considers this. Algren looks up into the mountains.

                                              ALGREN
                            A man could get lost up there ... Build an army.
                            Hold out a very long time.

                                              KATSUMOTO
                            Algren-san...Have you seen what happens to the
                            villages that stand In the way of the railroad?

Algren nods. He remembers.

                                               KATSUMOTO
                            That is what will happen to my village if we do
                            not stand and fight.
                                     (looks at him)
                            No. We serve the Emperor here.

                                               ALGREN
                            By dying?

                                               KATSUMOTO
                            Perhaps.

                                              ALGREN
                            At least make it battle, not a suicide.

                                            KATSUMOTO
                            And what would that accomplish?

Algren lifts his head, enjoying the feeling of the sun and wind on his face.

                                                ALGREN
                            It might give you one more day ... One more
                            fine day like this.

Katsumoto stares at him for a long moment, then smiles and spurs his horse. Algren follows.

They ride together, side by aide, the wind billowing their cloaks -- We enjoy the
ride as they do, the trees strobing by, the sun slanting through the leaves.

EXT.                      VILLAGE                       NIGHT
It is the eve of battle. And the samurai rejoice.

Katsumoto is on stage at the center of the village square, enthusiastically
performing a Noh drama. Algren sits with Toshiie and Taka in the audience,
enjoying Katsumoto's theatrics.

Other samurai can be seen around the village, eating, singing, and playing
instruments. Tonight is for celebrating life.

Elsewhere, a flash as Graham takes a photograph of some children.

                                                                                            103.
On the stage, Katsumoto spots Algren in the audience, points to him and
encourages him to join him. Algren resists. Toshiie prods him. Algren
surrenders and joins Katsumoto on the stage. The villagers are delighted.

Katsumoto embroils Algren in the performance. Algren does his best,
laughing at Katsumoto's antics.

It is the freest and happiest we have ever seen Algren. Time
SLOWS as we Savor his simple enjoyment

Toshiie is highly amused. Taka has a deeper response, she is moved as she
watches Algren give himself over to the part.

EXT.            VILLAGE                      LATER THAT NIGHT

A somber mood has descended. Algren sits and writes in his journal.

                                              ALGREN (V.O.)
                            July 14, 1877. For so long now, I have managed
                            to convince myself that there was nothing worth
                            believing in.

A samurai plays a melancholy bamboo flute. The gentle sound floats through the village...

                                              ALGREN (V.O.)
                            Certainly nothing worth dying for.

We see samurai preparing for the final battle. Some check
their armor... Others meditate...

                                             ALGREN (V.O.)
                            Now I am not so sure.

Some make up their faces so they will look handsome when they greet death.
Some methodically polish their swords. Some sit with their families.

                                               ALGREN (V.O.)
                            And so, for the first time in my life, I am truly
                            afraid. Not of dying. But of losing something
                            worth living for.

Ujio is performing a graceful, ritualistic sword-dance to the song of the flute.
Algren Joins Graham to watch him.

                                                GRAHAM
                            What is it:? .

                                              ALGREN
                            The kenbu,.. his dance of death.

Taka comes to them.

                                              TAKA
                                    (subtitles)
                            Algren-san, will you come with me?

                                                                                   104.

Algren leaves Graham and accompanies Taka toward the house.

They pass Higen and Toshiie, who sit with other children at the feet of the
massive Nakao, listening to a quiet story he tells,

INT.                   YORITOMO'S HOUSE                     FOLLOWING

The gentle flute music from outside drifts in.

One of Yoritomo's beautiful kimonos is elegantly spread on a mat.

                                               TAKA
                                     (subtitles)
                            If you wear this, it will honor us.

He nods.

She steps to him.

A moment. She gently reaches forward and unbuttons his collar.

A tender, silent scene as she undresses him and carefully wraps him in the
 kimono. Her hands move gracefull y around his body, never quite touching
him. His movements are gentle in response.

When he is fully dressed, then are tears in his eyes.

Suddenly, fiercely, they are holding each other.

EXT.             KATSUMOTO'S HOUSE -- PORCH                  LATER THAT NIGHT
The quiet evening continues.

Algren, now dressed in the kimono, finds Katsumoto carefully dropping little
leaves of incense into a small flame that simmers inside his battle helmet.

                                               KATSUMOTO
                            So m y hair will have a pleasing scent when I
                            meet my ancestors ... (dry) ... You do not do this ?

Algren smiles, sits.
                                                 ALGREN
                            I studied war at a place called West Point. They
                            taught us about a battle called Thermopylae.
                            Three hundred brave warriors held off the king
                            of Persia's army of a million men. For two da ys
                            they made them pay so dearly that the king lost
                            all appetite for further invasion
                                       (looks at him)
                            ... I have some thoughts about the battle tomorrow.

                                              KATSUMOTO
                                    (bemused)
                            Do you really think we can defeat them?

                                                                                         105.

                                               ALGREN
                            I sure as hell want to find out.

                                            KATSUMOTO
                            You believe a man can change his destiny?

                                              ALGREN
                            No ... But I think a man cannot know his destiny.
                            He can only do what he can, until his destiny is
                            revealed.

A si1ent beat.

Then Katsumoto picks up a long bundle wrapped in cloth. He unwraps it.
A beautilu1 long samurai sword.

He bows his head and offers it to Algren.

There are Japanese characters etched on the blade.

                                                ALGREN
                            What does it say?

                                              KATSUMOTO
                            "I belong to the warrior in whom the old ways
                            have joined the new."

Algren is moved beyond words. He bows.

As the CAMERA pulls away, Algren and Katsumoto squat side by side,
drawing in the dirt with a stick, planning the next day's battle strategy.

Across the square, Ujio continues his elegant dance of death, his graceful
form illuminated in silhouette by a fire.

INT.          YORITOMO'S HOUSE                   MORNING

It is the day of the battle. Algren is buttoning the long coat of his cavalry uniform.

He looks up to see Higen standing in the doorwa y, holding the breast-plate
of his father's armor.

EXT.             YORITOMO'S HOUSE                 DAY

Algren emerges from the house, wearing the breast-plate over his coat.
Taka is at his horse, tying a bag of food to the saddle. She turns and sees her
husband's armor on this man. And her breath stops.

Algren approaches her. They stand very cl ose.



                                                TAKA
                                      (subtitles)
                            Return.

                                                                                         106.

                                                 ALGREN
                                       (subtitles)
                            If that is my destiny ... Anshinritsumai. [I
                            wish you peace.]

                                               TAKA
                            Anshinritsumai.

He bows his head to her, she responds. The boys stand on the porch,
watching. He mounts his horse and trots off. They watch him go.                      .

Algren joins the line of samurai leaving the village. It is the first time we have
seen them in their full battle armor since the battle in the fog.

Katsumoto in his black armor, Ujio in his jet black. And Algren in the blood-red
breast-plate. It is dazzling.

EXT.      BATTLEFIELD           DAWN

We move along the line of waiting samurai. The faces are stoic. Prepared.
Their horses are corralled well behind them.

Algren stands with Katsumoto and Ujio. Graham is nearby. They peer into the
plain beyond.

They have chosen a strong defensive position. A steep mountain pass. Slopes on either
side create a funnel ahead of them. The Imperial Army will have to pass through the
funnel to reach them.

On a hill above them

Higen is revealed. He looks down first at the five hundred Samurai, then
sees, beyond, the overwhelming mass of the IMPERIAL ARMY.

Back on the battlefield

A distant thud followed by a high-pitched whine. A MASSIVE EXPLOSION
ahead of the Samurai. Artillery.

Algren finds Graham cowering at the base of a straw barricade.

                                               ALGREN
                            Mr. Graham....

                                               GRAHAM
                            Captain?

                                            ALGREN
                            Would you please stay with the horses?

Graham would like to be brave enough to remain, but he is not a soldier.

                                               GRAHAM
                            As you suggest.

                                                                                    107.

Graham starts to go --

                                             ALGREN
                            Mr. Graham ... Take this.

From his coat, Algren takes his journal, hands it to Graham.

                                            ALGREN
                            Maybe you can use it for your book.

                                               GRAHAM
                            I will.

He heads back to the relative safet y of the horse corral.

Meanwhile, the samurai remain impassive as artillery is stepped in closer, the
range bracketed. Then artillery rounds begin to fall among them.

Samurai are blown to pieces as they bravel y stand and await
death. Katsumoto BARKS a command to Ujio.

Suddenly, the Samurai break ranks and trot into a new defense
alignment. The artillery rounds now fall ineffectually where once
they stood.

Bagley directs the artillery to be re-targeted, It is a laborious, clumsy
process. They fire again. Another command. The Samurai change
position again.

Bagley is furious. Their fluid tactics have rendered his field artillery useless.

Katsumoto and Algren share a look of grim satisfaction. They are leveling
the playing field.

Bugle calls are heard from the Imperial Army.

                                              ALGREN
                            The call to advance.

The rattle of the snare drums. The sound of marching boots.

And then they appear. Thousands upon thousands of them. The Imperial
Army marching relentlessly forward in strict formation. The Rising Sun displayed.

Katsumoto gazes at the awe-inspiring sight. His 500 samurai face a staggering
5,000 soldiers.

                                              KATSUMOTO
                            Tell me ... what happened to those three hundred
                            warriors at Thermopylae?

                                                                                 108.
                                               ALGREN
                                      (a grim smile)
                             Dead to the last man.

Katsumoto glances to him, smiles.


EXT.                THE SAMURAI POSITION                     CONTINUOUS

The First Division of the Imperial Army moves into the funnel, their numbers
reduced by the size of the access, and head toward the barricade.

Katsumoto and Algren watch as they move closer and closer. We
are expecting the samurai to open fire, but they do not. They just
wait.

Finally the Imperial soldiers are in rifle range. They stop to fi re a volley.

Bullets begin hitting among the samurai. Many fall.

Algren nods to Katsumoto, Katsumoto then calls out a command and the
samurai retreat.

They race back toward the rear of the funnel.

The Imperial Army soldiers climb awkwardly over the first barricade and
pursue--

The samurai, meanwhile, have taken cover behind a second barricade that
had been hidden from the Imperial soldiers' view. Now safel y behind
the second barricade, Katsumoto calls out a command and--

The samurai fire!

500 arrows explode -- almost instantly followed by 500 more --

Like an image from Agincourt, the clouds of arrows sweep across the sky --

Imperial Soldiers fall, the attack falters--

From behind the new barricades, archers fire FLAMING ARROWS, that
Hit the old barricade. It EXPLODES INTO FLAMES, trapping the Imperia1
Army bet ween the two barricades.

And from the second barricade, two large CA TAPULTS send balls of flaming
pitch into the already panicking soldiers.

EXT.                        OPPOSING HILL TOP                    DAY

Colonel Bagley, Omura, several German advisers and Japanese Officers
watch through binoculars. Stunned. As the First Wave is routed.

                                                HAGLEY
                             What the hell?

                                                                                          109.
                                               OMURA
                             It seems Katsumoto will resist his destiny.
                                      (snaps an order)
                             Send in the second wave. Two divisions.

EXT.                  BARRICADES                          DAY

Algren and Katsumoto wait behind the second barricade. We note that this
barricade is the real thing.

Katsumoto removes a piece of shattered armor from his left forearm, a
bullet wound beneath. Algren looks over the barricade.

They see Imperial soldiers using semaphore flags to communicate with their commanders
on the opposing hilltop.

                                                KATSUMOTO
                             How long?

                                                ALGREN
                             They need to regroup and report our position. Then
                             they'll come hard.

Katsumoto considers the bodies of the dead Imperia1soldiers.

                                                 KA TSUMOTO
                             It is sad to see brave men die without faces... You cannot
                             tell one warrior from another.

                                               ALGREN
                             They're not warriors. They're soldiers. It's a
                             modern army.

                                             KATSUMOTO
                             Not my world anymore.

EXT.            BATTLE FIELD                   DAY

Bugles. The attack is reforming. Ranks now bolstered by reinforcements.

They come at a trot, through the narrow defile, skirting the first barricade,
continuing at a trot toward the second barricade.

EXT.              2ND BARRICADE                      DAY

Katsumoto pulls his long sword. Algren does the same.

Katsumoto calls out an order -- the archers fire another round.

The Imperial soldiers are being annihilated but still they come in great waves --
for ever y one who falls it seems there are ten to take his place.

They race forward, stepping over their fallen comrades, bayonets poised --

The Mauser rifles flash --

                                                                                           110.

Bullets explode around the samurai, many are hit.

The Imperial Army has been trained to keep firing on the run. The waiting
Samurai will be decimated, except --

From the hills on either side

Fully half of the Samurai force -- who have been kept hidden until this moment...
charge, screaming into the flank of the attacking Army. Even rifles cannot fire in
three directions at once.

Algren and Katsumoto lead the charge over the second barricade. Some are cut down,
but in moments swords engage ba yonets in brutal hand-to-band combat.

Algren And Katsumoto fight back to back, as if one person, slashing with their
swords, shattering bayonet, dealing death on all sides.

Ujio crouches, his back leg straight and planted, his front leg bent. Still using
his bow, firing off arrows with Stunning speed, refusing to budge--

On the opposing hillside

Bagley and Omura watch the battle through binoculars.

                                                  BAGLEY
                                A classic "V" ambush. Sonofabitcb is using
                                Welt Point tactics.

In the midst of the battle

A charging soldier thrust     s his bayonet into Katsumoto's arm - Katsumoto kills,
the soldier with his short    sword but is awkwardly tangled with his body, a second
soldier races toward him      for the kill - Algren spins and attacks killing the second
soldier - but a third races    toward Algren, bayonet f1ashing

He dodges -- but the bayonet slices into his side --

Algren kicks the soldier away -- tries to use his sword but the soldier springs
back ath1etically .. Ujio appears like a black spectral figure to deliver the
coup de grace.

All SOUND gradually fades and is replaced by the elegaic sound of a bamboo
flute... the images of combat become fragmented and impressionistic.

Bur no matter how bravel y the samurai fight, they are simply outnumbered...

Nakao is like a cornered bear, arcing his two swords wildly around him. He
is shot in the chest, and staggers a moment before continuing. Another
soldier shoots him in the arm at point blank range. Nakao', sword goes fl ying,
so the giant Samurai leaps forward and picks up the shooter bodily, twirling
him around like a wrestler, throwing him finally onto the upraised pike of a
fellow Imperial soldier. But now three more soldiers have levelled their
weapons, and a ruthless volley staggers him again. Shots rain on him as he
tries to continue fighting, but his strength leaves him. Finally, with one last
lunge, he manages to pull an Imperial soldier with him, crushing him as he falls.

                                                                                   111.
More and more fall as Algren, Katsumoto, and their comrades fight desperately...

The mournful flute is the appropriate accompaniment as Ujio is mortally
wounded. The grim award master is cut through with bullets. Still he fights.
An Imperial soldier holds up a rifle to protect himself, and Ujio's blade cuts
through the barrel. The soldier just has time to look at the gun in amazement
before a second sweep of Uji o's sword beheads him. But there are too many
to take the man's place, and finally fi ve men run Uji o through with bayonets,
and he is pinned against the barricade, still upright in death.

At last, what is left of this second wave of the Imperial Army, retreats.

EXT.             PLAIN                            ALMOST SUNSET

The plain before the barricade is littered with Imperial Army dead.

Algren and Katsumoto sit exhausted, leaning against the barricade. They are
both wounded.

Only about. hundred samurai are still alive.

Algren looks over the decimated warriors for a moment. Even those still
alive are in bad shape as they wait for the next wave of Imperial soldiers.

Katsumoto is looking at Ujio's body nearby.

                                           KATSUMOTO
                           He was Kaishaku ... my trusted friend.

                                            ALGREN
                           We won't be able to hold them back this time.

                                             KATSUMOTO
                           This is not your battle. You do not have to die
                           here.

 A long beat.

                                              ALGREN
                           I died a long time ago.

                                            KATSUMOTO
                           But now you live again.

                                               ALGREN
                           Yes.

                                             KATSUMOTO
                           It was not your time.

                                            ALGREN
                           No. Maybe I survived just to live this one last day.

Algren looks at him.

                                                                                      112.
                                               ALGREN
                            I'll stay.

He slowl y pulls himself up. He and Katsumoto gaze at the plain before them.

At the infantry troops massing on the opposing hilltop.

Algren looks at Katsumoto. He reaches into the pocket of his old uniform
and takes out the Medal of Honor he received, long ago, at Sutter's Hill.

He affixes it to his old cavalry tunic.

Katsumoto looks at Algren. They are both thinking the same thing.

Silent agreement.


EXT.                    PLAIN                                  SUNSET

The hundred mounted samurai are a beautiful sight.

They wait in formation in front of the barricade, the long plain through the
funnel to the opposing hilltop before them.

Katsumoto draws his long samurai sword.

Algren draws his.

And they slowl y begin to trot forward...

And then to canter...

BEHIND THE IMPERIAL ARMY

Colonel Bagley and Omura watch, transfixed. There is something
approaching admiration on Omura's face. On Bagley's, there is only malice.

                                              BAGLEY
                            The gatling guns. Quickly.

EXT.                     PLAIN                             SUNSET


Katsumoto points his sword and screams out his war cry. .

And they charge. It is suicidal

It is glorious.

It is the end of the samurai.

They charge forward, their war cries echoing in the canyon.

The Imperial troops fire rifles -- samurai fall .. but still they come: -- pounding
over the earth like something from an ancient dream

                                                                                        113.
Algren and Katsumoto charge side by side. Alive. Warriors.

BEHIND THE IMPERIAL ARMY

Bagley and Omura watch as the samurai fall, one by one.

WITH THE CHARGE

Fifteen or twenty of the samurai -- including Algren and Katsumoto--
somehow manage to fight their way through the lines.

They break into the open.

And continue riding straight toward the rear.

ALGREN AND KATSUMOTO

Are both wounded, yet still they charge. They have only one thought in
mind -- death to their enemies. They gallop forward toward Bagley and Omura.

BAGLEY

Looks around in abject terror. He screams out an order.

TWO WAGONS

Are moving into position. Their rear gates fall open ... revealing the GATILING GUNS.

ALGREN AND KATSUMOTO

Are near enough to see them. Yet they will not be deterred.

They charge on.


Up ahead.

THE GATLING GUNS

Are not yet ready to fire. Japanese soldiers slam ammo belts into the chambers.

ALGREN, KATSUMOTO AND THE REMAINING SAMURAI


Have almost reached their goal.

BAGLEY

Cowers in fear, looks around, but there is nowhere to hide.

THE SAMURAI CHARGE

Even while riding at I full gallop, they have fixed arrows into their long

                                                                                                       114.
bows. They let loose a lethal volley.

BAGLEY

                                             BAGLEY
                            Fire! Fire, dammit!!!!!

But before the guns can open up, he is IMPALED BY ARROW AFTER
ARROW, a human pincushion. The final arrow pierces his forehead.

Then...

The Gatling Guns finally fire. Ripping into the samurai-


Destroying them-

One after another is hit -- and still they come -- their voices raised in glorious cries of triumph-

Graham watches from a hilltop, tears in his eyes.

Katsumoto is hit, blood explodes .- his horse falls -- he spi1ls off--

Then Algren is hit -- he falls--

Algren drags himself to Katsumoto, bullets exploding ever ywhere ­

Algren looks up to see...

The remaining samurai still charging-

And still the Gatling Guns tear through them--

And still they charge ­

Until they are all down.

EXT.             OPPOSING HILLTOP                           SUNSET

A Japanese Officer shouts out an order -- the Gatling Guns stop.

Omura screams at him to continue firing!

The Japanese officer barks out response. Refusing.

Omura sees all the samurai are dead or dying.

But he also sees Algren kneeling by Katsumoto, dragging him awa y. He
screams at the Japanese officer to resume fire!

The Japanese officer refuses.

He just looks over the plain of dying samurai for a moment. Then he does
the most remarkable thing.

He slowl y kneels and touches his head to the dirt.

                                                                                    115.
Then a soldier near him does the same thing. Then another and another.
And then by the thousands.

They kneel and touch their heads to the dirt.

Honoring the last samurai.


EXT.                PLAIN                    SUNSET

A1gren drags the dying Katsumoto to a8 copse of cherry trees nearby...


EXT.                           CHERRY TREES                                SUNSET

Both men are bleeding profusel y.

                                                   KATSUMOTO
                             Help me up...

                                                   ALGREN
                             Just -- stay there.

                                                   KATSUMOTO
                             Help me up.

Algren helps him to stand. Without Algren's support, he would fall.

                                                   KATSUMOTO
                             My sword...

                                                   ALGREN
                             No.

                                              KA TSUMOTO
                             You have your honor again. Let me die with
                             mine ... Kaishaku.

Algren looks at him, deeply moved. Katsumoto manages to pull out his short sword.

                                             KATSUMOTO
                             You must help me. Hold it firmly...

Algren supports Katsumoto as he holds the sword's point firmly to his stomach.

                                                   KA TSUMOTO
                             Are you ready?

                                                   ALGREN
                             No, Kaishaku.

                                                                                     116.
 Katsumoto looks at him deepl y, warmly.

                                                 KATSUMOTO
                               We will ride together again.

Katsumoto embraces Algren firmly -- the sma1l sword impales him

Algren holds him tightly. Katsumoto is looking over Algren's shoulder as he dies.

Katsumoto sees something. A look of joy and absolute peace comes to his features.

                                                   KATSUMOTO
                                         (whispers)
                               It is perfect... They are all perfect.

His eyes cl ose. He is dead.

Algren gently kneels with Katsumoto's body

He holds him for a moment and then turns to see what Katsumoto was looking at.

Cherry blossoms.


A display of perfect beauty.


We slowl y fade to...


INT.               IMPERIAL PALACE -- THRONE                            ROOM DAY


Ambassador Swanbeck, Omura, and a retinue of advisors are presenting the
treaty documents for the Emperor's signature. The Emperor sits restively
on his throne.


                                                  AMBASSADOR SWANBECK
                               ...will usher in an era of unprecedented prosperity
                               and cooperation between our two great nations.
A servant comes and whispers into the Emperor's ear.

                                                   OMURA
                                         (subtitles)
                               Highness, if we could just conclude the matter
                               at hand...

The Emperor ignores Omura, and gestures that the doors to the chamber be opened.

Algren enters with Graham. Algren carries something wrapped in a blanket.
He approaches the Emperor. Kneels and sets the bundle at the Emperor's feet.
Algren remains kneeling with his head bowed. He unwraps the bundle.

                                                                                    117.
It is Katsumoto's long samurai sword.


'The Emperor looks at it.

                                               OMURA
                                     (subtitled)
                            All your enemies are dead, Enlightened One.

The Emperor continues to look at the sword. He does not look up.

                                            EMPEROR/TRANSLATOR
                                   (to Algren)
                            You were with him at the end.

                                              ALGREN/TRANSLA TOR
                            Yes. He asked that I bring you this -- that the
                            strength of the samurai will be with you alwa ys.

The Emperor rises from his chair and sits on the floor, in the traditional
Japanese fashion, before the sword.

                                               OMURA
                                     (after a moment)
                            En1ightcned One, we all weep for his loss, but
                            the future of our country lies in-


The Emperor interrupts him, speaking in English -- to ever yone's surprise.

                                               EMPEROR
                            My ancestors have ruled Japan for 2,000 years.
                            And for all that time we have slept. During my
                            sleep I have dreamed. I dreamed of a unified
                            Japan. Of a country strong and independent and
                            modern...
                                     (touches the sword lovingly)
                            And now we are awake. We have railroads and
                            cannon and Western clothing. But we cannot
                            forget who we are. Or where we come from.

The Emperor looks up at the gathered dignitaries.
               .
                                              EMPEROR
                          Ambassador Swanbeck I have concluded that your treaty
                          is not in the best interests of my people.

                                              AMBASSADOR SWANDECK
                            Sir, if I may--

                                              EMPEROR
                            You may not. From this moment on, economic investment
                            from ever y nation will be considered equally.

                                                                                      118.

Ambassador Swanbeck is stunned.

                                            AMBASSADOR SWANBECK
                          This is an outrage--

The Emperor gestures. A servant escorts Swanbeck to the exit. Omura takes a step
closer to the Emperor.

                                            OMURA
                                  (subtitled)
                          Enlightened One, we should discuss this

                                            EMPEROR
                                  (subtitled)
                          Omura, do you know our northern island?

Omura is confused.

                                              EMPEROR
                                    (subtitled)
                          There is a small one called Taraku. A rock in the sea.
                          There is nothing there but crabs who have been known
                          to tear a sleeping man apart ... I have had a small house
                          constructed on the island. You will go there now and
                          await our summons.

                                             OMURA
                                    (subtitled)
                          Sir...?


                                             EMPEROR

                          I hereby seize your family's assets and present them
                          as my gift to the people.

Omura looks at him, stunned.

                                             EMPEROR
                                   (subtitled)
                          Further, I have decided to stop the railroad cxpansion
                          into Yoshino.

                                            OMURA
                                  (subtitled)
                          Enlightened One

                                             EMPEROR
                                   (subtitled)
                          You have served your function. I have no more
                          need of you ... You can conspire with the crabs
                          now. Remove yourself.

                                                                                         119.
                                                OMURA
                                      (protests, subtitled)
                             Honored Emperor, I do not know wh y you
                             disgrace me.

The Emperor finally looks up from the sword.

                                                EMPEROR
                                      (subtitled)
                             If your shame is too unbearable ... I offer you
                             this sword.

Omura looks at him for a moment. Then bows tersely and goes.

The Emperor looks at Algren, still kneeling before him.

                                              EMPEROR
                                     (in English again)
                             The samurai is not a man now. He is an idea.
                                     (a beat)
                             Tell me how he died.

Algren looks At the Emperor.

                                                ALGREN
                             I will tell you how he lived.

We slowl y fade as Algren begins to speak...

EXT.                     VILLAGE                   DAY

Spring. A few years later.

There are no samurai training in the square, but otherwise the village is
bustling with life. We HEAR Graham's voice:

                                               GRAHAM (V.O.)
                             ...And so the days of the samurai had ended.

INT.                  LECTURE HALL (ENGLAND)                           DAY

Graham stands at a lectern on a book tour. A well-dressed audience listens
attentivel y. A banner proclaims, "The Last Samurai," by Simon Graham.

                                                GRAHAM (V.O.)
                             And in the years to come the Rising Sun of Imperial Japan
                             would fl y in triumph over Korea, over Russia, even over
                             China. Nations, like men, it is sometimes said, have
                             their own destiny

EXT.                               VILLAGE                             DAY

We see that Yoritomo's house has finally been completed.. Toshiie sits on the porch,
Instructing a group of younger children in calligraphy.

                                                                                    120.
                                            GRAHAM (V.O.)
                           As for the American Captain, no one knows
                           what became of him. All that is left is his journal
                           which I have published, according to his last request.

Taka steps from the house and passes Toshiie, she carries a basket. We
move through the village with her...

                                             GRAHAM (V.O.)
                           Some lay he died of his wounds, others that he
                           returned to his own country...

She passes an old man teaching the Noh drama to a group of teenagers.

She passes Higen, working on a new building. Apparently he has found a
good life as a carpenter. He seems content.

We go with Taka as she leaves the village...

EXT.                     CHERRY TREES                                DAY


Taka moves through the cherry orchard.

                                              GRAHAM (V.O.)
                           But I like to think he may have found at last
                           some small measure of the peace we all seek,
                           but few of us ever find.

Taka stops. Watching. We follow her gaze to discover:

Algren, sitting alone. Gazing peacefully sat the cherry bl ossoms.


Waiting for the perfect one. He turns to her, a smile of quiet joy spreads
across his face.

                                             GRAHAM (V.O.)
                           Anshinritsumai. [I wish you peace.]

LEGEND
ORIGINAL SCREENPLAY by WILLIAM HJORTSBERG

2nd Draft Revised 10 March 1984


1EXTERIOR FOREST NIGHT

Huge trees taper upward like columns supporting the roof of heaven. 
Moonlit dewdrops spangle a delicate spiderweb. The setting is 
tranquil and utterly majestic.

Over the brow of a distant hill, a pair of brilliant light beams 
scintillate in an etheral ballet.

Numerous small animals gather to behold this wonder. They stand on 
the hillcrest, staring down as if at the Nativity.

Squirrels, quail, hedgehogs, mice, pheasants and badgers, natural 
enemies untied by the radiant LIGHT. 

A magnificent stag watches, numbers of tiny songbirds perched in his 
branching antlers.

1A EXTERIOR FOREST NIGHT 

PULL BACK: from the hilltop, through ferns and brambles to a steep 
embankment where umbrella-sized toadstools cluster. 

A snarling face APPEARS under a mushroom cap. This is BLIX a brigand 
goblin hunter. Clad in decrepit armor and slung with savage weapons, 
he is a terrifying figure. 

Blix WHISTLES. The SOUND is unexpectedly lovely, a nightingale's 
call. 

Further back, three other goblins return the BIRDCALL. They bristle 
with weaponry. POX is a pig-faced fop wearing tattered lace and 
flithy brocade. Tiny BLUNDER and TIC are both masked by grotesque 
helmets. Swarms of gnats drone above their hidden heads. They creep 
forward to join Blix. 

1B GOBLIN'S POV : HILLTOP 

The distant animals silhouetted by dazzling LIGHT. 

1C EXTERIOR FOREST NIGHT

Blix signals an advance and the goblins creep through the forest 
towards the hilltop.

A moth lands on a twig two feet from Tic's head. He turns. His 
incredibly sticky tongue uncoils from within the helmet seizing the 
moth and retracting with it, quick as a flash.

As the goblins near the hilltop, the fantastic LIGHT gradually 
illuminates their hideous features. A tiny mouse runs out of the 
eye-slits on Blunder's helmet, circles the crest, and runs back in 
on the other side. 

Blix signals silently for the other goblins to spread out.

The goblins crawl separately through the underbrush.

Pox comes snout to snout with a wild piglet. Terrified, the little 
shoat SQUEALS and scampers off. 

2 DELETED

2A CLOSE : ANIMALS 

Alerted by the NOISE, they face the impending threat. The startled 
animals run for cover down the hillside. 

3 DELETED 

3A EXTERIOR FOREST NIGHT 

Blix charges forward, brandishing his crossbow. 

BLIX: Kill. . . . ! 

Blix runs over the top of the hill and down into the gully beyond, 
closely followed by Tic, Pox, and Blunder. Brilliant clumps of 
forget-me-nots are everywhere, like disgarded jewels. 

3B GOBLIN'S POV : DISTANT FOREST 

The pair of shining LIGHT BEAMS race away between the trees. 

4 DELETED 

5 DELETED

5A EXTERIOR FOREST NIGHT

The goblins watch the LIGHT BEAMS disappear. Blix GROWLS in 
frustration. 

BLUNDER(musing): . . . . Fast as a hound dog with his ass on fire. . 
. . 

Blunder spots a SHINING silver hair caught on the bark. He reaches 
up and plucks it free. 

POX: What's that . . . . ? L-l-let me see, old chap. 

BLUNDER: No! It's mine! 

Blunder hides the hair behind his back, but Pox quickly grabs the 
other end. 

POX: Give it to m-m-m-me! 

Both goblins pull on the hair. Miraculously, it does not break, but 
stretches between them like spun steel. 

BLUNDER: Turn loose, anus features! 

POX: Hard cheese! 

A furious tug of war. Pox pulls his knife and tries unsuccessfully 
to cut the hair. 

BLUNDER: It's mine you rectum! Mine! Mine! 

Blix marches up and furiously bangs their heads together. Pox and 
Blunder fall dazed to the ground. 

Blix holds the silver hair shining above his head and studies it. 

BLIX: Disgusting and pure, like a prayer. . .. 
There be magic in this hair.
The beast ran off, faster and faster. 
We must take this to our Master. 

6 EXTERIOR VAST LANDSCAPE NIGHT 

An incredible landscape, fantastically contoured hills rise above 
the monnbright mist. The four goblins dismount, tie up their devil 
steeds, and disappear over the brow of a hill. 

6A EXTERIOR HILLSIDE NIGHT 

The goblins scramble down a steep hillside towards a desolate 
wasteland below. A mysterious malevolant shape looms on the far 
horizon. 

7 EXTERIOR SINISTER EVERGLADE NIGHT

A miasmic Jurassic swamp. Stunted trees rise like amputated limbs 
from the fetid water. 

The goblins pick their way across the bog towards a distant island, 
stepping from submerged logs to crumbled chunks of masonary to 
floating lily pads.
A cracked marble plinth juts out of the water. The goblins creep by 
a towering skeletal statue playing a bone violin. 

7A EXTERIOR BOG NIGHT 

A v-shaped ripple undulates past them like the wake of a submerged 
crocodile. 

Blix unhooks a dead rat from his game belt and tosses it from his 
game belt and tosses it onto the scummy surface. There is an angry 
swirl and it is gone. 

Blix waves the goblins on and they climb onto a huge root twisting 
out of the water like a petrified serpant. 

The ominous wake cruises back and forth like a shark. Blunder 
follows its progress with fear-widened eyes. 

BLUNDER:Wish i was still a leprecaun. . . .
Stay clear of nasty places
like this and do nothing all day but 
sing and dance and guzzle wine in the sunshine. . . .

Furious, Blix turns on him, his finger to his lips. 

BLIX: Shhhh! 

Unchastened, Blunder whirls on Pox and repeats the gesture: 

BLUNDER: Shhhh! 

Pox follows suit with Tic: 

POX: Shhhh! 

Not to be outdone, Tic turns to silence whoever might be behind him. 

TIC: SHHHHH! 

7B EXTERIOR BOG NIGHT 

HAIRY MEG MUCKLEBONES rises out of the bog, huge and hideous. The 
water hag is half corpse, half serpant. She seizes Tic and 
disappears beneath the foul surface. The goblin's final CRY trembles 
in the chill night air. 

7C EXTERIOR BOG NIGHT
Blix, Pox, and Blunder are terrified. They scramble over the twisted 
root in a wild panic, leaping onto a floating log. 

BLUNDER: Run. . . . ! Panic. . . . ! Emergency. . . . ?

The log rolls beneath their frantic feet. They barely keep their 
balance. 

POX: Frog spit!

BLUNDER: Snail Sperm!

BLIX: All together. . . .now or never!

The goblin co-ordinate like tiny lumberjacks, running in unison. The 
rolling log drifts forward.

POX: J-j-jolly good! Team spirit and all that!

The log runs against the island and the goblins hop ashore.

8 EXTERIOR GREAT TREE NIGHT

An enormous blasted tree crowns the ruins of a forgotten castle. 
Tangled roots grip the anicient stones like the tenacles of a 
malformed sea monster. An atmosphere of eternal evil hovers over the 
site. 

The goblins stare back across the bog. 

BLUNDER: Poor Tic. . . .

BLIX(growling with anger): Forget Tic! Less is always more.

POX: Better we spilt three ways than four! 

Blix hurries up the crumbling steps. Pox and Blunder follow. 

The steps lead under gigantic twisting roots. Blix finds a small 
opening and slips inside. 

Pox and Blunder like this less and less but follow their leader 
without complaint.

9 INTERIOR GREAT TREE NIGHT 

The three goblins tumble down a steep slope. The giant tree is a 
vast hollow stump, open to a moonlit sky, surrounding a smaller tree 
transfixed by a curved bronze horn, an instrument of unspeakable 
evil. 

Pox and Blunder stare up like open-mouthed tourists. Blix is 
impatient. 

BLIX: Boost me. . . . ! Hurry. . . . ! We must sound the summons 
before the dawn. . . . 

The three goblins form a teetering ladder with Blix wobbling at the 
top and Blunder crushed at the bottom. 

Blix blows into the horn with all his might. Nothing happens. 
Suddenly, he breaks wind! 

Pox and Blunder grimace. 

Blix blows again into the horn.

There is no sound. Dead leaves and dust puff out of the bell, 
followed by three SQUEALING bats. 

The supporting goblins wobble. Pox steps on Blunder's head. 

Blix blows a third time into the great horn. 

The unholy SOUND reverbarates like the wailing of all the doomed 
souls in Purgatiory. 

10 EXTERIOR FOREST(VARIOUS ANGLES) NIGHT

As the evil SOUND moans, the forest creatures react with terror. 

Squirrels, rabbits, and mice dart fearfully for cover. Birds flock 
to their nests. Only the night creatures, the wolves, weasels, and 
owls perk up thier ears to listen.

11 INTERIOR GREAT TREE NIGHT

The three goblins cower terrified among the gnarled roots.

BLUNDER: Now what. . . . ?

BLIX: We sit. . . . We wait. . . . That be our fate! 

11A EXTERIOR GREAT TREE NIGHT

The goblins wait up on the upper platform of the ruined castle. Blix 
sits apart from the others, staring out across at the bog. The light 
of a campfire casts their shifting shadows against the huge trunk of 
the hollow tree.

Blix plays with the silver hair.

BLIX(to himself): Moving silent like the breeze.
Soft as shadows, still as trees,
Darkness be in all we sees. 
He lives in silence, he lives in fire, 
He lives in all that's dark and dire. 

A mysterious floating shape approaches out of the distance. It is a 
black cloak, wafting through the mist like an airborne manta ray. 

12 EXTERIOR BOG NIGHT 

The flying cloak wraps about the statue of the skeletal fiddler. The 
wind presses it tight, revealing the skull through the cloth. 

Suddenly, the statue's head turns to look at the great tree. 

13 EXTERIOR GREAT TREE NIGHT 

Blix walks to to the edge of the platform, peering into the night. 

BLIX: Look in the gloom, search out the tomb. 
That be where you find our sire.

The pedestal is empty. The statue of the fidder has vanished! 

Blix gets down on his knees, genuflecting, toward the the open bog. 

The black shadow of the LORD OF DARKNESS falls across him. 

Darkness towers over the ruined castle platform, a huge horned 
figure drpaed in bacl cloth. An awesome silence ensues. 

Blunder and Pox kneel, heaping ashes and dirt upon thier heads. 

BLIX: Hail O great One. . . . divine and dark! 
Strong like a lion, swift like a shark. 

Blix offers the silver hair up to Darkness. 

BLIX: Though I'm not worthy of the task Great Lord, I found this for 
your amusment. 

Blunder leaps to his feet and grabs the hair from Blix. 

BLUNDER: Don't listen to them mealy-mouthed lies boss. . . . I'm the 
one who found it. . . . Me! Blunder the Bold! 

There is a bight FLASH OF LIGHT. Blunder HOWLS with pain. 

Blunder stares at his arm in dismay. His hand is gone, magically 
replaced by a grotesque birdclaw. 

BLUNDER(stunned): Thank you, Lordship . . . . 

Blunder experimently clenches and unclenches his new bird claw. 

POX: Quite stylish, actually. . . . 

Darkness dangles the shining silver hair in front of him. 

DARKNESS: Where. . . . ? 

BLIX: In the woods, six leagues back, 
'Tween Twin Oaks and the Dragon's Track. 

DARKNESS: Did my bold hunters chance to see quarry which
cast this spoor? 

BLIX: I stalked it, Sire, but much too slow, 
What beast it be I do not know. 

DARKNESS: This hair is from an angel of light. . . It comes 
this way rarely. . . I must have this creature!

BLIX: Oh Divine Dark One, teach us how to catch this 
creature. 

POX: Your instruction would be m-m-most 
ap-p-preciated. 

BLUNDER: Amen! I wants to learn! I craves knowledge! 

DARKNESS: No trap of yours will work. . . . There is only 
lure for such disgusting goddness. . . .one bait which never 
fails. . . . 

BLIX: Name the bait, Lord. . . . 

DARKNESS: Innoncence! 

14 EXTERIOR COTTAGE MEADOW DAY 

A beautiful flower-spangled meadow alive with songbirds.

Baby rabbits frolic in the tall grass where industrious squirrels 
forage for acorns and nuts. 

A delicate fawn gambols under the watchful eye of the doe. Clouds of 
multi-hued butterflies swirl overhead. 

Waist-deep in flower, a young princess skips SINGING across the 
meadow. Her name is LILI. She wears splendid brocades and carries a 
bouquet wrapped in a lace napkin. Like these blossoms, she is 
beautiful and fresh and innocent. 

Tiny birds fly down and land on her head and shoulders. She laughs 
as a warbling wren takes a seed from her lips. 

LILI(singing): Come down sparrow, sing me good morning. 
Rise up sun, light the arch of the sky. 
Living river, turn light to diamonds,
When I look in my true love's eyes. 

Lili runs towards a distant thatched-roofed cottage. 

15 EXTERIOR BOULDER AT EDGE OF WOODS DAY 

Blix, Pox, and Blunder hide behind a boulder, watching the girl. 

BLIX(whipering): Darkness say the perfect lure Always be a virgin 
pure. . . . 

15A EXTERIOR COTTAGE AT EDGE OF WOODS DAY 

The WOODCARVER'S WIFE is hangin up the washing when Lili sneaks from 
behind the cottage. 

Grinning micheviously, Lili unfastens one end of the clothes-line 
and lets it drop. 

The laundry flutters onto the new-mown grass, A sheet drpaes around 
the outraged wife. 

WIFE: Dad-blamed faeries! 

16 INTERIOR COTTAGE DAY 

The cottage is snug and homey with smoke-blackened beams and hand-
pegged furniture. A WOODCARVER sleeps by his bench surrounded by 
wood-shavings and roughed-out toys. 

Lili steps into the sunlight streaming through the open doorway. Her 
beauty is etheral, an angel descending. 

Finches peck at newly-made tarts laid on a trestle table to cool. 
They rise to the rafters as at Lili's approach. 

The Princess peeks around the room. She tiptoes to the hearth and 
lifts the stewpot lid, dipping a finger in for a taste. 

Spying the tarts, she grabs one and eats it hurriedly, leaving a 
telltale crumb on her upper lip. 

The clock tolls the hour. A carved wooden maiden piroettes from the 
interior, pursued by a skeletal fiddler playing a bone fiddle. Lili 
is fancinated. 

The Woodcarver's Wife enters. She curtsies to the Princess. 

WIFE: God Bless Your Highness. A royal visit is ever a joy. 

LILI: I've not come to visit, Nell 

WIFE: Won't you stay for a tart? 

Nell pulls a tray from the oven. 

WIFE(cont): They're fresh-baked. 

LILI: I've no time today. 

WIFE(teasing): The Princess must have a sweetheart waiting. 

LILI: Nonsense! 

WIFE: Surely the king forbids such folly 

LILI: What my father doesn't know won't hurt him. 

WIFE: The wilful heart invites despair, 
Like blind men creeping in a dragon's lair. 

With Nell's back turned, Lili steals another tart, hiding it among 
the flowers in her bouquet. 

LILI: Neither country provebs nor king's command can keep me
out of the woods today.

WIFE: Then it's common sense ought. These woods be thick
with spriggen and banshee!

LILI: Is that why you've hung a bell over the door? 

WIFE: Aye, and spread the floor with flax and salt. My babe 
won't be stole by faeries. 

The Princess starts merrily for the sun-bright doorway. 

LILI(laughing): More salt, Nell. . . .! You'll worry 
yourself to death if you're not careful. 

Lili runs out like a naughty child. The Woodcarver's Wife 
leans against the door jamb and calls after her:

WIFE: Beware of toadstool rings and willow trees. . . . ! 
Stay away from old oaks! 

17 EXTERIOR FOREST PATH TO GLADE DAY 

Hiding behind a moss-coverd log, Blix, Pox, and Blunder watch 
Princess Lili run SINGING through the woods, oblivous to any sign of 
danger. 

BLIX(scowling): May be innocent. . . . May be sweet. . . . 
Ain't half as nice as rotten meat. . . . ! 

18 EXTERIOR JACK'S FOREST GLADE DAY 

A lovely glade surrounded by tall trees, Breathlessly, Lili runs in 
from the woods. She is familair with this spot. It is her trysting 
place 

LILI(calling): Jack. . . . ! I know you're here. . . . Jack! 

Lili looks around in exasperation. Behind her, something wild and 
mysterious swings through the trees like an animal. 

LILI(cont): Jack? Where are you. . . . ? Answer me! 

Lili is apprehensive at getting no reply. She hears the RUSTLE of 
the leaves but does not see the sun-dappled figure leaping from limb 
to limb overhead. 

LILI(frightened)(cont): Oh, Jack. . . . please say something if 
you're here. . . . 

JACK O' THE GREEN, a legendry "Green Man" who lives the free life of 
a hermit in the woods, drops down from a tree behind the Princess, 
landing without a sound. He is barefoot, about sixteen, and wears 
woven ivy leaves and skins. 

Startled, Lili SCREAMS. 

LILI(cont): Jack! You scared the life out of me. 

Jack says nothing, staring at her shyly. Lili hands him the flowers. 

A JAY flies down out of the greenery and lands RASPING on Jack's 
shoulder. He imitates the bird expertedly, The Jay answers him in 
English: 

JAY: She brings a gift as fair as herself. 

Lili LAUGHS, It all seems magic to her. 

LILI: You're so clever, Jack. . . . See what you can find in 
the flowers. 

Jack pokes in the bouquet and discovers the stolen tart. He stuffs 
it immediately into his mouth. 

JACK: Mmmmmmm. . . . 

LILI: Sweet? 

JAY: Sweets from the sweet. 

JACK: I know someone sweeter.

Lili blushes. 

19 EXTERIOR ANOTHER PART OF THE FOREST DAY

Concealed behind the trees, Blix, Pox and Blunder watch the Green 
Man and the Princess wander down a meandering path.

Pox picks a spider from his web, pops it in his mouth, and crunches 
it down with a happy smile.

19A EXTERIOR MEANDERING PATH DAY 

Several birds perch on Jack's head and shoulders. Squirrels, rabbits 
and hedgehogs play about his feet. Jack feeds them nuts and berries 
from his pouch, answering their chatter expertedly. Jack understands 
the language of all wild creatures. 

When a frisky wren flies warbling overhead, Lili hesitantly returns 
its call. 

JACK: That was very good. . . .just right. 

LILI: Teach me rabbit like you promised.

JACK: Rabbit is much harder than wren. 

LILI: Let me try. I'm a very good student. . . . My father 
thinks I'm brilliant. . . 

Lili toys with the silver madallion pendant she wears, causing 
reflected sunlight to shine in Jack's eyes. 

LILI(cont): See how brilliant I am! 

JACK(laughing): Stop it. . . . ! I can't see! 

LILI: Don't I dazzle you with my wisdom? 

Lili seems to glow with sunlight. Jack stares at her, rapt with 
love. 

JACK: Much more than wisdom dazzles me. 

Lili LAUGHS and hangs her madallion around his neck. 

LILI: Then teach me rabbit. 

JACK: Not today. . . . There's something really special I 
promised to show you. 

LILI(delighted): Oh, Jack. Do you mean it? 

JACK: If it pleases you. 

LILI: More than anything! 

JACK: This is their season. They won't pass here again 
for a long, long time. . . . If you want to see them, you 
must do everything I tell you. 

LILI: I swear. . . on my honour! 

JACK: I'm taking you to a very special place. . . it's 
sort of sacred. Nobody but me knows where it is, and, 
well. . . . 

LILI(impatient): What? Tell me! 

Jack unwraps the lace napkin from Lili's bouquet. 

JACK: You'll have to wear a blindfold. 

LILI(coyly): Don't you trust me, Jack? 

JACK: I'll always trust you, Lili. . . . 

20 EXTERIOR FOREST PATH, GLADE TO STREAM DAY 

Jack holds Lili's hand, leading her blindfolded along a path through 
the woods. Distant thunder RUMBLES. 

JACK: Storm's coming. . . .

LILI: Who cares? Haven't you a cosy place to hide? 

JACK: Many places. . . .None fit for a princess. . . . 

LILI: In these woods you are the prince, Jack. . . . 
I am only a pauper here. . . .

Jack turns to face a radiantly smiling Lili. He bends towards her, 
closer and closer, and, for a moment, seems about to steal a kiss. 
She waits, smiling, sensing what is about to happen. In the end, 
Jack's innoncence and timidity get the best of him and he turns 
away. Without his knowledge Lili lifts a corner of the blindfold and 
mischievously peeks. 

20A EXTERIOR BEHIND A TREE NEAR THE PATH DAY

The three goblin peer around a mossy trunk. 

BLUNDER: Yuck! Did you see what he was gonna do? 
Makes me want to puke!

BLIX: I swear by all the bats above, 
Nothing's quite so foul as love!

21 EXTERIOR UNICORN STREAM AND GLADE DAY 

A sun-glided amphithtre within the darker confines of the forest. 
Sparkling like a ribbon of diamonds, a stream flows down the middle. 

Jack leads Lili out of the woods and unties the napkin from around 
her eyes. 

LILI(aewstruck): Oh, Jack. . . .! It's magic! 

21A EXTERIOR STREAMSIDE SHUBBERY DAY 

Some time has passed. Lili is uncomfortable and restless.

LILI: How much longer? 

JACK: Be patient! 

Lili kneels by the bank of the streem, cupping water into her hands. 
Jack stops her from drinking. 

LILI: I'm thristy! 

Jack points at a huge viper moving sinously along the bank. 

JACK: It's poisened the brook. 
No animal will drink here now. 

LILI(indignant): I want some water. 

JACK: Shhh! 

LILI: Don't tell me to be quiet. . . .! 
I'm a princess!

Jack pulls Lili back into hiding. 

JACK(very softly): Just watch! True royalty
approaches. . . .

22 EXTERIOR THE STREAM (JACK & LILI'S POV) DAY 

The radiant LIGHT BEAMS GLEAM through the trees. A moment later, a 
splendid white unicorn moves down the hillside to the edge of the 
stream. This is a stallion. He holds his head proudly. His mate 
stands at the edge of the woods. 

LILI(OS): Ohh....They're so beautiful.... 

The unicorn dips his horns into the stream. 

JACK(OS): The alicorn purifies the water. . . . 

The stallion watches his mare approach to drink. She is slighter and 
more delicate, but every inch as mignificent. 

JACK(cont)(OS): There's no creature with more 
power or magic. . . . As long as they roam the earth, 
evil cannot harm the pure of heart. . . .

23 EXTERIOR LARGE BOULDER OPPOSITE CLEARING DAY

The three goblins crouch hiding.

BLUNDER(disgusted): Ugly one-horned mules!

BLIX: Shhh! 

24 EXTERIOR CLEARING DAY

The Princess is entranced.

LILI: Such grace. . . . Can you speak
their language?

JACK: A little. . . .it's very hard.
Unicorns talk only of love and laughter. 
Dark thoughts are almost impossible for 
them to express.

LILI: Oh Jack. . . I must touch one.

JACK(alarmed): No!

LILI: I want to!

Jack restrains the Princess when she attempts to get up from hiding.

JACK: It is forbidden. These are sacred 
animals.

LILI: Nothing is forbidden me!

JACK: Don't ever say that! You risk
your immortal soul. 

Lili pulls free and steps into the clearing.

LILI: You sound like my confessor. . . . 
I only want to touch one.

The Princess strides defiantly into the open meadow.

The unicorns watch the girl from across the stream. They snort and 
paw the ground.

Lili stands alone, holding her arms to the unicorns.

LILI(singing): Like a child feels watching a rainbow.
Like a brid feels the first time it flies
I feel magic stirring within me,
When I look in my true love's eyes.

The Stallion's nostrils flare. His strong neck arches. Sunlight 
gleams on his horn as he charges.

From Lili's POV the stallion is terrifying as he thunders towards 
her acroos the stream.

The stallion rears and prances, racing around the Princess as if 
drawn foward on an invisable lead.

Jack watches from the underbrush, his outrage tinged with more than 
a touch of jealously.

25 EXTERIOR BOULDER DAY

Blix, Pox and Blunder peer from their hiding-place. Evil leers 
brighten their impish features.

POX(whipering): M-m-might as well be fish
in a barrel. . . One would hope for a 
t-t-touch more sp-p-port. . . .

Blix clamps his hand over Pox's mouth.

BLIX: Pox! Shut your yap!

26 EXTERIOR CLEARING DAY

The lureof the virgin is too strong for the unicorn to resist. Lili 
makes no move as the trembling stallion stands before her, the 
rapier tip of his horn pressed against her breast. It is obvious he 
could kill her is an instant.

The Princess calmly reaches out and caresses his muzzle. 

LILI(singing): When the darkness falls like a curtain
And the rivers and streams turn to ice,
I have summer and daylight forever
When I look in my true love's eyes.

Across the stream, the mare paces back and forth, obviously 
agitated.

27 EXTERIOR BEHIND THE BOULDER DAY

Blix pulls a long black flute from his quiver. He takes a dried 
hornet from a black snail-shell with a hinged lid and slips it into 
his flute, aiming the instrument like a blowgun.

BLUNDER: Steady....take your time....
Don't miss...

Blix silences the foolish golbin with a ferocious scowl. His cheeks 
puff. There is a soft PHUT of expelled breath.


28 EXTERIOR CENTRE OF CLEARING DAY

The poisened hornet sails the air and strikes the hornet on the 
haunch.

Stung, the unicorn bolts through the clearing, disappearing into the 
undergrowth with the mare hard on his heels.

The Princess stands be confused and bewildered.

Distant THUNDER disturbs the tranquility.

Jack rushes to Lili's side.

LILI: Oh, Jack, it was so lovely...
like a dream.

JACK(angry): You're lucky it wasn't a 
nightmare!

LILI: Don't be such a scold.... Come,
I'll chase your fears away.

The Princess takes Jack by the hand and leads him from the clearing.

29 EXTERIOR FOREST (UNICORN HUNT) DAY

The unicorns plunge through brambles and fern clumps. Leaping a 
deadfall log, the stallion stumbles. He struggles to his feet and 
continues running.

The three goblins gallop pell-mell on their devilish steeds. There 
is nothing comical about them now.

30 EXTERIOR RING POND DAY

Jack and Lili sit atop a high promontory jutting over a crystalline 
pond.

LILI: Sweet William did a-hunting go,
In the wood where faeries dwell.
From dawn to dusk roamed he to and fro,
Lost, O lost, all under thier spell.

31 EXTERIOR FOREST (UNICORN HUNT) DAY

The stallion stagger, his gait increasingly unstable as the poisen 
takes effect.

The mare nuzzle his flank where the envenomed hornet struck. It is a 
virulent ound, red and swollen.

The war-like SHOUTING of the goblins grows even closer.

The unicorns pause at a fork in the trail. The stallion motions with 
his head. Sadly, the mare compreheads and flees down the divergent 
path to safetly.

The stallion stands his ground. When the three goblin hunters gallop 
towards him, he turns and limps into the woods.

32 EXTERIOR RING POND DAY

Jack lies beside Lili, listening raptly to her poem.

LILI(reciting): Came he at last to where bluebells grow,
He heard them ring, 'tis true to tell.
He lay him down and did not know
The flower's sound was his own death knell.

And while he slept came teh lady fair,
And gathered him up behind her saddle.
Now, all young hunters of bluebells beware
Sweet William rode straight through the 
gate of Hell.

Jack is lost in Lili's smile.

JACK: When I get to heaven, I know just
how the angels will sound.

LILI(enjoying it): Do you flatter all the girls
like that, Jack?

JACK(embaressed) It's the truth.

Lili kisses Jack sweetly. He doesn't respond.

LILI(smiling): Are you afraid of my kiss?

JACK: I'm afraid you'll break my heart.

LILI: Then still your heart... You
are dear to me as life itself.

JACK: Only because I amuse you...Like some
trained bear!

LILI: That's not true! I do love
you, Jack. You must believe me!

JACK: And if I so....no good can come
from it. I am only a Green Man, without
land or title...no name or wealth to 
bring you.

The Princess her golden ring on and off her finger.

LILI: What does it matter. I don't care
about any of that.

JACK: But it does matter....! If not 
now....Someday. What about when the time 
comes for you to marry?

LILI: I want to marry you.

JACK: That's impossible!

LILI: Not if it's what you really 
want, Jack.

Lili shows Jack her ring.

LILI(cont): Don't you wish this was our
wedding ring?

JACK: What if I say yes...? Will my wish
come true?

LILI: It is my right as a princess to
set a challenge for my suitors.

Lili throws her ring high over their heads. It glitters through the 
air, tumbling over and over in the long drop to the pond.

LILI(cont): I will marry whoever finds this 
ring.

The ring spalshes into the cnetre of the pond. Jack strips off his 
leafy cloak and dives headlong from the cliff.

33 EXTERIOR UNICORN DEATH ARENA DAY

Sweat-streaked, the unicorn staggers out of the tree onto a sweeping 
green meadow brilliant with pink bloosoms. Froth bubbles on his 
nostrils. His wide azure eyes betray his panic.

The goblins ride onto the flower-bright meadow. They jump down from 
their mounts in a frenzy.

BLUNDER(excited): We got him now....!
We got him now!

The stallion stumbles forawrd, making a last futile effort to attack 
the goblins. Limbs leaden, head hanging, the noble animal settles 
against a sapling and slides to the ground.

Thunder RUMBLES overhead. A wild wind whips the pink blossoms into 
the air.

34 EXTERIOR UNDERWATER RING POND DAY 

The golden ring drifts down, tumbling in a lazy spiral.

Jack's pale form stabs through the crystal water. The distant glint 
of the sinking ring lures him on.

The ring settles into the mud at the bottom, concealed by waving 
weeds.

Jack searches blindly as clouds of silt billow about him.

35 EXTERIOR UNICORN DEATH ARENA DAY

The three goblins advance towards the fallen unicorn through a pink 
blizzrd of wind blown blossoms.

35A EXTERIOR SKY DAY

The black clouds boil and CRASH, thunderheads mounting one upon 
another in a dark maelstrom.

36 EXTERIOR UNICORN DEATH ARENA DAY

The goblins stands around the fallen unicorn. Blunder turns away as 
Pox seizes the end of the alicorn, lifting it off the ground. Blix 
swings an evil battle-axe high up over his head.

Jagged lightning splits the raging darkness as the black blade 
falls.

Blix waves the severed alicorn in triumph.

The whirling pink petals turn instantly into white snowflakes.

37 EXTERIOR RING POND DAY

Apolcalyptic winds SCREAM through the forest. Lightning FLASHES.

The world is plunged into winter darkness.

Lili clings to a tree trunk.

LILI(in desparation): Jack! Help me!

The Princess can't maintain her grip. The icy blasts knock her to 
the ground and she crawls to the cliff edge.

LILI(cont)(screaming): Jack!

The her horror, Lili sees a skin of ice form over the surface of the 
pond.

LILI(cont) (sobbing): Oh, dear God.... Jack.....
no....

Fighting the raging winds, Lili stumbles to the pond and pounds on 
the ice in frustration. It is no use.

LILI (cont): ....got to get help!

Frantically, Lili runs off into the storm-whipped woods.

38 EXTERIOR UNDERWATER RING POND DAY

Jack turns and looks up at the dark surface. He storkes upwards, 
only to bump his head into something solid at the top. The pond is 
covered by a sheet of ice!

39 EXTERIOR RING POND DAY

Jack's contorted face is seen through the ice.

He breaks the frozen surface with his fist and his gasping head 
thrusts into the air.

JACK(shouting): Lili....!

His words are lost on the wind.

40 EXTERIOR COTTAGE MEADOW DAY 

Winter shrouds the tiny homestead. Immobile goats, chickens and 
ducks stand silent as snow statues in the farmyard.

Lili runs from the frozen forest and stumbles up the cottage steps. 

41 INTERIOR COTTAGE (FROZEN) DAY

The Princess barges in, wild-eyed and distraught.

Frost rimes the walls and furnishings. Everything glisten like sugar 
candy. The Woodcarver and his wife are frozen solid.

LILI: Nell....! Arthur....!

Lili touches the wife's gelid cheek.

LILI: Nell....? Oh, nooooo!

Lili is shocked to discover the wife is frozen.

The Princes throws herself sobbing across the bed.

SOUNDS of SNORTING and SHOUTING come from outside
. 
Lili scratches the frost off the window pane in the sleeping alcove.

42 LILI'S POV : THROUGH WINDOW

The noisy goblins ride up on a makeshift sleigh of lashed animal 
bones. They stop outside and clamber out. Blix has the alicorn 
tucked under his arm.

43 INTERIOR COTTAGE DAY

Terrified, Lili runs wildly across the cottage and clims the ladder 
to the loft.

43A INTERIOR COTTAGE LOFT DAY

Barrels and chests are stored here. Cured bacon and hams hang from 
the rafters. Lili hides in a corner with several twig brooms and a 
butter churn. She wraps herself in an old quilt snatched from an 
open trunk.

Snows blows in through a hole in the roof, covering the floor 
timbers. Three-inch gaps between the planks permit a view into the 
cottage interior.

43B LILI'S POV : BETWEEN PLANKS

The front door slams open and the goblins stumble laughing inside.

BLIX: Mortal world turned to ice,
Here be goblins' paradise!

43C INTERIOR COTTAGE DAY

Blunder sinks his handaxe onto the kitchen table as he saunters past 
the frozen tarts.

BLUNDER: Lots to eat!

Pox runs forward to the cradle and seizes the frozen baby, baring 
his tusks for the feast.

POX: I s-s-simply adore m-m-milk-fed meat!

BLUNDER: What're you....? Some kinda animal?

Horrified, Lili GASPS (OS) in the loft.

The goblins cock their ears to listen. Pox SNARLS and drops the baby 
back in the cradle.

Curious, Blunder starts up the ladder to the loft, but changes his 
mind half-way, more interested in what Blix is doing.

BLIX: Why eat cold? It's better hot!

Blix points the alicorn at the frozen stewpot on the hearth. It 
begins to steam and bubble, magically boiling without a fire 
underneath.

POX: Am-m-mazing! How did you d-d-d-do that, old, ch-ch-chap?

Blix is equally surprised by the alicorn's power. He CACKLES and 
aims it at the clock on the mantle.

The clock's hand spin wildly around backwards, the carved figures 
darting in and out at fives times their normal speed.

Blix launches on an orgy of destruction, waving the alicorn like a 
magic wand. Plates shatter, the cradle rocks. furniture topples, 
Toby mugs come WAILING alive, painted wooden toys dance and caper.

The goblins SHRIEK with impish joy.

43D INTERIOR LOFT (FROZEN) DAY

Lili watches the havoc through the gaps in the floor.

Blix points the alicorn straight up. Snow flies wildly around the 
crouching Princess.

The broom and the butter churn begin a mad dance across the crowded 
loft.

It is all the Princess can do to keep from screaming.

43E INTERIOR COTTAGE (FROZEN) DAY

As a grand finale, Blix points at Nell's frozen figure, blowing her 
skirts above her waist.

POX(languidly): M-m-most amusing Blix....most
terribly amusing.

BLUNDER: This is sure our lucky day.
Killed that ugly one-horn dead as a cowplop
on a birthday cake!

BLIX: Prattle, prattle like a priest!
(pointing to himself)
It was me who shoot the beast!

POX: Without the p-p-princess for bait,
you'd never gotten close....
B-b-beauty brought the b-b-beast
to bay.

BLUNDER: She's so sweet....I could
eat her brains like jam!

43F INTERIOR LOFT (FROZEN) DAY

Lili slumps against the wall, aghast at what she's just overheard.

43G INTERIOR COTTAGE DAY

Blunder and Pox fill a sack with frozen tarts.

POX: I'd like such her b-b-bones!

Blix points the alicorn at the cottage door. It flies open with a 
CRASH.

BLIX: Better hurry! Can't be late!

Blix marches out of the door. The other two goblins follow, darrging 
their sacks of tarts.

BLUNDER: When we deliver that horn, 
Pox ol' buddy, Darkness gonna give us a humongous big
reward.

Blunder and Pox leave, slamming the door behind them.

After a long pause, Lili creeps sobbing down the ladder from the 
loft.

LILI: Oh, God.... God....

The Princess stumbles across the cottage towards Nell.

LILI(cont) What have I done...? I didn't
want the unicorn to die.... All I did
was touch it....

Lili pleads with the frozen Wife, as if begging for her forgiveness. 
She is interrupted by the gruff voice of a House BROWNIE.

BROWNIE(OS): You're a wicked, wicked girl!

Lili looks up and sees a long-bearded Brownie standing next to the 
clock on the mantle.

43H LILI'S POV : BROWNIE

BROWNIE: The world is in a fine mess
because of you.

43I BROWNIE'S POV : LILIbr 
LILI(desperately) : I'll make it somehow....
I swear it...! I don't care what happens to
me.

43J LILI'S POV : BROWNIE

BROWNIE: Words...mere words.... Bolds
deeds be needed now! Look at you!
Pampered and soft! Never done a day's
work in your life....

LILI(OS): Who are you?

BROWNIE: Me...? I'm the house brownie...
I keep dust devils under the bed and all
the china cracked.... You know how a watched pot
never boils? I do that...and I'm
a wizard at turning sweet milk sour....

The front door CRASHES loudly open.

43K INTERIOR COTTAGE (FROZEN) DAY

Little Blunder swaggers into the cottage.

Lili covers her face with the quilt and holds herself rigid as if 
frozen. The Brownie ducks out of sight.

Blunder stalks to the kitchen table and pulls his axefree. He does a 
double-take on spotting the Princess. The tiny goblin can't remember 
can't remember if he saw her earlier or not.

He pokes her and lifts her skirt to peek at her legs. He is stopped 
short by Blix's angry CRY outside:

BLIX(OS): Blunder! Move your butt! On the double!

Blunder hurries to the door.

Lili relaxes when she hears it SLAM.

LILI: Thank God....

Lili looks up at the mantle.

LILI(cont) (sobbing): Can you....help me?

437 LILI'S POV : BROWNIE

BROWNIE: Can I what?

LILI(OS): Help me....

BROWNIE(sadly): I'd like to....but I'm
a domestic sort of chap....no good at all
where demons are concerned....

43M BROWNIE'S POV : LILI

LILI: Then I'll do it myself! I'll follow those 
goblins....somehow.....
even if it costs my life!

43N LILI'S POV : BROWNIE

BROWNIE: I like your spirit! There's always 
hope when a brave heart back a noble cause....
but what chance have you? They have the alicorn!
The power is theirs!

43O BROWNIE'S POV : LILI

The Princess resolutely hurries about the cottage, gathering things 
to eat and other useful items.

LILI: I will do it! You'll see....I
fooled them now, didn't I.... Well,
I'll do it again easy as pie....

Lili starts for the door.

BROWNIE(OS): Wait....! Take this....!

Lili turns back.

43P LILI'S POV : BROWNIE

The Brownie pulls a golden feather from his cap and tosses it down 
to Lili.

BROWNIE: 'Tis from the tail of the cockatrice....
Make you as fleet as a running deer. And better, when
things seem at their darkest, 'twill remind
you always that hope is alive....

43Q BROWNIE'S POV : LILI

The Princess tucks the feather into her bodice.

LILI: Thank you....Hope is just what
I need.

Lili rushes from the cottage back into the snow.

44 EXTERIOR FOREST (SNOW TRAVELER) DAY

A full-scale blizzard drives down through the naked tree limbs. Jack 
slogs forward, near frozen.

JACK(calling): Lili....! Lili....!

Jack sees a tiny bird, frozen solid on a branch. He takes it 
tenderly down, trying to warm it with his breath.

JACK(cont): What's happened....

Standing rigid all around him are numbers of frozen animals.

He can do nothing for the bird and trudges on into the storm.

JACK(cont)(calling): Lili....! 

Up ahead, the figure of a man is barely discernible.

Jack runs to the man, thinking himself saved..

Jack discovers the man is frozen, like the bird. His initial shock 
gives way to releif. The man is his salvation after all.

Quickly, he unties the stranger's travel bags and cloak.

JACK(cont): God rest your soul.... I know you
won't mind if I borrow your things.

Jack wraps himself in the claok and finds a tinder box in the travel 
bag.

He scrapes together a pile of twigs, striking sparks with the flint 
and steel to start them smouldering.

45 DELETED : TRANSPOSED TO 46D

46 EXTERIOR FAERIE CIRCLE NIGHT

A campfire blazes. Jack sleeps beside a tiny fire, shivering under 
his new cloak.

A tiny glowing LIGHT streaks out of the woods. It circles around 
Jack. The LIGHT touches the fire and it BLAZES up like a bonfire, 
waking Jack.

JACK: What....?

46A JACK'S POV : LIGHT

Jack stares at the radiant buble hanging above him. He sees a tiny 
woman-child with delicate dragonfly wings trapped inside. This is 
LUNA.

JACK (cont)(OS): Who're you?

46B EXTERIOR FAERIE CIRCLE NIGHT

Luna ZOOMS off into the treetops.

Jack grabs a flaming brand and jumps to his feet.

JACK (cont): Who's there....?

Watching him through the drifting smoke in GUMP, an elf no more than 
the waist high. Slightly built, he is near-naked in spite of the 
cold. His face is that of a child, yet his eyes shine with a wisdom 
centuries old.

GUMP(smiling mysteriously): Here you be a forest
child and not know the Gump....

JACK: Gump, is it?

GUMP: Aye, Jack.... Honeythorn Gump at 
your service.....

The air is filled with frenzied CLICKS and SNAPS: stones tapping, 
stick's rubbing, logs being thumped, etc.

Numbers of green-glowing eyes stare at Jack out of the shadows.

JACK (frightened): How d'you know my name?

GUMP: How does a migrating swallow know 
the way south in winter....? Or a 
spawning salmon find the tiny freshet of
his birth from the black cold depths of the
mysterious sea....? I know everything, Jack!

JACK: Everything....? Why has this
happened? Why is it winter now?

GUMP: I'd be a powerful wizard indeed could I answer....
(shrewdly): Suppose you tell me , Jack.

Jack in uncomfortable.

JACK: Me? How can I do that?

GUMP: You know these woods as well as
any elf.... Did you not see 
something odd today? Any strange spirits?
Did nothing untoward happen?

JACK: No....well.... I took Lili to see
the unicorns.....

GUMP (furious): You did what?

Numbers of elves and faeries appear out of the dark woods. They come 
in all sizes, from sprites no larger than squirrels to plump hobmen 
as big as small children.

BROWN TOM is a plump, tipsy leprechaun, draped with pots and pans 
like a tinker; SCREWBALL, a tiny pixie wearing an ill-fitting cap 
and garments tassle with flowers.

FAERIES (whispering in chorus): What....? 
Codfish and cockles....! Never....! Pewterpots and....
pumpkins....! Poo-poo pudding....! Doo-doo 
dumplings....! Shit-willy whatnot....!

GUMP: Silence!

The whipering stops. All eyes are on Jack. He writhes with guilt 
under thier scrunity.

JACK(deepling ashamed): Oh God, 
she touched him....

A GROAN rises from the crowd of faeries. They are outraged. Gump is 
the maddest of all. His face darkens. His eyes glow. He trembles 
with banshee fury.

GUMP: Touched it! A mortal laid hands 
on a unicorn?

BROWN TOM: Bad....terrible bad!

JACK: We meant no wrong.

GUMP (screaming): What was it you did 
mean, Jack!

JACK: Nothing....

GUMP (cold and hard): Nothing, he calls it!

JACK: I wanted to share something special 
with her.

GUMP: Well.... I have something now to share with you....a lively 
reel to warm your bones!

Gump magically pulls a violen out of thin air.

JACK: I'm in no mood for dancing.

GUMP(screaming with wrath): Squawk! Squawk!
No more talk.... Do you think you can
upset the order of the
universe and not pay the price?

Brown Tom produces ancient bag pipes, Screwball a tambourine. The 
other wee folk tune up an incredible variety of oddly-shaped 
instryemnts : seashell trumpets, acorn cellos, gossets, serpentines, 
blossom-bell horns, bone flutes, all manner of drums and rattles.

A wild and haunting overture begins. The rhythm is complusive.

Jack cannot control his body. His feet move against his will.

JACK(frantic): No! I want no part of
your nonsense.

Gump leers demonically.

GUMP: Time to dance, Jack!

Playing his fiddle, Gump is possessed, demonic.

Screwball beats on a log with a pair of shin bones. The faerie 
orchestra breaks into an other-world melody. Jack leaps and jumps 
like a zombie.

JACK: No...! Please....!

BROWN TOM(chanting): Round and round and round and round,
Before you're lost, you must be found
. 
The tempo increases. The musicians leap and cavort.

Jack twists and capers, dancing against his will.

SCREWBALL(chanting): In and out and up and down, 
Behind each smile there lurks a frown.

Gump leaps wildly, fiddling like a demon. Jack is a prisoner of the 
frenzied music.

BROWN TOM(chanting): Spin and spin and spin and spin, To learn to 
lose you first must win.

Gumps hops into the fire, dancing and playing as sparks leap about 
him. The music grows wilder. Jack will never survive.

SCREWBALL(chanting): Twist and reel and toe and heel,
The end to pain is to learn to feel!

Jack's face is a mask of agony. With supreme effort, he hurls 
himself onto the ground, his body jerking spasmodically to the 
music.

JACK(screaming):Enough!

The faerie orchestra falters, their tempo broken.

GUMP(angry): Is the music not to your liking?

JACK(gasping): I....won't....go....on...Take
my life, if you must.... What I did
is unforgiveable....
(boldly) But, I did it for love! And I'd do
it again! I love Lili with all my heart and
would sooner die than break a 
promise!

Gump stares at Jack. A tender expression softens his flinty eyes.

GUMP: Hmmmm..... Love, you say....? Love is 
another story....

JACK: I meant no disrespect....

GUMP: Answer me this riddle and
all is forgiven.

JACK: And if I cannot?

GUMP: Why, Jack....then 'tis your
death song I'll be playing.

JACK: Ask away, and pray God my answer
pleases you.

GUMP: What is a bell that does not ring,
Yet, its knell makes the angels sing?

Gump laughs, knowing Jack can't solve his riddle. Jack frowns in 
concentration, then grins, as the memory of Lili's song rushes back.

JACK: Bluebells!

GUMP: What?

JACK: The flower. Bluebells. To hear
then ringing means your life is
at an end.

Gump hurls his violin to the ground and stomps on it.

GUMP: Damnation! Codfish and cockles!
Gammon and trotters!

Screwball and Brown Tom run for cover as Gump explodes in an insane 
fury. He throws himself to the ground, kicking and SCREAMING.

GUMP(cont): Rabbot noodles....! Schweinhundt
saukraut mit schlagober....!
Piddle-puddles und ka-ka crumpets....!
Piss pots and thunder mugs!
Demkopf doo-doo brains riddle-widdler!

Abruptly, Gump stands and dusts himself off as if nothing had 
happened. He smiles at Jack and holds out his tiny hand.

GUMP(cont): You bested me, Jack....
Bested me.... bested me...

JACK(modestly): A riddle with an answer
is like an empty cup when you're 
thirsty for wine.

GUMP: Well spoke! And if it's wine you
want, it's wine we shall have.

Gump claps his hands and four tiny glasses magically APPEAR, 
floating in the air before them.

Another clap and Brown Tom's hat POPS off his head, revealing a wine 
bottle balanced underneath.

GUMP(cont): A small measure of entertainment 
at best.

Gumps snaps his fingers and the wine bottle floats off Brown Tom's 
head, pausing to in mid-air to fill each bobbing glass.

GUMP(cont): Elderberry wine....no finer drink 
under heaven.

Each one takes a glass. Gump raises his in a toast.

GUMP(cont): Here's to Jack....riddle-solver....
dancing fool, and faerie friend.

They all clink glasses. Jack regards his with suspicion.

JACK: I'm honoured, Gump....But no more tricks!

GUMP(to the others): Here be precious summertime frozen
into a winter memory and the blamed 
fool won't drink faerie wine for fear of
enchantment.

They all drink, Jack with some relunctance. The faeries enjoy the 
wine. Jack gags, as if he's swallowed fire.

JACK(coughing): Pranks....! Is that all you're good
for....! I've lost Lili....! Gump!
Help me! Use your magic to find her....
set the world right.

GUMP: Changing this frozen hell is beyond
my modest powers.

JACK: Is there nothing you can do?

GUMP: If you want more tricks, I'm your
man.... but, for big questions, you must 
go elsewhere.

JACK: But don't you care what's happened?

GUMP: Course we care.... What good's the 
world locked in a season of death?
No folks to scare on a summer's
night....

BROWN TOM: No babies to tickle....

SCREWBALL: No lovers to tease....

GUMP: No more spells to cast....Does that
sound like an enjoyable prospect?

JACK: We must find the answer!

GUMP: That we must. But first, we better 
see that no harm's come to the
unicorns.

SCREWBALL: I sadly fear the worst....

Gumps claps his hands and everyone is magically holding
luminous flower lanterns.

46C EXTERIOR DEEP FOREST NIGHT

Seen from a distance, the lantern-lit faerie procession glows like 
foxfire between the massive trees.

46D EXTERIOR SNOW (LILI TRACKS GOBLINS) NIGHT

Princess Lili tuns swiftly between the frozen trees, following the 
tracks of the goblins. The quilt is torn, her hair dishevelled. She 
pauses at the top of a small, steep hill. 

The tracks of the goblins' sleigh pass below.

Lili jumps from the hilltop, leaving the quilt floating behind like 
a discarded skin. It is an incrediable leap.

She lands with the sureness of a wild woodland creature and runs 
off, hair streaming behind, following the trail of the sled.

47 EXTERIOR UNICORN DEATH ARENA NIGHT

The faerie procession moves out of the woods onto the frozen meadow.

FAERIES(singing together): What can you do when there's Nothing to 
be done?
Sing a little song
And have fun, fun, fun....

The silhouette of the unicorn is glimpsed in the glow of the faerie 
lanterns.

Led by Jack, the faeries run towards the recumbent stallion.

Wisp stoops and picks up an arrow dropped by the goblins.

GUMP: This is goblins' work....
Powerful demons are agaisnt us!

Jack kneels sadly beside the ice-glazed unicorn.

The SOUND of CRASHING HOOFBEATS alerts the faeries as the mare 
unicorn thunders out of the trees.

BROWN TOM: Take cover, laddies!

The faeries dive for protection. Only Jack stands his ground.

The mare charges straight at Jack. He is knocked to his knees as she 
gallops past.

The unicorn wheels about. Jack scrambles to his feet.

She charges again, skidding to a stop on the frozen grass. Her 
alicorn is aimed straight at Jack's throat.

GUMP: Run, Jack!

JACK: The fault was mine. I owe her 
my life.

GUMP: Nobly spoken, lad, and nobility
is her gift in return.

The mare makes a soft NOISE deep in her throat. It is a cross 
between whale song and the cooing of doves.

Jack responds in kind, imitating the sound exactly.

SCREWBALL: What's he saying? What's
it mean?

BROWN TOM (shrugging): Search me.... I speak
some rabbit, but not a word of unicorn.

The unicorn continues, a SOUND as close to music as anything in 
nature. Jck listens intently and answers her.

GUMP: Come on Jack, don't keep us in
the dark.

JACK: The dark is where we'll stay....
We're cursed. All warmth and light
was lost when the stallion died.

BROWN TOM: Is there naught we can do?

JACK: We must get the alicorn back.
Only then will the world return to normal.

GUMP: And how do faeries fight a demon?

JACK: She says we're to find a champion....
a mortal, bold of heart and pure in
spirit.

SCREWBALL: Look....! Look....!

Screwball points to the mare's hoofprints in the snow. Tiny wild 
flowers spring to life within each indentation.

JACK: That is the warmth of her soul.
Not even death's icy hand can stop
it!

SCREWBALL: Little good her soul'll do us now.

BROWN TOM: Screwball's right. Where we gonna 
find a champion when every mortal can swing a
sword is froze stiff as an icicle?

GUMP: Don't give up so quick, lads.
(feeling Jack's arm)
You sure you're mortal?

JACK(indignant): Course I am!

BROWN TOM(dubious): What sort of mortal
speaks unicorn?

SCREWBALL: Why aren't you frozen then?

JACK: I don't know.... I was underwater....
and when I came up for air, everything
was covered with ice.

GUMP: You'll do.... We best get you
some weapons.

JACK(puzzled): Weapons....? What are they?

BROWN TOM (dubious): He's no champion,
Gump.

GUMP: We'll have to make him one....
or kill him trying....!
Follow me!

Gump leads Jack and the others into the woods. The unicorn follows. 

FAERIES(singing together): What can you do when there's
nothing to be done?
Sing a little song 
And have fun, fun, fun....

48 EXTERIOR GREAT TREE NIGHT

Lili creeps around the base of the tree, making no sound. She moves 
with the grace of an animal and hides behind a gnarled root where 
she can watch the goblins.

Blix holds court, surrounded by a lantern's glow. Pox sits on a bit 
of crumbling masonary. Blunder watches Blix gesture with the 
alicorn.

BLIX: Look at us! Waiting around like
lackies....and for what? We're the 
ones with the power!

BLUNDER: You shouldn't talk like, Blix.
We gets in plenty big trouble!

BLIX: I'm not afraid! Not even Darkness lasts 
forever!

Blix aims the alicorn at Blunder, causing a burst of fire to erupt 
beneath the tiny, helmeted goblin.

Blunder YELPS and runs off, clutching his flaming backside.

Blix roars with laughte. Power has gone completely to his head.

BLIX (cont): Watch out, Pox!

Blix points the alicorn at Pox. Fire explodes beneath the pig-faced 
goblin. He leaps SCREAMING into the air.

Blix points the alicorn at the fire he started and it grows larger.

BLIX (cont): Higher.... higher....
Burning fire! 
Making music
Like the choir!

Blunder and Pox watch Blix make the fire fountain into the air.

The heavens blaze. Lili is dazzled.

Something very strange is happening within the swirling column of 
flame. Gradually, a demonic face emerges,

Outlined in the fire we see the leering face of Darkness!

Pox and Blunder applaud Blix's rebellion.

POX/BLUNDER (chanting): Higher.... higher..
Burning fire!
Making music 
Like a choir!

The three unsuspecting goblins looks up and see the demonic Lord of 
Darkness flaming above them.

Blix tosses the alicorn into the air. Blunder unwittingly catches 
it.

BLIX: Greetings, Worship....

POX: W-w-welcome, Great Lord....
D-d-darkest of the ....

DARKNESS: Your devotion disgusts me? You 
insignificant strands of toad slobber!

Blix and Pox drop grovelling to their knees, covering their heads 
with leaves and dirt.

Blunder can't control himself. He rushes forward and points the 
alicorn up at Darkness.

BLUNDER: Hear me, you angels of light!
Your reign is over! A new order 
begins! All the imps of Hell will 
dance freely over this dark land....
I hold the power....

DARKNESS: Enough!

Darkness points a burning finger at Blunder. The alicorn is rippef 
from the goblin's graps and flies up to Darkness. Blunder YELPS in 
terror.

Something terrible happens: the ground around Blunder begins to 
soften. To his horror, the little goblin sinks under as if into 
quicksand.

BLUNDER: Please.... It was only a joke...
I didn't mean it.... Honest....!

Blunder is in up to his neck. 

BLUDNER (cont): Whatsamatter? Have you no sense of
humour? I hope you choke of faerie 
breath and flower petals!

Blunder's hand points up from the earth. Darkness ZAPS it, turning 
it to another chicken-claw!

Blunder is gone without a trace; sucked under with a disgusting 
SLURP.

Darknesss HOWLS his triumph to the heavens.

From her place of concealment, Lili overhears every word.

DARKNESS: Did you think this alicorn a mere
plaything....? With it my empire 
is eternal! Before I ruled only 
the night. Now, my minions will
frolic in darkness until the end 
of time.

Darkness aims the alicorn at the column of fire started by Blix, 
tracing an arc of flames through the night.

Like a mad orchestra conductot with a magic baton, Darkness controls 
the fire's movements. The blaze twists and swirls across the black 
night, blazing meteor trails, bright as the aeora.

BLIX (fawning): Forgive this intrusion.... My
goblins are a free-spirited lot.
I like to encourage their....
initiative. What do you think of
this policy, Master?

Columns of flame shower around the Dark Lord and from within thier 
incendiary interiors, evil wraith-like spirits emerge, swirling like 
ghosts.

Bright as comets, numbers of etheral flaming spirits orbit their 
fiery master. Darkness stands in total control within their mighty 
conflagration, the alicorn his sceptre.

Suddenly, with the pure clarity of a BELL CHIME, the presence of 
DAYLIGHT is detected.

The reflected glow of the coming dawn tinges the ground and casts it 
luminence over Darkness and the goblins.

DARKNESS (cont) (writhing): What is this light...?

Beams of rising sunlight advance down the tree trunks.

Darkness recoils, wrapping his flaming cloak about him.

DARKNESS (cont): You killed the final unicorn....
Is this not true?

Blix and Pox exchange guilty looks.

BLIX: This is true....

POX: Undeniably t-t-true, Lord.

Darkness is on to them. He points with the alicorn.

DARKNESS: You lie! Here is dawn!

POX: Well.... almost t-t-true....
ess-s-sentially true....

BLIX: That stallion is dead, dead as dreams,
dead as legend....

DARKNESS: OUT WITH IT!

Sunlight is half-way to the ground. Darkness shrinks, shrivelling 
like a dying ember.

POX: But.... but.... the m-m-mare still
lives...

DARKNESS: If even one unicorn walks the 
earth, my power is not complete....

BLIX: Just a female.... She has no
power...
. 
The ground grows very light. Darkness melts into the campfire.

DARKNESS: Only the power of creation....?
Get that female....! I command
you.... In the name of Darkness....

Sunlight strikes the ground. Darkness is gone! His arm holding the 
alicorn aloft the fire is the last to disappear.

Lili backs silently into the shadows surrrounding the Great Tree.

49 EXTERIOR FOREST PATH DAY

Lili runs straight into a driving blizzard. A distant SOUND alerts 
her and she pauses to listen.

It is Jack and the faeries, SINGING. Jack's voice carries above the 
others.

JACK & THE FAERIES (os): When times are hard and things look bad,
Don't feel blue and don't feel sad....

A look of astonished joy comes over Lili's face. As the SOUND of 
singing FADES, she runs towards it, calling eagerly.

LILI: Jack....! Ja-aack!

50 EXTERIOR PATH TO GUMP'S CAVE DAY

Jack and the faeries troop march through the blizzard, all SINGING 
merrily.

JACK & THE FAERIES (singing): If your down, wearin' a frown,
That's the time to dance like a clown!

Jack hears something in the distance and stops to listen.

LILI (very faint) (os): Ja-aack.... Ja-aack....

JACK (bewildered): Lili....?

The SOUND of her distant call is erased by the howling storm. Jack 
sadly decides it was a trick of the wind and hurries to catch up 
with the others.

51 EXTERIOR FOREST PATH DAY

Lili stops running. There is nothing but the wailing wind.

LILI (softly): Jack....? Oh, Jack....

A solitary tear starts from her eyes, only to freeze on her cheek 
like a diamond beauty spot.

LILI (cont): Please God.... help me!

Lili drops sobbing to her knees. Through her grief, she sees the 
unicorn's track in the snow, each hoofprint gay with tiny blooming 
flowers.

Her courage restored, Lili follows this meandering trail of 
burgeoning life through the forest.

52 EXTERIOR ENTRANCE TO GUMP'S CAVE DAY

Gumps leads the way a huge BOULDER lodged uner the roots of a giant 
tree.

GUMP (proudly): Here's my home, Jack.... What
d'you think of that for a front
door?

Jack thinks Gump is pulling his leg.

JACK (in jest): Be some job in getting it open.

GUMP: Think you so?

Gump WHISTLES. Immediately, two eyes blink open on the front of the 
boulder, and he is seen to have facial features.

BOULDER: Morning', Gump....

The Boulder stands on a pair of tiny legs and waddles forth from 
under the tree roots, REVEALING the entrance to a cavern.

He promptly trips and rolls over and over in the snows, his tiny 
stone feet kicking wildly in the air.

GUMP (bowing): After you, Jack....

Jack enters apprehensively udner the twisting roots.

JACK: Thank you....

The other faeries follow, leading the unicorn.

53 INTERIOR MOUTH TO CAVE DAY

An earthern antechamber under the tree, high enough for Jack and the 
unicorn. There is a small wooden door at the far end, sealed with a 
bright brass padlock.

GUMP: Brown Tom. Stay here with the
unicorn and guard her well.

BROWN TOM: Like me own life!

GUMP: Better than that! She's the last 
of her kind.

Gump marches to the little wooden door. He inserts a finger into the 
padlock, twisting it like a key. Instantly, the pops apart. Gump 
opens the door and enters a low tunnel beyond.

54 INTERIOR TUNNEL DAY

Tree roots twist down like dead men's fingers and clutch the ancient 
rune stones lodged in the earthen walls.

Gump and Screwball walk upright in the damp tunnel, but Jack is 
forced to crawl on his hands and knees. Luna flies above thier heads 
like a tiny neon insect.

GUMP: Right this way....

Gump pauses by another wooden door, sealed with a brass lock. He 
opens it instantly with his magic touch.

SCREWBALL: Home, sweet home!

55 INTERIOR GUMP'S CAVE DAY

Jack and the faeries enter a cost burrw furnished with carved wooden 
chairs and tables, a porcelain stove and bundles of herbs hanging 
from the ceiling. The simple furniture is overwhlemed by vat piles 
of treasure: gemstones, pearls, chests heaped with gold coins.

GUMP: Fit for a king's ramsom!

Jack in awe as he wades through the ankle-high loot.

JACK: Such riches.... I feel I must be
dreaming....

GUMP: If life is a dream, better you dread
the waking!

Screwball fills a golden helm with rubies and pours them out over 
his head. He laughs like a child in a sandpit.

JACK: ....beautiful....

GUMP: Mere trinkets.... Let's find you
something useful.

Luna's golden LIGHT streaks down and whirls around Jack's head. He 
swats futilely at her.

JACK: Stop it....! Go away....!

GUMP: Easy.... Luna only seeks a little 
affection.

Luna hovers beside Jack's cheek.

JACK: I meant no disrespect, but....
ouch! Make her stop, will you,
Gump!

GUMP: Does your blood run so cold? You'll 
be a corpse before your time.

Gump unstoppers a silver wine decanter and pours three goblets full.

JACK: What does she want from me?

GUMP: Foolish question....
(handing Jack a goblet)
Drink, and wamr your heart.
The answer's at the bottom of 
your cup.

Jack sniffs his goblet suspiciously. This time, he is careful not to 
drink when the faeries do.

GUMP (cont): Now then.... down to business.

Gump pulls a bejewlled broadsword free from its scabbard. It is a 
remarkably beautiful weapon. 

JACK: What's this....? Something to cook
with?

Gump and Screwball exchange a hopeless look.

GUMP(patiently): This is a weapon, Jack.... As fine
a weapon as you'll ever see.

JACK(curious: So, that's a weapon.... What's it
do?

SCREWBALL: World is doomed, if you ask me.

Screwball goes back to playing with the jewels.

Gump pulls a silk handkerchief from his belt.

GUMP: A little demonstration.

Gump tosses the kerchief high in the air and it wafts slowly down. 
The little elf is an expert swordsman. He whirls the weapon in a 
gleaming blur, slicing the drifting handkerchief neatly in half.

GUMP(cont): With such a blade you could behead
an ogre as easily as uncapping a 
soft-boiled egg.

JACK: That's really something.... Can I
try?

Gump hands the sword to Jack.

GUMP: You're the champion, aren't you?

Jack picks up half the kerchief off the jewel-littered floor and 
tosses it into the air. As it flutters down, he swings wildly with 
the broadsword. Gump has to duck to avoid having his own head 
chopped off.

GUMP(cont): Watch out....! You'll get the hang of 
it in time.... Now, we best see 
about some armour..... Screwball!

SCREWBALL: Coming right up!

Screwball flips open the lid of a chest. Folded inside is a golden 
chain-mail coat of exquisite workmanship.

GUMP: Go on.... see if it fits.

Jack slips the coat over his head. It fits perfectly.

GUMP (nodding approval): It will turn a broadhead arrow
ar fifty yards.

SCREWBALL: He might pass for a champion in 
that.

GUMP: Have a look at yourself, Jack.
(pointing: Use yonder shield for a mirror.

JACK(confused): ....Shield?

GUMP(exasperated): The round shiny thing over there.

SCREWBALL: Clothes never made the man....

Gump silences Screwball with a stern look and and stalks over to a 
small carved desk.

There is a loud, MUSICAL CHIME. Gump pulls a remarkable instrument 
from a pouch on his belt: a wonderous crystal globe filled with 
whirling miniature worlds.

GUMP(studying globe): Hmmm... getting late. Almost half-
way past the morning mayfly hatch...
. 
SCREWBALL(sullen): Too cold for mayflies now....
'Sides, I ain't got no timepeice.

GUMP: You first must know how 
to tell the time.

SCREWBALL: I ain't got nothing....

GUMP: No more chatter....! I've got work
to do.

Gump sits at the desk setting his timepeice beside him and rummaging 
among his papers.

Jack kneels before a brightly polished shield and studies his 
reflection.

Luna round and round his head.

SCREWBALL: Think I'll brew some tea.

Screwball snatches variosu herbs off the ceiling.

SCREWBALL(cont): Colt's foot and sassafrass...
Maybe a spot of spearmint....
St John's Wort not bad.... and
a little foxglove.

Screwball feverishly stuffs a silver teapot full of dried herbs.

56 DELETED

57 EXTERIOR PATH TO GUMP'S CAVE DAY

The unicorn's flowering footprints lead Lili to Gump's cave.

She pauses to consider the situation. Snowflakes glisten in her 
tangled hair. She is fiercly beautiful.

Deciding nothing is amiss, Lili stalks silently inside.

58 INTERIOR MOUTH OF CAVE DAY

A small cooking fire flickers under blackened pots and an iron 
skillet. The mare unicorn is bedded down on a blanket of straw. 
Brown Tom lies fast asleep against her flank.

The unicorn lifts her head when Lili tiptoes in.

Brown Tom is jerked awake as the mare climbs to her feet, snorting 
with rage.

BROWN TOM: What....? What....? 
Who's there?

LILI: I'm Princess Lili.... I.....

BROWN TOM: You! You're the cause of 
all our sorrow!

The Princess drops to her knees.

LILI: I know it was wrong.... Everything
is my fault.
(weeping)
Please.... please forgive me.

BROWN TOM: I ain't the one ye should be asking.

LILI: I want to make it up to her....
I followed the goblins! They gave the alicorn 
to the Lord of Darkness!

BROWN TOM: Good lass! You're a plucky
little partridge at that.

LILI: We can't stay here! It's not safe!
Darkness sent the goblins to hunt
the mare... If I found her, so will
they....We msut go!

59 DELETED

60 INTERIOR MOUTH OF CAVE DAY

Brown Tom looks past Lili to the mouth of the cave.

BROWN TOM: Too late!

Pox and Blix stand in the entrance, aiming their wicked, barbed 
arrows straight at the hearts of Lili and Brown Tom.

Brown Tom swings an iron skillet back over his head in a warrior's 
stance.

BROWN TOM: If you imps're looking for a
fight, ye've come to the chap
who'll oblige ye.

BLIX/POX: Kill....! K-k-kill...!
Kill...!

Blix and Pox loose their arrows, renocking the bows with incredible 
speed.

Brown Tom moves like lightning, using the skillet as a shirld to 
deflect the arrows raining about him.

Lili stands in front of the mare, striving to protect the unicorn's 
body with her own.

Brown Tom lepas acrobatically about with the skillet. A fusillade of 
arrows CLANGS OFF its iron surface.

A lucky shot peirces Brown Tom's hat. Dark red liquid streams down 
his face. His eyes roll up in mortal terror.

BROWN TOM: Dick-o-Tuesday's duck! They've done
for me!

Brown Tom staggers in a dramatic half-circle, toppling straight over 
backwards, stiff as a board.

The mare unicorn rears WHINNYING on her hind-quarters.

The goblin hunters advance. Blix spreads a heavy net wide.

The black shadow on the net falls across Lili and the unicorn like 
an evil spider web.

61 INTERIOR GUMP'S CAVE DAY

Screwball's teapot steams merrily. He sits stop a jewel cask 
enjoying a cup. A horned Viking helmet several sizes too large 
covers his head down to the bridge of his nose.

Gump works at his desk, marking out distances on an ancient chart 
with a pair of golden dividers. Dozens of parchment mps are spread 
in front of him.

GUMP(muttering): Forty leagues from the Dragon's
Track.... another half-span past 
the basilisk den.

Gump lifts his elbow and the curled parchment rolls together.

GUMP (cont)(annoyed): Wirrikows and dopplegangers!

SCREWBALL: Spot of tea, Gump....?
Help calm your nerves...

GUMP: Not now! I'm busy with navigation.

On the other side of the cave, Jack practices a variety of thrusts 
and passes with his sword in front of the polished shield.

Luna buzzes around him like a miniature meteorite.

JACK: That's not so bad.... What do you
think, Luna?

Jack studies his reflection in the shield.

There is a BURST OF LIGHT behind him. Luna materialises as a child-
sized woman with gossamer wings. She wraps her slender arms around 
his neck.

LUNA: I think you look like a hero.

JACK: What! H'd you do that?

Jack spins around, but Luna is gone. Only the tiny dot of LIGHT 
hovers in the air.

JACK(cont) (puzzled): Magic....

Jack looks back at the shield and there is a full-sized Luna hugging 
his reflection.

LUNA: Nobody knows nut you. it's our
secret....
(kissing his cheek)
Promise?

JACK (squirming): Don't do that.

LUNA(another kiss): Better promise....

JACK: All right, all right....
I promise.

A loud, MUSICAL CHIEME interrupts Gump's work. he looks around for 
his timepiece but it is nowhere in sight.

GUMP: Hmmmm...? Screwball!

SCREWBALL (all innocence): Something I can
do for you, Gump?

GUMP: Hand it over....!

Sheepishly, Screwball pulls Gump's timepeice from inside his tunic 
and gives it back.

SCREWBALL: Well, well, well....
how'd that get in there? Must be
some kinda magic...

GUMP: Sneak thief's magic!
(studies timepiece)
Jack! it's time we were on
our way!

At the SOUND of Gump's voice, Luna TRANSFORMS instantly back to a 
dot of light.

JACK: I'm ready as I'll ever be....

Jack picks up the shield and starts after Gump and Screwball. Luna 
flies overhead.

62 INTERIOR MOUTH OF CAVE DAY

Brown Tom lies flat on his back as Jack and the faeries emerge from 
the tunnel. 

Gump rushes to his fallen friend, lifting him in his arms.

GUMP: Brown Tom....? You can't be dead....!
Oh, this is is terrible.... terrible!

Brown Tom opens his eyes and looks feebly about.

BROWN TOM (in a daze): Why, Wisp.... 
they kill you, too?

GUMP: Course they didn't! What in blazes
are you talking about?

Brown Tom rolls his eyes up at the arrow piercing his hat.

BROWN TOM: Goblins shot me through
the brain pan.

Gump yanks off Brown Tom's hat. Bits of broken wine bottle tumble 
out. Gump reagrds his friend with scorn.

GUMP: Your brains are one spot an
arrow'd do no harm!

JACK: Where's the unicorn?

Sheepishly, Brown Tom pulls the arrow from his hat.

BROWN TOM: I'm afeered the goblins took her.
Did me best to fight them off, but
they swarmed up by the hundreds.... Horrid
creatures they were. The Princess warned 
me, but....

JACK: Princess Lili?

BROWN TOM: Aye.

JACK(overjoyed): She's alive!

BROWN TOM: She was living still 
when they killed me.

GUMP: You'll earn your champion's spurs
this day, Jack.... We'll follow their
tracks in the snow. Foul weather's on our
side for a change.

62A EXTERIOR FOREST DAY

Jack and the faeries march through the woods holding lanterns, into 
the teeth of a driving blizzard.

63 INTERIOR GREAT HALL DAY

Blix and Pox kneel nervously before the Throne of Darkness. A huge 
fire blazes in the hearth.

POX: Hail m-most great, and d-d-darkest
of the dark!

BLIX: Though we be nothing in your sight,
We bow before your strength and might!

We hear Darkness speak, but see only his bat-winged shadow spread 
like an inky cloak across the two kneeling goblins.

DARKNESS (os): Can you fawning sycophants
do more than grovel? What of the task I set you?

POX: D-d-done, Lord. We have the 
m-m-m-m-m-m.... the unicorn.

DARKNESS(os): Where is she?

BLIX: In the dungeon like a treasure, 
Awaiting your darkest pleasure.

DARKNESS (os): Very good.... You two are not
entirely devoid of talent.

POX: There's m-m-more, Sire....

BLIX: Though unworthy of your magnificence,
Trifles without consequence,
We present with all due deference....
A gift. 

DARKNESS (os): Gift....? What sort of gift?

BLIX: This thing you once called innocence.

DARKNESS (os): Innocence...? I must behold this 
wonder....

Darkness stares into the fire.

As Darkness grimps the arm of his throne, his fingers start to melt, 
dripping to the dank stone floor.

64 INTERIOR DUNGEON DAY 

Darkness bleeds through the groin vault ceiling, speading like a 
stain across the curving stones.

Below, the unicorn is locked in a steel halter, a woven steel cable 
binding her to an iron windlass.

The Princess paces the dark and dripping cell. Her dress is in 
tatters, her hair tangled. There is something wild and free about 
her now, and yet she has never appeared more alluring.

The melting shadow of Darkness drips from the ceiling, forming a 
small demonic shape as it falls.

We hear the BEATING of Darkness' heart in time with each evil drip. 
The sound grows LOUDER and LOUDER until the echo reverberates within 
the vaulted chamber.

Lili is terrified. She looks frantically around as the pulsing rhytm 
continues. The Princess sees nothing and hugs the unicorn's neck for 
comfort.

64A INTERIOR GREAT HALL DAY

Darkness contemplates the raging flames, his heartbeat THUNDERING.

65 EXTERIOR HILL ABOVE GREAT TREE BOG DAY

Jack and the faeries stare out at the tree-crowned ruin and 
surrounding bog.

65A EXTERIOR BOG DAY

Jack and the faeries wade forward through the drifting curtains of 
mist.

JACK: Legend says the Dark Castle stood
in olden days when evil anarchy
ruled the land.... The wicked still
come here to sacrafice.

GUMP: They worship the demon....

SCREWBALL: It's ugly! I hate it!

GUMP: Good! You shall go first....

65B INTERIOR GREAT HALL DAY

CLOSE ON: Darkness. For the briefest instant, we see the smouldering 
eyes of the demon GLOWING in anitcipation out of the shadows.

65C EXTERIOR BOG DAY

Although Jack is in no trouble, the water is rapidly growing too 
deep for the faeries. Gump urges Screwball forward:

GUMP: Go on! Hurry up!

SCREWBALL: All the time me.
Same old story.

Screwball clibs up onto a floating lily pad.

An undulating v-shaped wake moves through the water alongside as 
they step from lily pad to lily padf and clamber onto a long, 
twisting root.

Without warning, an emaciated green arm shoors out of the water and 
grabs Screwball. He is gone under the surface with a scream.

BROWN TOM: Screwball!

JACK: What was that?

GUMP: Big trouble!

Jack grips the hilt of his sword and rushes to the spot where 
Screwball disappeared.

JACK: We've got to do something.

Before Jack can finish, Meg Mucklebones rises out of the bog behind 
him. She tosses Screwball aside and hauls Jack into her cadaverous 
embrace.

MEG: Foul tasting faerie.....! Come to
me, juicy boy!

Jack YELPS in horror.

MEG (cont): Who be this tender morsel
disturbing Meg Mucklebones' rest?

JACK(terrified): They call me Green 
Jack ma'am.

The faeries watch in dismay.

BROWN TOM: Our champion's a goner, he is.

The fearsome hag pinches Jack with her wicked talons.

MEG: What a fine fat boy you are....

JACK: You don't mean to eat me,
do you ma'am?

MEG: Oh, indeed I do....

JACK: That would be a shame, Miss Meg.
You're so lovely. You deserve far 
better than scrawny little
me....

The flattery gives Hairy Meg a pause; she simply can't resist it.

MEG: Hmmmm....think me fair, do you, Jack?

JACK: All the heavenly angels must 
envy your beauty.

MEG: Ooooo....what a find meal you'll make,
be the rest of you as sweet
as your tongue.

JACK: Let me go and I'll sing songs
of praise to you.

MEG: Let you go? Don't be daft. I've
had naught but muskrat and snakes 
all this month.... bit of rancid
goblin, too....

JACK: But....but....don't you like
my words?

MEG: Words are little help in 
filling an empty stomach....

JACK: Then fill your soul with loveliness.
Look into your glass and feast on
beauty.

MEG: There's no looking-glass here....
Sometimes, when the moon is full,
I'll chance to see my reflection
in the bog.

Jack glances at the shield hanging over his shoulder.

JACK: My shield would serve you well.

Meg Mucklebones takes Jack's shield, partially releasing him from 
her clammy clutches.

MEG: What a splendid idea! 
You be so clever, Jack.

Hanging onto Jack with one hand, Hairy Meg bends over the shield.

JACK: Your radiance is the alchemy
that makes rusted steel shine like 
silver.

Meg primps and preens: an obscene parody of a pretty maiden at her 
vanity table.

MEG: Oooo! That's nice! I be the envy
of any princess in the land.

While Meg is pre occupied with her grotesque reflection, Gump 
catches the Jack's eyes. The cunning elf silently mouths the word: 
'sword', pointing to his waist at the same time.

JACK: Better, you are a queen without
a peer.... a reigning angel.

Jack nods to Gump and silently draws his sword. Meg doesn't notice 
thing.

MEG: You have such discerning taste 
for so young a boy....

Meg turns to face him with a fearful pucker of her tattered lips.

MEG (cont): Come, Jack....give us
a kiss before dining.

Jack petrified with fear.

GUMP(shouting): Give her the kiss of 
cold steel, Jack!

Jack swings blindly with his eyes closed. It is a lucky stroke, Meg 
Mucklebones' head flies from her shoulders.

JACK(astonished): I did it!

The decapitated hag sinks back beneath the scummy surface.

GUMP: Like a chmapion, Jack.

BROWN TOM: Bravo!

JACK: How's Screwball?

SCREWBALL: Chewed, but not disgested....

Jack points his sword at the hollow tree.

JACK: Then on to victory!

FAERIES (all together): On to victory!

65D INTERIOR GREAT HALL DAY

A huge fire blazes in the gaping hearth. Darkness stands before it, 
almost a shadow in his midnight cloak.

DARKNESS: I've been an exile for too long....
banished by the sun.... forced to
hide in the bowels of the earth....
On the eve of my greatest victory, this....
child of nature appears.... It has been an eternity
since I felt such desire.... I could know 
her in an instant. She is helpless.... and yet....
(anguished)
What is wrong with me, Father?

A VOICE IN THE FIRE answers Darkness; majestic and sepulrchral; the 
flames billow out as it speaks:

VOICE: You hold the world in your grasp....
Supreme power belongs to you... yet 
your triumph is meaningless!

DARKNESS: Meaningless?

VOICE: What do you gain from it? What pleasure
comes from ruling a pack of imps and
goblins....? Souls already black.... This
innocent creature fascinates you because 
only she can appreciate the enormity
of your achievement.

DARKNESS: I'll take her then!

VOICE: A hollow victory! She remembers 
the world as it was, when she loves your
new order you will triumph! Woo her....
win her.... break her spirit....

DARKNESS: Thank you, Father.... Your
wisdom is ever my guide.

VOICE: Remember.... She must desire you....
nothing else matters!

65E EXTERIOR GREAT TREE DAY

Jack and the faeries step ashore on the island. Gump makes a 
mystical sign with his hands.

JACK: What's that?

GUMP: For our protection, Jack. You must 
be ready.... Remember, Darkness is a liar....
a treacherous fiend! Don't listen to him. 
Never believe what you see.....

JACK: He won't fool me.

GUMP: Don't be so sure! No human has 
ever set foot in this place before! 
66 INTERIOR GREAT TREE DAY

Jack and the faeries stare up at the massive horn embedded in the 
inner tree.

Screwball starts to climb towards it.

SCREWBALL: What a nice big trumpet....! Bet
it sounds louder than anything....

Gump hauls him back down by the seat of his pants.

GUMP: Don't touch it! Our lives are
lost if it blows!

Jack finds an opening hidden between the roots of the inner tree.

JACK: In here! I've found a passage!

Jack drops inside.

66A INTERIOR GREAT HALL DAY

The moment Jack enters the inner tree, a deep TREMOR reverberates 
through the subterranean Castle of Darkness.

Draped in shadows before the fire, the Dark Lord looks up at this 
disturbance.

DARKNESS (to the fire): I feel a presence....!
Some power invades my sanctity....

VOICE (from the flames): Every wolf suffers 
fleas.... 'tis easy enough to
scratch!

The flames surge out towards Darkness, embracing him.

67 INTERIOR TINY ANTECHAMBER DAY

Like the catacombs of Paris, the walls are decorated with bones and 
human skulls. At each corner of the open ceiling is a carved demonic 
head. Jack and the faeries stand looking up.

GUMP(gloomily): The decor of death....

BROWN TOM: Tells you somthing 'bout
him what lives here.

SCREWBALL: It's a dead end....

Jack searches along the ossuary walls.

JACK: Doesn't make sense.... Check
the walls. There must be some sort
of secret key....

Screwball doesn't join the other faeries in the search. He is 
attracted by several round stone balls lying in the rubble. Picking 
up three with a happy grin, he begins to juggle.

SCREWBALL: One-two-three....
fidde-dee-dee....

Gump sees what Screwball is doing and flies into a rage.

GUMP: Screwball! Drop those this 
minute!

Screwball tosses the balls carelessly over his shoulder. One lands 
in the stone cornice near the ceiling and rolls along, gathering 
momentum as it passes through the open mouths of each gargoyle.

The balls disappears into the mouth of the final gargoyle. It is 
swallowed with an emphatic GULP.

All at once, the roof slides shut above.

BROWN TOM(alarmed): Newt-finger marmalade!

The floor pulls suddenly open and they all plummet SCREAMING into 
empty space. Luna circles, a dot of light above tthe bottomless pit.

LUNA (wee voice): Oh, dear.... Oh, dear...

The tiny faerie whirls in a blur of indecision before streaking down 
into the dark opening after her falling friends.

68 INTERIOR CAVE CHUTE DAY

Like prisoners on a fairground helter-skelter, Jack and the faeries 
spin down a seemingly endless curvinbg chute.

GUMP(singing): When times're hard and thing look bad,
Don't feel blue and don't feel sad....

JACK: How can you sing at a time
like this?

GUMP: Can you think of anything 
better to do?

They hurtle through festooned cobwebs, stirring up smokey clouds of 
ancient dust.

69 INTERIOR CAGE AND ALCOVE DAY

The end of the chute opens into an iron cage. Jack and the faeries 
tumble through onto a pile of straw. Luna is right behind, bright as 
a firefly.

BROWN TOM: Ouch! Ow!

SCREWBALL: Where are we?

Gump stares woefully at the iron bars.

GUMP: Some place we don't want to be!

A scuffling NOISE in the far side of the cage attracts their 
attention. Blunder pops up from a pile of straw, still wearing his 
helmet.

BLUNDER: Shhhh! What is this?
A chatterbox convention?
SCREWBALL: Who be you, bucket-head?

GUMP: Stay clear of that imp! He's
a hell hound goblin!

BLUNDER: What I am won't help me 
none, nor you neither....

Blunder pulls off his helmet. He is Screwball's indenical twin!

BLUNDER(cont): ....even if you is my brother!

Screwball can't believe his eyes.

SCREWBALL(astonished) Blunder...!

BLUNDER: Screwball....!

They rush into each other's arms.

GUMP (to Jack): A Buttercup family reunion....!
I can't believe it.... Last I remember,
he sold Screwball a jug of dragon's tears
that turned out to be cow piss!

SCREWBALL: What happened to you?

BLUNDER(flexing his bird claw): It's a long story....
Let's just say I went look for adventure and 
found more'n I could handle....
Doesn't matter now anyway... We're all of us
in the same fix....

JACK: Just what sort of fix is that?

BLUNDER: The kitchen of the Lord of 
Darkness! All of us be on his menu!

SCREWBALL: I knew it! I knew it! Should
of stayed at home....

BLUNDER: That's right, brother, me'n you 
is barbeque!

BROWN TOM: Wish I had a drink....

JACK: Only dead meat waits for the
stewpot! Spring the lock, Gump!

Gump examines the huge padlock with a frown.

GUMP (wearily): Iron is sore trouble for elves.

SCREWBALL: Magic's no good against it.

Jack slumps down in the corner to think things over. The faeries 
mill about by the opposite wall.

Jack stares at the bars. Luna orbits his head.
JACK: I know I promised.... but it's the only way....

Luna buzzes him furiously.

JACK(cont): Sure it's a secret... It'll
keep forever when we're all dead....

Jack glances guiltily at the whirling dot of LIGHT.

JACK(cont) (to Gump): Why not have Luna fly
out between the bars and find a key?

GUMP(shaking his head): She's much too small....
could never lift it...

JACK(blurting it out): Not if she changes 
sizes like she can!

GUMP: What?

There is a bright FLASH of faerie-light and Luna stands full-sized 
before them, her gossamer wings a-tremble.

GUMP(cont)(outraged): You wilful sprite! How dare 
you keep such secrets?

LUNA: They're mine to keep! But I'll do
what you ask.... if you kiss me, Jack.

JACK: That's easy enough.

Jack kisses her chastely on the cheek.

LUNA: Call that a kiss? Am I not sweet?

JACK(eager to please): Sweeter than bee
pollen on a summer wind.

Luna moves in close to Jack.

LUNA: Sweet is the wind thats blows me to 
you....

Jack gently pushes her away.

JACK: It's not possible. I'm in love....

LUNA: A faerie's love makes anything 
possible....

A soft cocoom of faerie LIGHT engulfs Luna. She metamorphoses within 
it, emerging as Princess Lili.

LUNA/LILI: ....even you heart's desire.

Luna/Lili embraces Jack. It is sweet and tempting.

JACK(resisting): No.... this isn't real....

Screwball and Blunder giggle and snigger.

LUNA/LILI: Oh, but it is.... I'm warm and alive
and happy to be in your arms.

Jack is nearly enchanted, but after a delicious moment, he pushes 
away.

JACK: I can't do it....! This is faerie glamour!

A brilliant aura of faerie LIGHT envelops Luna/Lili and she 
TRANSFORMS into her true winged-form
. 
LUNA(bitterly): You....! You....mortal! I
could vex you! Dance you life away!

JACK: Threats can't make you love you.
Human hearts don't work that way.

LUNA: What care I for human heart?
Soft and spiritless as porridge!
A faerie's heart beats fierce and free.

There is a furious pytotechnic whirlwind and, in an instant, Luna 
returns to a tiny dot of LIGHT.

JACK: Luna....?

Without an answer, Luna flies out between the iron bars.

JACK(cont) (to the faeries): I.... didn't mean
to hurt her.

GUMP(scornful): Your fine senseibilities
have left us here to rot.

The SOUND of heavy footsteps approaches, accompanied by rough, 
tuneless SINGING.

COOK(os): ....this li'l piggie went to market....
anudder li'l pigge got eat.... pig-meat
pie, l'l piggie die....

BLUNDER: Oh, no! He's coming...!
Hide! Hide! Hide!

Blunder conceals himself under a pile of straw. A deformed shadow is 
cast across the cage.

SCREWBALL: Blunder's got the right idea!

Screwball hides in the straw. Jack and the other immediately do the 
same.

A fiendish demon COOK opens the cage door. He is ten feet tall and 
unspeakably ugly. He peers blindly inside, sniffing the air with his 
hideous nose.

COOK: ....pig-pig-pig...
. 
The Cook gropes inside the cage.

The Cook reaches deep into the straw pile in teh corner and grabs 
Blunder.

BLUNDER: Help....! Lemme go...?
Turn me loose, you tub o' guts!

The cook hauls Blunder out, kicking and screaming. He locks the cage 
abd stumps away.

BLUNDER(cont): I hope I give you heart-burn!

After a bit, the faeries and Jack peer up out of the straw.

SCREWBALL(woefully): Fricasseed faeries, the lot of us....

BROWN TON: Lambs to the slaughter....

Jack draws his sword.

JACK: Not without a fight!

Transformed back to full-size, Luna tip-toes into the alcove outside 
the cage, her hands coyly behind her.

GUMP: Luna....!

LUNA(maliciously): You look like mourners at your
own funeral.

GUMP(angry): Come back to dance on 
our graves!

LUNA: I'd gladly frolic on Jack's....

She LAUGHS and holds up a large iron key.

LUNA(cont): ....but this cage shan't be 
your tomb!

Luna tosses the key in to Gump. Instantly, she reduces to a tiny dot 
of LIGHT and flies out of the alcove.

GUMP: Well done!

Gump unlocks the barred door and they all clamber out. Screwball 
steps on Brown Tom's head in his eagerness.

SCREWBALL: Lemme outta this stink hole!

BROWN TOM: Mind you bleeding foot!

GUMP: Shhhh! 

Jack is the last of all.

JACK: Keep behind me in case
there's trouble.

Sword in hand, Jack ;eads the faeries out of the alcove into
the kitchen.

70 INTERIOR KITCHEN DAY

Huge ovens belch fire and smoke. The vast hearth blazes. Like the 
lower reaches of Hell, the Dark Lord's kitchen is a place where all 
hope is abandoned.

Jack and the faeries creep through the brimstone haze.

BROWN TOM: Terrible sight for a sober
man to see....

JACK: Quiet!

The demon Cooks blocks the way, chopping meat with a montrous 
cleaver, A SECOND COOK, every bit as terrifying, SNORES by the 
hearth. Trussed to a spit, Blunder hangs upside-down nearby.

Jack motions the faeries on. The blind Cook turns them, sniffing the 
air.

COOK: Whut be there?

Jack and the faeries duck behind a huge bellows.

SCREWBALL: ....Back in the frying pan!

Gump clamps his hand over Screwball's mouth.

Grasping his cleaver, the Cook advances towards them.

COOK(sniffing): Be it live victuals?

From where he hangs, Blunder sees the faeries' plight.

BLUNDER(calling out): Hey....!
Lard belly!

The Cook turns, angered by this insult.

COOK: Whut say, pip-squeak?

BLUNDER: Two things down here look 
just alike!

COOK: Wuzzat?

BLUNDER: Your face and my ass!

The Cook GROWLS with fury.

COOK: Bash in you face! Den it no be 
so pretty!

The Cook backhands poor Blunder, smacking him about like a punching 
bag.

Jack and the faeries make a break for the exit.

Blunder manages to work one arm free from his bonds.

COOK(cont): Whut you got to say now,
pork pie?

Blunder rears back and punches the Cook in the jaw. Stunned,
he topples over over backwards a great CRASH.

70A INTERIOR GREAT HALL DAY 

The reverberations tremble through the immense underground castle. 
Darkness listens by the fire. 

DARKNESS: Do you feel it, Father....? 
A force....loose in my domain.... 

VOICE(out of fire): Guard well what is yours! 

DARKNESS(roaring): BRING INNOCENCE TO ME! 

71 INTERIOR KITCHEN CORRIDOR DAY 

The faerie band gathers in the foul, dripping corridor. Irregular 
torchlight casts a lurid glow across the broken stones. 

BROWN TOM (gasping for breath): 
.....saved....by a goblin.... Never 
thought....I'd see....the day.... 

JACK: Wish we could repay the favour! 

SCREWBALL: My brother can take of himself. 

GUMP: Screwball's right! It's more important 
we find the unicorn. 

JACK: And Lili! 

BROWN TOM: Where do we start? 

GUMP: We must find the dungeons. Legend has 
is they house such sirriw that death 
is a gift....albeit one rarely granted. 

Screwball sits down defiantly. 

SCREWBALL: Think I'll stay right here thank you 
very much. 

Gump grabs hold of Screwball's ear and hauls him back up. 

GUMP: Not so fast! You search with the 
rest of us! 

Screwball hugs Jack's leg. 

SCREWBALL: All right! I'm going with Jack! 

GUMP: No you won't. Be faster if we 
split up. 

Screwball looks both ways, deciding which seems safest. 

SCREWBALL: Fine! I'm going this way! 

BROWN TOM: I'm going that way! 

They both turn and collide, falling flat on their rumps. 

JACK: Wait....! Better to search in 
teams, Gump and me together. Brown 
TOm, you and Screwball look in the 
other direction. 

Gump hauls out his ornate timepeice. 

GUMP: Right! Let's synchronise! We meet 
back here in twice five hundred 
beats of a bluebird's heart. 

Brown Tom takes a similar timepeice from under his tunic and studies 
its intricate interior. 

BROWN TOM: Best to allow another couple dozen 
butterfly breaths in case we get 
thirs....er, get lost.... 

GUMP: No grog shops down here, Brown Tom. 

JACK: Let's hurry! 

Jack and Gump run off along the corridor, followed by Luna's glowing 
LIGHT. Screwball watches without moving. 

SCREWBALL: Know what I want to know? 

BROWN TOM: What? 

SCREWBALL: Why me? 

Brown Tom gives Screwball a swift kick in his rear. 

BROWN TOM: Why not? 

The two little elves scamaper off together. 

SCREWBALL: I hate it....I hate it.... 
I hate it.... 

72 INTERIOR DUNGEON DAY 

The iron-studded dungeon days swing magically open as Lili watches, 
her eyes aglow with animal fire. She crouches beside the unicorn, 
resting on her haunches in an easy feline fashion. 

Lili rises like a sleepwalker, unable to resist the compulsion 
luring her toward the open doorway. 

The chained unicorn WHINNIES pitifully. Princess Lili looks back 
without expression as she leaves. 

73 DELETED 

74 DELETED 

75 INTERIOR ANOTHER CORRIDOR DAY 
Luna's bobbing LIGHT leads the way as Jack and Gump hurry along the 
rubble-choked corridor. Alerted by the SOUND of something, they dart 
into the shadows. 

GUMP: Quick, Jack! 

Jack and Gump watch in horror as a cracked EGG the size of a 
watermelon runs down the corridor on armor-scaled chicken legs, led 
on either side by a Demon holding a chain leash. 

Jack draws his sword. The Demons stop and the Egg begins to crack. 

JACK: I'll scramble that one! 

Gump restrains him. The Egg cracks apart. 

GUMP: Don't trust your eyes! All is 
enchanted here. 

The Egg breaks into pieces and a dripping winged monster emerges; a 
diabolic cross between a bat and a pterodactyl. It emits a fearsome 
SHRIEK and flies off down the corridor followed by the twin 
attendant Demons. 

Jack and Gump hurry on in the opposite direction. 

75A INTERIOR DUNGEON CORRIDOR DAY 

Screwball and Brown Tom creep timorously forward. They are alerted 
by the SOUNDS of something approaching. A hideously deformed shadow 
fall across the opposite wall. 

The two faeries clutch each other in terror and duck into the 
shadows. 

It is Princess Lili! She passes the evles' hiding place as if in a 
trance. 

76 INTERIOR VIADUCT DAY 

Jack and Gump emerge on a narrow span arching across the vast 
central of the undreground castle. Similiar viaducts, above and 
below, bridge the awesome chasm. 

The Green Man and the faerie gawk at the sheer magnitude of it all. 

JACK: Not even kings live like this.... 

On a high span above, Jack sees Princess Lili drifting by like a 
somnabulist. 

JACK (cont): My God! Gump, look! It's Lili! 

GUMP: Don't believe it, Jack. 

JACK (yelling): Lili ! 

The SOUND ECHOES through the vast space. 

77 INTERIOR LILI'S VIADUCT DAY 

The Princess pauses. A section of parapet has broken off and she 
wanders to the edge, staring down into the void. For a precarious 
moment, she teeters on the brink, seemingly about to fall. 

JACK (os) (calling): Li-li ! 
The Princess does not respond, wobbling like a dreamer on the narrow 
edge of disaster. She leans against the ruined parapet and a bug 
chunk of masonry breaks away, tumbling and bouncing into the abyss. 

JACK (cont) (os) (calling): It's Ja-ack ! 

Lili's face is blank. She turns and continues blindly on her way. 

78 INTERIOR VIADUCT DAY 

Jack stares up at Lili's retreating form. 

JACK: It's her. I know it. 

GUMP: Don't be so hasty! Remember who we're dealing with. 

JACK: I've got to reach her! 

Jack races off. Gump runs along behind. 

78A INTERIOR GREAT HALL DAY 

The shadowy figure of Darkness looms over a band of deformed PYGMIES 
with needle-sharp teeth and wickedly curved talons long as pitchfork 
tines. 

DARKNESS: My enemies approach.... destory them! 
Darkness points an evil finger and the Pygmies scurry CACKLING off. 

79 DELETED 

80 INTERIOR LILI'S VIADUCT DAY 

Jack and Gump hurry out onto the arching span. The Princess is 
nowhere in sight. 

GUMP (running after): Slow down....! 
Use some caution! 

JACK: This way! 

Jack runs on into the corridor in the direction taken by Lili. Gump 
follows after. 

81 INTERIOR RAIN CORRIDOR DAY 

Lili wanders down a long colonnade with dangling vine-like roots. A 
glistening magic rain falls from the granite ceiling. Her blank eyes 
stare straight ahead. 

Jack and Gump appear at the opposite end of the passage in time to 
see the Princess drift out of sight. 

JACK: There she is....! Lili....! 

Jack and Gump run to catch up, pushing through root tendrils agleam 
with rain. Suddenly, they are attacked by SCREAMING Pygmies. 

GUMP: Jack! 

JACK (drawing his sword): Demons! 

The nimble Pygmies leap about them, lethal talons slashing through 
the drizzle. 

Jack and Gump retreat, backing between clingling rootlets. 

GUMP: Quick! In here! 

Gump yanks open a heavy oaken door in the side wall and they duck 
inside, slamming it shut in the teeth of the attacking Pygmies. 

81A INTERIOR SEALED CORRIDOR DAY 

Jack strains against the door handle, struggling to keep the portal 
shut tight. There is less space than in a closet. The corridor 
behind them is completely bricked over. 

GUMP: Trapped....! 

CLOSE ON DOOR: With great force, the Pygmies' claws stab through the 
thick wood like stiletties. Their needle tips are mere inches from 
Jack and Gump. 

The door's inner surface is studded with talons. Jack suddenly SLAMS 
the door open with such force it swings into the side wall with a 
loud CRASH. 

The Pygmies' frenzied SCREAMING ends in abrupt SILENCE. 

Jack and Gump peer cautiously out. 

81B INTERIOR RAIN CORRIDOR DAY 

The Pymies hang unconscious on the other side of the door, dangling 
from their imbedded talons. 

JACK: Come on! 

Jack and Gump run into the rain. 

82 INTERIOR CORRIDOR OUTSIDE GREAT HALL DAY 

Jack and Gump hurry around the corner just as Lili heads towards a 
pair of massive doors swinging slowly open at her approach. 

JACK (calling): Lili! Wait! 

Gump grabs Jack's arm and yanks him to a stop. 

GUMP: Don't be daft! She's under a spell! 

Lili enters and the doors swing closed behind her. 

83 INTERIOR GREAT HALL DAY 

An enormous chamber draped with black cloth surrounded by tall 
Baroque columns. Winged demons writhe in the shadows above. A long 
black table reaches down the centre of the room. All is lit by 
firelight. The gaping hearth, with its entablature of monumental 
sculpture, is flanked by a pair of massive ebony thrones, carved in 
a hideous, twisting mass of tendons, sinews and museles. 

When the imposing doors swing closed, Lili's spell is broken. She 
stares in terror at her news surroundings. 

Something weird and mysterious approaches from out of the draped 
shadows. It is a magnificent high-collared black gown, waltzing like 
a ghost across the black marble floor. There is no one wearing the 
garment! 

Fascinated, Lili watches the dress circle towards her. She finds it 
irresistable. Taking hold of the gown's empty sleeves she begins to 
dance, spinning round and round to the impulsive music. 

84 INTERIOR CORRIDOR OUTSIDE GREAT HALL DAY 

Jack paces back and forth in front of the sealed doors. 

JACK: Why did you stop me? 

GUMP: We best reconnoitre. What if it's 
a trap? 

Gump and Jack strain to see through the crack between the doors. 

85 INTERIOR GREAT HALL DAY 

Lili dances by herself, turning slow dreamy circles before the 
blazing fire. She is now WEARING the splendid black gown! 

Reflected firelight GLITTERS in the shadows. An open jewel box 
spills its sparkling treasure onto an ornate table. Lili is lure 
like a moth to the flame. 

She steps up onto an oversized footstool by the table. The ebony 
casket brims with gemstones. Lili's eyes dazzle. A carved ebony 
figure of a skeleton turns slowly out of the centre, holding in its 
up lifted arms the most exquisite black diamond necklace the mind 
can imagine. 

The Princess sucks in her breath. The temptation is too great. She 
impulsively takes the necklace and hops down from the stool. 

The high collar of her gown makes fastening the clasp difficult and 
without thinking, she backs towards the wall, fumbling behind her 
neck. 

She leans against a sculpted marble frieze of souls in torment, 
concentrating on the tricky clasp. All at once, a piece of sculpture 
becomes ANIMATE. Powerful arms reach out to fasten the necklace. For 
a moment Lili doesn't notice, grateful for the help. Then, she 
realises what is happening and SCREAMS. 

The musular black arms reach for her as she pulls away in terror. 
Lili turns to run, but is stopped short by her reflection in a tall 
cheval glass mirror. She looks furtively about, making certain she 
is unobserved. Alone, she admires her perfect image. 

CLOSE ON MIRROR: Beneath Lili's pleased expression we see the evil 
face of Darkness APPEAR like a man emerging from under water. 

Darkness penetrates the surface of the mirror. 

Lili backs away, GASPING soundlessly with terror. 

Darkness steps forth through the glass into the room, clad in black 
finery. 

Lili staggers. Darkness reaches to embrace her and the Princess 
SHRIEKS at the top of her lungs. The moment he touches her shoulder, 
she slumps tothe floor, unconscious. 

Darkness stands over the fallen girl, his heartbeat pulsing like 
muffled thunder. Something almost like a smile creases his hideous 
features as he rolls a lock of Lili's hair between his clawed 
fingers. 

The Princess blinks and opens her eyes. She is horrified to find 
Darkness kneeling over her and frantically tries to get away. 

DARKNESS: Do not be afraid, lady.... 

Lili GASPS like a stranded fish. She is catatonic with fear. 

DARKNESS (cont): I mean you no harm. 

Darkness offers the Princess his hand. 

DARKNESS (cont): How like you my gifts...? Does 
the gown not please you? Come.... 
tell me.... 

Lili's terror renders her speechless. 

DARKNESS (cont): The colour is most suitable... We 
sanctify the death of the old world 
and the birth of a new order.... 
You are the guest of honour. 

Lili WEEPS and tugs at the black dress. 

LILI: ....of dishonour...! Take this 
away.... Please! I beg you! 

Darkness advances on Lili. The slow kettldrum THROB of his heart 
underscores his words. 

DARKNESS: Your soul in like some dark nectar.... 
I cannot rest unril I taste its 
sweetness. 

LILI (frantic): Never! I hate you! I hate this 
dress! 

DARKNESS: Can you speak so of your bridal 
gown....? 

LILI (screaming): Nooooooooo! 

86 INTERIOR CORRIDOR OUTSIDE GREAT HALL DAY 

Jack and Gump listen by the closed doors to Lili's peircing scream 
(OS). Jack is desparate and half-draws his sword from the scabbard. 

JACK: What has he done to her?

Gump restrains the boy.

GUMP: You have no power to stop it....
Be thankful she lives.

Jack shoves his sword back in disgust.

JACK (bitterly): Some champion....
What good is this fancy sword?

GUMP: It's not the sword that counts, but
the man who swings it....

87 INTERIOR GREAT HALL DAY 

Lili slumps to the cold stone floor, WEEPING. Darkness bends 
solicitously over her.

DARKNESS: Why the tears?

LILI (sobbing): ....everything is lost....
poor Jack....

DARKNESS: Why weep for him? He left you
alone to die!

LILI: No! He'd never do that! He was
killed....like everything else....

DARKNESS (glancing over his shoulder): Yes.... But
why mourn? You have a new and grander destiny!

LILI: Consort of some cowardly vile toad
who slinks through the night!

DARKNESS: Not so! I requite to shadow's
solace and dark of the night.... Sunshine is my
destroyer!

LILI (scornful): You think you're so powerful....
and hide in the ground like a mole!

DARKNESS (smiling): This too will change. 
The last unicorn dies tonight....!
As her blood ebbs, the sun sets forever. 
There shall never be another dawn!

LILI (horrified): No....! You can't....
You mustn't....

Darkness throws back his evil head and LAUGHS.

88 INTERIOR CORRIDOR OUTSIDE GREAT HALL DAY 
The demonic LAUGHTER of Darkness carries through the massive doors.

JACK: He means to kill the mare, Gump!

GUMP: Don't mourn the corpse
'til the coffin's in the ground.

DARKNESS (OS): My dominion shall encompass
the enternal night!

GUMP: As long as the sun still shines, 
so does hope!

JACK (bitterly: Sun doesn't shine down here.

Jack fingers Lili's silver medallion hanging around his neck
and from out of the blue, inspiration strikes.

JACK (cont) (grinning): Wait a minute....! I 
think I know a way.

89 INTERIOR GREAT HALL DAY

Lili stares at Darkness with terror and loathing.

DARKNESS: The world shall be at last as 
nature intended....a place of chaos and
anarchy!

LILI: You're mad!

DARKNESS: Aye, Lady, and proud to be so! 
For in madness lies the soul of all 
that's noble.... Can you fathom the loneliness
of untold eons lived in darkness? My spirit
was forged in that black fire....

LILI: You live alone because you are
loathsome! The contagion of your wicked heart demands
isolation.

DARKNESS: Nay, mistress. I've found
my mate and you know it. We're just 
alike, you and I. Beneath the skin
we are already one.

LILI: Never!

DARKNESS: 'Twas your sin trapped the unicorn.
Even now, the evil seed of what you've 
done blooms within you!

LILI (shrieking): You lie! You're
repulsive!

DARKNESS (stung by her words): No more so than you!
Can't you sense it? That is why I desire you. 
I need someone to share the dark secrets of my 
soul.

LILI: You....? You disgust me! You're
nothing but a beast!

DARKNESS: Everyone is a beast....only most are
afraid to see it!

Darkness compels Lili over to the mirror with the force of his will.

90 LILI'S POV : MIRROR 

Lili sees her reflection in the glass. The lovely feminine
features ALTER into those of a cat-like beast.

DARKNESS (os): This mirror shows how we really are....
Behold your true reflection.

91 INTERIOR GREAT HALL DAY 

Lili pulls free from his graps and turns from the glass. Her
face remains lovely and unchanged.

LILI (frantic): No! You're working magic on me!
I won't believe it!

DARKNESS: My Lady misjudges me... I am no
common trickster.... look at
you hands!

Lili's fingers transform before her eyes: hooked claws spring from 
their tips, coarse black hair pushes the skin.

DARKNESS (cont) (Laughing): My mirror
never lies.

Lili's lovely face undergoes the same tranmutation she
witnessed in the mirror. She feels fur-covered sheeks and
pointed ears. This time, her SCREAM is hysterical.

Darkness places a protective arm around Lili.

DARKNESS (cont): Glory in your animal nature.
It is your triumph!

LILI: I'm hideous!

DARKNESS: No! The puling, pallid creature you
were was truly something disgusting.
Now you are magificent.... a fierce goddess!

Lili jerks away, HISSING and showing her claws.

LILI: Damn you!

DARKNESS: We are both of us damned, my Queen.

Darkness bows with mock formality, ALTERING into his own shadows, 
which slides through a crack in the paving stones.

Lili cannot resist her reflection. Horrified anew. she falls to the 
floor, WEEPING.

91A EXTERIOR SKY DAY 

Round and red, the great disc of the setting sun slides towards the 
distant horizon.

92 INTERIOR CORRIDOR OUTSIDE GREAT HALL DAY 

Crazed by anxiety, Jack finds the keyhole and cups his hands around 
it.

JACK (calling out): Lili....? Can you
hear me....?

93 INTERIOR GREAT HALL DAY 

Lili huddles WEEPING on the cold stones.

JACK (os): ....Lili....?

At the sound of Jack's voice, the Princess looks up with a start.

LILI: ....Jack?

JACK (os): Over here....
By the door....

Lili turns eagerly turns to the door.

LILI: Oh, Jack....dear Jack! Can it
really be you? I was afraid you 
were dead.

93A INTERIOR CORRIDOR OUTSIDE GREAT HALL DAY 

JACK: Thank God you're all right! I didn't
know what to do.... I never want to
lose you again....

93B INTERIOR GREAT HALL DAY 

Lili pauses before the keyhole, out of Jack's line of sight.

LILI: Jack, my love....my precious
love! I pray it's you and not more
wicked magic.

93C CORRIDOR OUTSIDE GREAT HALL DAY 

JACK: It's me, you can be sure of that....
and there's magic on our side, too.

93D INTERIOR GREAT HALL DAY 

LILI: It's all my fault....the unicorn....
everything....

JACK (os): My fault as much as yours....
Don't worry. We're here to save you.

LILI (sadly): I'm far past saving,
sweet Jack....

A huge tears wells in Lili's eye and flies out toward the keyhole, 
defying gravity.

94 INTERIOR CORRIDOR OUTSIDE GREAT HALL DAY

Lili's tear flies through the keyhole and strikes Jack's face like a 
horizontal raindrop. He touches the spot curiously.

GUMP (amazed): How did you do that?

JACK (to Gump): I didn't do anything....
(into keyhole) let me see your face. 
It will give me hope....

Jack strains to see through the keyhole.


95 INTERIOR GREAT HALL DAY 

Lili stares at the keyhole in horror.

JACK (os): ....just to glimpse your smile....

LILI (grief-stricken): No.... I can't....
forget me, Jack....

The Princess reaches out her animal's paw and covers the keyhole.

96 INTERIOR CORRIDOR OUTSIDE GREAT HALL DAY 

As the LIGHT in the opening grows DARK, Jack tenderly places his 
hand next to Lili's.

JACK: Lili....? I love you....

Gump pulls frantically on Jack's arm.

GUMP: Come, Jack. We've no time 
to spare.... Remember your plan?

Sadly, Jack takes his hand from the keyhole and follows Gump back 
along the corridor.


97 INTERIOR GREAT HALL DAY 

Princess Lili lies SOBBING. High above, the winged figures watch 
her. The music THROBS, underscoring a low, rhythmic CHANTING. Like 
some ghastly chorus fro, Hell, the living statuary sings in unison 
to Lili:

STATUARY (singing): Bride of Night.... Bride of Night....
Darkness is your heart's delight!
Hail to Darkness! Hail the Night!
His the Power and the Might!
Master of Chaos, Lord of Doom,
Sing his praises from the tomb!

Lili lifts her head, listening to the sepulchral SINGING. Her eyes 
burn like a tiger's. She bares her fangs, and from her throat issues 
a bone-chilling HOWL.

98 INTERIOR DUNGEON CORRIDOR DAY 

Screwball and Brown Tom stop short in their tracks when they hear 
the SOUND of a distant HOWL echoes in the shadows. 

SCREWBALL (trembling): I vote we run like hell! 

The two faeries scamper off into darkness. 
99 INTERIOR DUNGEON CORRIDOR DAY 

Gump, Jack and a woman-sized Luna wait outside the kitchen door as 
Brown Tom and Screwball come running up. Gump studies his ornate 
timepiece.

GUMP: Where were you? In another three flicks 
of a badger's tail it'll be half-past.

SCREWBALL: Sorry....time slips away
when you're having so much fun.

BROWN TOM (out of breath): We....found the mare
....chained....in the dungeon below.

Gump shoves his timepiece back in his belt.

GUMP: Excellant.... Who has a bit of
parchment?

The two faeries search in their clothing. Screwball produces a 
plethora of trash: marbles, string, old doll's eyes, coloured bird's 
eggs, ancient coins, etc. At last he finds a crumbled peice of 
sheepskin.

SCREWBALL: Here.... I was saving it
to write me will on.

BROWN TOM: Where there's a will there's
a....

GUMP: Shush, both of you....! Jack has a 
plan....a good one....

Gump squats on the floor, and, using a triangle and some charcoal, 
divides the parchment into mysterious lines and angles.

GUMP (mumbling): ....angle of refraction equals....
angle of incidence....multiplied by a 
factor of fourty.....divided by the
square root of a google-plex....

Gump SNAPS his fingers triumphantly.

GUMP (cont): Perfect! It will work like a charm, Jack!

JACK: Let's get started! What we need to 
do is sneak back into the kitchen and 
gather all the plates and 
platters....

SCREWBALL: Oh no! Not me! Seen enough
of that kitchen, I have!

BROWN TOM: Don't be so pig-headed! 
You can trust Gump.

SCREWBALL: I'd sooner trust a rat 
in the ghetto!

BROWN TOM: Well.... trust Jack then.

Jack eases open the kitchen door.

JACK: Remember....just the shiny ones....

Jack leads the way back into the kitcheb. Gump urges the other two 
to follow.

GUMP: ....and be quiet! Soft as
thistledown, that's the faerie way.

100 INTERIOR KITCHEN DAY 

Jack and the faeries tiptoe cautiosuly into the kitchen.

Both Demon Cooks are asleep, the encountered first is stretched out 
across his chopping block, SNORING like a dragon with indisgestion.

The unfortunate Blunder turns slowly over the coals, hog-tied to a 
spit. A bright red apple is stuffed in his mouth. Jack and Gump rush 
to his side.

Gump pulls the apple from Blunder's mouth.

BLUNDER (frantic): Get me outta here! Please!
While I'm still medium rare!

GUMP: Quiet....! You're a free imp
on one condition....

BLUNDER(very loud): Condition....! What condition?
Loose me or I'll make such....

Gump shoves the apple back into Blunder's mouth, stoppering his loud 
complaint.

GUMP: Any more noise and you're
shish-ka-bob....

Blunder nods eagerly.

GUMP (cont): You do what we tell you....
understand?

More eager nodding from Blunder.

GUMP (cont): Swear it!

Gump pulls the apple out of Blunder's mouth.

BLUNDER: I swear! On the festering
forelock of Nicodemus!

Jack cuts Blunder's bonds and the little imp hops nibmly out of the 
fireplace.

BLUNDER: A thousand thanks....

Jack boosts Gump and Screwball up onto the mantle where the polished 
plates are stacked.

JACK: Up we go!

Luna TRANSFORMS into a dot of LIGHT and flies up to the cimnet 
pieces, REMATERIALISING there in her full size.

JACK (cont): Your turn, Blunder.

Jack lifts Blunder onto his shoulds so he can climb to the first 
level of the three-tiered mantle. Blunder joins Screwball, Gump and 
Luna as they rush about the mantlepiece, frantically gathering 
shield-sized plates.

One by one, the faeries toss the plates down to Jack, who stacks 
them in Brown Tom's arms.

Brown Tom staggers through the kitchen carrying a teetering tower of 
plates. He can't see where he is going and trips over the nozzle of 
the giant bellows.

The plates fall with a deafening CRASH!

Both ferocious blind Cooks are awakened by the NOISE.

SECOND COOK: Huh....! Wuzzat?

Jack and the faeries freeze in place as the Cook rises and pulls his 
huge cleaver from the chopping block.

COOK (sniffing the air): Meat....! Me
smells fresh meat!

Jack draws his sword and steps between the awesome Cook and Brown 
Tom, sprawled helplessly on the floor.

SECOND COOK: Find meat!

JACK: Over here!

The blind cook lunges for Jack. He wields his deadly cleaver with 
amazing accuracy for one without sight.

COOK: Chop it up!

Jack ducks past the Cook, smacking him on the leg with the flat of 
his blade. The huge demon YELPS in pain.

The Second Cook picks up a skillet, wielding it like a club.

SECOND COOK: Smash....! Me smash!

Jack is caught between the two demon Cooks. He cannot face one 
without turning his back on the other.

Gump sees Jack's predicament and leaps from the mantle onto the 
Second Cook's head with a wild CRY:

GUMP: Schweinhundt!

Gump clings to the Second Cook like a terrier, confusing him and 
giving Jack time to dart acrobatically out of the way.

JACK (jabbing the Cook): Gotcha!

COOK: Cut you in half!

A mighty swing from the Cook misses Jack, who executes a nimble 
back-flip. The Cook cleaves through a hanging side of meat by 
mistake.

The Second Cook grabs hold of Gump and shakes him.

SECOND COOK: Sweet, sweet blood....

Up on the mantle, Screwball and Blunder exchange a helpless look. 
Gump is a goner unless they do something. They a simultaneous 
unspoken conclusion, and leap onto the Second Cook's back.

SCREWBALL (calling out): Rooster toes....!

BLUNDER (calling out): ....pig whiskers!

Faced with this new twin threat, the Second Cook drops GUmp, who 
immediately bities him on the leg.

SECOND COOK: Whut.....! Who now? Ouch!

Jack fights a rearguard action, stabbing at the savage Cook as he 
retreats.

JACK: Best you can do?

COOK: You gonna be mince-meat!

Jack back onto a steep stone ramp against the far wall.

JACK: Got to catch me first!

The Cook's cleaver CLANGS against the ramp, missing Jack by inches.

The Second Cook has his hands full. Brown Tom has joined the fray 
and clings to his other leg while Blunder and Screwball claw and 
punch at his head.

SCREWBALL & BLUNDER: Hit him....!
Sock him....!

Staggering under the full weight of the faerie onslaught, the Second 
Cook lurches in circles.

SECOND COOK: Kill....! Smash....!

Furious, the Second Cook swings his heavy skillet at Screwball and 
Blunder. He misses them completely, hitting himself square on the 
head and knocking himself out.

The faeries leap off as the demon toppes backwards into the 
fireplace.

GUMP: We must help Jack!

The faeries race to the foot of the ramp. Jack parries the Cook's 
fearsome swing. The Cook presses him relentlessly. The CLASH of 
steel rings through the cavernous kitchen.

The faeries start up the ramp like a tiny cheering section.

BLUNDER: Stick him a good one!

SCREWBALL: Cut him down to size, Jack!

Giant wine barrels are stacked at tge top of the ramp. The Cook back 
Jack against them. There is no further room for retreat.

COOK: Gonna spill your guts, boy.

The Cook swings his cleaver from the hip. Jack nimbly springs out of 
harm's way. The cleaver drives full force into one of the chocks 
supporting the pyramid of wine barrels.

GRUMBLING, the Cook yanks his cleaver free. This pulls the chock 
loose from under the bottom barrel.

COOK (cont) (Listening): Wuzzat....?

The entire stack of barrels shifts, rolling towards the Cook.

COOK (cont): Bad news!

The Cook runs for his life. The huge hogshead RUMBLE forward in a 
wooden avalanche.

Jack crouches at the top of the ramp. As the Cook runs past he 
sticks the sword-blade between his legs and trips him up.

The Cook tumbles, head over heels, down the ramp.

Half-way up, the faerie band sees the giant barrels ROLLING towards 
them.

SCREWBALL (horrified): Sodom and Glockamora!

The faeries turn and run.

The barrels CRASH on top of the fallen Cook, knocking him senseless 
as they CONTINUE rolling.

The faeries dive for cover in the arched opening of the kitchen 
doorway at the bottom of the ramp.

The barrels CRUNCH into the kitchen wall. Because they are larger 
than the doorway, the faeries crouching inside are spared.

Oceans of wine flood out in a dark tidal wave, forcing the door and 
washing the little people into the corridor beyond.

101 INTERIOR KITCHEB CORRIDOR DAY 

Brown Tom is beside himself with delight. He scoops up wine with 
Screwball's helmet and pours it on top of his head..

BROWN TOM: Whoopeeeeeee!

Jack appears in the shattered doorway, sword in hand.

JACK: Hate to break up the
party, but there's work to be
done!

Gump jumps to his feet.

GUMP: Hurry! Get those plates~

Jack sheathes his sword and rushes into the kitchen.

Screwball and Blunder follow, but Brown Tom lingers behind, scooping 
the helmet full of wine.

BROWN TOM: Just a wee taste....

Gump kicks Brown Tom smartly in the pants.

GUMP: Move! Or I make your head ring
worse than any hangover!

Gump chases Brown Tom back into the kitchen.

101A INTERIOR KITCHEN DAY 

The faeries gather up the fallen plates. Jack stares thoughtfully at 
the fireplace, where the body of the Second Cook has snuffed out the 
flames.

GUMP: What's on your mind, Jack?

JACK: Smoke rising.... That chimney
must go clear to the top.

Gump peers into the hearth.

GUMP: Not much to hold onto. Take a 
peapod pixie to make the climb.

Screwball steps proudly forward.

SCREWBALL: I'll do it!

The faeries are astonished. Screwball never volunteers.

GUMP: What? Can I believe my ears?

SCREWBALL: Don't see why not. Ain't 
I small enough for the job?

BLUNDER (proudly): No job's too
small for the Buttercup brothers....

SCREWBALL (on his knees: Please, Gump.... let me try.
I know I'm always trouble, but I want
to make it up to you....
Prove that I won't let you down.

BROWN TOM: Be sure ya don't fall down!

GUMP: All right! Do it! But be swift.

SCREWBALL: Thank you....thank you....
You'll never regret it....

Jack boosts Screwball up into the chimney.

JACK: I'm proud of you, Screwball.
(handing him a plate)
Don't drop it....

GUMP (calling up): We'll send Luna with 
a signal when all is ready.

101B INTERIOR CHIMNEY DAY 

Screwball clings to the smoke-blackened bricks, staring up the 
nearly endless shaft at a small circle of light far above.

BROWN TOM (os) (calling from below): Always
knew you'd be going places, Screwball....
Good luck....!

SCREWBALL (to himself): I'm goin' places,
all right.... straight to the top and on
outta this hell-hole.... No more
kitchen....no more demons.... Just the 
easy life for Screwball Buttercup....

101C INTERIOR KITCHEN DAY 
A shining gold plate is propper on the Secnd Cook smouldering in the 
fireplace.

Luna positions another plate against the bellows, taking care to get 
the angle right.

Gump stands between the bellows and the shattered kitchen door, 
measuring the nagle with a curious hand-held instrument.

GUMP: Little more to the left, Luna....
that's better..just a touch more....
perfect.

101D INTERIOR KITCHEN CORRIDOR DAY 

Blunder and Brown Tom run off carrying armloads of plates.

Jack leans a platter against the corridor wall, adjsuting it 
precisely.

JACK (calling): How's that, Gump?

GUMP (os): Dead centre....!

102 INTERIOR GREAT HALL DAY 

Lili's tears have dried. She prowls the majestic hall with regal 
dignity. Something magic occurs at the baquet table: each crystal 
goblet fills mysteriously with black wine as she passes; every empty 
bowl and platter suddenly is heaped with an incredible things to 
eat-all of it black!

The food is beautiful in spite on its colour. Lili stares a it with 
undisguised hunger. Some animal instinct warns her not to trust this 
gleaming ebony feast, but she's famished and snatches up an apple 
bright as ploish anthracite.

DARKNESS (os): Good....eat....

Lili GASPS, dropping the apple. Darkness sits in one of the twin 
grostesque thrones flanking the hearth.

DARKNESS (cont): The food is for your enjoyment.

LILI: I don't want it! I'm
not hungry!

DARKNESS: Do you lie just to please me?

LILI: I do nothing for your pleasure!

Darkness gestures to the opposing throne.

DARKNESS: You are so like a child, milady.
Sit, and we'll talk.

Lili makes no move towards the chair. 

DARKNESS (CONT) (gently): Like a 
child, you expect anger and
defiance will upset me.... These
are the qualities I admire most....

Lili snarls, fangs gleaming in the firelight.

LILI: So.... I'd love to rip out your
throat, yet it would pain you more
if I licked your hand....

DARKNESS: All I desire is that you
sit in that chair and talk with me.

Lili approaches the grotesque throne. Like some impossible organism, 
it pulses in anticipation.

LILI: Sit....? Here....?

DARKNESS: Yes. Please....

LILI: I prefer to stand.

For a moment, Darkness nearly sucumbs to anger. The viens in his 
forehead throb. His talons grip his throne in a spam of fury.

DARKNESS (snarling): Sit....!

Darkness shrewdly realises rage won't work and he relaxes with a 
twisted smile.

DARKNESS: (cont): .....or stand. As 
you wish.... It's enough that we're
alone together.... just the two of
us....

102A CLOSE: MATCHING FIREPLACE OPPOSITE 

Across the Great Hall from the blazing hearth is an identical 
fireplace. This one is cold, but not empty. Covered with soot and as 
black as a Moor, Screwball climbs into VIEW between the massive 
andirons.

DARKNESS (cont) (os): All of time
awaits us....why not make a start.

Screwball puts down his plate and tiptoes into the Great Hall 
towards the banqueting table.

LILI (os): A start at what....?

102B INTERIOR GREAT HALL DAY

Darkness leans forward in his throne, smiling at Lili.

DARKNESS: Simple conversation....

LILI: What do we possibly have to
talk about?

DARKNESS: Thoughts....dreams....
ambitions....

LILI: I have no interest in your
foul ambition.

DARKNESS: Desire then....surely we 
beasts all have desire.

102C INTERIOR GREAT HALL (MATCHING FIREPLACE OPPOSITE) DAY

Unseen, Screwball climbs up onto the banquet table. He can't believe 
his good fortune. A bounteous feast surrounds him.

LILI (os): You'd never dream what 
I desire....

DARKNESS (os): Don't be so sure....
Dreams are my speciality

Screwballs stuffs his tunic with black fruit. He rushes about, 
treading on the feast in his crazed delirium at beung surrounded by 
such plenty.

DARKNESS (cont) (os): It is through
dreams I influence mankind. I have 
dreams of my own.... dreams of enternity
with you....no more silence....no
more loneliness....

102D INTERIOR GREAT HALL DAY 

Lili LAUGHS in the face of Darkness.

LILI (scornfully): Such drivel! You
sound like some simpering schoolboy!

DARKNESS: I'll wager there was a 
time when the attention of a 
devoted schoolbvoy were entirely to
your liking.

Lili regards her claws with a savage sneer.

LILI (snarling): I know what I'd do
with such meat now!

DARKNESS: ....all things change, lady.
The pleasures of youth become the
regrets of maturity....

A loud CRASH on the banquet table causes Darkness to look around. He 
SEES Screwball standing by the centrepiece, about to shove a whole 
chicken in his mouth.

DARKNESS (cont) (angry): What're
you doing here?

Blackened with soot, Screwball easily passes for a goblin.

SCREWBALL (all innocence): .....am
I early....?

DARKNESS: You impudent imp!

SCREWBALL: I thought the invitation
said half-past....

DARKNESS (roaring): GET OUT!

Screwball gets the message. He drops the chicken and hops down off 
the banquet table, running to the opposite fireplace for all he's 
worth.

DARKNESS (cont) (gently to Lili): Sit....
I value your thoughts. Why not share them
with me?

Lili looks at the grotesque throne.

LILI: No more than that....just sit?

DARKNESS (nodding): Sit....

Lili steps up onto the oversized footstool. Inches behind her, the 
monstrous throne swells and throbs like an organic creature, the 
powerful sinews rippling with desire.

LILI (a feline smile): Doesn't
seem such an outrageous request....

The Princess prepares to sit, her luscious, silk-swathed bottom only 
inches from the lavcivious surface of the squirming throne.

DARKNESS: You'll never regret granting
me this favour....

Lili's eyes glitter as she teases him.

LILI: What shall we talk about?

DARKNESS (impatient): Just sit!

The febric of Lili's gown brushes the writihing throne. In another 
second she will be sitting. Unexpectedly, she stands up tall on the 
footstool.

LILI: Such a disagreeable chair....must
be terribly uncomfortable. I think 
I'll stand if you don't mind.

Darkness barely controls his raging anger.

DARKNESS: I prefer you to sit!

LILI: I'd rather stand, thank you.

Darkness's forehead swells with fury.

DARKNESS: Sit!

LILI: No.... Not now....

Darkness puffs like an adder in his frenzy, rising up to tower over 
Lili.

DARKNESS (roaring): I command you to sit!

Lili is utterly unafraid. She LAUGHS at the swollen image of 
Darkness.

LILI: Don't be silly.

Lili hops down from the footstool.

DARKNESS (screaming with rage): SIT, DAMN YOU!

Lili sashays past him, twitching her gown in an unashamedly wanton 
fashion. Her hearty LAUGH is as loud as the outraged ROARS of 
Darkness.

LILI (laughing): Never.... never....

110A INTERIOR DUNGEON CHASM DAY 
Jack scales a plate like a golden discus across the chasm to Brown 
Tom waiting on the viaduct above.

Jack hurls another plate.

Suddenly, the Winged Monster, hatched from the walking Egg, glides 
SHRIEKING from the shadows. It catches the plate in its saw-toothed 
beak and dives at Jack. Gump sees it first.

GUMP: Jack....!

Dropping the plate, the Winged Monster rips at Jack. The Green Man 
draws his sword and defends himself. The fight is savage and brief. 
Jack hacks the Monster out of the air. It lies, flapping and broken 
at his feet. Gump touches him sympathetically on the arm.

JACK: ....I'm all right....Let's
get on....to the dungeon....

GUMP (pensive): You have power 
within I never imagined. 

111 INTERIOR GREAT HALL DAY 

Darkness stares at the Princess in a towering rage. She 
flirtatiously pretends to be interested in a bit of fruit before 
rejecting it in favour of another, which also proves not to her 
liking.

DARKNESS: I'm not above my own little
pranks, milady.... Should you have
a taste for them.

LILI: No doubt they're as foul as
the stuff you set on your table....

Darkness relaxes, taking his cue from Lili's mocking tone.

DARKNESS: Foul....or fair, such distinctions
are entirely arbitrary, my dear.... Does
not the lowly toad think his mate fair, 
warts and all....?

LILI: Do you suggest I will think 
you fair some day?

DARKNESS: In time....and time we surely
have... stretching before us....
infinity....like a merciful curtain closing
off the past....

Darkness moves gracefully to Lili's side and kneels before her.

DARKNESS (cont): I beseech you...do not reject
my foods as you do my food.... Never have I
abased myself so before another....It is not
humility that brings me low, mistress.... but
love....

LILI: Love?

DARKNESS: Aye, love.... You think my
heart a barren desert where only
hate can flower....A much finer blossom
show its petals now....nourished by
sorrow....watered with your tears...
(baring his breast)
I offer you this rose, Princess!
....my heart....my soul....

Lili is astonished. She walks away to consider what Darkness
has said.

Darkness watches her slyly. His expression reveals his words
to have been a ruse. He gloats in anticipation.

Lili turns back to face him. Darkness immediately resumes his look 
of adoration.

LILI: You dizzy me, lord.... I never
thought to hear the word 'love' 
spoken again....

DARKNESS: You'll hear it forever.
(shouting)
I love you!

LILI: If such is true....hope 
is yet alive...
(regarding her claws)
These talons can caress as well as kill....

They are interrupted by the SOUND of a CHIME. An unseen clocks tolls 
the hour.

Darkness stares up into the shadows.

DARKNESS: It grows late....

111A EXTERIOR SKY DAY 

The setting sun blazes through distant drifting clouds, tinting the 
sky in a riot of colours. Another CHIME is heard.

111B INTERIOR GREAT HALL DAY 

The SOUND of the unicorn's frightened whinny carries up from the 
dungeons below.

DARKNESS (laughing): Our wedding
feast is in good voice....Think
you not?

Lili cunningly disguises her alarm.

LILI: I admire your thrift, my lord,
both the meal and entertainment
in a single dish.

Darkness appreciates this joke.

DARKNESS: Are you anxious to see blood flow?

LILI: As you are to drink it!
(smiling slyly)
Will the groom grant his bride her wish
on this night?

DARKNESS (beaming with pleasure): 
You have but to ask my savage beauty.

Lili leers, baring her feline teeth.

LILI: I want to kill the unicorn!

Darkness claps his hands with joy.

DARKNESS: Lady, you make me proud....

111C INTERIOR CHIMNEY DAY 

Screwball struggles up the endless chimney, past hideous gargoyles 
and ancient skeletons imbedded in the blackened bricks.

The SOUNDS of conversation CARRY UP from below.

LILI (OS): I will do it with joy....!
Let the unicorn's blood anoint our love!

SCREWBALL: Crumpets and candlesticks....!
She's gonna kill it!

LILI (OS): ....and in the eternity
awaiting us, I will happily sit on your throne
as befits the Queen of Darkness!

SCREWBALL: I can't let that happen....Why,
it's not civilized!

Clutching the golden plate, Screwball struggles upwards like
a tiny mountaineer.

He reaches into a grinning skull for a handhold and the jaws
clamp shut on his fingers.

SCREWBALL (cont): Billygoat dumplings!

Screwball yanks his hand free, nearly losing his balance. His terror 
gives him renewed energy and he scrambles frantically up the inside 
of the chimney.

111D EXTERIOR TOP OF CHIMNEY DAY 

The chimney pot is shaped like a monstrous demon. Black as a sweep, 
Screwball emerges at the top and looks around.

The distant sun is a dying ember resting on the surrounding rim of 
dark mountains. We HEAR the SOUND of a clock CHIME!

111E INTERIOR DUNGEON CORRIDOR DAY 

A distant CHIME stops Gump in his tracks. He pulls out his timepiece 
from the pouch and studies it.

GUMP: ....not much time....

111F INTERIOR GREAT HALL DAY

Princess Lili stretches out her arms towards Darkness.

LILI: Bring me to the wretched beast.

Darkness takes her arm and leads her towards the blazing hearth.

The unicorn's distant whinny ECHOES from below.

DARKNESS: This way, fair beauty. I hear a 
throat begging to be cut.

Lili hesitates when she realises Darkness intends to lead
her straight into the flames.

LILI (fearful): No....! It's impossible!

Darkness steps into the leaping flames. He turns and takes
Lili's hand.

DARKNESS: Now you are my queen. Nothing is
impossible....Come....it takes but a 
single step....Find the faith....

Darkness looks deep into Lili's eyes. She places her tiny
foot among the white glowing coals. Nothing happens. Not
even the fur is singed.

Lili smiles. Her fear vanishes. She stands at the side of her 
master. Darkness wraps a powerful arm about the girl and they are 
consumed by flames, becoming one with the blaze around them.

113 INTERIOR DUNGEON DAY

Unseen by the deformed goblin GUARDS, the faeries creep out of the 
shadows and take cover behind a squat stone column.

Jack positions Blunder in the corridor entrance with the final plate 
before joining the others.

JACK: Everything's ready....

GUMP: And you, Jack? Your greatest
challenge is still to come....

Darkness and Princess Lili emerge, arm in arm, out of a background 
curtain of fire. They sweep majestically down the stone steps to 
where the unicorn is chained.

Silent as mice, Jack and the faeries peer around at them. Jack is 
horrified by Lili's bestial appearance. 
JACK: ....oh, God....! Lili....

GUMP: Judge her with your heart, not
your eyes.

Blix and Poxand the other goblin Guards scramble to attention as the 
regal pair ascends.

BLIX: Greetings....

POX: S-s-s-salutations....

DARKNESS: Silence....! Prepare the unicorn 
for sacrafice!

The goblins hurry to comply. Blix selects a grotesque black 
greatsword from among a rack of weapons.

Pox furiously pedals a grindstone. Blix applies the blade. Showers 
of sparks shower onto the glistening floor.

Behind the column, the watching faeries are desparate. Luna's 
glowing LIGHT hovers above their heads.

BROWN TOM: The game is lost....for all
of Jack's pretty plan...
. 
JACK: No! It'll work! It must!

GUMP: Luna! Fly up to Screwball! Tell
him it's time!

Quick as a FLASH, Luna STREAKS off into the shadows.

Blix carries the sharpened greatsword to Darkness, offering it with 
a low bow.

DARKNESS: Excellent.... Let the ritual
begin....

The demon Guards stand in a semi-circle around the unicorn. Blix and 
Pox open tattered black prayer books. Darkness steps to a twisted 
lectern and READS from a sinister volume.

DARKNESS: In the beginning, there was
nothing....a void of darkness, a cold
enternity of silence....

POX: Endless night, black as death!
Mother of Shadows protect us!

The assembled Guards answer in a ghastly CHORUS:

CHORUS OF GUARDS: Mother of Shadows, renew us!

POX: Dream Sister....eclipse our pain!

CHORUS OF GUARDS: Night Bride....restore our strength!

114 INTERIOR KEEP AND CORRIDORS DAY

Luna BLAZES straight up out of the abysmal keep; a tiny shooting 
star. The demons' ceremony continues (OS):

DARKNESS (OS): ....and when the perfect void
was corrupted by Light, a great wailing was
heard and all the brethern fled in terror....

Luna rockets along the ruined corridors of the labyrinth.

CHORUS OF GUARDS (OS): Deliver us, O' 
Darkness, from all fear....

115 INTERIOR DUNGEON DAY 

Darkness steps forward. His booming VOICE disturbs the sleeping abts 
and sends them wheeling in clouds around his head.

DARKNESS: Hear me, ye Powers of the Night! We
offer this sacrafive in honour of you....

Darkness reaches up and seizes a fluttering bat from out of the air.

DARKNESS (cont): Here is our offering....
sanctified with blood....

Darkness crushes the bat to a pulp and splatters the unicorn's white 
flank with its blood. Darkness struggles mentally with the mare.

DARKNESS (cont): ....and with fire!

Darkness touches his fingertip to the unicorn's haunch. The hide 
smoulders instantly, leaving an ugly brand.

CHORUS OF GUARDS: Blood and fire, born of Night....
Blood and fire, drown the Light!

The unicorn rears back. Her hooves CLATTER on the cold
stones.

DARKNESS: I pray you, Father, accept my 
sacrafice....Let Light be orever extinguished!
Let the Age of Darkness begin!

Darkness contorts with the strain on imposing his will on the 
unicorn. He dominates the mare and she grows calm.

As the Demon Guards CHANT, Blix and Pox strain at the winch. They 
drag the unicorns towards the chopping block.

116A EXTERIOR TOP OF CHIMNEY DAY

Screwball stands watching the sunset. One hands holds the plate, the 
other polishes a black apple on his tunic.

SCREWBALL (singing under his breath):
....nickety-nackety....noo-noo-noo....

The apple is bright as obsidian. Screwball smiles at his reflection 
on its gleaming surface.

SCREWBALL (cont) (singing): ....fiddle-
dee-widdle-dee....

Screwball takes a big bite of the apple.

Screwball grins, chewing happily. Not a care in the world.

It hits him like a stroke. His eyes cross and he toppes, dropping 
the plate.

Luna comes BLASTING out of the chimney like a tracer bullet.

LUNA (tiny voice): Screwball!

Screwball falls onto the rim of the chimney.

In a brilliant BURST OF LIGHT, Luna materialises into her grown 
self, catching the plate an instant before it drops over the edge.

LUNA (cont): Do it!

Luna looks sadly down on Screwball, touching him with her toe.

LUNA (cont): Screwball...wake up!

Screwball SNORES loudly.

LUNA (cont): Oh, Screwball....

Luna aims the golden plate at the ruby BLAZE of the setting
sun. She aims a beam of LIGHT straight down the chimney.

116B INTERIOR CHIMNEY DAY

The beam of LIGHT descends the dark shaft like a golden waterfall. 

116C INTERIOR KITCHEN DAY 

The beam of LIGHT moves like a searchlight inside the fireplace, 
criss-crossing the Second Cook's body as it misses the propped plate 
he holds by inches.

117 INTERIOR DUNGEON DAY

Working together, the two goblins turn the iron winch. Bit by bit, 
the cable is drawn forward onto the drum.

The unicorn's neck is stretched across the block.

Darkness stands before Lili, offering the greatsword.

DARKNESS: Once your hands were too delicate
for such a task....spinning and weaving 
were more their work....

LILI: Let my loom be made of flesh and blood....
I am sister to the Fates!

Lili eagerly seizes the sword.

DARKNESS: What a queen you'll make!

Jack slumps against the wall, desparate.

JACK: Come on, Screwball....

GUMP: She means to do it, Jack!
She's one of them!

Jack stares at Lili.

Gump grabs a long black bow from a weapon rack, and an arrow from a 
quiver beside it.

GUMP (cont): I'm going to stop her!

JACK: Gump, wait! I trust her!

Gump fits an arrow onto the bowstring.

The unicorn is helpless before Lili. Blix locks the winch, securing 
the cable.

DARKNESS: My lady, the birth of a new
world awaits your stroke.

Lili swings the greatsword high over head.

CHORUS OF GUARDS (chanting):
Blood and fire....eternal ice!
Blood and fire....and sacrafice....

Gump draws back the arrow in the longbow, aiming at Lili.

JACK: No....! Don't...!

Jack grabs the bow. He and Gump struggle for the weapon.

120B INTERIOR KEEP DAY 

The beam of LIGHT ZOOMS out of the corridor, strikes the plate on 
the viaduct, and REFLECTS down into the lowest depths of the castle.

121 INTERIOR DUNGEON DAY 

Gump is determined to shoot Lili. Jack, equally determined to stop 
him.

JACK: I trust her, Gump....I'll
always trust her....

GUMP: Foolish, mortal!

The beam of LIGHT STREAMS in through the corridor. Blunder REFLECTS 
it off his plate towards the others.

Struggling for the bow, Jack and Gump kick over the propped shielf 
the moment the LIGHT beam reaches it.

BROWN TOM: Stop lads....! The light!

A wild LAUGH bursts from Lili's throat. She swings the sword with 
all her might.

The blade arcs through the air, a glittering SUNBURST where it 
carves through the deflected beam of LIGHT.

Lili aims not for the mare, but for the line restraning her. The 
sword severs the woven cable.

LILI (exultant): Run! You're free....!

The unicorn plunges into the shadows. Only the ECHO of her hoofbeats 
remain.

Jack and Gump stop struggling. Jack dives for his fallen shield.

Darkness pulls a weapon from his belt. It is the stallion's alicorn 
mounted as a shortsword.

DARKNESS (sneering savagely): Innocence!

Huge and terrible, Darkness lunges for Lili, driving the alicorn 
straight through her side.

Lili is pierced by the horn. She GASPS, supported by the Demon's 
hold on the blade.

Miraculously, Lili's features alter and TRANSFORM. The fangs and 
claws disappear. Her fur melts like the morning dew. She is an 
innocent maiden once more.

Lili slides dying off the alicorn and falls to the ground.

Jack holds his shield in the beam of LIGHT, angling in a bright 
swath towards Darkness.

JACK: Burn....! You evil bastard....

The LIGHT hits Darkness like an express train. He HOWLS, blasted in 
a smoking whirlwind across the dungeon.

Darkness cowers on his knees, SCREAMING in the LIGHT.

All the goblins scatter HOWLING from the LIGHT. 

Brown Tom capers a happy two-step around Gump, who stares straight 
up into the central keep.

BROWN TOM: ....and we'll dance on the 
black devil's grave....

GUMP'S POV : LOOKING UP: The beam of LIGHT dims and goes
out.

BROWN TOM (OS): What's wrong....? What's
happening, Gump?

Gump shrugs, looking sadly at Jack and the darkened shield
he holds.

GUMP (sadly): Sunset....

With a savage SNARL, Darkness staggers off into the gloon, trailing 
trendrils of smoke.

Jack drops the shield and rushes to Lili's side. He kneels and 
cradles her in his arms.

Throwing back his head, Jack HOWLS like a wild animal. His CRY is a 
wolf-wail of utter despair.

Gump runs frantically up to grieving Green Man.

GUMP: No, Jack....Quick! He's after the mare!

Gump seizes the grotesque sacraficial greatsword.

GUMP (cont): The world needs a champion!
(handing Jack the black sword)
Use this against him!

Jack snatches the sword. He rises cold with fury and runs off into 
pursuit of Darkness.

A precipice jutting over eternity. The unicorn runs along a narrow 
trail bordering the edge of the abyss, highlighted by a bright 
backdrop of comets and stars.

126A INTERIOR TUNNEL NIGHT 

CLOSE ON: The black hooves of Darkness as he runs relentlessly along 
the unicorn's track. 

PULL BACK to show Darkness TRANSFORMED into a muscular black unicorn 
stallion. He surges onward, an explosion of strength. FLAMES flare 
from his nostrils.

126B EXTERIOR EDGE OF THE WORLD DAY 

The huge black unciron THUNDERS out of the cavern-mouth.

The mare stand alone, trapped on a final promontory.

The black stallion REARS and charges the mare....

Black and terrible, the devil stallion rises over the mare, striking 
out with his fearsome hooves.

The mare staggers before this onslaught of evil, falling to the 
ground amid flying black feet.

The black stallion paws the ground, preparing to ram his alicorn 
into the fallen mare.

Jack runs out from the dark cavern, gripping the evil greatsword 
with both hands. He sees the stallion tower above the mare

JACK (calling out): Darkness....!
You rotten filth!

The superb black unicorn turns to meet this new challenge. He 
SNORTS, breathing fire, and lowers his head, charging straight at 
Jack.

Jack stands his ground, greatsword poised, as the huge black 
stallion gallops towards him, hooves striking SPARK.

Jack swings with all his might as the demon unicorn ROARS
slavering past.

The greatsword passes straight through the black beast, as if it 
were striking a ghost.

Jack is knocked off balance by the fury of the charge, but he 
manages to stay on his feet as the stallion wheels and attackes 
again.

The black unicorn's red eyes BLAZE as he crashes into Jack.

The Green Man is thrown awkwardly to one side. He loses the 
greatsword and sprawls helpless on the ground.

Dazed, Jack rises on his elbows.. He sees the black hooves of 
Darkness standing before him.

Looking up, Jack sees the Lord of Darkness TRANSFORMED back to his 
original form. He holds his alicorn sword pointed straight at the 
boy's heart.

DARKNESS: Always a pleasure to take a 
brave man's life. 

Darkness thrusts down with the alicorn, but Jack rolls skillfully 
aside and counds to his feet.

JACK: ....haven't killed me yet....

Jack draws his own sword and swings at Darkness, who parries with 
the alicorn. SPARKS fly.

Jack swings again. Darkness catches the blade in his bare hand and 
holds Jack immobile to meet his malevolent gaze.

DARKNESS: ....Oh, but I have...

Jack is speechless with horror.

DARKNESS (cont): Don't you know me, boy,
don't you know from whence I come....

The muscle hump behind Darkness's neck bulges and cracks. It bursts 
open and a pair of leathery bat wings unfold. Jack's horror is 
complete.

DARKNESS (cont): Time to die....

Darkness drives the alicorn sword into Jack's chest, running him 
through.

Jack's eyes are wide with astonishment. Is this what it's like to 
die?

Darkness pulls the alicorn out of Jack. There is no blood! No trace 
of a wound remains on his flesh. Jack blinks in wordless amazement.

DARKNESS (cont): So...! I should have
known....We're just the same! You're
immortal, Jack!

JACK (disbelieving): No....! I'm not!
I'm human....

DARKNESS (laughing): Who was your mother?

JACK (confused): I....don't know....

DARKNESS: Who was your father?

JACK: ....I....can't remember....

DARKNESS: How long have you lived in 
the forest?

JACK: All my life....! I...I....
know who I am....

DARKNESS: You pitiful fool! An immortal
all this time and never knew....
(laughing)
Don't you see, Jack? Don't you understand
your power....! Together we could rule 
the universe!

JACK (bewildered): .....together....?

DARKNESS: There'd be nothing to stop us!
No power could stand in our way! We're
just the same, Jack....You and I.....
eternal....!

Jack struggles to understand the immensity of this
revelation. He wavers in the face of the demon's persuasiveness.

All at once, the mare unicorn gallops up from the shadows, white and 
pure.

She spears Darkness straight his mid-section. The evil Lord SCREAMS, 
staring down at the shining alicorn thrsut out of his chest.

DARKNESS (cont): ....Father....! Protect me....

Darkness starts to shrink. The mare lifts the writhing demon high in 
the air, impaled like a kicking insect.

Rearing, the unicorn arches her neck and tosses Darkness over toe 
edge into the abyss.

Darkness tumbles into the haze. His final HOWL is a lament from the 
depths of Hell.

At the last moment, the falling figure of Darkness TRANSFORMS into 
the flapping black cloak and sails off into the shadows.

Jack picks up the alicorn. He wraps his other arm around the 
unicorn's neck. They stand together at the edge of the world, united 
in a victorious embrace.

126C EXTERIOR MOUTH OF CAVERN NIGHT 

The faeries gather at the entrance. Screwball is there, half asleep. 
Luna is full-sized. Pale and sleeping, Lili lies on the black cloak. 
The faeries stand around her, eyes downcast.

Jack rides up, mounted on the unicorn. Surrounded by light, he is 
more than a champion. He is divine. The faeries are delighted.

GUMP: Why....Jack....solved 
your riddle at last....

BROWN TOM: Should've known no 
mortal could speak unicorn 
like that....

JACK: How is Lili?

GUMP: Sadly beyond the help of faerie
magic. She's under a powerful spell....
It's like a riddle....

Jack understands. He brightens into a smile.

JAC: I know the answer....! Lift
her to me, gently....

Jack hands Gump the alicorn as the faeries gather Lili in their 
arms, lifting her above their heads.

Jack carefully pulls the enchanted Princess in front of him across 
the unicorn's withers.

JACK (cont): We'll meet again, dear friends....

Jack touches his heels to the unicorn's flanks and they
gallop off in a CLATTER of hoofbeats.

GUMP (waving): Ride like the wind,
Jack....

BROWN TOM: Wish we could go with him....

GUMP: And why not? I know some magic
words that'll do the trick!

SCREWBALL: Oh no! Not me! I hate to travel
like that....makes me sick.

GUMP: Stand back....! The sky's the 
limit!

SCREWBALL: Can't stand your bumpy
takeoffs....

Abruptly, Screwball SHOOTS into the air, flying out of
sight.

GUMP: Screwball! Wait for the spell....

SCREWBALL (os): ....I never do....

Gump gestures magically.

GUMP: Eiderdown and milkfeed fluff....

All at once, Gump, Blunder, and Brown Tom STREAK off into space. 
Luna watches them go. TRANSFORMING into a dot of LIGHT, she speeds 
up after them.

127 EXTERIOR FOREST (RIDE MONTAGE) NIGHT 

Jack clings to Lili as the unicorn thunders through the midnight

impossible chasms, splashing across streams in a burst of moonlit

127A EXTERIOR SKY NIGHT 

The full moon hangs above like the lantern of God as the faeries

Far below, magically white and fluid as free-roving moonbeam, the

ease of a dreamer transported through time.

128 EXTERIOR RING POND DAY 
It is not yet sun-up. The first faint trace of the false dawn tints 
the eastern horizon. Everywhere, the snow is melting. It is like 
springtime, with bold patches of green showing through the frozen

A bright beam of LIGHT APPROACHES, weaving between the giant trees. 
It is Jack and Lili, mounted on the unicorn.

Jack rides up onto the high rock overinghanfing the ponnd and slides 
easily to the ground with Lili in his arms.

The unicorn doesn't move. She stands watching as Jack gently rests 
Lili down on the mossy earth.

Jack strips off his golden mail coat and steps on the edge of the 
promontory. He dives gracefully into the pond.

128A EXTERIOR FOREST DAY 

Screwball in the lead, the faeries CRASH down through the trees,

High above the faerie celebration, beautiful MUSIC is HEARD. It is 
Gump, playing his violin in uppermost branches of a towering pine. 
Delicate as the call of a meadow lark, Gump's music rises sweetly 
into the heavens. It is just dawn. The sun's GLOW blazes in the 
east.

129F EXTERIOR UNDERWATER DAY 

A winking GLEAM catches Jack's eyes and he reaches out an eager 
hand.

A cloud silt issues from his grasp as he opens his fingers. Centred 
on his palm, golden and perfect, is Lili's ring.

129G EXTERIOR UNICORN DEATH ARENA DAY 

Round and full, the sun rises. The golden sun rays pierce through 
the trees and start across the open meadow. Gump's music continues, 
more lyrical than ever.

As the sunlight advances, bright spring flowers push up through the 
once-frozen earth.

129H EXTERIOR UNDERWATER DAY 

Jack turns and strokes upwards, higher and higher, towards the 
shining ceiling of light far above.

129I EXTERIOR UNICORN DEATH ARENA DAY 

Gump's music swells to a crescendo. The life-giving sunlight reaches 
across the meadow and strikes the flank of the dormant stallion.

130 EXTERIOR RING POND DAY 

Jack breaks the surface, holding the ring triumphantly above his 
head.

130A EXTERIOR CLIFF ABOVE POND DAY 

The Princess sleeps under the tree. She no longer wears the black 
wedding gown, but is dressed as before. Jack's armour has also 
disappeared.

Jack kneels before Lili and slips the ring onto her finger.

He takes the girl into his arms and kisses her passionately on the 
mouth.

Lili smiles. Her eyelids flutter.

134 EXTERIOR UNICORN DEATH ARENA DAY

The unicorn's sunlit flesh twitches, dislodging a butterfly warming 
his wings on his haunch.

In a single, beautiful movement, the stallion rises to his feet. He 
arches his powerful neck and CALLS to his mate. The magic animals 
gallop off together across the open meadow.

136A EXTERIOR RING POND DAY

Princess Lili awakens.

LILI: Oh....! Jack! What a dream
I've had!

The Princess smiles when she sees the ring on her finger.

LILI (cont): Such a terrible dream....
I could never tell you....

Lili looks around, but Jack is nowhere in sight.

LILI (cont): Jack....? Where are you....?
(calling)
Green Jack!

Getting no reply, Lili wanders off in search of Jack.

137 EXTERIOR JACK'S FOREST GLADE DAY 

Puzzled, Lili searches the familiar place.

LILI (calling): Jack....! Where are you
hiding now?

The wind surges through the treetops. The leaves all move together 
as if they were a single living organism.

Jack's VOICE is heard out of the waving trees.

JACK (os): I'm everywhere, Lili....my
spirit lives in everything....

LILI: Jack.... Don't play games with me!
I love you!

JACK (os): I....love.....you...

LILI: Will you be here tomorrow?

Unseen in the bushes, Gump and the faeries hide, grinning as
they watch Lili.

JACK (os): I'm always here, Lili....
whenever you come....

Mystified, but happy, Princess Lili picks a flower and wanders off 
into the sun-bright woods.

END CREDITS ROLL

138 EXTERIOR MEADOW DAY 

A lush broad expanse, boldly pattered with wild flowers. Breasting 
the waving grass like a swimmer in the sea, the unicorn bounds 
joyfully in total freedom.

Mounted on the animal's back, his arms in victory, Jack rides like a 
triumphant angel. His hair and skin are tinted green! He is the 
incarnation of all that is magical in Nature.
