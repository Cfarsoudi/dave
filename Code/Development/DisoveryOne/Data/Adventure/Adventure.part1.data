 EXT. BANGKOK. NIGHT. A single headlamp in close up shines directly and brightly out Extreme noise and light. Beyond its glare can be seen the outline of a motorized tricycle ("tuk-tud") and its Thai driver A young man, Richard, sits in the back, his rucksack beside him, swaying with the motion of the vehicle. He is worn and sweating. They travel through nocturnal Bangkok: fleets of tuk-tuks, taxis, road works, food vendors, dogs, tourists. Music and credits. EXT. KHAO SAN ROAD. NIGHT The bright headlight comes to a halt. Richard climbs down from the tuk-tuk RICHARD (V.O.) When you hit Bangkok, there's really only one place to go. The street is busy, full of Thai's and travelers. Richard picks his way through the crowd, his rucksack on his back. He absorbs the scene as he passes boarding houses and hotels, and the shops and stalls selling food, clothes, pirated tapes, jewelry, travel tickets, and international phone calls. Restaurantes are filled with western travelers watching American films or European sport. RICHARD (V.O.) (continuing) The Khao San Road is a decompression chamber between east and west. It's where you learn to breathe car fumes and tropical air for the very first time, or else carefully rearrange your memories before you catch your flight home. Richard is approached by a young male Thai Hustler who walks backwards in front of him while making his pitch. HUSTLER You need somewhere to stay? RICHARD I'll be OK, Thanks. Richard politely ignores each of his subsequent offers. HUSTLER What do you want? Sell your passport? Buy passport? Airline tickets? You want silk? I'll take you to the best silk place? You get a suit in twenty-four hours. Diamonds? You want to come with me, you get present for your girlfriend. Maybe no girlfriend. You want a girl, no problem. Good time. Boy girl fucking no problem. You want to drink some snake blood? At this last one Richard stops and addresses the Hustler. RICHARD No thanks. Richard walks on, the hustler fading out behind him. HUSTLER You want designer clothes? I get you Versache, Gucci, Armani, no problem. You want a camera, all the best makes: Nikon, Leica, Canon I can get you. RICHARD (V.O.) Yeah, it's all here: you an phone home, meet up with strangers, split up with your friends, watch Hollywood movies while you sip Budweiser and eat a burger or get some massage and green chicken soup. You could be anywhere in the world bu you could only find it here. And what do they want, all these people?

 EXT. KHAO SAN ROAD. NIGHT./ INT. BARS AND SHOPS. NIGHT. Various young travelers, male and female, in snapsho9t exerpts, address their comments to the camera or each other. TRAVELER 1 Where you been? TRAVELER 2 Where you going? TRAVELER 3 I've been there TRAVELER 4 It's a waste of time TRAVELER1 We just got back TRAVELER2 Fantastic TRAVELER 3 How much did it cost? TRAVELER5 A complete rip off. TRAVELER3 Too many people. There's a much better place along the coast. TRAVELER 4 We're going exploring. We've read this book. It tells us all the best places to explore. TRAVELER 2 I know a place that everyone says is really unspoiled. TRAVELER 1 I heard they built a big hotel there. TRAVELER 5 Some sort of sewage problem, apparently. TRAVELER 1 We're going anyway: all the rooms have got air conditioning. RICHARD (V.O.) But for me it's all about finding out something about a place, and something about yourself. And when you get off the beaten track, that's where you find out what there is to find out. Richard turns into one of the restaurants. INT. RESTAURANT. NIGHT. The restaurant extends deeply back away from the street. Richard passes many diners not dissimilar to himself. Some are talking, many are engrossed in the video entertainment. At the back he reaches a reception desk where he drops his pack. A Thai female HOTEL RECEPTIONIST sits behind the desk. She immediately shows Richard a "menu" of available rooms. The menu offers a spread of prices for single/double/window/fan/aircon/bathroom. Richard points to the cheapest combination and hands over 300 baht. The Receptionist becomes aware that he is being started at. A worn, disheveled man in his mid-thirties is standing at the nearby bar, a bottle in his hand, studying Richard. This is Daffy. RICHARD Good evening. Daffy says nothing but continues to stare and takes a drink. Richard will not be stared down. Neither turns away. The Receptionist passes over a key and smiles broadly. HOTEL RECEPTIONIST Welcome to Thailand. Richard turns to her. RICHARD Thank you.

 INT SHOWER. NIGHT In a small windowless shower room, Richard stands motionless, eyes closed, facing with pleasure the spray of cold water. INT. HOTEL CORRIDOR. NIGHT The sound of the shower can be heard through a door marked with a shower sign. The sound stops and the door is opened. Richard emerges with a towel wrapped around his waist, carrying his key and washbag. He walks the short distance to his room. He puts the key in the door but the lock is stiff and he has to fiddle with it, bent over and dripping water on the floor. While he is doing so, the sound of footsteps climbing nearby stairs can be heard. There is the sound of a loud wolf-whistle. Richard turns to the source of the whistle. A beautiful European woman is smiling at him. This is Francoise. She approaches and takes the key from his hand. She turns the key in one direction, then the other, while twisting the handle. FRANCOIS Et voila. The door swings gently open. She stands back RICHARD Thank you. Footsteps approach from the stair. Francoise is joined by a young man, ETIENNE, who catches up with her. He nods at Richard as he takes her arm. They walk away from Richard to the next door. FRANCOISE Bonsoir. RICHARD Eh - bonsoir. ETIENNE Goodnight. The couple reach their door. They enter their room and the door is closed behind them. Alone in the corridor again, Richard contemplates their presence. RICHARD (V.O.) I was traveling alone for two reasons. First of all, being alone allows you more opportunity to absorb your experiences on a personal level. Secondly, and this I felt acutely at that moment, there was no one who wanted to go with me.

 INT RESTAURANT. NIGHT Richard is in the restaurant which is quiet now. He is alone at a table eating and drinking. On a high shelf several feet away a Hollywood action film, all gunshots, car chases, and explosions, plays on the television. Most of the tables around him are empty. Richard is interrupted by the man he met earlier, Daffy, who pulls up a chair beside him. DAFFY Excuse me. RICHARD Yes? DAFFY I'm Daffy. RICHARD Richard. Hi. DAFFY Look, I'm sorry to bother you but I was wondering if you could help me out. RICHARD Help you out? DAFFY Yeah; just ten or fifteen dollars maybe. RICHARD I'm sorry, I don't think so. DAFFY I'm waiting on some money coming through. It's just that at the moment, you know, I'm short. They're going to chuck me out. On the street in Bangkok, that's bad. RICHARD I'm really sorry but I just arrived; I'm on a pretty tight budget myself. I just can't afford it. DAFFY Just five dollars, please. He leans in close to Richard DAFFY (continuing) I'll share something with you. RICHARD I'm sorry. I can't lend you any money. Daffy retreats. Richard turns back to the video and his food. Daffy approaches two young women sitting at a nearby table. DAFFY Excuse me, ladies, is there any chance you could help me out. I'm down on my luck at the moment. The two young women seem uncomfortable. Richard notices. DAFFY (continuing) if you could see your way to lending me some cash - RICHARD Here. He leans across and holds out a ten dollar note for Daffy. DAFFY Thank you, sir. Thank you. I promise I will repay you. RICHARD Just take it, OK. Daffy takes it. Richard returns to the video as a big yellow explosion is reflected on his face. INT. RICHARD'S HOTEL ROOM. NIGHT. Some light enters from the street through a small window. Richard lies on his bed, watching the fan rotate above him. He is listening to the sound of Etienne and Francoise engaging in noisy sex. They reach the climax of their activity and fall silent. Richard just has time to enjoy the silence when a new disturbance begins, this time from the next room in the other direction. It is a man, Daffy, banging on the wall just above Richard's head and shouting in time. DAFFY (O.S.) Have. You. Got. Anything. To. Smoke. Have. You. Got. Anything. To. -

 INT. HOTEL CORRIDOR. NIGHT. Richard knocks sharply on the door of Daffy's room. The door is opened immediately by Daffy, looking even worse then before. RICHARD No, I don't have anything to smoke. Daffy stares at him for a moment. Recognition dawns. DAFFY You. You're the guy that lent me the money. RICHARD Yeah, that's right. Now could you be quiet so I can get some sleep. DAFFY Ten dollars. I'll find a way to pay you back. How would you like to know About somewhere special? The perfect beach. Paradise. No one else knows about it. That's got to be worth something. What do you say? RICHARD Look I don't care about the money right now: I just want some sleep. So if you could be quiet - DAFFY Yea, OK. I will be, I will be, I promise. RICHARD Thanks. Richard turns away. DAFFY Richard - He turns back. DAFFY (Continuing) Been nice knowing you. He sticks his hand out. Richard politely reciprocates. RICHARD Sure. They shake hands. INT. EXT. RESTAURANT. DAY. The restaurant fronts on to the street where a new day's activity is beginning. Richard watches this as he eats his breakfast. He notices Etienne and Francoise sti down at the next table. RICHARD Bonjour. ETIENNE Good morning. FRANCOISE Did you sleep well? RICHARD Not too bad. FRANCOISE I hope our noise did not keep you awake. Richard looks from one to the other. RICHARD The noise? Don't worry. You're on holiday. ETIENNE She means your neighbor. The Scotsman RICHARD Oh, that noise! Yes, he certainly did. ETIENNE We moved rooms because of him. FRANCOISE He tried to borrow money from us. ETIENNE What idiot would lend him money? It would disappear. FRANCOISE He said if we lent him money h would tell us about a secret beach. ETIENNE It's on an island that no one get to. FRANCOISE But he has been there, off course. ETIENNE It was ridiculous; all this at three o'clock in the morning. RICHARD It would be nice though, if there was a place like that. You know, that no one could get to. ETIENNE Of course, but look; all these people. If that place existed, they'd all be there. 

 INT. TRAVEL AGENT'S. DAY On a large board are details, photographs and prices of various standard excursions. A Thai TRAVEL AGENT reels them off at great speed. TRAVEL AGENT Nakhon - Pathom - Phra Ptahom Chedi - Damnoen Sadual floating market - eight hundred baht. Kanchanburi - Erwan national Park Phrathat Cave, huang Khamin Falls - six hundred baht. Nam Tok, hellfire Pass, Three Pagodas, Sai Yok National Park - fifteen hundred baht. Bang Pa In Royal Palace, Ayatthaya, Wat Phra Manhathat, Wat Raburna - one thousand baht. What do you want? Richard studies the board but is not excited. RICHARD Twenty Marlboro light, please. Instantly the Travel Agent produces the packet of cigarettes from a shelf and lays them on the counter. EXT. KHAO SAN ROAD. DAY. Richard lights up and looks around. He looks through the tapes at a stall. INT. HOTEL CORRIDOR. DAY Richard walks along the corridor towards his room, his new tape playing on his walkman. On his door, a folded sheet of paper is attached with a pin. Richard lifts it off and unfolds it. It is a detailed and carefully drawn map of a cluster of islands. Some are named. One is unnamed. On it, some features are marked; hills, forest, river and a letter X. In the corner it reads "X = beach". Richard switches his Walkman off. He studies the map then walks to Daffy's door and knocks. No reply. Richard twists the handle and pushes gently. The door opens. INT DAFFY'S ROOM. DAY. The room is dim, be even so the blood can be seen sprayed and smeared around the walls, sheets and floor. There is no sign of Daffy. Richard treads carefully, avoiding the pools of blood on the floor. He reaches the other side of the room. There, wedged in the narrow gap between bed and wall, is Daffy's corpse. His wrists have been cut. Richard studies the map again. RICHARD (V.O.) You hope and you dream, but you never believe that something's going to happen for you, not like it does in the movies. And when it does, you sort of expect it to feel different. More visceral. More real. Like IMAX maybe. I was waiting for it to hit me, but it didn't. And just for the record, I never did get my ten dollars back. Richard switches his walkman back on. INT. POLICE STATION. DAY. In an office, two policemen, one in UNIFORM and the other a DETECTIVE, stand over Richard while he signs a statement. RICHARD (V.O.) The police didn't want to waste any time on it. They were just pissed off becase he was traveling on a false passport, name of Mr Daffy Duck, birthplace Ruritania, which kind of fucked up all the paperwork. They pulled everyone in from the hotel, but all they wanted form me was a statement saying I found him and it looked like he cut his wrists. No problem. The detective studies Richard's passport. DETECTIVE What are you doing in Thailand? Tourist? RICHARD Traveler. DETECTIVE You go to Patpong? See smoke from pussy, ping pong ball from pussy, razor blade from pussy; bird from pussy. RICHARD I don't think so. DETECTIVE Why not? Thai girls best in the world. Thai food best in the world. Thai dope best in the world. RICHARD I wouldn't know anything about that, sir.

 INT. POLICE STATION CORRIDOR. DAY The door of the office opens and Richard walks out. Lined up in the corridor, slouching against the walls, are several other travelers from the hotel. At the front of the queue are Francoise and Etienne. The officer beckons Etienne into the office and closes the door. Richard and Francoise acknowledge each other with a smile. INT. RICHARD'S HOTEL ROOM. DAY. Richard is seated at the top of his bed, addressing his speech out of shot while he holds the map. RICHARD OK, this island may not actually exist. And even if it does, we might not be able to get there. But look at it like this: what else is there to do around here? Richard is alone. RICHARD (continuing) So what do you think? Are you going to come or not. I'd be thrilled if you'd join me, you and youryou and your boyfriend.

 INT. HOTEL CORRIDOR. DAY Richard knocks on his neighbors' door. Etienne opens it. RICHARD Hi. You want to take a hike? I mean a trip. A journey. With your girlfriend and me. I mean the two of you, and me. It's a secret island. Paradise. You know the kind of thing I'm talking about. Francoise appears behind Etienne. FRANCOISE Hi. RICHARD Hi there. Here, take a look. He shows Etienne the map. RICHARD (continuing) It's a map. The dead guy left it for me; I think it's the place he tried to sell you. It's going to be just fucking great. You want to come? I'd be thrileld if Francoise and Etienne are looking at him. RICHARD (V.O.) I realized that I had absolutely no idea of how I was going to get there. 

 EXT. RAILWAY/THAI COUNTRYSIDE. NIGHT. A train travels at night alongside fields. INT. TRAIN. NIGHT Richard is awake. Opposite him, Etienne and Francoise are slumped together in sleep. RICHARD (V.O.) Etienne, however, and I have to hand it to the guy, was fucking great. He organized the whole thing: tickets, timetables, best route, the whole damn trip. EXT. SEA. DAY. The bow of a passenger ferry crashes through a wave. EXT. BOAT DAY. The decks are crowded with travelers and their packs. Amongst them are Richard, Francoise, and Etienne. Maps and guidebooks are being studied by many. The noise of the engines and the wind deters conversation. RICHARD (V.O.) Thanks to him we hit the final stop on the tourist trail inside twenty-four hours, where, Etienne assured me, we would hire what he called a "local fisherman" to take us on the last stage of our journey.  

 INT EXT. TRUCK. DAY Inside back of a covered, converted pick-up, four people are seated down each side, amongst them Richard, Francoise, and Etienne. Behind them as they bump along, can be seen the dusty red road bordered with dense green shrubs. The truck stops. EXT. ROAD. DAY. Richard unloads the final of the three rucksacks from the roof of the truck, passing it down to Etienne who stands at the back with Francoise. The truck pulls away, revealing as sign, "Seashell Bungalows". EXT. BUNGALOW. DAY. A simple wooden shack on stilts, one of several standing in a line at the edge of the beach. There is a small porch to the front. INT. BUNGALOW. DAY A spartan room: bed, mosquito nets, chair, cupboard, fan. Richard dumps his rucksack. Ext. SEA/BEACH. DAY. A long inflatable tube is towed past by a motorboat, its passengers whooping with delight. As it passes, Francoise is revealed, standing in the water, looking in towards the shore. She begins to walk in. On the beach there are sunbathers, games of beach volley ball, and vendors selling food and sunglasses. RICHARD (V.O.) This was just the kind of place I didn't want to hang around. Not that it's lacking in comfort. Quite the opposite. It's got everything. Everything you could possibly need to make you feel at home. And what's the point of that. On the beach Francoise picks up a towel. EXT. BEACH RESTAURANT. DAY. The restaurant fronts on to the beach. At the back there is a bar. Richard sits alone at a table with a drink, watching the scene on the beach, including Francoise. Etienne pulls up a chair and sits down. Francoise will join them as the dialogue proceeds. ETIENNE It's arranged. Tomorrow morning. Eight hundred baht. RICHARD Nice work. ETIENNE There is one problem. Etienne opens the map on the table. ETIENNE He will not take us to the island. It's in the National Park and it is forbidden to go there. But we are allowed to travel to this one to stay for one night. RICHARD That's the wrong one. ETINENNE I know that. Francoise sits down with a drink. RICHARD So from there to there? FRANCOISE We swim. RICHARD Swim? ETIENNE We leave our rucksacks on this island and then we swim. FRANCOISE You can swim? RICHARD Yes, of course I can swim. How far do you think it is? ETIENNE One or two kilometers. RICHARD Oh. Great. Not far at all. I don't like to be negative, but do you think we should let someone know where we're going? ETIENNE Why? RICHARD We're going to swim "one or two kilometers" across open sea, from one uninhabited island to another. Something goes wrong. What then? FRANCOISE Have you told someone? RICHARD No. FRANCOISE I think it's a bad idea to tell anyone. ETIENNE Richard, it's secret. That's the whole point. RICHARD Yeah, OK. Foreget it. We won't tell anyone. Richard picks up the map EXT. BUNGALOW. DAY Richard sits on his veranda, under cover. Beyond him is a tropical downpour. He hears two sets of footsteps rushing up the stairs of the next door bungalow. Two men, Americans, Zeph and Sammy, try to open their door but cannot. ZEPH Fuck, I knew we locked it. We should have left it unlocked. Sammy addresses Richard SAMMY We lost our key RICHARD Where did you lose it? ZEPH On the beach. Or in the water. SAMMY The truth is we don't know. RICHARD You try reception? ZEPH Closed. Back later. We hope. RICHARD Pretty annoying SAMMY It's a disaster, to which there is only one sensible, considered, appropriate, and timely response. EXT. BUNGALOW. NIGHT. All three are stoned. A joint is passed around while Zeph sings badly. ZEPH I smoke two joints in the morning, and I smoke two joints at night, and I smoke two joints in the afternoon, and then I feel alright. I smoke two joints in time of peace, and two in time of war. I smoke two joints before I smoke two joints and then I smoke some more. I can't remember the rest. RICHARD Perhaps you smoked too much dope. ZEPH Not possible SAMMY Do you know the Kentucky friend mouse story?" RICHARD Woman bites chicken leg, turns out to be a mouse. Or a rat. It's an urban myth. SAMMY Exactly. Always happened to someone else. RICHARD So? SAMMY So there's an urban myth, well more of a rural myth, going around here at the moment. It's about a beach. RICHARD Uh-huh. ZEPH Yea. This beach is perfect. It's on an island, right, hidden from the sea. Imagine: pure white sand and enough dope to smoke all day every day for the rest of your life. Only a few know exactly where it is and they won't tell anyone. SAMMY Of course no one's actually ever met any of these people, only met someone who has. You know what I mean. It's a Kentucky fried mouse. RICHARD I hadn't heard that one before. But it's good. It's a good story. A torch shines on them, jolting them into some sort of reaction and a woman's voice calls out. THAI WOMAN Hey, you! I got your key! INT. BUNGALOW. DAY Richard's rucksack is packed an by the door. Richard is sitting copying Daffy's map on to another sheet of paper. He finishes and writes a note on the copy. He puts the original in his pack and lifts it. EXT. BUNGALOW. DAY. Richard hops over the fence to the veranda of Zeph and Sammy's bungalow. He slips the folded copy under their door. He looks around to check that he has not been seen. EXT BEACH. DAY Richard walks along a narrow wooden pontoon, his rucksack on his back. He stops about half way along at a small narrow wooden boat with an outboard motor. He looks down into it. Etienne and Francoise walk past him along the pontoon without stopping and disappear from view. RICHARD (V.O.) OK, let's face it. There is no such thing as a local fisherman anymore. There really isn't the demand for them. If you want to catch fish you put down a hundred kilometer drag net. Richard walks away along the pontoon. RICHARD (V.O.) (continuing) And if you want to go somewhere - you get a taxi. EXT. SEA.. DAY. Richard, Francoise and Etiene sit at the back of a small powerful motor launch which skims across the surface of the sea with great noise and speed. EXT. BEACH. DAY. The motor launch idles gently as it drifts into the shallows of a small deserted bay. Richard Francoise, and Etienne jump from the boat into the shallows. EXT. BEACH. NIGHT. As the sun sets they sit in silence, each shovelling down forkloads of noodles. EXT. BEACH. NIGHT. The only sounds are those of crickets and the waves gently breaking on the shore. Richard is lying asleep on the sand. He is woken by someone rummaging through the rucksack beside him. It is Francoise, removing clothes, books, souvenirs. Eventually she finds her camera, a mini-tripod and a cable-release. She places them on an unfolded T-shirt on the sand. RICHARD Francoise - FRANCOISE Sshh. Etienne will be angry if I wake him. He thinks I waste film taking photographs of the sky. Richard wakes up and works out what she is doing. RICHARD I think so too. FRANCOISE One night I will get the perfect photograph. She presses the cable release. FRANCOISE (continuing) Un, deux, trois, quatre, cinq, six. She lets the shutter close. FRANCOISE (continuing) Take a look. Richard leans over and squints down the viewfinder. The sky is framed. Francoise leans into the frame. Richard draws back. RICHARD You realize that in the eternity of space, there is a planet, just like this one, where you are photographing back towards us. You're photographing yourself. FRANCOISE Incredible RICHARD There are infinite worlds out there, where anything that can happen does happen. FRANCOISE So on one you are rich, on another poor. On one you are a murderer, on another the victim. RICHARD Exactly FRANCOISE Richard, you know something - She hands him the cable release while she adjusts the camera. FRANCOISE (continuing) That is just the kind of pretentious bullshit that Englishmen and Americans always say to French girls so that they can sleep with them. RICHARD Sorry. I thought I was doing quite well. FRANCOISE It's just the sky, Richard. She presses his thumb down on the cable release, her hand around his. FRANCOISE (continuing) Un, deux, trois, quatre, cinq, six, sept EXT. NIGHT. SKY. Francoise voice fades away over an image of the night sky. Time lapse: the sky rapidly changes to day. RICHARD (V.O.) When you develop an infatuation for someone, you always find a reason to believe that this is exactly the person for you. It doesn't need to be a good reason, a bad one will do just as well. Taking photographs of the night sky, for example: in the long run that's just the kind of dumb irritating habit that would cause you to split up. But at the time - it's the charming eccentricity you've been searching for all these years. EXT. BEACH. DAY. From a different beach they look towards their target: the island. It is 1-2 kilometers away. Richard, Etienne, and Francoise stand on the beach looking towards it. Each is in their swimwear and a T-shirt, and carries a plastic bag, inflated and tied, in which they carry their valuables and some rations. ETIENNE One kilometer FRANCOISE Two. ETIENNE Richard? RICHARD I don't know - I'm American. ETIENNE So? RICHARD We think in miles, not kilometers. ETIENNE So how many miles do you think it is? RICHARD I have no idea but it looks like a long way. FRANCOISE. Too far? RICHARD If it's too far, then we'll drwon. But if we dont' try then we'll never know. Richard wades into the water., RICHARD So, let's go. RICHARD (V.O.) You have to enjoy a moment like that. You just don't know, you see; it may never happen again. Once more. RICHARD SO, let's go. RICHARD (V.O.) I am such a fucking hero. "Let's go". I felt like I'd waited all my life just to say something like that. So I replayed it a couple of times, taking it from different perspectives. EXT. BEACH. DAY. Multiple repeats of Richard's moment from various perspectives and speeds. RICHARD So: let's go. RICHARD (V.O.) You have to enjoy a moment like that. You just don't know, you see: it may never happen again. Once more. RICHARD So: let's go. He dives in and begins swimming. EXT. SEA. DAY. They are far out to sea now, several hundred meters from the shore. Richard swims at the front, the other two about five meters behind. RICHARD Everyone ok? ETIENNE We're ok. RICHARD I think we're about half way. A few strokes later. ETIENNE Richard - I saw a fin! RICHARD What! ETIENNE A fin! They all stop and tread water. RICHARD A shark fin? ETIENNE I don't know, just a fin. Over there. About a hundred meters. RICHARD Big? ETIENNE. Yes. RICHARD Well what the fuck do you expect me to do about it. ETIENNE Nothing. I just thought you ought to know. RICHARD Well to be honest, Etienne, I would rather have not known about it. ETIENNE I'm sorry. RICHARD A bit fucking late. He starts swimming again. A few strokes later he hears a short sharp scream from Francoise. ETIENNE Francoise! Francoise! Richard turns around. Francoise is gone. Her plastic bag bobs on the surface. Etienne is frantic, hysterical. ETIENNE (continuing) She is gone! RICHARD What happened? Etienne submerges briefly and resurfaces. ETIENNE She just went under the water. She was pulled under. Oh God, I don't see her. RICHARD Was there a shark? Did you see a shark? They both start looking down at their feet and circling frantically in the water. ETIENNE I don't know! I don't know! Oh God. Suddenly Richard screams. Francoise surfaces, pulling up his ankle. She and Etienne laugh at Richard. RICHARD Very funny. You Europeans, you have ssuch a playful sense of humor. No wonder your comedy has conquered the world. He swims on. ETIENNE What about Moliere? RICHARD Fuck off. He swims on without looking round. EXT. BEACH. DAY. One by one the three swimmers emerge from the sea and collapse on the beach. They are absolutely exhausted and lie there on the sand, unable to speak. Eventually, they tear open their plastic bags, drink some water and eat some chocolate. Richard has a little water left in his bottle. He notices Francoise and Etienne eyeing it enviously. He holds the bottle out towards them, then snatches it back and swigs down the last of the water. EXT. FOREST. DAY. Richard, Francoise, and Etienne walk through the forest behind the beach. EXT. FOREST. DAY They scramble up a steep slope through dense foliage. Richard, at the front, pauses to let the other two pass him, then he follows. EXT. TOP OF SLOPE/CLEARING. DAY. Richard reaches the top of the slope and follows the other two through a gap in the foliage. He joins Etienne and Francoise who are standing in awe at the edge of a large clearing filled with cannabis plants. ETIENNE Nice Island. They smile and examine the plants. Richard wanders a short distance away. Something glinting on the ground catches Richard's eye. He leans down and picks it up. It is an empty brass cartridge from a rifle. Richard looks around. Just ahead he sees the remains of an extinguished campfire, and beyond that, protruding from the undergrowth, a pair of male legs and beyond them, the butt of a rifle. CLOSE IN on the nest in the undergrowth. The legs and gun belong to a Farmer. He is asleep. His physique is strong and his skin weathered. Richard turns back to Etienne and Francoise. They are still strolling amongst the plants. Richard begins to back away. The Farmer wakes. He lifts his gun and stands up to look out over the dope field. EXT. FIELD. DAY. There is no one there. EXT. FIELD. DAY. The farmer looks around, sees nobody. His attention is attracted by a whistle. He looks over. A group of three more, similarly armed Farmers emerge from the forest at the other side. He waves at them. They beckon him across. He sets off through the field. EXT. AMONG PLANTS. DAY. The three inturders continue to crawl along the ground between the plants Suddenly Richard stops. The farmer's footsteps come closer. His feet pass in the gap between Richard and Francoise. He pauses. They lie frozen in place. He lights a cigarette and drops the match. He moves on. They breath again. EXT. EDGE OF FIELD. DAY. Richard, Etienne, and Francoise reach the far edge of the field and enter the forest again. FRANCOISE My God, what are we doing here? ETIENNE Shit. This was not on the map, Richard. RICHARD I didn't draw the map, Etienne. ETIENNE It's a fucking mess. RICHARD I didn't force you to come, so don't blame me. FRANCOISE We should go back. It's too dangerous. We shouldn't be here. RICHARD Go back? How? Swim perhaps? Great idea. Back in the water? Well fuck that. You swim back if you want to. Both of you. I'm not. ETIENNE Richard - she is frightened. So am I. Richard looks at them. They await his lead. RICHARD Well, we're not going back. Richard smiles. The other two are still nervous. RICHARD (V.O) Once again, I think you'll agree. A moment worth savoring. EXT. FOREST. DAY. They flit thorugh a lest dense forest, up a slope, looking carefully around as they go. RICHARD (V.O.) The most satisfying aspec, of course, was that Monseigneur Practical, Mr. Timetable, Mr I'll-sort-it-out-with-a-local-fisherman, he turned out to be not so hot in your actual primordial fight or flight situation, your combat zone, where what it takes to stay alive is quick thinking and nerves of steel. I didn't need to say anything. I knew it, and so did he. They reach the top of the hill. Richard looks back. Down below they can see the dope fields. They continue EXT. FOREST. DAY. They are travelling downhill now, beside a stream. They stop to drink from it. ETIENNE If we follow this down, it should lead us all the way to the lagoon. RICHARD That's right, all the way down. RICHARD (V. O.) He was right. All we had to do was follow the water and we'd be in paradise. Only I twasn't going to be that easy. EXT. WATERFALL. DAY. Water thunders from a clifftop to a pool Etienne and Francoise are lying flat on a rock, peering over the edge of this high waterfall. It falls in a single giant step. On either side of the waterfall, cliffs curve away to form a massive circle enclosing the lagoon and an area of land covered in forest. Etienne crawls back a few paces to where Richard is sitting on a rock. Francoise continues to look over. ETIENNE Well, Richard, how are we going to get down? RICHARD Why are you asking me? ETIENNE Why shouldn't I? RICHARD Because you can have an opinion too. ETIENNE I have an opinion RICHARD OK, so let's hear it. FRANCOISE We'll jump. RICHARD Don't be stupid. Etienne? ETIENNE We'll climb down over there. RICHARD There? ETIENNE So, what do you think? FRANCOISE Listen to me - we can jump. RICHARD No, if we try to climb there we'll all be killed. Over there looks better. ETIENNE Maybe we could make a rope out of some creepers. RICHARD Yes, or maybe we could build a hang glider and a giant staircase. FRANCOISE (Shouting) Please! They turn to her. She is standing with her back to the drop. RICHARD What? She turns around. ETIENNE No! She jumps. She falls towards and into the pool. Richard and Etienne scramble to the edge and peer over. She surfaces and waves. Richard and Etienne look at each other. RICHARD OK, so we'll jump. EXT. WATERFALL. DAY. Richard and Etienne jump. They sink and then surface. All three are ecstatic and elated, charged with the excitement of the fall and the joy of a journey's end. They exchange hugs and kisses. They become aware of a single person clapping slowly. They turn to see Keaty, a young Afro-Caribbean Londoner, standing a few paces away. KEATY Congratulation. It took me the best part of an hour to work up the balls to do that. Mind you, I was alone, so you have to make allowances. They say nothing. KEATY (continuing) I'm Keaty. RICHARD Are there many people here? Keaty raises a hand to stop Richard's question. KEATY The Q and A comes later. First of all, I think you'd better meet Sal. INT. LONGHOUSE. DAY. Sal, a woman in her early thirties, is seated on the floor opposite Richard, Francoise, and Etienne. Sal is studying Daffy's map. She hands it back to Richard. Gathered around them are about twenty assorted inhabitants of various nationalities, all weathered travelers in their twenties or thirties. The longhouse is single story building made from wood and bamboo lattice, about thirty meters long. It is divided up by low partitions into single or double sleeping areas, some of which are personalized, others not. There is also an open area where this action takes place. RICHARD (V.O.) At first they were more interested in the map than us. It seems that Daffy, the guy who drew it, he was a founding father, he discovered this places and set up the community five years ago. Then about one year ago he starts to get depressed, six months later he leaves and that's the last they hear till we turn up. RICHARD He's dead. He cut his wrists open in a hotel room on the Khao San Road. The police didn't know what to do with the body. I guess they'll incinerate him or something. SAL Do you tink he gave a mpa like this to anyone else. RICHARD I don't know. I don't think so. SAL And you, have you told anyone or shown anyone this map? ETIENNE No. FRANCOISE No. RICHARD No. SAL Good. EXT. ISLAND SCENES. DAY/NIGHT. Commence a montage of various scenes of island life involving its citizens and the newcomers. The longhouse stands at one edge of a clearing, dominating it. Scattered around are several other smaller huts and a few tents. Other locations are the beach, the garden, and the forest. We see the inhabitants at work in the garden in the lagoon relaxing on the beach around the fire at night RICHARD (V.O.) Now I've got to say that my first impressions were not favorable. Oh God, I thought, it's a tribe of hippies. I thought we'd have to talk about our positive energies a lot, kiss the earth every morning and recycle our waste products by some unspeakable mechanism. Fortunately not. It really was some kind of a paradise. We grew some fruit and some dope. The farmers on the other side left us alone and we didn't trespass on their turf. INT. LONGHOUSE. DAY Everyone, including Francoise, Etiennne and Richard is sitting around a big wooden table set for dinner. Two people are serving side dishes of vegetables and rice. RICHARD (V.O.) Sal was the leader but it wasn't a big deal. There wasn't any ideology or shit like that, it was just a beach resort for people who don't like beach resorts. One man begins drumming softly on the table with his hands. Another joins in, then another. Soon everyone is tapping out a rhythm, against the table or a bottle or a coconut shell, using their hands or a knife or chopsticks. This is intercut with the following scene to the point where the newcomers have joined in and it reaches a crescendo as the main dish -a massive complete swordfish, is served. EXT. ISLAND SCENES. DAY. Various characters are introduced in different locations; at work or at rest; speaking to Richard or (as if to him) to camera. First the three Swedes. RICHARD(V.O.) There was the Swedes: Christo, Sten, and Karl. CHRISTO We like fishing KARL Fishing. Yeah. STEN Yeah. CHRISTO And in the winter we like skiing. KARL Yeah. STEN Yeah. CHRISTO But in Thailand - there is no skiing. RICHARD (V.O.) Then there were the Yugoslavian girls. SONJA We are from Sarajevo. MIRJANA Our hearts are full of loss RICHARD I'm sorry. They start laughing at him SONJA It's alright. MIRJANA We tell everyone that. RICHARD (V.O.) There was the Weathergirl. WEATHERGIRL I feel a tightness in my pelvis; it's gonna rain. Heavy rain falls. RICHARD (V.O.) And yes, unfortunately, there was a man with a guitar. GUITARMAN (singing badly) "Come as you are, as you were, and as I want you to be" RICHARD(V.O.) The only person I didn't like was Sal's boyfriend, Bugs. He was one of those pricks who just won't shut up about all the great things they've seen and done, all of which are just that little bit better, bigger, more dangerous, more extreme, more remote, more unusual, more thi more that more fucking everything than anything you've ever done. BUGS We were in the dessert for three weeks. It's forty-eight in the shade and there's bugger all of that to speak of. We're on one and half liters a day; it's practically suicide. But every morning we'd look east and see the sunrise, and I'd thing, if I die today - it's worth it. RICHARD (V.O.) The local diet was pretty good and most evenings we'd smoke some dope. Most afternoons too, as a matter of fact, but I had a personal rule never to smoke before lunch, although as time went on I allowed myself a certain number of - special occasions". Richard smokes dope. INT. LONGHOUSE. DAY. The drumming reaches its crescendo and the swordfish is laid out. RICHARD (V.O.) This became our world. Pretty soon nothing else mattered anymore: family, friend, future achievements - who cares. Back home was just standing behind a counter all day wearing a stupid fucking hat saying, "how can I help you sir, eat in or take away?" All gone, all faded away. I settled in. I found my vocation. EXT. BEACH. DAY. Richard, Etienne, and Francoise are standing in waist-deep water. Each is holding a bamboo spear. Their hair is longer and their tans deeper than when they arrived. They are watching Christo who stands a short distance away, spear poised for the kill while he talks through the process. CHRISTO OK. Now you stand still. You wait. The fish come. You wait until the fish are still. They trust you. You wait. His speech is hypnotic, calming. His students take in the view. CHRISTO (continuing) And then- He suddenly throws the spear into the water. He lifts it out triumphant. CHRISTO (continuing) You kill A dying fish wriggles on the end of the spear. CHRISTO (continuing) Now, you try. Richard, Etienne and Francoise wade apart a little and into deeper water. They wait and look. EXT. UNDERWATER. DAY & EXT. SURFACE. DAY. Their feet and legs are visible. At first nothing is happening, then a few fish swim into view. Richard throws and misses. The other two throw and miss. CHRISTO No, no, no. Too fast. Slowly. They pause Richard throws. He hauls his spear from the water. RICHARD Yo! A decent sized fish wriggles on the end. CHRISTO You are a natural! They all congratulate him. Richard raises the spear aloft. RICHARD And I say unto you: I shall provide. EXT. CLEARING. DAY A bamboo spear, loaded with fish like a giant kebab, is carried across the clearing towards the cooking area wehre the chef and his helpers are at work. The spear is held by richard who smiles as he deposits the fish on the broad wooden chopping surface. RICHARD (V.O.) That's right, I had an aptitude, a hidden talent. All these years I'm good for nothing, turns out I'm a full-on old fashioned hunter fucking gatherer. INT. LONGHOUSE. DAY As Richard enters there are only a few people inside. He walks to the partitioned area and looks for a packet of cigarettes among his possessions. Opposite to him, Keaty is lying down, reading the Bible. KEATY Ah, the hunter gatherer returns. Satisfied with a good day's killing amongst the fruits of the sea? RICHARD That's me: a good day's killing. KEATY God has smiled on you. RICHARD He has? KEATY He has made you sharp of eye and swift of limb. In other words, you catch a lot of fish, you'll be very popular around here. RICHARD Great. KEATY Dont forget to thank Him, will you? RICHARD I'll try. KEATY He'd appreciate that. Anyway, first day's fishing, first day's catch, you lot are just about ready to join the community. RICHARD I thought we already had. KEATY Not yet baptized, my son, not yet baptized. EXT. CLEARING. NIGHT A blade burns in the fire. Keaty lifts the knife from the fire. The entire community is assembled, watching. He takes Etienne's wrist. RICHARD (V.O.) Every society must have its rituals. They're what binds you together, they tell you that you belong. Ours was simple. Last one to arrive tattoos the next. KEATY It hurts. OK? Etienne nods. Keaty swiftly cuts the simple symbol just below Etienne's shoulder and smears blue powder into the cut. Etienne winces. Keaty finishes and hands the knife to Etienne who heats the blade briefly in the fire before he turns to Francoise. He kisses her arm before he cuts. Francoise takes the knife. Richard offers his arm. She grips it tightly. She hesitates. He looks into her eyes. She cuts. He grimaces. She works on, holding his arm. INT. LONGHOUSE. NIGHT. A few candles still burn as people prepare to turn in for the night. Richard is lying in his sleeping area. He is watching Francoise. She is standing, visible only from the waist up above a partition. She is inspecting her tattoo. RICHARD (V.O.) All the excitement of arrival had given me something to think about, but it wasn't enough to displace my major preoccupation. You can go to the most beautiful place in the world, but the sunlight shall not bleach they passion, nor the tide wash away thy desire. A hand. Etienne's appears from below, beckoning her down. She takes the hand. Just for a moment her eyes meet Richard's and then she lowers herself towards the ground, disappearing from view. The last candle is extinguished. EXT. BEACH. DAY. A game of soccer is in progress, involving most of the population, men and woman. Etienne is playing well. A few people, not involved in the game, are scattered along the beach, relaxing. Amongst these are Francoise and Richard, who is watching the game. RICHARD He's good. FRANCOISE Who? RICHARD Etienne. He's good at soccer. FRANCOISE Oh, I wouldn't know. RICHARD You don't like soccer? FRANCOISE No. It's so boring. RICHARD Yea, but he is good. Look. Nearly scored. FRANCOISE Is that good or bad? RICHARD I think it's good. Not that I think there's anything good about being good at soccer. Anyone could do that. I could do it if I wanted to. I just don't want to. That's all. She sits up. FRANCOISE Richard. RICHARD Yes? FRANCOISE What are you talking about? RICHARD I don't know. Just conversation. FRANCOISE Do you have a girlfriend? RICHARD Here? FRANCOISE Anywhere RICHARD No. Why? FRANCOISE Just conversation. RICHARD I'm not jealous, if that's what you're thinking. FRANCOISE No, it's what you are thinking. You are far from home. You meet a girl. It's exciting, why not? You are attracted to her - it's in your eyes. Perhaps in hers as well. So you think something might happen; it's easy to believe, it's exciting. But she has a boyfriend so you are jealous. Don't worry. It's natural. Now I have seen enough football. Shall we swim? Richard is stunned. RICHARD So would I be wrong? FRANCOISE What? RICHARD If I thought something might happen - would I be wrong? She touches him. FRANCOISE Richard, how would I know? I don't know any more than you. She walks away. Richard watches her go. He turns to the football. Etienne scores. RICHARD (V.O.) And that's all it takes. Nothing more than a few words and the softest touch and your life is different, won't ever be the same again. Man dies, leaves you the mystery map to the secret island: happens every day. But you get a smile from someone you want: well that's special, that's worth the journey. INT. LONGHOUSE. NIGHT. Richard is sitting in his bed. He is watching Francoise in conversation with Keaty across the other side of the room. During Richards (V.O.) their conversation ends and Keaty walks away, leaving Francoise momentarily alone. Most of the population is present in the room. Sal is reading. RICHARD (V.O.) I would have liked to have continued our discussion, to thrash out the details of our forthcoming affair, but every time I had the chance to catch her alone, something always got in the way. Francoise is alone now. Richard is about to move across when the center of the room is occupied by commotion. At the heart of this are Bugs, and an Italian man, Gregorio. Bugs is holding a pair of pliers. Gregorio is in pain. Richard watches. BUGS I can deal with it! GREGORIO I don't want you to deal with it. BUGS It won't take a minute. GREGORIO No! Please, no! I must go to the mainland. Onlookers join in. VARIOUS No way/ You can't go to the mainland/ No, etc. GREGORIO Sal! Sal looks up for the first time. SAL Sorry, I wasn't really tuned in. You want to go to the mainland? To see a dentist, is that it? GREGORIO Yes. Sal is casual but firm. SAL No. It's out of the question. She returns to the book. With help from two or three other people, Bgs drags Gregorio to the floor and rips out the offending tooth with a pair of pliers. Gregorio screams. RICHARD (V.O.) I was sort of disturbed by this, but really only by the method, by the way that Bugs handled it. But the guy couldn't leave; I could see that. When you have something secret, everyone's got to take responsibility to keep it that way. Francoise has gone. EXT. BEACH. DAY A tropical lightening storm is in progress. At the edge of the beach, Christo, Richard, Sten, and Karl are standing under the ineffectual shelter of a palm tree, ecah holding their spear. A short distance away, under anotehr tree, sit Francoise and Etienne, hand in hand. They are all contemplating the sea and the sky. Christo has a swimming mask and a snorkel. RICHARD (V.O.) In any case, I was more concerned about the Francoise situation. After such a promising start, it just didn't seem to be reaching its natural conclusion. In truth it was beginning to annoy me; I mean what's the use of being in paradise if you can't have whatever you want. Correct me if I'm wrong, but isn't that the whole idea? CHRISTO The problem is seeing the fish. With the rain and the poor light, they are very difficult to catch. It could last for days. Sometimes when it rains, we get hungry. RICHARD Hey, Etienne, you going fishing? ETIENNE I don't know, maybe if - RICHARD Dont' worry. You just sit there. I'll go, OK? I'll go. You just sit there. He takes the mask and snorkel from Christo and marches down towards the sea. ETIENNE Good luck Richard looks back at them but says nothing. He pulls the mask on and resumes his march into the sea. EXT. LAGOON. DAY. AND UNDERWATER. DAY. Richard swims along near the sea-bed past rocks and coral but can see no fish. He surfaces and swims further out. He hears shouts from the shore. He turns and treads water. The shouts from his colleagues are indistinct, carried away by the wind and the rain. RICHARD (Shouting) I can't hear. He takes the mask off to clean the lens. RICHARD (Continuing) And you can't hear me. He puts the mask back on and turns away from the shore. He freezes. There is a shark's fin in the water, moving towards him. He looks around. The shore seems far away. He starts swimming frantically towards it. The shark closes in. Richard submerges and turns to face the shark. The shark approaches head on. It is about five feet long with the appropriate teeth. Richard is terrified, convinced he is about to die. The shark swoops towards him at speed. It stops, its teeth centimeters from his mask. It pauses then flicks its tail and swims past Richard. He is astonished. It circles him and approaches again, pausing just in front. Tentatively, Richard raises a hand. The shark does not react. Richard pats it gently on its snout. It swims around him again. Richard sees small fish swimming around him. He spears one and holds it out on the tip of his spear. The shark snatches it off and repeats its circle but does not threaten Richard. He smiles. As it approaches again, he holds the spear in both hands and lowers it by his side. The shark bobs in front of him, curious and friendly. Richard's arms begin their forward motion as his V.O. commences. RICHARD (V.O.) I ducked to one side, then to the other as it passed me. First on my left, then on my right. INT. LONGHOUSE. NIGHT. Grilled shark steaks have been passed around and eaten by all while Richard stands and relates his adventure. He cannot resist a glance at Francoise, who listens with rapt attention. RICHARD (V.O.) But it could see that I was getting tired, so I stood my ground as he swam in for his final attack. EXT. UNDERWATER. DAY. Continuing the shark scene. The shark is bobbin in front of him, practically wagging its tail. Richard is smiling. RICHARD (V.O.) And at that instant, it was either the shark or me. The shark knew it, I knew it. Richard's arms flex. The spear travels up. It stops. Richard grips the spear tightly as it shakes. Blood spurts out towards Richards' mask in pulses and the sea turns red around him. RICHARD (V.O.) Nothing personal, of course. It's the way of nature. But I swear that in the last flicker of its dying eyes there was a moment between us, when it said - INT. LONGHOUSE. NIGHT. Richard continues his story. RICHARD "Hey Richard - enjoy your dinner." There are cheers to the end of his story. Bugs waits until these die down. BUGS Strange thing, killing a shark, isn't it? RICHARD Just a big fish, Bugs. BUGS Just a big fish? Maybe. Maybe when it's still a baby and it hasn't really learned to kill yet, then maybe it's just a big fish. But when it's a great white angry mother with the taste of human blood on its tongue, well then it's a different story. Richard yawns noisily. Some people laugh. He notice Bugs scowling at him. RICHARD Sorry, Bugs. Is it just me or does this wet weather make everybody tired? Maybe we can hear your "very different" and I'm sure "very fascinating" story some other time. There is a flurry of exaggerated yawning, sniggering, extinguishing of candles and calls of "goodnight". Bugs does not laugh. He stares at Richard. Richard is smiling as he extinguishes the final candle. EXT. BEACH. DAY. A sunny day. A game of cricket, under the supervision of Keaty, is about to begin. KEATY Wicketkeeper. First slip. Second slip. Gully. Square leg. Long leg. Silly mid-off. Cover point. At low tide, two sets of cricket stumps have been set up on the beach some twenty yards apart. The stumps and bats have been roughly hewn. At one end, Sten stands with a bat, ready to defend his stumps. At the other end stands Keaty, who is umpiring. Behind them, the bowler warms up, holding a small rubber ball. Among the ten fielders are Etienne and Francoise. Richard, the second batsman, walks toward Keaty, practicing with an air of exuberance. KEATY (Continuing) We thank you Lord, for the twin pillars of civilization, Christianity and cricket, even when played by those of another faith., Amen. Ok, right arm over the wicket; first ball. The bowler runs up and bowls. Sten hits the ball and it is fielded for no run at leaisurly pace by Etienne. Keaty and Richard watch. KEATY (Continuing) You do realize that killing a defenseless shark won't make any difference. RICHARD Difference to what? KEATY You and Francoise, that's what. RICHARD Sorry Keaty, but I don't know what you're talking about. KEATY That is why you killed it, isn't it? Ducked one way then the other! All to impress her, I suppose. The second ball is bowled and fielded. KEATY (Continuing) But you haven't got a chance in hell. I'm not saying you won't get a quick fumble in her knickers down the back of the longhouse but in the long run. Third ball RICHARD I don't need to discuss this with you. KEATY No ball! RICHARD Also, you're wrong. Third ball re-bowled and hit well. KEATY Four runs! He turns back to Richard. KEATY (continuing) Richard, you are a novelty act. He is the main attraction. RICHARD Thank you for your opinion, Father. Fourth ball. KEATY I don't mean to bring you down. I just wouldn't want anyone to get hurt RICHARD If you don't shut up, you're the one that's going to get hurt. Silence KEATY One other thing. RICHARD What? KEATY He's better looking than you. RICHARD Thanks. Fifth ball bowled and hit. The batsmen both run, Richard and Sten exchanging places. Richard prepares to face the bowler KEATY Right arm over the wicket. One ball remaining. The ball is bowled. Richard hits it in the air. KEATY Catch it! Catch it! Etienne catches it. Keaty signals "out". Richard walks away from the wicket, past Keaty and the celebrating fielders, Francoise among them, who have gathered around Etienne. EXT. BEACH. DAY. Richard reaches the fringe of the beach where Sal is sitting alone, half watching the game. SAL Aren't you going to stay and watch the game? RICHARD No. As a matter of fact, I'm going to go for a long walk. SAL Don't forget about this evening. You wouldn't want to miss it. RICHARD Why? What happens this evening? Another obscure English sport with which to humiliate the Americans? SAL It's the anniversary, Richard. EXT. CLEARING. NIGHT. A pair of hands, Sten's, tap loud and fast on a small drum. The inhabitants are sitting in a group. They are all holding half coconut shells. Sonja walks along with a large clay bottle, filling each shell with a milky liquid. Sal is standing up. The drumming stops. SAL To the first six years. They all drink. Richard cringes at the unpleasant taste. Beside him, Etienne proudly gulps down the whole drink. Sonja refills the cups, pouring freely. SAL (continuing) And looking forward to the next one. They all drink again. Once again, Richard sips while Etienne empties his cup. RICHARD So who was actually the first here? SAL Well, technically, Daffy was the first person on the island. RICHARD So why did he leave? There is an immediate silence. SAL What? RICHARD Why did Daffy leave? What made him unhappy? The silence persists. RICHARD (continuing) Sorry. Have I broken a rule? SAL No, Richard, don't worry. Daffy left because he felt that in coming to paradise we had inevitably destroyed it. RICHARD Because you built a shelter. SAL He was a purist. MIRJANA He was crazy. There is a general murmur of agreement. RICHARD Must have been. The atmosphere is still slightly awkward. Guitarman breaks the silence by plunging into a rendition of a popular favorite. Sonja refills the cups. Once again, Etienne tilts back his head and drinks. INT. LONGHOUSE. NIGHT. The longhouse is empty. Outside a different, slower tune is being played. The door is kicked open. Richard struggles in, carrying Etienne draped over his shoulder. Francoise follows. Richard lets Etienne slide off onto his bed where he lies, inert and comatose. FRANCOISE Look at him. It's disgraceful to drink so much. RICHARD I think he just got carried away with the excitement of the occasion. FRANCOISE Don't make excuses for him. I'm so embarrassed. RICHARD (V.O.) Now, I thought, this si my moment. It's now or never. Now or never. Now or - RICHARD Francoise - FRANCOISE Richard, would you like to go tot the beach with me. RICHARD Yes! EXT BEACH. NIGHT. Richard and Francoise walk down the shore to the moonlit sea. Francoise wades in up to her thighs. Richard follows. FRANCOISE Do you like it here, Richard? RICHARD I love this island. FRANCOISE Do you think about home? RICHARD No. FRANCOISE Nor do I. Do you think that I ignore you? RICHARD Me? No. FRANCOISE It's because I am with Etienne. It's difficult to spend time with you. RICHARD I don't suppose there's any special reason that you should, spend time with me, that is. FRANCOISE Of course there is: I like you, a lot. RICHARD And have you mentioned this to Etienne. FRANCOISE No. It's our secret. They are very close now, looking into each others' eyes. Suddenly Francoise looks away. FRANCOISE (continuing) There! RICHARD What? FRANCOISE Look! The plankton. Shrimps. In the dark, when they are disturbed, they glow. She dives in. He follows. UNDERWATER. NIGHT. Their faces, close together, are illuminated by the phosphorescent plankton. EXT. BEACH. NIGHT. They surface, kissing passionately. EXT. CLEARING. DAY. Under a shelter in the cooking area, the Chef walks up to two sacks of rice and slashes them open. He picks out two clumps of green, rotten mush and holds them out towards Sal who stands nearby. EXT. CLEARING. DAY The inhabitants of the community are sprawled around the area, generally facing towards Sal who addresses them. Francoise is sitting with Etienne but turns to acknowledge Richard with a smile at some stage. SAL Alright, I've got some bad news. As some of you may have heard, a couple of sacks of rice have gone rotten. Now this is not a disaster - VARIOUS Oh, no. SAL Yes, that's right: I need a volunteer to go to Ko Pha Ngan with me to buy some rice. So please don't all volunteer at once. There are no volunteers. Everyone avoids Sal's eye. SAL (continuing) Keaty? KEATY I went two months ago. SAL And so did I. Anyone else? Still no volunteers. SAL (continuing) Richard? Richard has been scrutinizing Francoise's back. RICHARD What? SAL What about you? Will you come to Ko Pha Ngan with me? RICHARD Sure. Yea. I'll come with you. SAL Great. She smiles at him. INT. LONGHOUSE. DAY Richard is sitting on his mat with a pencil and a piece of paper. A line of people wait to pass him some crumpled baht and their order. Their recitals overlap. MAN 1 Toothbrush, toothpaste, sixty cigarettes, a new hat, some elastoplast, a pair of swimming trunks, four bars of chocolate and some razors. WOMAN 1 One hundred aspirin, one hundred paracetamol, six boxes of regular tampons, toothpaste, soap and some shampoo. MAN 2 Toothpaste, a ball of string, four double-A batteries, and twenty condoms. No, make it forty. WOMAN 2 Six bars of chocolate, moisturizer, four boxes of tampons, assorted sixes, two bars of soap and some toothpaste. MAN 3 One tin of beef curry. WOMAN 3 A newspaper, some boiled sweets, shampoo and conditioner, two hundred cigarettes, a pair of plastic sandals, small, a new swimsuit, size ten, bright but no flowers, a plain T-shirt, a jar of Vegemite and three cigarette lighters. The last to sit down opposite Richard is Bugs. He sits close, their knees almost touching. Richard is posed with his pen, ready to take note. RICHARD Anything I can do for you? Bugs smiles. His right arm whips out and he grabs Richard by the testicles. Richard buckles forward in pain. BUGS Yeah. When you get to Ko Pha Ngan, keep your hands to yourself and your dick in your pants. He releases Richard. Preplexed and in pain Richard watches Bugs walk away. INT. LONGHOUSE. NIGHT. Everyone is asleep. Track along past the sleeping forms to stop at Richard. The figure looking down at him is Sal. EXT. CLEARING. DAWN. Sal and Richard are walking away from the longhouse in the early morning light. Sal has a small parcel of cannabis wrapped up in a plastic bag. RICHARD Why are we leaving so early. SAL If you hang around, people take advantage of you, give you orders for all sorts of shit - clothes, condoms, Vegemite and God knows what else. RICHARD Right. SAL We go to Ko Pha Ngan, sell the dope, buy the rice, and come back. That's all. EXT. BEACH / Water. Day. Sal walks into the water and begins swimming out towards the cliff. Richard watches then dives into the water. EXT. LAGOON / CLIFFS. DAY. Sal waits for Richard as he catches up with her at the base of the cliffs inside the lagoon. RICHARD Over? SAL Under. RICHARD Anything I should know? SAL Don't breathe till you get to the other side. Sal submerges. Richard watches her disappear into an underwater tunnel into the rock. He takes a deep breath., UNDERWATER. DAY. Richard enters the tunnel, passing from the light into the dark. He enters near total darkness. Far ahead is a narrow point of dim light. He swims towards it. INT CAVE. DAY. Richard surfaces, breathing deeply. He is in a cave within the cliffs, from which a small entrance opens on to the sea beyond. Within the cave is a large flat rock and moored beside that is a small narrow boat with an outboard motor. The ceiling of the cave is high and opening into it is a chimney (which will be in use later). Additional light enters through this. As Richard surfaces, Sal is already in the boat. SAL Welcome to the garage. She pulls the start cord. The small engine's loud roar reverberates around the stone walls. EXT. SEA / CLIFFS. DAY. The small boat emerges from the cave on to the sea, Richard at the front and Sal at the helm. EXT. BEACH. NIGHT. By the light of the moon, they come to land on a deserted stretch of beach. Richard jumps into the shallows as Sal cuts the engine. Lights dance in the sky some distance away. Sal and Richard drag and shove the boat up the beach. The full moon shines brightly. The insistent beat of dance music is heard. RICHARD (V.O.) All the way I was sort of looking forward to the party, but when we actually got there - EXT. BEACH RESORT. NIGHT. The street is lined with bars each pumping out western music on its own sound system. Richard and Sal walk along the strip. They turn towards a bungalow complex. Sal is still carrying the parcel of dope. RICHARD (V.O.) - I couldn't be bothered. It all seemed kind of trashy and out of place. This was why we kept the secret. If these assholes ever found out about our island they'd take just one night to spoil it forever. EXT. BUNGALOWS RECEPTION. NIGHT. The reception area is covered by an awning. An old warped pool table stands in the center. Sal and the receptionist, SUMET, greet each other and speak in Thai. There are no subtitles but when they discus sthe number of rooms they indicate with their fingers: this is not seen by Richard. SAL Good evening. SUMET Good evening, how are you? SAL Very well, thank you. SUMET You brought something? SAL As always. Sal puts the parcel on the desk. Sumet weighs it in her hand. SUMET Good. SAL We'd like to stay one night. SUMET Two rooms? SAL One. Sumet looks at Richard. SUMET A good choice. Young and strong. She squeezes his arm and laughs. SAL She says she's got two rooms. No problem. RICHARD Great. INT. PHONE BOOTH. NIGHT. Richard is in one of a line of booths in an international call office/general tourist store. RICHARD I don't know. I just don't know. Maybe this year, maybe not. I like it here. Things are different out here. RICHARD (V.O.) I phoned home and discovered that I couldn't communicate. I realized that I was no longer the person they knew. RICHARD You don't understand. He hangs up. He steps out of the booth. On the other side of the store are racks of patterned shirts and hats. Richard walks across and stares just beyond them. He is looking in a mirror, at himself, tanned and weathere-beaten. INT.SUPERMARKET. NIGHT. Richard browses, selecting the items on his list, then spending time choosing soap, eventually opting for a brand marked "Genuine French Soap". RICHARD (V.O.) In fact the more I thought about it the more I realized that none of this world made any sense to me. I'd left it behind. We all had, and in its place we'd found somewhere special, and we were determined to keep it that way. He drops the "French" soap in his basket. EXT. BEACH. NIGHT. The music is far away now. Richard and Sal struggle along the deserted beach to their boat carrying a pallet laden with sacks of rice. They arrive and drop the pallet. RICHARD Now I understand why no one wants to come for the rice. INT/ EXT. BAR. NIGHT. The bar opens out to a street just back from the beach. It is busy. Sal and Richard stand at the bar with their drinks. SAL So how does it feel to be back in the world? RICHARD It's not like I remembered it. SAL It gets worse every time. A hand rests on Richard's shoulder, gently pushing him aside to create space at the bar. It is Zeph. ZEPH Excuse me, please. He does not see Richard's face but concentrates on the barman. Richard recognizes him and conceals his face. ZEPH (continuing) Excuse me! Four beers please. Heinneken. The barman serves him. Sammy and two German girls stand behind Zeph. He passes the drink back to them and turns to speak. Richard and Sal listen in. ZEPH (Continuing) OK, where was I? SAMMY The beach. ZEPH Right, the beach: it's on this secret island, in the middle of the national park where no one is allowed to go. It's paradise. GIRL 1 Sounds cool. ZEPH What's even better is we got the map of how to get there. GIRL 1 Can we see it? SAMMY Sure. Let's go back to our place. We can smoke some dope, drink some beer, loosen off these tight clothes we're wearing, then check out the map. ZEPH But hey it's secret - if we show you the map, you have to come with us. They laugh. Zeph and Sammy high-five each other. ZEPH (continuing) Back in a minute. Just going to conduct a recon of the local sanitation facility. Richard watches him leave the bar. EXT. TOILET. NIGHT. The toilet is a narrow concrete passage with a ditch along the bottom on one side. There is no roof but a single light above. Zeph is just finishing as he notices Richard. ZEPH Hey, Richard! I hardly fucking recognize you. Where have you been? The beach? Tell me - it's paradise. RICHARD There is no beach. ZEPH What? RICHARD The map is wrong. ZEPH You've been? RICHARD No. it's dangerous. ZEPH Danger - hey, you're calling my middle name. What kind of danger? RICHARD Doesn't matter. ZEPH I think you're trying to put me off. RICHARD I'm just telling you, for your own good: stay away. Don't go. Don't even try. Just forget it. ZEPH We'll do whatever we want. He goes to leave. Richard places a hand on his chest. They stop for a moment. Zeph pushes the hand away. ZEPH (continuing) Fuck you. Zeph walks past then turns back. ZEPH (continuing) Stay away from the mushrooms, Richard, they make you paranoid. EXT. BECH / STEPS. NIGHT. Richard and Sal are climbing the steps towards the bungalow reception. SAL That idiot Daffy? What was he doing - handing out Xerox copies to every asshole in Thailand? RICHARD Yeah, it's unbelievable. SAL Why? That's all I want to know. Why? RICHARD I don't know, Sal. SAL Pardon me for this, but thank Christ he's dead. EXT. BUNGALOWS RECEPTION. NIGHT. Richard and Sal enter from the steps. Behind them the party is still in progress. Sal approaches the desk while Richard hangs back. She greets Sumet who hands over one key. SAL Bad news. RICHARD What? SAL She gave away your room. She thought we were - you know - together. Sorry. RICHARD Right. Great. Well I'll go find somewhere else then. I'll meet you back here in the morning. SAL Richard. She shows him the key for the room. They look at each other. SAL (continuing) I'm going to play a couple of games of pool with Sumet. She throws the key. He catches. SAL (continuing) Why don't you go warm the bed? INT. BUNGALOW. NIGHT. The room is in darkness. Moonlight penetrates the threadbare curtain. The bed is surrounded by a mosquito net. The music from the beach party is audible. Just visible through the net is the outline of two human forms entwined. EXT. BUNGALOW. NIGHT. Lizards scuttle across the small porch. INT. BED. NIGHT. Surrounded by a wall of mosquito net, Richard and Sal lie on the bed. Sal lies on her side falling asleep. Richard is awake. RICHARD Sal. SAL Uh-huh. RICHARD Can I ask you a question? SAL It was great. RICHARD No, it's not that. I just wondered about Bugs. And me. Sal rouses herself. SAL OK, it's like this. Bugs is my boyfriend, my partner, and you, you're someone I just screwed. Is that ok? She turns on her side again. RICHARD That's fine. That's absolutely fine. SAL Good, now get some sleep - I may wish to have sex again before we eat breakfast. EXT. BEACH. DAY. Richard and Sal push the boat into the water and away from the beach, jumping on board as they do so. EXT. SEA/CLIFFS. DAY. Richard and Sal approach the outer cliffs of the sea-wall in the boat. Richard looks up. Bugs is standing at the top of the cliff, directly above the cave. INT CAVE. DAY. The sacks of rice are now contained in a net being hauled upwards on a rope towards and into the chimney which rises out of the ceiling. Sal swims away into the tunnel. EXT. CLIFF TOP. DAY. Bugs and Keaty haul the rice up with the aid of a block and tackle. INT. CAVE. DAY. Richard is alone as he looks up the chimney and watches the cargo disappear the last few feet to the top of the cliff. As it reaches the top it is swung aside and Bugs looks down. Richard and Bugs stare at each other down the length of the chimney. Richard casually clutches his groin and thrusts once. RICHARD (V.O.) Screwing Sal was pretty good but screwing Bugs - that was even better. INT. LONGHOUSE. NIGHT. The longhouse is full of inhabitants. Richard walks the length of the hut like Santa Claus despensing toiletries and other gifts as requested. He reaches Francoise alone at the end of the hut. He gives her the "French" soap. RICHARD For you. FRANCOISE I missed you. RICHARD I'm back. FRANCOISE What was it like? RICHARD The rice run? No problem. FARNCOISE I mean being with Sal? RICHARD Ohfine. Listen, do you want to go to the beach? FRANCOISE I can't. Meet me tomorrow morning. Ten o'clock at the waterfall. She touches him as she walks away. RICHARD (V.O.) I didnt' feel as bad as I should have about all this. In fact I didn't really feel bad at all. What happened on Ko Pha Ngan was different, it didn't count. EXT. FOREST/WATERFALL. DAY. Richard is on his way to the waterfall. RICHARD (V.O.) And I was glad to be back. Now I really did understand why no one wanted to go for the rice. Life here was so good that going back to the world we came from could only bring you down. He reaches the area by the waterfall and stands waiting. He looks around for Francoise: no sign. He checks his watch: a few minutes to ten. SAL (O.S.) Hi there, Richard. Richard turns to see Sal, who has appeared as though from nowhere. RICHARD Oh, Sal. Hi. SAL Hi? Is that all you can say? I thought we had a little more rapport than that. RICHARD I mean, hello, nice to see you. What brings you here. SAL I was looking for you. RICHARD Oh. Well, here I am. SAL I have to go somewhere. I'd like you to accompany me. Richard checks his watch. RICHARD Right now? It's not really all that convenient, Sal. SAL I'm sorry. Are you meeting someone? RICHARD Me? No. SAL You sure? RICHARD Yes. SAL Good. So, you can come with me.   (Unfortunately the copy of the script is now missing a page.)   SAL If they reach the island, I want you to discourage them from getting any further. RICHARD "Discourage." SAL You'll think of something, Richard. I trust you. Sal kisses him on the cheak and leaves. Richard watches her go. RICHARD Sal! How long do I - Sal! She does not turn around. Richard turns back towards the other island. He focuses the binoculars. EXT. BEACH. DAY. The empty beach on the other island. EXT. HILLTOP. DAY. Richard is not pleased. EXT. BEACH. NIGHT. Richard and Francoise are sitting in the shadows. RICHARD She didn't tell me how long I was supposed to wait or anything. You know what she's like, she just gets you to do things. FRANCOISE What kind of things? RICHARD Just things, you know. FRANCOISE No, I don't. RICHARD Hey, what's wrong - I'm sorry I wasn't there today. Is that it? FRANCOISE I think Sal is attracted to you. RICHARD No, I don't think so. FRANCOISE On Ko Pha Ngan, did anything happen? RICHARD Happen? No, nothing. FRANCOISE You promise. RICHARD I promise. FRANCOISE Good. They kiss. RICHARD (V.O.) Ok, so I lied. It just wasn't the right time. EXT. HILLTOP. DAY. Richard sits at the lookout. RICHARD (V.O.) And the next day, we couldn't meet up either. It was straight back up. Same scene again: no travelers, no boat, no action, nothing. Now I thought if this is going to be a regulra situation, I'm going to have to start hiding from Sal so I don't have to come up here. But a strange thing happened: I began to enjoy it. I looked forward to it, I started to explore. EXT. HILL. DAY. From a vantage point, Richard looks down on the lagoon, the beach, the forest, and the clearing. With the binoculars he can see the details of life in each of these areas. EXT. ISLAND SCENES. DAY. Through the binoculars, various characters are at work or at rest including Francoise, Etienne, Sal, Bugs, Keaty, etc. RICHARD (V.O.) And then I couldn't understand why I'd never come up before. I got a whole new perspective. They were ants, or rats in an experiment, but up here I wasn't part of it, I was free. I could do whatever I wanted. This was my personal adventure playground. There was even a bunch of local bad guys I could fool around with. EXT. FOREST NEAR DOPE FIELD. DAY. Looking through the trees, the four dope farmers (with their guns) are visible about thirty meters away, relaxing and playing cards. Richard appears in a tree, hiding from their view, if they cared to look. He steals forward to another tree. He watches them. RICHARD (V.O.) Pretty soon, I was starring in my very own war movie. It was Vietnam 1968, or at least about as close to it as I would ever get, considering I was born in 1973. But I knew exactly who I was: renegade special forces officer on a solo mission, search and destroy. I liked the sound of it "he prefers to work alone," they'd say, "he's got the stare." The farmers are oblivious. Richard advances as far as he dare: a few meters from them. He peers at them around the edge of the tree. He notices that the one nearest has left a knife on the ground. Richard lifts a stone and throws it high in the air beyond the farmers. As it falls through the trees to the forest floor the farmers are startled. They stand and turn away towards the noise reaching for their guns, cocking them, etc. The knife is taken by Richard. The farmers see a bird fly from a tree. Satisfied, they give up and return to their resting place. Richard steals away from tree to tree. The farmer cannot understand where his knife has gone. EXT. FOREST. DAY Richard sits in a hollow under a rough shelter he as made from palm leaves. He is using the knife to gut a bird of some sort which he then eats raw. RICHARD (V.O.) I hadn't entirely forgotten my purpose up here, but I wasn't worried about it. I mean I didn't want one of those bastards turning up with my map sticking out of his pocket, but if they did, it was going to be a challenge. It was a mission, my mission, to defend our island. EXT. HILLTOP. DAY. Richard watches the empty beach. RICHARD (V.O.) The only hitch was - the enemy didn't show up. Now it was probably a mistake, but I one day I brought Francoise up. I thought I'd show her around. EXT. FOREST. DAY Richard struggles through dense undergrowth, followed by Francoise. RICHARD Come on, just through here. Watch out for the thorns. Here: look. Beneath a tree, a few rotting logs are topped off with palm leaves. RICHARD (continuing) Well, what do you think? FRANCOISE What is it? RICHARD It's a shelter. I built it. I thought we could move up here. Get away from it all. FRANCOISE We? RICHARD Yeah. You'll need to tell Etienne, of course but - FRANCOISE Richard, it's horrible. RICHARD Primitive, yes, but you have to accept some limitation when you go for seclusion like this. FRANCOISE And to eat? RICHARD Whatever I kill, we'll eat. Francoise laughs. FRANCOISE Enjoy yourself, Richard. I'll see you later, back in civilizatin. RICHARD Do you want a mushroom? FRANCOISE What? RICHARD They grow here, all over the place. I picked some. Here. Richard collects a handful from under the shelter. Francoise does not think this is funny. FRANCOISE No thanks. RICHARD Please yourself. He swallows one. Francoise turns away. She struggles back through the undergrowth. Richard watches her. He swallows a handful of mushrooms. EXT. FOREST. DAY. Close up: a caterpillar crawls along a green leaf. Richard, his pupils dilated, is watching, transfixed. He holds the knife at the end of the leaf. The caterpillar crawls on to the blade. Richard sticks his tongue out and swivels the blade around. The caterpillar crawls on to his tongue. Richard gently closes his mouth. He swallows. RICHARD (V.O.) When you're a highly trained combat machine, you can't allow yourself to be distracted by minor problems in your personal life. And you can't sit around, you have to stay active, otherwise your energy will dissipate. You have to feed the fear. EXT. FOREST. NIGHT/DAWN. Richard, his face disrupted by mud, sneaks towards the rough shelter of wooden planks and palm leaves under which the four farmers are sleeping. INT. EXT. SHELTER. NIGHT/DAWN. The shelter is several meters long but shallow and is open down the length of one side. This is the farmers' home on the island. It contains a collection of tools, arms, crates, bedding, food, cigarettes, and bottles of cheap whiskey. Spaced out within the shelter, the four farmers are asleep on low pallets or mats on the ground, each with their gun by their side. Richard enters the shelter and surveys the scene. He approaches the nearest farmer who lies asleep. He is wearing a bandana which has slipped half off in his sleep. Very slowly, Richard reaches down and lifts the farmer's gun, a Kalashnikov-type assult rifle. Richard holds the weapon, becoming comfortable with it. He lifts the butt to his shoulder and squints down the sight. He closes in on the farmer, so close that the muzzle is almost tickling the farmer's nose. In his sleep, the farmer swats at his nose as he might swat at a fly. Richard withdraws the gun a fraction. His finger strokes the trigger. He moves very carefully around the shelter, pointing the gun at each sleeping farmer and mouthing "bang" as he goes. He returns to the first farmer and kneels beside him. The farmer is on his side, facing away from Richard. He stirs in his sleep and wakes slightly. He reaches out behind him to feel for his gun. His hand feels the metal. He relaxes and closes his eyes again. Behind him, Richard smiles and releases his own grip on the gun. Instead he lifts the bandana away from the farmer's head and puts it on his own. Now he produces the knife from the back of his shorts. He kneels beside the farmer and holds the knife firmly. Abruptly he stabs it into the upright wooden plank behind the farmer's head. The blade sinks deep into the wood. EXT. WATERFALL. DAY. Richard screams as he executes an exhibition dive from the top of the waterfall to the pool below. EXT. BEACH. DAY. There is no one on the beach apart from Richard. He walks to the water and dives in. He surfaces and faces the sun. RICHARD (V.O.) I was ecstatic. In a fair contest I had infiltrated their command and left my mark. I had fulfilled my potential as a warrior, a soldier, a killer on the loose. I could just imagine them trying to work how the missing knife got home. Christo, Sten, and Karl appear walking down the beach with their fishing gear as Richard walks in from the water. RICHARD Hi, guys. CHRISTO Hello Richard. RICHARD (V.O.) I couldn't wait to tell Francoise about it. EXT. FOREST. DAY. Richard's face is slapped twice by Francoise's hand. They are standing in a small clearing not far from the longhouse. Francoise raises her hand to slap him again. He retreats a fraction. RICHARD Do you want to calm down? I'm trying to tell you about something exciting. I'm trying to share it with you and all you can do is freak out because you don't like where I want to live. FRANCOISE I don't care about that. RICHARD No? Still pissed about the mushrooms. You know Francoise, sometimes you are so uptight. FRANCOISE You liked to me. About Sal. RICHARD Oh, that. She told you? FRANCOISE She told everyone. She believes in openness and honesty, not like you. RICHARD Come on, you were two-timing Etienne. FRANCOISE Because I liked you. I didn't know you were going to screw Sal twenty-four hours later. RICHARD Well if you're going to make such a big deal out of it - FRANCOISE Bugs is going to kill you. And you know what - I don't care. She raises her hand and slaps him again. Richard does not flinch. INT. LONGHOUSE. DAY. Richard enters the longhouse. Inside are several people, including Bugs, sitting at the far end. When they see that it is Richard, all conversation stops. One by one at first, then en masse, everyone except Bugs leaves the longhouse, hurrying past Richard at the door. Richard and Bugs stare at each other down the length of the longhouse. Richard smiles. He repeats the gesture that he made when returning with the rice: he clutches his groin and thrusts towards Bugs. Bugs starts running towards Richard. Just as Bugs reaches him he takes evasive action, feinting to one side. Bugs, cursing, pursues Richard around the longhouse, each of them trampling over possessions and partitions. Bugs is bigger but Richard is too sly and nimble for him, taunting and mocking as he dodges around the narrow upright supports that run down the middle of the building. Eventually Bugs has Richard cornered. They face each other, crouched slightly, breathing heavily. From outside a loud, horrified screaming begins. It carries on and on. RICHARD Don't you think we ought to go see what the problem is? Bugs pauses for a moment. He glances towards the door for a fraction of a second. Richard slugs him in the jaw. EXT. CLEARING. DAY. Richard emerges from the longhouse, flexing the fingers of his punching hand. A crowd has gathered as he joins it. At the center are Karl, on his knees, wailing and shouting in Swedish, and Sten, who has been savaged by a shark and looks dead. Despite his appearance, Keaty and Gregorio are attempting to resuscitate him. RICHARD (V.O.) Poor Karl: he didn't speak much English, but he only needed one word. KARL Shark! Shark! RICHARD (V.O.) They were trying to save Sten's life although even as a novice in this field I could tell that just wasn't going to happen. Richard backs away. EXT. BEACH. DAY. Richard walks along the shore and begins to follow a bloodstained furrow in the sand. RICHARD (V.O.) The way I saw it, sharks live in the sea, so if you go swimming where they live, they might eat you. That's what sharks are good at, that's what they do. I could have explained this to Christo but I just knew he wouldn't see it. Richard is standing over Christo who is lying in agony on the sand. CHRISTO Richard! My foot. My foot! It's so painful. My foot! Richard looks at Christo's right leg: it has been bitten off beneath the knee, leaving only a ragged bloody stump. RICHARD Yeah, your foot - it's - pretty bad. Christo clings to him. CHRISTO But it will be ok? Please Richard, when I get to the hospital? RICHARD Hospital? CHRISTO Tell me - it will be ok. RICHARD Yeah. Sure. Christo, it'll be ok. EXT. GRAVE STIE. DAY. A freshly dug grave in sandy soil about 1.5 meters deep. The corpse (Sten) in a sleeping bag is slung into the grave, its feet protruding from the end. Immediately, the earth starts to be filled in from either side. KEATY (O.S.) We are gathered here today to pay our last respects to Sten. I couldn't claim to know the bloke all that well but what I knew, I liked. He was a straightforward, easy to get along with, reliable sort of guy. He worked hard for the whole community - he even lost his life fishing for us. Keaty is addressing the entire community beside the grave while earth is heaped on. KEATY He made an effort to join in whatever was going on. For example, he played cricket with an aptitude and enthusiasm that belied his Nordic origins, and I think we can see that as a symbolic ofhis place amongst us in a wider sense. Anyway, he wasn't one for long speeches, and neither am I. May God take you soul, and you shall rest forever in peace mate. We'll miss you. Keaty holds back a tear as he throws a flower in the grave. Others throw flowers in. Bugs hammers a wooden cross into the ground behind the grave. INT. LONGHOUSE. DAY. Christo is being nursed by Etienne who is mopping his brow, trying to get him to drink etc. Several people are sitting around, inactive and silent. Christo moans. A couple of people get up and leave. RICHARD (V.O.) After the funeral we all tried to get back to normal, but it just didn't seem right. After a while it became clear that the problem was Christo. You see, in a shark attack, or any other major tragedy I guess, the important thing is to get eaten and die, in which case there's a funeral and someone makes a speech and everyone cries and says what a good guy you were, or: get better in which case everyone can forget about it. It's the hanging around in between that really pisses people off. EXT. FOREST. DAY. Etienne is backing through the forest. Outraged. ETIENNE This is disgusting! You cannot do this! Take him back! A party of stretcher bearers, including Bugs, Sal, and Keaty, carry Christo through the forest. Sal is carrying a small rolled up tent. Richard walks behind. SAL Ok, that's far enough. They lower Christo to the ground. ETIENNE Take him back, you fucking animals! Sal drops the tent at Etienne's feet. The part walks away apart from Richard ETIENNE (continuing) Fucking bastards! INT. SMALL TENT. DAY. Christo, delirious, is being nursed by Etienne in the small tent, now situated in the middle of the forest. Richard is with him. RICHARD It's not that they don't care, Etienne, it's just that they don't care in the same way as you do. It's a fine distinction, I know. ETIENNE I understand: they wish he was dead. RICHARD No! they've be equally happy if he recovered. They just want an outcome. ETIENNE He needs a doctor. RICHARD You worked in a hospital. ETIENNE For one month, as a cleaner, a domestic. RICHARD Well that's one month longer than anyone else around here. Look, you're doing your best for the guy. No one could ask for more. Everyone apprecaites that. ETIENNE Look, Richard! Etienne draws back the sheet covering Christo's discolored stump. Richard recoils. RICHARD Jesus! ETIENNE It's gangrene. It's spreading. He needs an amputation. Etienne produces a knife from his possessions. RICHARD You're going to do it here? ETIENNE Where else? RICHARD OK! I'll hold him still. Etienne prepares to proceed, but at the last moment he cannot. He drops the knife Richard relaxes. EXT. BEACH. DAY. People are playing and relaxing on the beach and in the water, shouting and swimming. RICHARD (V.O.) It would be a lot easier to condemn our behavior if it hadn't been so effective, but out of sight really was out of mind. The bad smell was gone - it was like we had amputated Christo from our community and after the operation was over, we felt a whole lot better. UNDERWATER. DAY. In water one meter deep, moving forward with a smooth side-to-side action, the POV of some underwater creature. Small fish scatter ahead of it. Suddenly a pair of legs come into view: they are Francoise'. Close right in on them at speed. EXT. SEA. DAY. Francoise screams as Richard surfaces beside her, laughing. FRANCOISE Richard! RICHARD Just when you thought it was safe to go back in the water. FRANCOISE That's not funny. RICHARD Hey, relax, just a joke. What's wrong with you? FRANCOISE No, what's wrong with you? Why didn't you stop them moving Christo? RICHARD Francoise I just thought we ought to spend some time together. We haven't had a chance to talk, and let's face it, it's going to be a lot easier for us to do that if Etienne isn't hanging around the longhouse. FRANCOISE I don't believe it. You really think it was alright to move him. RICHARD He was getting everyone down. FRANCOISE I don't know what has happened to you, Richard. RICHARD I like it here! That's what happened! So what's the problem? Francoise turns and walks away. Richard calls after her sarcastically. RICHARD (continuing) We do still have something going don't we? She does not reply. RICHARD (V.O.) So, it seemed that Francoise and I were finished. Under other circumstances I might have got depressed about a think like that, but I had something else to occupy my mind. EXT. BEACH. DAY. Seen through binoculars, Zeph walks along the beach on the other island. He is carrying a large piece of driftwood. He turns away from the water and walks up the beach towards the line of palm trees. There he joins Sammy and the two German girls who are constructing something from driftwood and polystryrene floats. EXT. CLEARING. NIGHT. Richard is sitting with Sal. RICHARD They're building a raft. It's nearly finished. SAL When did they get there? RICHARD I don't know. Sometime during all that shark shit. SAL Well you'll have to stop them. RICHARD They won't get beyond the DMZ. SAL The what? RICHARD The demilitarized zone, Sal. SAL Right. You call it what you want, Richard, just don't let them get this far. RICHARD They won't. Believe me. SAL This is a particularly bad time, with Christo lying in that tent, it wouldn't look good if anyone arrived. RICHARD He's still alive? EXT. FOREST. DAWN. In the small tent, a torch glows, outlining Etienne and Francoise over the prone form of Christo. Francoise emerges from the tent. Richard watches. EXT. FOREST. DAWN On the upper part of the island Richard ascends rapidly beside the stream. EXT. HILLTOP. DAWN. Richard surveys the beach on the other island. EXT. BEACH. DAWN. Through binoculars. Zeph, Sammy, and the German girls launch their raft. It floats. They climb on and begin paddling. EXT. FOREST NEAR DOPE FIELD. DAY. Richard flits thorough the trees until he can see the shore. EXT. BEACH. DAY. The travelers on their raft come ashore. They consult their map then move into the forest. EXT. FOREST NEAR DOPE FIELD. DAY. Richard watches them as they ascend the slope to the dope field. In the other direction, hidden from the travelers perspective, he notices the four farmers sitting at their shelter eating breakfast. EXT. FIELD. DAY. The travelers, watched by Richard, reach the top of the slope and then the edge of the field. The farmers are nearby. RICHARD (V.O.) If I was going to warn them, then now was the time to do it. All I had to do was walk out and tell them not to make any noise I could lead them to safety. I could persuade them to go. I could threaten them. If the worst came to the worst, I could lead them to the camp and we could kick the shit out of them, then send them home. But I didn't want to do any of those things. I wanted to see what would happen. Zeph, Sammy, and the German girls are jubilant. SAMMY We are in dope heaven. There is no other explanation. ZEPH (singing) I smoke two joints in the morning. I smoke two joints at night. I smoke two joints in the afternoon and then I feel alright. I smoke two joints in time of peace and two in time of war. I smoke two joints before I smoke two joints and then - Zeph stops singing. He has seen the farmers, armed and watching him from a few meters away. Sammy and the others also notice, one by one. They too stand still, dumb and frightened. ZEPH Hi. SAMMY Shit. ZEPH We're Americans. Tourists. But we will leave. We made a mistake. We go now. We take nothing. Slowly, he begins to walk backwards, smiling reassuringly. The farmers say nothing but advance and outflank the travelers, herding them back into a huddle. ZEPH (continuing) We go now. We leave in peace. Look we can pay. Here, American dollars. You can have them. The farmers line up opposite them. All begin to plead desperately for their lives. One of the German girls suddenly breaks away and starts running in the direction of Richard's hiding place. One of the guards shoots at her repeatedly, missing. The others start shooting at the remaining three, cutting them down in a hail of bullets. The German girl keeps on running, zigzagging as she goes. The farmers fire but miss. She reaches the place where Richard is hiding, couched down in the undergrowth. Startled by seeing him, she stops abruptly. Richard and the German girl stare into each other's eyes for a moment. Suddenly her chest explodes forwards as a single bullet rips through from her back. She falls to the ground. Richard is spattered in her blood. He sits motionless, staring at her corpse. UNDERWATER. DAY. In the pool at the base of the waterfall. It is empty. Richard appears, submerging at the speed from his jump. He sinks then floats slowly towards the surface, eyes open. EXT. POOL. DAY. Richard climbs from the pool. RICHARD (V.O.) So that was it. Now I knew exactly what would happen. I wouldn't need to wonder aobut it any longer. EXT. CLEARING. NIGHT. Richard walks across the deserted clearing towards the light of the longhouse. Around him, a wind begins to blow. INT. LOONGHOUSE. NIGHT. The longhouse is full. Everyone is there, apart from Etienne and Francoise, engaged in quiet conversation. Richard is hardly noticed as he sits down. A few seconds later, Sal sits opposite him. She is absolutely matter of fact. SAL Well? RICHARD They're dead. SAL All of them? RICHARD Yes, all of them. They disturbed the farmers. SAL Right. RICHARD I guess that means we don't need to worry about them any more. SAL Yeah. The only problem we have left is Francoise and Etienne. Richard realizes what she means. RICHARD You knew they'd be killed. SAL It's not the first time. RICHARD And Daffy? SAL What? RICHARD Daffy. He saw it happen. Didn't he? Yea, he saw it happen. And now you wanted me to see it happen. SAL Richard, if you're going to live here, you've got to get involved. Richard's knife (the stolen one) is lying beside him. Sal picks it up by the tip of the blade. SAL (continuing) Francoise. And Etienne. She slaps the knife into Richard's hand. She stands up and walks away. Richard contemplates the knife. EXT. CLEARING. NIGHT. A storm is building up, scattering anything loose across the clearing. INT. LONGHOUSE. NIGHT. Most of the lights are out now. The wind is beginning to rattle the building. Richard lies awake. RICHARD (V.O.) I wasn't thinking about what she asked me to do. INT. HOTEL CORRIDOR. DAY. Richard and Daffy shake hands. RICHARD (V.O.) I was trying to remember somewhere I used to call home, someone I used to be, but I couldn't put a name to that place or a face to that person anymore - they got left behind in a hotel room in the Khao San Road along with a man who cut his wrists. INT. DAFFY'S ROOM. DAY. Richard steps carefully across the floor, avoiding the pools of blood. RICHARD (V.O.) But at least I understood why he'd done it. EXT. CLEARING. NIGHT. It is pouring rain and the storm grows stronger. Richard appears alone in the clearing, the knife in his hadn. Thunder and lightening begin. RICHARD (V.O.) I still didn't know what I was going to do when I got to them. You see, when you have blood on your hands, you ask yourself, what difference will it make if you spill some more? I had made a sacrifice to keep the secret, and now that sacrifice was the secret. EXT. FOREST. NIGHT. Richard approaches the faint glow of the small tent where Francoise is nursing christo. He is carrying the knife. He crawls close up to the tent. Etienne is sleeping in the open doorway. INT. LONGHOUSE NIGHT. Inside there is darkness while all are sleeping. The thunder is directly overhead and the lightening flashes frequently. Sonja stirs in her sleep. In a flash of lightening she thinks she sees something. A whole series of flashes provide a clearer view. At the end of her bed four corpses, Zeph, Sammy, and the two German girls, hang upside down and bound together from the central beam in the roof of the building. Zeph appears to be staring at her, his hair trailing against her feet. She screams. More lightening illuminates the four armed Farmers. EXT. FOREST. NIGHT. Richard crawls towards the sleeping Etienne. Inside the tent, Francoise has her back to the entrance as she mops the brow of Christo, feverish and unconscious. INT. LONGHOUSE. NIGHT. The farmers have torches now. One of them is interrogating Sal angrily in Thai while the other inhabitants cower at gunpoint. FARMER You draw maps! You bring people here! Why? SAL No, we don't. We bring no one. FARMER You are lying! You are bringing people here. Too many people! He hits her with the rifle butt. SAL No, I promise, we keep it secret. We tell no one. He hits her again. FARMER Then who drew this? He holds out the map drawn by Richard. EXT. FOREST. NIGHT. Richard draws closer to Etienne. He reaches him, the knife poised in his hand. INT. LONGHOUSE. NIGHT. The four bodies hang from the roof. The farmers have gone. Sal lies injured on the floor. The inhabitants silently pass the map from one to the other. It reaches Bugs last. He studies it. EXT. FOREST. NIGHT. Richard's bald is at Etienne's throat. He opens his eyes, frozen with fear. Richard is aware of a gaze from another direction. Keeping the knife at Etienne's throat, he turns to see that Francoise is looking at him. They stare at each other. Richard takes the knife away. RICHARD You have to leave. Do you understand? You have to leave right now. If you don't they'll kill you. ETIENNE What about Christo? RICHARD There is nothing more you can do. I'll look after him. FRANCOISE Richard - RICHARD You don't have time to talk about this. You have to go now. Christo moans. Etienne looks at him. RICHARD (continuing) Leave him with me. Etienne understands. He and Richard stare at each other. EXT. FOREST. NIGHT. Bugs runs through the forest, away from the lights of the clearing. EXT. FOREST. NIGHT. Francoise and Etienne flee through the forest towards the beach. INT. SMALL TENT. NIGHT. Richard studies Christo, illuminated by a torch. His breathing is labored and irregular. Richard reaches forward. He pinches Christo's nose and covers his mouth. Christo's body struggles briefly and goes still. Richard relaxes his grip. He switches off the torch. EXT. LAGOON. NIGHT. Richard swims out from the beach. EXT. LAGOON/CLIFFS. NIGHT. Richard swims out towards the cliff. He reaches the cliff and pauses, taking a deep breath before submerging towards the underwater tunnel. INT. CAVE. NIGHT. Moonlight reflects in through the chimney and the entrance. Etienne and Francoise are in the boat. Etienne is trying to start the boat. He sees the silhouette of a man surface and crawl onto the flat rock. Etienne steps off the boat onto the rock as the figure in the shadows approaches him. ETIENNE Richard, come one, get into the boat. The man pulls Etienne forward and stabs him deep into his abdomen. ETIENNE (continuing) Richard! It is Bugs. BUGS Richard can't help you now, French boy. Francoise screams. Bugs releases Etienne who falls helpless to his knees. Bugs turns his attention to Francoise. She pulls the start cord and the engine starts. Bugs holds one end of the mooring rope, pulling the boat towards him while Francoise tries to undo the other end. RICHARD (O.S.) Hey, Bugs! Richard stands on the rock. Bugs turns towards him. He drops the rope and walks a couple of paces, then rushes him. Richard manages to avoid the blade. They fight. Bugs forces Richard on to the ground He is about to stab Richard. Etienne appears behind Bugs, struggling on his feet, bleeding from his wound. He is holding a piece of rope. He slings it around Bug's neck. Etienne's eyes roll and his head lolls. He falls back into the water, pulling Bugs with him. UNDERWATER. NIGHT. Etienne and the struggling Bugs sink. Bugs cannot free himslf, becoming only more entangled. INT. CAVE. NIGHT Richard lies on the flat rock. Francoise is in the boat. She switches off the engine. UNDERWATER. NIGHT. Etienne and Bugs lie at rest on the sea bed. EXT. SEA. DAY. A calm sunny day. Richard and Francoise are on the boat, drifting. RICHARD (V.O.) That was the worst thing: I didn't even get to die. I had to live with myself. INT. HOTEL ROOM. DAY. In a typical Khao San Road hotel. The room is a mess. Richard disheveled and haggard is sitting at a small table, working with a pencil and a piece of paper. RICHARD (V.O.) I haven't seen her since and I don't suppose I ever will. I've been here six months now. EXT. CLEARING. DAY. The clearing is deserted and overgrown. The longhouse is derelict and overrun with creepers. EXT. ISLAND. DAY. From above in one rising shot, the beach, the lagoon, and the island. RICHARD (V.O.) Listening to all the people talk about where they're going to go and ho great it's going to be, and I try to tell them: you can go too far, you can find out too much, but no one ever listens, no one ever listens. I guess there's some things you just have to discover for yourself. INT. HOTEL ROOM. DAY. He finishes his work. It is a copy of The Map. He picks up a single tack. INT. HOTEL CORRIDOR. DAY. Richard pins the map to the door of an adjacent room. He walks back to the open door of his own room. He looks back once and closes the door. Close on The Map.     THE END

                                  Based on the novel by

                                      Daniel Wallace

                                  Final Production Draft

                

               This is a Southern story, full of lies and fabrications, but 
               truer for their inclusion. 

               FADE IN:

               A RIVER.

               We're underwater, watching a fat catfish swim along.

               This is The Beast.

                                     EDWARD (V.O.)
                         There are some fish that cannot be 
                         caught. It's not that they're faster 
                         or stronger than other fish. They're 
                         just touched by something extra. 
                         Call it luck. Call it grace. One 
                         such fish was The Beast.

               The Beast's journey takes it past a dangling fish hook, baited 
               with worms. Past a tempting lure, sparkling in the sun. Past 
               a swiping bear claw. The Beast isn't worried.

                                     EDWARD (V.O.)
                         By the time I was born, he was already 
                         a legend. He'd taken more hundred-
                         dollar lures than any fish in Alabama. 
                         Some said that fish was the ghost of 
                         Henry Walls, a thief who'd drowned 
                         in that river 60 years before. Others 
                         claimed he was a lesser dinosaur, 
                         left over from the Cretaceous period.

               INT. WILL'S BEDROOM - NIGHT (1973)

               WILL BLOOM, AGE 3, listens wide-eyed as his father EDWARD 
               BLOOM, 40's and handsome, tells the story. In every gesture, 
               Edward is bigger than life, describing each detail with 
               absolute conviction.

                                     EDWARD
                         I didn't put any stock into such 
                         speculation or superstition. All I 
                         knew was I'd been trying to catch 
                         that fish since I was a boy no bigger 
                         than you.
                              (closer)
                         And on the day you were born, that 
                         was the day I finally caught him.

               EXT. CAMPFIRE - NIGHT (1977)

               A few years later, and Will sits with the other INDIAN GUIDES 
               as Edward continues telling the story to the tribe.

                                     EDWARD
                         Now, I'd tried everything on it: 
                         worms, lures, peanut butter, peanut 
                         butter-and-cheese. But on that day I 
                         had a revelation: if that fish was 
                         the ghost of a thief, the usual bait 
                         wasn't going to work. I would have 
                         to use something he truly desired.

               Edward points to his wedding band, glinting in the firelight.

                                     LITTLE BRAVE
                              (confused)
                         Your finger?

               Edward slips his ring off.

                                     EDWARD
                         Gold.

               While the other boys are rapt with attention, Will looks 
               bored. He's heard this story before.

                                     EDWARD
                         I tied my ring to the strongest line 
                         they made -- strong enough to hold 
                         up a bridge, they said, if just for 
                         a few minutes -- and I cast upriver.

               INT. BLOOM FRONT HALL - NIGHT (1987)

               Edward is chatting up Will's pretty DATE to the homecoming 
               dance. She is enjoying the story, but also the force of 
               Edward's charisma. He's hypnotizing.

                                     EDWARD (CONT'D)
                         The Beast jumped up and grabbed it 
                         before the ring even hit the water. 
                         And just as fast, he snapped clean 
                         through that line.

               WILL, now 17 with braces, is fuming and ready to leave. His 
               mother SANDRA -- from whom he gets his good looks and 
               practicality -- stands with him at the door.

                                     EDWARD
                         You can see my predicament. My wedding 
                         ring, the symbol of fidelity to my 
                         wife, soon to be the mother of my 
                         child, was now lost in the gut of an 
                         uncatchable fish.

               ON WILL AND SANDRA

                                     WILL
                              (low but insistent)
                         Make him stop.

               His mother pats him sympathetically, then adjusts his tie.

                                     WILL'S DATE
                         What did you do?

                                     EDWARD
                         I followed that fish up-river and 
                         down-river for three days and three 
                         nights, until I finally had him boxed 
                         in.

               Will regards his father with exasperated contempt.

                                     EDWARD
                         With these two hands, I reached in 
                         and snatched that fish out of the 
                         river. I looked him straight in the 
                         eye. And I made a remarkable 
                         discovery.

               INT. TINY PARIS RESTAURANT (LA RUE 14°) - NIGHT (1998)

               WILL, now 28, sits with his gorgeous bride JOSEPHINE. This 
               is their wedding reception, crowded with their friends and 
               family. They should be joyful, but Will is furious.

               Edward has the floor, ostensibly for a toast. The room is 
               cozy and drunk.

                                     EDWARD
                         This fish, the Beast. The whole time 
                         we were calling it a him, when in 
                         fact it was a her. It was fat with 
                         eggs, and was going to lay them any 
                         day.

               Over near the doorway, we spot Sandra, just returned from 
               the restrooms. She looks gorgeous. She couldn't be any happier 
               if this were her own wedding.

                                     EDWARD
                         Now, I was in a situation. I could 
                         gut that fish and get my ring back, 
                         but doing so I would be killing the 
                         smartest catfish in the Ashton River, 
                         soon to be mother of a hundred others.

               Will can't take any more. Josephine tries to hold him back, 
               but he gets up and leaves. Edward doesn't even notice.

                                     EDWARD
                         Did I want to deprive my soon-to-be-
                         born son the chance to catch a fish 
                         like this of his own? This lady fish 
                         and I, well, we had the same destiny.

               As he leaves, Will mutters in perfect unison with his father --

                                     EDWARD AND WILL
                         We were part of the same equation.

               Will reaches the door, where his mother intercepts him.

                                     SANDRA
                         Honey, it's still your night.

               Will can't articulate his anger. He just leaves.

                                     EDWARD
                         Now, you may well ask, since this 
                         lady fish wasn't the ghost of a thief, 
                         why did it strike so quick on gold 
                         when nothing else would attract it?
                              (closer; he holds up 
                              his ring)
                         That was the lesson I learned that 
                         day, the day my son was born.

               He focuses his words on Sandra. This story is -- and has 
               always been -- about her more than anyone.

                                     EDWARD
                         Sometimes, the only way to catch an 
                         uncatchable woman is to offer her a 
                         wedding ring.

               A LAUGH from the crowd.

               Edward motions for Sandra to get up here with him. As she 
               crosses, we can see that thirty years of marriage has not 
               lessened their affection for each other.

               As they kiss, Edward tweaks her chin a special little way.

               The crowd APPLAUDS.

               Edward toasts the happy couple. Josephine covers well for 
               her absent husband, a smile as warm as summer.

               Edward downs his champagne in a gulp.

               EXT. OUTSIDE LA RUE 14° - NIGHT

               We come into the middle of an argument on the sidewalk. 
               Occasional PASSERSBY take notice, especially as it gets more 
               heated. Both men are a little drunk.

                                     EDWARD
                         What, a father's not allowed to talk 
                         about his son?

                                     WILL
                              (disbelieving)
                         I am a footnote in that story. I am 
                         the context for your great adventure. 
                         Which never happened! Incidentally! 
                         You were selling novelty products in 
                         Wichita the day I was born.

                                     EDWARD
                              (shaking his head)
                         Jesus Christ.

                                     WILL
                         Friend of yours? Did you help him 
                         out of a bind?

                                     EDWARD
                         Come on, Will. Everyone likes that 
                         story.

                                     WILL
                         No Dad, they don't. I do not like 
                         the story. Not anymore, not after a 
                         thousand times. I know all the 
                         punchlines, Dad. I can tell them as 
                         well as you can.
                              (closer)
                         For one night, one night in your 
                         entire life, the universe does not 
                         revolve around Edward Bloom. It 
                         revolves around me and my wife. How 
                         can you not understand that?

               A long beat, then...

                                     EDWARD
                              (low)
                         Sorry to embarrass you.

               Will won't let him get the last word.

                                     WILL
                         You're embarrassing yourself, Dad. 
                         You just don't see it.

               ANGLE ON Edward. Fine. A hand to wave, enough of you.

               He walks away.

               ANGLE ON Will, still fuming with righteous anger. It's then 
               we FREEZE FRAME.

                                     WILL (V.O.)
                         After that night, I didn't speak to 
                         my father again for three years.

               INT. A.P. NEWSROOM (PARIS) - DAY

               A typically busy day. On hold with the phone cradled under 
               an ear, Will sorts through a bundle of mail dropped on his 
               desk.

                                     WILL (ON PHONE)
                              (without pauses)
                         William Bloom with the Associated 
                         Press if I could just...

               He's put back on hold. Returning to the mail, he finds a 
               hand-addressed envelope. Rips it open.

                                     WILL (V.O.)
                         We communicated indirectly I guess. 
                         In her letters and Christmas cards, 
                         my mother would write for both of 
                         them.

               INT. BLOOM HOUSE KITCHEN - DAY

               At the table, Sandra talks on the phone while Edward fixes a 
               sandwich.

                                     WILL (V.O.)
                         When I'd call, Mom would say that 
                         Dad was out driving. Or swimming in 
                         the pool.

               Edward takes a seat, starting to eat his sandwich.

                                     WILL
                         True to form, we never talked about 
                         our not talking.

               INT. BLOOM HOUSE MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT

               Sandra stands by the window, watching as...

               EXT. BLOOM BACK YARD - NIGHT [CONTINUOUS]

               Edward swims laps in the family pool. He's born to the water.

                                     WILL (V.O.)
                         The truth is, I didn't see anything 
                         of myself in my father, and I don't 
                         think he saw anything of himself in 
                         me. We were like strangers who knew 
                         each other very well.

               EXT. RIVER - DAY

               Edward stares intently into the water, a lion in wait.

                                     WILL (V.O.)
                         In telling the story of my father's 
                         life, it's impossible to separate 
                         the fact from the fiction, the man 
                         from the myth. The best I can do is 
                         to tell it the way he told me.

               We LOOK DOWN at the river, where Edward's reflection is caught 
               in the dark water. As the water ripples past, something 
               changes.

               Sure enough, as we LOOK UP again, it's a younger EDWARD BLOOM, 
               20's, staring into the water. He's not just handsome, not 
               just charming. It's as if all the forces of the natural world 
               had conspired to create him.

                                     WILL (V.O.)
                         It doesn't always make sense, and 
                         most of it never happened.

               Suddenly, this Edward thrusts both hands into the water, 
               grabbing hold of

               THE BEAST.

               He brings the catfish up to his face. Looks it right in the 
               eye. A beat, then the Beast spits out Edward's gold ring.

                                     WILL (V.O.)
                         But that's what kind of story this 
                         is.

               Smiling, Edward takes the ring, then throws the Beast back 
               into the water with a splash.

               TITLE OVER:

                                         BIG FISH

               INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY

               Young Dr. Bennett stands between the Wife's legs. She's 
               flustered and sweating, but the doctor has a comforting 
               bedside manner...

                                     YOUNG DR. BENNETT
                         Now, Mrs. Bloom, I'll need you to 
                         give me one good push. On three. 
                         One...

               Suddenly, we hear a POP as a slimy mass of human being rockets 
               into the doctor's unprepared hands. Bennett tries to hold 
               tight, but the infant is slippery like a fish. It shoots up 
               into air.

               The NURSES and the Husband try to grab the baby, but no one 
               can hold it. As the newborn sails upward TOWARDS CAMERA, we 
               can see a GIGGLING SMILE on its face.

               As it falls, the newborn knocks over a tray, which provides 
               it a ramp to slide right out of the room. Everyone races 
               after it.

               INT. HOSPITAL HALLWAY - DAY

               Bursting through the doors --

                                     YOUNG DR. BENNETT
                         Grab that baby!

               A NURSE finally scoops up the slippery baby. Everyone lets 
               out a collective sigh of relief.

                                     WILL (V.O.)
                         My father's birth would set the pace 
                         for his unlikely life. No longer 
                         than most men's, but larger. And as 
                         strange as his stories got, the 
                         endings were always the most 
                         surprising of all.

               INT. HALF-DARK PARIS APARTMENT - (PRESENT) DAY

               Over the sound of rain, a phone RINGS on a chair. By the 
               tone of the ring, we know we're not in the U.S. -- it has 
               that insistent European sound.

               As it keeps RINGING, we look to see the apartment is mostly 
               empty, just a few half-unpacked boxes. A cradle is still in 
               its carton.

               KEYS in the lock. LAUGHTER in the hallway. The door swings 
               open to reveal a drenched Will (29) carrying four sacks of 
               groceries, the bottoms collapsing from the rain. His wife 
               Josephine (28) pushes past him to get the phone.

                                     JOSEPHINE
                         Allo oui?

               Will begins stripping out of his wet clothes, each layer 
               unleashing a new drizzle. He plays it up, trying to get a 
               reaction out of Josephine.

                                     JOSEPHINE
                              (on phone)
                         Yes, he's here.

               She hands the phone to Will, concerned.

                                     JOSEPHINE
                         It's your mother.

               Half-stripped, Will takes the phone. This won't be good news.

                                     WILL
                              (on phone)
                         Hi. Uh-huh. Uh-huh.

               As Josephine takes off her rain coat, we see she is very, 
               very pregnant. She listens carefully to Will's side of the 
               conversation, trying to gauge how bad the news is.

                                     WILL (CONT'D)
                         What does Dr. Bennett say? Okay. No, 
                         sure, let me talk to him. I'll wait.

               He covers the mouthpiece. Looks over to Josephine.

                                     JOSEPHINE
                         It's bad.

                                     WILL
                         It's more than they thought. They're 
                         going to stop chemo.

                                     JOSEPHINE
                         You need to go.

                                     WILL
                         Probably tonight.

               A beat.

                                     JOSEPHINE
                         I'm going with you.

                                     WILL
                         You don't have to.

                                     JOSEPHINE
                              (a simple fact)
                         I'm going with you.

               INT. AIR FRANCE 747 - NIGHT

               As the plane continues boarding, a STEWARDESS recites the 
               welcome spiel in French. Will has a window seat in coach. 
               Josephine sits beside him, putting on hand lotion.

               Taking his hands, she rubs the excess into him. There's an 
               effortless intimacy between them. She can pinpoint what he's 
               feeling before he can.

               INT. 747 / FLYING - NIGHT

               Hours later, and the lights are dimmed. Most of the PASSENGERS 
               are asleep, including Josephine. Her head is propped against 
               Will's shoulder, her hands tucked under her belly.

               Will watches her sleep, brushing back her hair. A beat, then 
               he notices a BORED BOY in the next row over.

               Off the glow of the reading light, the boy is using his hands 
               to cast shadows on the seat back. The kid is pretty good, 
               making a convincing bird, a passable monkey, and finally a 
               dog.

               We PUSH IN on the silhouettes.

                                     EDWARD (O.S., PRELAP)
                         So which one's it gonna be? The Monkey 
                         in the Barn, the Dog in the Road?

               Focusing on the final shadow, we...

                                                              MATCH CUT TO:

               INT. BLOOM HOUSE - NIGHT

               ...come to find Edward making the shapes.

               Will (6) sits in his pajamas on the floor next to him. The 
               endtable lamp lies between them, its shade off to cast big 
               shadows on the wall.

                                     WILL
                         The one about the witch.

                                     EDWARD
                         Your mom says I can't tell you that 
                         one anymore. You get nightmares.

                                     WILL
                         I'm not scared.

               Edward looks around for a beat, seeing if his wife is in 
               earshot. He then leans in, complicitous.

                                     EDWARD
                         Neither was I. At first.

               Will smiles, excited to hear the forbidden story.

                                     EDWARD
                         This all happened in the swamp outside 
                         of Ashton. Kids weren't supposed to 
                         go out in the swamp, on account of 
                         the snakes and spiders and quicksand 
                         that would swallow you up before you 
                         could even scream. But there were 
                         five of us out there that night: Me, 
                         Ruthie, Wilbur Freely, and the Price 
                         Brothers, Don and Zacky.

               Edward holds up his hand, counting the names on his fingers.

                                     EDWARD
                         Not a one of us knew what was in 
                         store.

               As his hand moves past the light, we

                                                                   COME TO:

               A flashlight SWEEPS past. We are...

               EXT. FIELD AT THE SWAMP EDGE - NIGHT

               The night is WHIRRING and BREATHING, alive. The moon hangs 
               low, casting long shadows.

               Five kids walk past in silhouette. Four have flashlights on. 
               The fifth keeps tripping, crashing into YOUNG EDWARD (10).

                                     EDWARD
                         Zacky, turn your flashlight on!

                                     ZACKY
                         I don't got any batteries!

               Red-headed ZACKY PRICE is 10. His brother DON PRICE is 12, 
               and a lot bigger than the others. 

                                     DON PRICE
                         Then why'd you bring it?

                                     ZACKY
                         I don't want to be in the swamp with 
                         a witch and no flashlight.

               WILBUR FREELY, also 10, is the black asthmatic son of a 
               sharecropper. Redheaded RUTHIE MACKLIN, 8, is happy just to 
               be there.

                                     EDWARD
                         Is it true she got a glass eye?

                                     WILBUR FREELY
                         I heard she got it from Gypsies.

                                     EDWARD
                         What's a Gypsy?

                                     ZACKY
                         Your momma's a Gypsy.

                                     DON PRICE
                         Your momma's a bitch.

                                     RUTHIE
                         You shouldn't swear. There's ladies 
                         present.

                                     DON PRICE
                         Shit.

                                     ZACKY
                         Damn.

                                     WILBUR FREELY
                         Screw.

                                     EDWARD
                              (whispering)
                         Turn off your flashlights! She'll 
                         see 'em.

               MOVING UP behind the kids, we find ourselves at the gates 
               of...

               EXT. A CREEPY OLD HOUSE - NIGHT

                                     ADULT EDWARD (V.O.)
                         Now, it's common knowledge that most 
                         towns of a certain size have a witch, 
                         if only to eat misbehaving children 
                         and the occasional puppy who wanders 
                         into her yard. Witches use those 
                         bones to cast spells and curses that 
                         make the land infertile.

               We PULL BACK, and BACK, revealing more of the Gothically 
               creepy house: its broken windows, strangling vines, and eerie 
               gargoyles half-buried in the dirt. Even bats are afraid to 
               fly over it.

               In the moonlight, the house is especially sinister. Who knows 
               what is lurking in the shadows?

                                     ADULT EDWARD (V.O.)
                         Yet of the all the witches in Alabama, 
                         there was one who was the most feared. 
                         For she had one glass eye, which was 
                         said to contain mystical powers.

               We finally come to the kids, staring in through the gate.

                                     WILBUR FREELY
                         I hear if you look right at it, you 
                         can see how you're gonna die.

                                     EDWARD
                         That's bull-s-h-i-t, that is. She's 
                         not even a real witch.

                                     DON PRICE
                         You're so sure, why don't you go in 
                         and get that eye? I heard she keeps 
                         it in a box on her nighttable.

               Edward looks back at the spooky house.

                                     DON PRICE
                         Or are you too scared?

                                     EDWARD
                         I'll go in right now and get that 
                         eye.

                                     DON PRICE
                         Then do it.

                                     EDWARD
                         Fine, I will.

                                     DON PRICE
                         Fine, you do it.

                                     EDWARD
                         Fine, I'm doing it.

               He hands Zacky his flashlight, then starts climbing the gate.

                                     RUTHIE
                         Edward, don't!

                                     WILBUR FREELY
                         She'll make soap out of you!
                              (to Ruthie)
                         That's what she does, she makes soap 
                         out of people.

               Edward drops down on the far side of the gate. Truth be told, 
               Edward is scared, but he forges ahead anyway.

               Wilbur looks to Ruthie, and they're in complete agreement. 
               They get the hell out of there. Zacky would run too, but Don 
               holds him by the collar.

               EXT. APPROACHING THE HOUSE

               Edward curves around the tall bushes that hide the front 
               door. Anything could jump out of them.

               He steps on the porch. The boards SQUEAL and CREAK, but he 
               continues on. A cat SCREAMS OUT from a broken wicker rocker. 
               Catching his breath, Edward reaches the front door.

               The doorknob is ancient brass, two projections that look 
               like horns. Yet Edward extends his hand, reaching closer and 
               closer before he finally

               RINGS THE DOORBELL.

               Impossibly fast, the door opens, revealing an OLD WOMAN with 
               a patch over her left eye. She looks like she's been dead 
               for years, but too stubborn to lie down.

                                     EDWARD
                              (calm and 
                              straightforward)
                         Ma'am, my name is Edward Bloom, and 
                         there's some folks'd like to see 
                         your eye.

               EXT. BACK AT THE GATE - NIGHT

               Zacky and Don Price wait for Edward, each moment more 
               convinced he's already dead. But suddenly, he's back at the 
               gate.

                                     DON PRICE
                         You get the eye?

                                     EDWARD
                         I brought it.

                                     DON PRICE
                              (dubious)
                         Let's see it.

               The Old Woman steps out of the shadows behind Edward, flipping 
               up her eye patch. When their flashlight beam hits her left 
               eye, it shines with a hellish glow.

               We RUSH IN on Zacky, who is paralyzed by what he sees.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. FRONT PORCH OF HOUSE - DAY

               An OLD MAN -- Zacky -- stands on a wobbly stepladder, changing 
               a lightbulb. Suddenly, the ladder gives way and he falls. 
               Dead.

               EXT. AT THE GATE - NIGHT

               We RUSH IN on Don Price.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. FRATERNITY HOUSE BATHROOM - DAY

               Twenty-year old Don Price falls face-forward on the tile, 
               face mushed in the grout. Very much dead.

               EXT. AT THE GATE - NIGHT

               Don and Zacky both tremble with fear. The latter has tears 
               in his eyes.

                                     ZACKY
                         I saw how I was gonna die. I was 
                         old, and I fell.

                                     DON PRICE
                         I wasn't old at all.

               The brothers suddenly bolt. Still standing next to the Old 
               Woman, Edward smiles.

               EXT. AT THE OLD WOMAN'S DOOR - NIGHT

               Edward helps her back inside. He could leave now, but 
               curiosity gets the better of him.

                                     EDWARD
                         I was thinking about death and all. 
                         About seeing how you're gonna die.

               The Old Woman turns to him slightly, still not facing him.

                                     EDWARD
                         I mean, on one hand, if dying was 
                         all you thought about, it could kind 
                         of screw you up. But it could kind 
                         of help you, couldn't it? Because 
                         you'd know that everything else you 
                         can survive.

               The Old Woman smiles a little, a crooked grin of broken teeth.

                                     EDWARD
                         I guess I'm saying, I'd like to know.

               The Old Woman turns leaning her face right in front of his. 
               And on a silent count of one, two, three -- Edward looks 
               into The Eye.

               This time we don't cut. Instead, we HOLD ON Edward as he 
               witnesses his death. He stares transfixed, perplexed and 
               amused. Whatever he sees, it's not as dire as the other boys. 
               His future has something strange in store.

                                     EDWARD
                         Huh. That's how I go?

               The Old Woman nods. Still a little overwhelmed, Edward turns 
               and leaves.

                                     ADULT EDWARD (V.O.)
                         From that moment on, I no longer 
                         feared death. And for that, I was as 
                         good as immortal.

               As Edward leaves, the door swings SHUT on its own.

                                                              MATCH CUT TO:

               INT./EXT. BLOOM HOUSE - (PRESENT) DAY

               The front door opens to reveal Will and Josephine on the 
               porch with their bags. REVERSE to Will's mother Sandra (53), 
               surprised and a little annoyed.

                                     SANDRA
                         How did you get here?

                                     WILL
                         We swam. The Atlantic, it's not that 
                         big really.

                                     SANDRA
                         Ruth McHibbon offered to pick you up 
                         at the airport.

                                     WILL
                         We rented a car.

                                     SANDRA
                              (simply)
                         You didn't need to do that. You just 
                         didn't.

               A beat. Starting over...

                                     WILL
                         Hi, Mom.

               He leans in and hugs her. She surrenders, squeezing her son 
               tight. Will and his mother are cut from the same cloth -- 
               strong-willed but practical. They've always been close.

                                     SANDRA
                         I'm so glad you're here.

               That hug finished, Sandra pushes past her son to her daughter-
               in-law. Seeing the size of her belly --

                                     SANDRA
                         You shouldn't have flown. But...

               They hug.

                                     JOSEPHINE
                         It's good to see you. You look 
                         beautiful.

               It's not flattery. It's the truth.

                                     SANDRA
                         Thank you. I'll bet you need to --

                                     JOSEPHINE
                         Yes.

                                     SANDRA
                         Down the hall on the right. The door 
                         sticks. You have to really pull it.

               Josephine squeezes past, a smile to her husband -- be nice. 
               Will heads back to the rental car to retrieve luggage. Sandra 
               follows him.

               Coming down the driveway, we get to see the house for the 
               first time: an older suburban home, three bedrooms, big for 
               the neighborhood, and nicely grown into the lot. KIDS are 
               playing on the street.

                                     WILL
                         Is that Dr. Bennett's car?

                                     SANDRA
                         He's up with your father.

               Heading back to the house...

                                     WILL
                         How is he?

                                     SANDRA
                         He's impossible. He won't eat. And 
                         because he won't eat, he gets weaker. 
                         And because he's weaker, he doesn't 
                         want to eat.

                                     WILL
                         How much time does he have left?

                                     SANDRA
                         You don't talk about those things. 
                         Not yet.

               INT. KITCHEN - DAY

               Sandra is pouring iced tea for Will and Josephine.

               DR. JULIUS BENNETT (85) enters from the foyer, still winded 
               from coming down the stairs. He was the town's first Black 
               physician. He's still the town's best physician.

                                     DR. BENNETT
                         Will.

                                     WILL
                         Dr. Bennett. It's good to see you.
                              (they shake)
                         My wife, Josephine.

                                     DR. BENNETT
                         A pleasure.

               He judges her belly.

                                     DR. BENNETT
                         You're seven months.

                                     JOSEPHINE
                              (impressed)
                         To the day.

               He leans close to her, whispering in her ear...

                                     DR. BENNETT
                         It's a boy.

               She smiles, surprised but not doubting. Will looks over -- 
               what did he say? Josephine shakes her head.

               Back to the main subject...

                                     SANDRA
                         You don't think he looks any worse.

                                     DR. BENNETT
                         No. I would say he's the same.

               And in the silence that follows, a lot is said. It wasn't 
               the upbeat reply Sandra was hoping for.

                                     WILL
                         Can I see him?

                                     DR. BENNETT
                         Absolutely. Be good for you to talk 
                         to him.

               A moment of awkwardness -- everyone here knows they haven't 
               spoken in years.

               Sandra hands Will a squat can of Ensure from the case on the 
               counter.

                                     SANDRA
                         Get him to drink one of these. He 
                         won't, but tell him he has to.

               INT. FOYER - DAY

               Coming out from the kitchen, Will slowly climbs the stairs. 
               They CREAK with every step.

               The wall is filled with family photos, happier times. Most 
               of the pictures are of Will, starting when he was an infant 
               and ending at his wedding. As he climbs the stairs, we can 
               see him growing up with every step.

               INT. UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - DAY

               A crack of sunlight spills around the half-open door at the 
               end of the hallway. Will walks towards it, running a hand 
               along the wallpaper.

               Almost at the door, he stops for a beat. Gets his breath. 
               Then goes inside.

               INT. GUEST ROOM - DAY

               Edward Bloom, 61, lies asleep on the bed. Although he's not 
               the vibrant man we've seen before, it's not as bad we feared. 
               The illness has been quick, and left him largely intact.

               There are no I.V.'s, no monitors, nothing.

               Coming up to the bed --

                                     WILL
                         Dad?

               Edward cracks open an eye, a beat before he focuses. He tries 
               to say something, but no words come out.

               He looks over at a pitcher on the nightstand. Will pours him 
               a glass of water, helping him hold it to his parched lips.

               Finished, Edward sets down the glass by himself. A very long, 
               tense beat. Will almost speaks again to fill the silence.

               Finally...

                                     EDWARD
                         You --
                              (he points)
                         -- are in for a surprise.

                                     WILL
                         Am I?

                                     EDWARD
                         Having a kid changes everything. I 
                         mean, there's the diapers and the 
                         burping and the midnight feedings...

                                     WILL
                         Did you do any of that?

                                     EDWARD
                         No, but I hear it's terrible. Then 
                         you spend years trying to corrupt 
                         and mislead this child, fill its 
                         head with nonsense and still it turns 
                         out perfectly fine.

                                     WILL
                         You think I'm up for it?

                                     EDWARD
                         You learned from the best.

               Will doesn't rise to the challenge. A beat, then he remembers 
               the can of Ensure. Holds it up. Edward recoils.

                                     WILL
                         Just drink half the can. I'll tell 
                         her you drank the whole thing. 
                         Everyone wins.

               A beat, then Edward rolls his eyes. Fine. Will cracks open 
               the can, finding a straw on the nightstand.

                                     EDWARD
                         People needn't worry so much. It's 
                         not my time yet. This isn't how I 
                         go.

                                     WILL
                         Really.

                                     EDWARD
                         Truly. I saw it in The Eye.

                                     WILL
                         The Old Lady by the swamp.

                                     EDWARD
                         She was a witch.

                                     WILL
                         No, she was old and probably senile. 
                         Maybe schizophrenic.

                                     EDWARD
                         I saw my death in that eye. And this 
                         is not how it happens.

                                     WILL
                         So how does it happen?

                                     EDWARD
                         Surprise ending. Wouldn't want to 
                         ruin it for you.

               Edward slurps down as much of the Ensure as he can stand, 
               then pushes the can away. He swallows with difficulty.

                                     EDWARD
                         There was this panhandler who used 
                         to stop me every morning when I came 
                         out of this coffee shop near the 
                         office.

                                     WILL
                         Okay.

                                     EDWARD
                         And every day I gave him a quarter. 
                         Every day. Then I got sick and was 
                         out for a couple of weeks. And when 
                         I went back there, you know what he 
                         said?

                                     WILL
                         What did he say?

                                     EDWARD
                         You owe me three-fifty.

                                     WILL
                         Really.

                                     EDWARD
                         True story.

               A beat.

                                     WILL
                         When did you ever work in an office?

                                     EDWARD
                         There's a lot you don't know about 
                         me.

                                     WILL
                         You're right.

               Edward gives a wry smile. He walked into that.

                                     EDWARD
                         Your mother was worried we wouldn't 
                         talk again. And look at us. We're 
                         talking fine. We're storytellers, 
                         both of us. I speak mine out, you 
                         write yours down. Same thing.

               Will won't commit to Edward's assessment.

                                     WILL
                         Dad, I'm hoping we can talk about 
                         some things while I'm here.

                                     EDWARD
                         You mean, while I'm here.

                                     WILL
                         I'd just like to know the true 
                         versions of things. Events. Stories. 
                         You.

               Edward LAUGHS a little, which becomes a COUGH. The HACKING 
               escalates until another drink of water gets it under control. 
               It's not clear whether any of this was an act to keep from 
               talking.

                                     EDWARD
                         Your mother hasn't been keeping up 
                         the pool. If you wanted to you 
                         could...

                                     WILL
                         I will.

                                     EDWARD
                         You know where the chemicals are?

                                     WILL
                         I used to do it when you were gone, 
                         remember? I used to do it a lot.

               He didn't mean for that to sound so pointed. Taking the half-
               empty Ensure, Will gets up to go. He's at the door when...

                                     EDWARD
                         I was never much for being at home, 
                         Will. It's too confining. And this, 
                         here. Being stuck in bed. Dying is 
                         the worst thing that ever happened 
                         to me.

               He smiles at his joke.

                                     WILL
                         I thought you weren't dying.

                                     EDWARD
                         I said this isn't how I go. The last 
                         part is much more unusual. Trust me 
                         on that.

               INT. UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - DAY

               Shutting the door behind himself, Will drinks the rest of 
               the Ensure himself. Edward was right. It tastes horrible.

               Heading for the stairs, Will walks past an open door. As he 
               leaves frame, we STAY BEHIND to look inside...

               INT. WILL'S BEDROOM - DAY [FLASHBACK]

               ...where an eight-year old Will is propped up in bed, his 
               face covered with chicken pox and pink calamine lotion. He's 
               showing Edward how many bumps there are on his arm.

                                     YOUNG WILL
                         Dr. Bennett says I'm going to have 
                         to be home for a week.

                                     EDWARD
                         That's nothing. I once had to stay 
                         in bed for three years.

                                     YOUNG WILL
                         Did you have chicken pox?

                                     EDWARD
                         I wish.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. TINY CHURCH - DAY

               Wearing a white shirt and tie, YOUNG EDWARD -- still about 
               10 -- sings "Down to the River My Lord" along with the 
               CONGREGATION. His voice is high and thin, but he gives it 
               his all.

               Suddenly, his voice CRACKS and DROPS a half-octave. And then 
               another. His friends Wilbur Freeley and Ruthie look over, 
               wondering what's wrong. Embarrassed, Edward just keeps 
               SINGING, trying to follow along with the baritone part.

               He pulls at his collar. Then pulls again, his face getting 
               red. Starting to panic, he loosens his tie. He's starting to 
               undo the collar button when it POPS off by itself. Two more 
               buttons fly off. One hits a CHUBBY WOMAN in the neck.

               ON HIS SHOES

               As we watch, Edward's pant cuffs rise inch by inch -- that's 
               how fast he's growing.

                                     EDWARD (V.O.)
                         Truth is, no one quite knew what was 
                         wrong. Most times, a person grows up 
                         gradually. I found myself in a hurry.

               INT. YOUNG EDWARD'S BEDROOM - DAY

               Young Edward lies in bed, his limbs connected to various 
               pulleys and levers to support his weight. He has a dozen 
               encyclopedias around him, and another dozen on the floor.

                                     EDWARD (V.O.)
                         My muscles couldn't keep up with my 
                         bones, and my bones couldn't keep up 
                         with my body's ambition. So I spent 
                         the better part of three years 
                         confined to my bed, with the World 
                         Book Encyclopedia being my only means 
                         of exploration. I had made it all 
                         the way to the "G's," hoping to find 
                         an answer to my gigantificationism, 
                         when I uncovered an article about 
                         the common goldfish.

               INSERT: The encyclopedia article, complete with drawings.

                                     YOUNG EDWARD
                              (reading)
                         "Kept in a small bowl, the goldfish 
                         will remain small. With more space, 
                         the fish can grow double, triple, or 
                         quadruple its size."

               Young Edward thinks this through.

                                     EDWARD (V.O.)
                         It occurred to me then, that perhaps 
                         the reason for my growth was that I 
                         was intended for larger things. After 
                         all, a giant man can't have an 
                         ordinary-sized life.

               EXT. BASEBALL FIELD - DAY

               The CRACK of a bat announces the game-winning home run. The 
               crowd CHEERS the swing, and especially the batter as he rounds 
               the bases.

               Although we've seen him briefly before, this is our first 
               real exposure to GROWN-UP EDWARD, who we'll follow from 
               roughly the ages of 18 to 30.

                                     EDWARD (V.O.)
                         As soon as my bones had settled in 
                         their adult configuration, I set 
                         upon my plan to make a bigger place 
                         for myself in Ashton.

               EXT. SCHOOL FIELDS - DAY

               SINGLE SHOTS: Football hero Edward leads his team to victory. 
               On the sidelines, a PRETTY GIRL admits the name of her secret 
               love:

                                     GIRL
                         Edward Bloom!

               The other GIRLS SQUEAL in agreement. Don Price looks over, 
               glowers.

               EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - DAY

               SINGLE SHOT: A lawnmower ROARS along the grass. We LOOK UP 
               to see who's pushing it, but it's not Edward. It's one of 
               his teenage EMPLOYEES.

               Edward is back at the truck, which is painted to read, "Bloom 
               Landscaping." He has workers on every lawn.

               He signs an autograph for an ADMIRING CUB SCOUT.

               INT. BASKETBALL COURT - DAY

               Edward takes an impossible shot at the buzzer from the other 
               end of the court. Naturally, he makes it, winning the game.

               As the crowd goes wild for Edward, Don Price is the only 
               teammate who doesn't mob him.

               EXT. TOWN - DAY

               Edward carries a dog out of a burning house.

               INT. SCIENCE FAIR - DAY

               Edward wins a blue ribbon for his invention, a machine 
               labelled "Perpetual Motion." He and the JUDGE pose for a 
               photograph. A FLASH.

               Pissed, Don Price throws his crappy lima bean plants in the 
               trash.

               INT. HIGH SCHOOL STAGE - DAY

               A dashingly handsome Edward leads the CAST out for a curtain 
               call. He's the star of the show. Off to the side, we see Don 
               Price is the ass-end of a horse costume.

               Edward soaks in his applause, smiling and gracious.

               EXT. GRADUATION STAGE - DAY

               Edward accepts his diploma. The PRINCIPAL hugs him tight.

                                     EDWARD (V.O.)
                         I was the biggest thing Ashton had 
                         ever seen. Until one day, a stranger 
                         arrived.

               EXT. FARM - DAY

               As two FARMERS shake their heads, we REVERSE to a show a 
               massive hole punched through the side of a barn. It's roughly 
               the shape of man, but no human could be that large.

               EXT. SHEEP PEN - DAY

               Two fat ewes look up, a shadow falling across them. They 
               BLEAT in panic as

               TWO OVERSIZED HANDS

               reach in and scoop them up. Their protests continue as they're 
               carried away, one under each arm. We still haven't seen the 
               full stranger.

               EXT. COURT HOUSE - DAY

               A MOB of about 50 have gathered, many of them with shotguns. 
               Amid the crowd we see Don Price.

                                     SHARECROPPER
                         He ate an entire cornfield!

                                     LITTLE GIRL
                         He ate my dog!

                                     HOT-BLOODED SHOTGUN TOTER
                         If you ain't gonna stop him Mayor, 
                         we will!

                                     MAYOR
                         I won't have mob violence in this 
                         town. Now, has someone tried talking 
                         to him?

                                     SOME FARMER
                         You can't reason with 'im!

                                     SHEPHARD
                         He's a monster!

               Agreement from the crowd. And then...

                                     A VOICE (O.S.)
                         I'll do it.

               Everyone turns to see who said that. The crowd parts to reveal 
               none other than Edward Bloom. Don Price glowers.

                                     EDWARD
                         I'll talk to him. See if I can get 
                         him to move on.

                                     MAYOR
                         Son, that creature could crush you 
                         without trying.

                                     EDWARD
                         Trust me, he'll have to try.

               EXT. HILL OUTSIDE ASHTON - DAY

               Edward climbs up the last bit of the steep hillside, reaching 
               the mouth of a cave. Outside, buzzards squabble over the 
               remains of the giant's feast: broken barrels, bones picked 
               clean.

               In his most serious voice, Edward calls out:

                                     EDWARD
                         Hello!

               There's no answer.

                                     EDWARD
                         My name is Edward Bloom! I want to 
                         talk to you!

               From deep in a cave, a thunderous voice:

                                     VOICE (O.S.)
                         GO AWAY!

               The giant's voice has such force, it blows Edward's hair 
               back.

                                     EDWARD
                         I'm not going anywhere until you 
                         show yourself.

               A beat, then we hear a RUMBLE, like a train coming. Edward 
               braces himself, fists ready for a fight, if that's what it's 
               going to take.

               As the RUMBLE gets louder, the ground starts to shake. Even 
               Edward starts to worry. Just how big is this guy?

                                     EDWARD (V.O.)
                         Armed with the foreknowledge of my 
                         own death, I knew the giant couldn't 
                         kill me. All the same, I preferred 
                         to keep my bones unbroken.

               Edward picks up a stone, ready to play David to Goliath.

               Then suddenly, the giant bursts forth. Hunched over, he slams 
               into a stunned Edward, knocking him halfway down the hill.

               KARL THE GIANT is bigger than any man you've ever seen. Not 
               just tall, but massive. He's completely feral, with a beard 
               to his elbow and skin scratched and blistered. What remains 
               of his clothes are ragged and muddy. God knows what's living 
               in his matted hair.

               Karl leans over Edward, blocking the sun. Edward throws his 
               rock, but it just bounces off. The giant didn't even notice 
               it.

                                     KARL
                         Why are you here?

               Edward ponders the best response, settling on...

                                     EDWARD
                         So you can eat me. The town decided 
                         to send a human sacrifice, and I 
                         volunteered.

               Karl's eyes narrow, confused. Edward stands up.

                                     EDWARD
                         My arms are a little stringy, but 
                         there's some good eating on my legs. 
                         I mean, I'd be tempted to eat them 
                         myself.
                              (beat)
                         So I guess, just, if you could get 
                         it over with quick. Because I'm not 
                         much for pain, really.

               Edward closes his eyes, hands at his side, ready to be eaten. 
               Karl just stares at him, not sure what to do.

               After a beat, Edward opens his eyes a tiny bit, just to see 
               what the giant is doing. Relieved to see he's not licking 
               his chops --

                                     EDWARD
                         Look, I can't go back. I'm a human 
                         sacrifice. If I go back, everyone 
                         will think I'm a coward. And I'd 
                         rather be dinner than a coward.

               Karl sits down with a BOOM, dejected.

                                     EDWARD
                         Here, start with my hand. It'll be 
                         an appetizer.

               Reaching up, Edward shoves his hand into Karl's mouth. But 
               the giant spits it back out.

                                     KARL
                         I don't want to eat you. I don't 
                         want to eat anybody. It's just I get 
                         so hungry. I'm too big.

               And that's the sad truth. Karl is less a monster than a freak -- 
               a giant man, but in the end, just a man.

               Edward takes a seat beside him.

                                     EDWARD
                         Did you ever think maybe you're not 
                         too big? Maybe this town's just too 
                         small. I mean, look at it.

               Circling behind them, we look down at Ashton -- a tiny town 
               in a tiny valley.

                                     EDWARD
                         Hardly two stories in the whole place. 
                         Now I've heard in real cities, they've 
                         got buildings so tall you can't even 
                         see the tops of 'em.

                                     KARL
                         Really?

                                     EDWARD
                         Wouldn't lie to you. And they've got 
                         all-you-can-eat buffets. You can eat 
                         a lot, can't you?

                                     KARL
                         I can.

                                     EDWARD
                         So why are you wasting your time in 
                         a small town? You're a big man. You 
                         should be in the big city.

               Karl smiles, but then it fades. A certain sad suspicion --

                                     KARL
                         You're just trying to get me to leave, 
                         aren't you? That's why they sent you 
                         here.

                                     EDWARD
                         What's your name, Giant?

                                     KARL
                         Karl.

                                     EDWARD
                         Mine's Edward. And truthfully, I do 
                         want you to leave, Karl. But I want 
                         to leave with you.
                              (closer)
                         You think this town is too small for 
                         you, well, it's too small for a man 
                         of my ambition. I can't see staying 
                         here a day longer.

                                     KARL
                         You don't like it?

                                     EDWARD
                         I love every square inch of it. But 
                         I can feel the edges closing in on 
                         me. A man's life can only grow to a 
                         certain size in a place like this.
                              (beat)
                         So what do you say? Join me?

               Karl thinks a moment. Then --

                                     KARL
                         Okay.

                                     EDWARD
                         Okay.

               They shake on it.

                                     EDWARD
                         Now first, we gotta get you ready 
                         for the city.

               EXT. RIVER - DAY

               IN A SINGLE SHOT, Karl cuts his hair with hedge clippers, 
               while Edward cuts up a surplus army tent to make him a shirt.

               EXT. MAIN STREET OF ASHTON - DAY

               Spirits buoyed by the high school MARCHING BAND, all the 
               good CITIZENS of Ashton are gathered to see off Edward and 
               Karl.

               There's a few tears amid the familiar faces.

                                     MAYOR
                              (loudly, for the crowd)
                         Edward Bloom, first son of Ashton, 
                         it's with a heavy heart we see you 
                         go. But take with you this Key to 
                         the City, and know that any time you 
                         want to come back, all our doors are 
                         open to you.

               Edward ducks a bit so the Mayor can put the key around his 
               neck. The crowd CHEERS. And with that, Edward and Karl start 
               walking, waving as they go.

               Only DON PRICE, smoking on the corner, isn't sad to see Edward 
               go. He crushes his cigarette under his heel. He wishes he 
               could crush Edward.

               Many of the townfolk come onto the street to hug Edward or 
               shake his hand.

                                     EDWARD (V.O.)
                         That afternoon as I left Ashton, 
                         everyone seemed to have advice.

                                     VARIOUS TOWNFOLK
                         Find yourself a nice girl! Don't 
                         trust anyone in Kentucky! Watch your 
                         pride, Edward Bloom!

                                     EDWARD (V.O.)
                         But there was one person whose counsel 
                         I held above all others.

               As the crowd parts, he finds himself face to face with

               THE OLD WOMAN.

               The ruckus slows and quiets, as if a strange spell has been 
               cast. She motions for Edward to lean down, so she can whisper 
               something to him. Although we're VERY CLOSE, we can't hear 
               her voice.

                                     EDWARD (V.O.)
                         She said that the biggest fish in 
                         the river gets that way by never 
                         being caught.

               The advice only succeeds in confusing Edward.

                                     EDWARD
                              (to the Old Woman)
                         Okay. Thanks.

               Edward and Karl keep walking. The Old Woman shuffles off, 
               somehow knowing her advice will go unheeded.

                                     KARL
                         What did she say?

                                     EDWARD
                         Beats me.

               EXT. ROAD - DAY

               We TILT UP from the road to reveal Edward and Karl walking 
               out of Ashton. Each wears a backpack with all his earthly 
               possessions.

                                     EDWARD (V.O.)
                         There were two roads out of Ashton, 
                         a new one which was paved, and an 
                         older one that wasn't. People didn't 
                         use the old road anymore, and it had 
                         developed the reputation of being 
                         haunted.

               Edward and Karl come to a bend, where the paved road veers 
               left and an overgrown dirt road runs straight. The old road 
               is blocked with signs and warnings of danger.

                                     EDWARD (V.O.)
                         Since I had no intention of ever 
                         returning to Ashton, this seemed as 
                         good a time as any to find out what 
                         lay down that old road.

               Karl looks at the dirt road, wary.

                                     KARL
                         You know anyone's who's taken it?

                                     EDWARD
                         That poet, Norther Winslow did. He 
                         was going to Paris, France. He must 
                         have liked it, because no one ever 
                         heard from him again.
                              (beat)
                         Tell you what. You take the other 
                         way and I'll cut through here. Meet 
                         you on the far side.

               A little paranoid...

                                     KARL
                         You're not trying to run away?

                                     EDWARD
                         Just to be sure, you can take my 
                         pack.

               Karl perks up, even though it means more for him to carry.

               EXT. DIRT ROAD - DAY

               The road is overgrown, but not altogether creepy. The sun is 
               still shining, and the birds still CHIRPING.

               Spinning the Key to the City, Edward WHISTLES, because it's 
               a day meant for whistling.

               EXT. FURTHER ALONG - ROUGH PATH

               The road has narrowed to a rough path. Spikes of sunlight 
               break through the thick canopy, catching particles in the 
               air. Still, Edward WHISTLES.

               Coming around a bend, his PITCH DROPS as he sees thick, thorny 
               vines growing across the path. He stops. For the first time, 
               he realizes the birds have stopped singing. The forest is 
               dead quiet.

               He looks back the way he came. It's tempting to go back. It 
               would be easier to go back. But Edward presses on.

               He carefully steps through the thorns. His trouser legs catch 
               on the barbs. We can hear the fabric TEAR.

               FURTHER ALONG

               A scratched and sweaty Edward waves off various STINGING 
               BUGS flying at him, finally whipping off his hat to swat at 
               them.

               Just then a CAWING crow swoops down and grabs the hat right 
               out of his hands.

                                     EDWARD
                         You stupid sonofa...

               He stops his swearing, but grabs a rock and throws it. The 
               stone ricochets off a tree and into a BEE'S NEST. The swarm 
               roars out.

               Edward high-tails it, each step still precarious.

               EXT. THE DARK FOREST - DAY [LATER]

               Edward is bruised, battered and bee-stung.

               A half-broken sign lies in the road. Edward picks it up. 
               Reads it:

                                         WARNING!

                                     JUMPING SPIDERS!

               Sure enough, up ahead he sees the path is overgrown with 
               thick cobwebs, heavy from the rain.

                                     EDWARD (V.O.)
                         There comes a point where a reasonable 
                         man will swallow his pride and admit 
                         he's made a terrible mistake. The 
                         truth is, I was never a reasonable 
                         man.

               Edward tosses the sign and forges ahead, into the spiderwebs.

                                     EDWARD
                         And what I recalled of Sunday School 
                         was that the more difficult something 
                         became, the more rewarding it was in 
                         the end.

               EXT. CLEARING / THE ROAD - DAY

               Edward emerges from the forest, brushing the last cobwebs 
               off and shaking the spiders from his shirt. One is stuck in 
               his sleeve, and he has to dance to get it out. Even then, he 
               still keeps twitching, convinced another one is left behind.

               At his feet, the gravel road has returned, smooth and dusty 
               and comforting.

               Ahead lies a tiny one-street town -- smaller even than Ashton -- 
               with powerlines emerging from the woods to feed it. Dangling 
               from the line above he sees two dozen pairs of shoes, their 
               laces tied together.

               He passes a sign that reads "Welcome To Spectre!"

               EXT. THE TOWN OF SPECTRE - DAY

               It's a main street with stores on each side: Cole's Pharmacy, 
               Talbot's Five and Dime, Al's Country Store. Everything is 
               old, but this isn't a ghost town. In fact, there's a group 
               of about 20 CITIZENS spilling out to see Edward approach. 
               Most are smiling. There are even a few tears of joy.

               What's more, all of these people are barefoot.

                                     MAN'S VOICE
                         Friend!

               A forty-year old man named BEAMEN comes out of the seed store 
               to greet Edward. Friendly but a little drunk, he's the closest 
               thing the town has to a mayor. He's carrying a clipboard.

                                     BEAMEN
                         Welcome to ya. What's your name?

                                     EDWARD
                         Edward Bloom.

               Beamen checks the clipboard. Not finding the name, he flips 
               forward a few pages. Still looking...

                                     BEAMEN
                         Bloom like a flower?

                                     EDWARD
                         Yes.

                                     BEAMEN
                         Oh. Here! Right here. Edward Bloom. 
                         We weren't expecting you yet.

               Still confused...

                                     EDWARD
                         You were expecting me?

                                     BEAMEN
                         Not yet.

               A helpful woman named MILDRED chimes in:

                                     MILDRED
                         You must have taken a shortcut.

                                     EDWARD
                         I did. It nearly killed me.

                                     BEAMEN
                         Mmm-hmm. Life'll do that to you. And 
                         truthfully, the long way is easier, 
                         but it's longer.

                                     MILDRED
                         Much longer.

                                     BEAMEN
                         And you're here now, and that's what 
                         matters.

               Beamen's daughter JENNY (8) hides behind her father, peering 
               around to look at the handsome stranger.

                                     EDWARD
                         What is this place?

                                     BEAMEN
                         The town of Spectre. Best kept secret 
                         in Alabama. Says here you're from 
                         Ashton, right? Last person we had 
                         from Ashton was Norther Winslow.

                                     EDWARD
                         The poet? What ever happened to him?

                                     BEAMEN
                         He's still here. Let me buy you a 
                         drink. I'll tell you all about it. 
                         Hell, I'll have him tell you.

                                     EDWARD
                         No. I've gotta meet somebody. I'm 
                         already running late.

               He didn't mean it as a joke, but for some reason, everyone's 
               laughing.

                                     BEAMEN
                         Son, I already told you. You're early.

               INT. BEAMEN'S HOUSE - DAY

               Sitting at the kitchen table, Edward takes a second slice of 
               apple pie. He and Beamen are joined by NORTHER WINSLOW (30), 
               who fancies himself a cultured artist, though he's never 
               left the state.

                                     BEAMEN
                         Now tell me if that isn't the best 
                         pie you ever ate.

                                     EDWARD
                         It truly is.

               UNDER THE TABLE

               Young Jenny is stealthily untying the laces on Edward's shoes.

                                     NORTHER WINSLOW
                         Everything here tastes better. Even 
                         the water is sweet. Never gets too 
                         hot, too cold, too humid. At night 
                         the wind goes through the trees and 
                         you'd swear there was a whole symphony 
                         out there, playing just for you.

               Suddenly, Jenny YANKS OFF Edward's shoes. She races for the 
               door.

                                     EDWARD
                         Hey!

               He chases after her.

               EXT. TOWN / MAIN STREET - DAY

               As she runs, Jenny ties Edward's laces together. Reaching 
               the edge of town, she tosses the shoes up and around the 
               power line -- a perfect throw. There's no way he's ever 
               getting them down.

               The gathered citizens of Spectre CHEER for Edward, who is 
               confused and overwhelmed. The women hug him. Men shake his 
               hand.

               Still focused on his shoes...

                                     EDWARD
                         Wait! I need those!

                                     NORTHER WINSLOW
                         There is no softer ground than town.

                                     MILDRED
                         That rhymes!

                                     BEAMEN
                         He is our poet laureate.

               The townsfolk continue to congratulate Edward... 

                                     EDWARD (V.O.)
                         Sometimes in a dream, you'll visit 
                         places that seem instantly familiar, 
                         filled with friends you've never 
                         met.

               EXT. UNDER A TREE - DUSK

               Edward sits with Norther Winslow. The fireflies are out. 
               Thousands of them.

                                     EDWARD (V.O.)
                         A man might travel his entire life 
                         and never find a place so inviting. 
                         My journey had scarcely begun, and I 
                         had arrived.

               Norther hands him his noteboook.

                                     NORTHER WINSLOW
                         I've been working on this poem for 
                         12 years.

                                     EDWARD
                         Really.

                                     NORTHER WINSLOW
                         There's a lot of expectation. I don't 
                         want to disappoint my fans.

               A beat.

                                     EDWARD
                         It's only three lines long.

               Norther grabs his notebook back.

                                     NORTHER WINSLOW
                         This is why you don't show work in 
                         progress.

                                     EDWARD
                         Norther, do you ever regret not making 
                         it to Paris?

                                     NORTHER WINSLOW
                         I can't imagine any place better 
                         than here.

                                     EDWARD
                         You're a poet. You oughta be able 
                         to. And maybe if you'd seen more, 
                         you could.

               Norther doesn't answer. Just goes back to his notebook.

               EXT. BY THE RIVER - NIGHT

               By the light of the full moon, Edward soaks his feet in the 
               water, trying to make sense of it all. The Key to the City 
               dangles around his neck.

               He stares at himself in the reflection. He smiles.

               It's then that a WOMAN emerges at the far side of the river.

               No telling where she came from -- she must have been swimming 
               underwater. We never see her face.

               She stands in the river with her bare back to Edward, 
               squeezing the water out of her golden hair, oblivious to his 
               presence. Edward is breathless. It's the first woman he's 
               seen in her natural state, and he doesn't dare move lest he 
               frighten her away.

               Then he sees the snake.

               It's a cottonmouth, has to be. It leaves a break in the water, 
               its small reptilian head aiming for her flesh.

               There's no decision to be made. On pure instinct, Edward 
               dives in. He swims as hard as can,

               GRABBING THE SNAKE

               just as it's about to strike.

               The woman dives back underwater, understandably terrified 
               that a man is coming at her.

                                     EDWARD
                         No, it's okay! I got it. I got the 
                         snake.

               As the splashing subsides, Edward looks at what he holds in 
               his hands. Which isn't a snake at all, but rather a common 
               stick. And a non-threatening one at that.

               While Edward ponders his mistake, he looks around to discover 
               that the Girl in the River is gone. He never even saw her 
               face.

                                     EDWARD
                         Wait! I'm sorry. Hello?!

               Edward keeps expecting her to surface, somewhere, but she 
               never does. He stands alone in the river, wondering what 
               tricks his eyes are playing on him.

               EXT. BY THE RIVER - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS

                                     A GIRL'S VOICE (O.S.)
                         There's leeches in there!

               Edward looks to the bank, where young Jenny Hill is watching 
               him.

                                     EDWARD
                         Did you see that woman?

                                     JENNY
                         What did she look like?

                                     EDWARD
                         Well, she... uh...

                                     JENNY
                         Was she nekkid?

               Embarrassed to admit it...

                                     EDWARD
                         Yeah.

                                     JENNY
                              (matter-of-fact)
                         It's not a woman, it's a fish. No 
                         one ever catches her.

               Given the day he's had so far, Edward isn't inclined to follow 
               up on the issue. He starts to wade back to the bank.

                                     JENNY (CONT'D)
                         Fish looks diff'rent to diff'rent 
                         people. My daddy said it looked like 
                         the coon dog he had when he was kid, 
                         back from the dead.

               Edward climbs up onto the shore, completely drenched. He 
               pulls up his pant legs to reveal three shiny leeches clinging 
               to his skin.

                                     EDWARD
                         Shoot.

               He starts to work pulling them off.

               EXT. PATH BACK TO TOWN - NIGHT

               Edward and Jenny walk back.

                                     JENNY
                         How old are you?

                                     EDWARD
                         Eighteen.

                                     JENNY
                         I'm eight. That means when I'm 
                         eighteen, you'll be 28. And when I'm 
                         28, you'll only be 38.

                                     EDWARD
                              (a little wary)
                         You're pretty good at arithmetic.

                                     JENNY
                         And when I'm 38, you'll be 48. And 
                         that's not much difference at all.

               Eager to get off this subject...

                                     EDWARD
                         Sure is a lot now, though, huh?

               EXT. MAIN STREET - NIGHT

               As Edward and Jenny approach Main Street, they find "downtown" 
               has been transformed. Lanterns and streamers hang on cables 
               across the street, and a small stage has been built at one 
               end to hold FIDDLERS.

               The whole town is there in celebration of its newest citizen, 
               Edward Bloom. Before he can protest, two WOMEN have grabbed 
               him by the arms, pulling him in to dance with them.

               The resulting dance number seems both choreographed and 
               complete chaos. From FARMER to BAKER'S WIFE, everyone wants 
               to dance with Edward, who finds himself tossed around like a 
               stick caught in a whirlpool. Still, he's having a blast.

               Jenny grabs both his hands, and they spin wildly.

               Beamen plucks his LAUGHING daughter away to dance with her.

               Then Mildred cuts in to dance with Edward. It's hard to hear 
               over the MUSIC.

                                     MILDRED
                         Jenny thinks you're quite a catch. 
                         We all do.

                                     EDWARD
                              (not hearing)
                         What?

                                     MILDRED
                         I said you're quite a catch!

               Edward stops dancing. A beat, then he heads for the edge of 
               the crowd. Beamen is there, with Jenny on his shoulders.

                                     EDWARD
                         I have to leave. Tonight.

                                     BEAMEN
                         Why?

                                     EDWARD
                         This town is everything a man could 
                         ask for. And if I were to end up 
                         here, I'd consider myself lucky. But 
                         the fact is, I'm not ready to end up 
                         anywhere.

                                     BEAMEN
                         No one's ever left.

                                     JENNY
                         How are you gonna make it without 
                         your shoes?

                                     EDWARD
                         I suspect it will hurt a lot.

               And with that, Edward walks down Main Street. The townspeople 
               stop dancing, disbelieving, some shaking their heads.

               Poor Edward Bloom's gone crazy.

                                     BEAMEN
                              (calling after him)
                         You won't find a better place!

                                     EDWARD
                         I don't expect to.

               Jenny runs to him. She'd tackle him if she could.

                                     JENNY
                         Promise me you'll come back.

                                     EDWARD
                         I promise. Someday. When I'm really 
                         supposed to.

               It's not good enough, but it will have to do. Edward keeps 
               walking. 

               EXT. THE DARK FOREST - NIGHT

               VARIOUS SHOTS: Edward negotiates the thorns in his bare feet. 
               It's horrible. Almost unendurable.

               And then it gets worse.

               The trees ahead are moving. At first, it just seems to be 
               the wind blowing the branches, but as we hear the wood 
               CRACKING and GROANING, there's no mistaking it: they're trying 
               to block him.

               Snake-like WHITE ROOTS shoot out of the ground, grabbing for 
               his ankles. He leaps up, kicking off one tree trunk to grab 
               another one's branches. He swings off, lands and rolls. Now 
               all the trees are moving to block him, their dark shapes 
               towering over him in the flashes of LIGHTNING.

                                     EDWARD (V.O.)
                         As difficult as it was to reach 
                         Spectre, I was fated to get there 
                         eventually. After all, no man can 
                         avoid reaching the end of his life.

               As he ducks under branches, the chain holding the Key to the 
               City gets caught. He's almost strangled, but the chain finally 
               breaks. The silver key disappears into the mud.

               Scrambling forward, he looks for a way out. But the trees 
               have encircled him, their spiky crowns bending down to crush 
               him.

               He SCREAMS up at the night, until his breath is gone.

                                     EDWARD
                         And then I realized, this wasn't the 
                         end of my life.

               With a sudden calm...

                                     EDWARD
                              (aloud)
                         This isn't how I die.

               Another lightning FLASH, and suddenly the trees are back 
               where they've always been. Edward is lying shoeless and torn 
               in a muddy puddle, staring up at the rain. And LAUGHING.

               EXT. THE ROAD - DAY

               His bare foot steps onto asphalt.

                                     A DEEP VOICE
                         Friend!

               Edward turns to see

               KARL

               to his right, coming down the larger, paved road.

                                     KARL
                         What happened to your shoes?

               Edward looks down at his muddy, bloody feet.

                                     EDWARD
                         They got ahead of me.

               With that, the men start walking down the larger road.

                                                              CROSSFADE TO:

               INT. DINING ROOM - NIGHT

               Edward and Will sit at opposite ends of the table, with Sandra 
               and Josephine in the middle. Although Edward has a small 
               plate of food in front of him, he hasn't touched it. He's 
               exhausted from the trip downstairs, but determined to maintain 
               the family dinner ritual.

               The other three eat awkwardly, each CLINK and SCRAPE of a 
               knife or fork resonating. Will finally breaks the silence.

                                     WILL
                         I don't know if you've seen it, but 
                         Josephine has some photos in the 
                         most recent Newsweek.

                                     SANDRA
                         Really! That's wonderful.

                                     JOSEPHINE
                         I spent a week in Morocco for the 
                         story. It was incredible.

                                     SANDRA
                         We'll have to pick up a copy.

               A beat. As Will scoops out another serving of potatoes, Edward 
               suddenly speaks:

                                     EDWARD
                         I don't know if you're aware of this, 
                         Josephine, but African parrots, in 
                         their native home of the Congo -- 
                         they speak only French.

               All three stop to listen.

                                     JOSEPHINE
                              (amused)
                         Really.

                                     EDWARD
                         You're lucky to get four words out 
                         of them in English. But if you were 
                         to walk through the jungle, you'd 
                         hear them speaking the most elaborate 
                         French. Those parrots talk about 
                         everything: politics, movies, fashion -- 
                         everything but religion.

               Taking the bait...

                                     WILL
                         Why not religion, Dad?

                                     EDWARD
                         It's rude to talk about religion. 
                         You never know who you're going to 
                         offend.

               A beat.

                                     WILL
                         Josephine actually went to the Congo 
                         last year.

                                     EDWARD
                         Oh, so you know.

               INT. GROCERY STORE - NIGHT

               Will shakes a shopping cart free from the pile-up while his 
               mother checks her list.

               AT THE PRODUCE SECTION

               Sandra starts to bag string beans.

                                     WILL
                         Mom, would you say you understand 
                         Dad?

                                     SANDRA
                         Of course.

                                     WILL
                         What I mean is, do you really know 
                         what's going on in his head? 

                                     SANDRA
                         Yes.

                                     WILL
                         How is that possible? I mean, you 
                         try to ask him a question and suddenly 
                         it's another one of his stories.
                              (decidedly)
                         You can't honestly say you know him.

                                     SANDRA
                         Yes, Will, I do. And don't presume 
                         things you don't know.

               She's more amused than annoyed, but Will is entering dangerous 
               territory.

                                     SANDRA
                         Would you say you understand 
                         Josephine?

                                     WILL
                         Yes. But that's a different...

                                     SANDRA
                         No it's not. It's exactly the same. 
                         Your father and I met, we dated, and 
                         we married -- we chose each other -- 
                         because we understood each other on 
                         some fundamental level. Just the 
                         same as you two.

               She moves on to the carrots.

                                     WILL
                         Josephine and I have a lot in common.

                                     SANDRA
                         Yes, you both think William Bloom is 
                         a very smart man.
                              (beat)
                         The problem is, you only see me as 
                         your mother, and not as someone's 
                         wife. And I've been his wife longer 
                         than I've been your mother. You can't 
                         discount that.

                                     WILL
                         True. But I've known him my whole 
                         life, and I don't feel like I know 
                         him at all. Or ever will.

               With a look, Sandra acknowledges the stakes.

                                     SANDRA
                         I know it's not easy. Just remember, 
                         he didn't choose to be your father 
                         and you didn't choose to be his son. 
                         You just ended up together. You could 
                         pick numbers out of a dark bag and 
                         it'd be just the same. If you ask 
                         me, it's a wonder parents and children 
                         can stand each other at all.

                                     WILL
                         But I understand you, Mom. I always 
                         have.

                                     SANDRA
                         Well, clearly you don't. But I'm not 
                         the mystery you're trying to solve 
                         right now.

               INT. AT THE CHECKOUT - NIGHT

               Reaching the CASHIER, Sandra hands over her coupons. Will is 
               approaching with a Newsweek magazine.

               Two checkstands over, an ATTRACTIVE BLONDE WOMAN in her 50's

               is getting her change. Though she's Sandra's generation, she 
               carries herself like a much younger woman, with blue jeans 
               and sneakers.

               She accidentally makes eye contact with Will as he passes. 
               We HOLD ON the woman, who tracks Will as he reaches Sandra. 
               It's hard to read her reaction: does she recognize him, or 
               just find him attractive?

               Will notices the gaze. The woman turns away.

               Will racks his brain -- does he know this woman?

                                     SANDRA
                         Before I forget, your father has 
                         papers in the basement I'd like you 
                         to go through. I wouldn't know what's 
                         important.

                                     WILL
                              (distracted)
                         Mom, do you know who that is? Blonde 
                         hair.

               Sandra looks. After a beat, the Blonde Woman turns again, 
               semi-casually. Noticing that both Will and Sandra are looking, 
               she smiles a little before taking her cart to leave.

                                     SANDRA
                              (no idea)
                         Was she one of your teachers?

                                     WILL
                         No. But it's weird. She seemed to 
                         recognize me.

                                     SANDRA
                              (to the cashier)
                         Do you know who that is?

               The Cashier turns to look. He can only get a profile as the 
               woman leaves.

                                     CASHIER
                         Never seen her before. Pretty, though.

               INT. GUEST BEDROOM - NIGHT

               A portable fan quietly WHIRRS in the corner. Turned low, the 
               RADIO on the nightstand is playing a call-in AM sports show, 
               just a wash of background chatter. Edward lies asleep on his 
               back.

               At the window, Josephine quietly lowers the shade. She reaches 
               over Edward to switch off the radio. He stirs from the silence -- 
               he wasn't fully asleep -- and sees Josephine stretched over 
               him.

                                     EDWARD
                              (playfully lecherous)
                         Hello.

               She smiles.

                                     JOSEPHINE
                         Hi. How are you feeling?

                                     EDWARD
                         I was dreaming.

                                     JOSEPHINE
                         What were you dreaming about?

               He tries to recollect, but it's already gone. Josephine 
               motions, is it okay for her to sit on the bed? He nods.

                                     EDWARD
                         I don't usually remember unless 
                         they're especially portentous. You 
                         know what that word means, portentous?

               She shakes her head.

                                     EDWARD
                         Means when you dream about something 
                         that's going to happen.
                              (beat, gathering)
                         Like one night, I had a dream where 
                         this crow came and told me, "Your 
                         Aunt is going to die." I was so scared 
                         I woke up my parents. They told me 
                         it was just a dream, to go back to 
                         bed. But the next morning, my Aunt 
                         Stacy was dead.

                                     JOSEPHINE
                         That's terrible.

                                     EDWARD
                         Terrible for her, but think about 
                         me, young boy with that kind of power. 
                         Wasn't three weeks later that the 
                         crow came back to me in a dream and 
                         said, "Your Grampa is going to die." 
                         Well, I ran right back to my parents. 
                         My father said, no, Gramps is fine, 
                         but I could see there was trepidation. 
                         And true enough, that next morning 
                         my Grampa was dead.

               He sits up a bit in bed, his strength returning.

                                     EDWARD
                         For the next couple weeks, I didn't 
                         have another dream. Until one night 
                         the crow came back and said, "Your 
                         Daddy is going to die."
                              (beat)
                         Well, I didn't know what to do. But 
                         finally I told my father. And he 
                         said not to worry, but I could tell 
                         he was rattled. That next day, he 
                         wasn't himself, always looking around, 
                         waiting for something to drop on his 
                         head. Because the crow didn't tell 
                         how it was going to happen, just 
                         those words: your Daddy is going to 
                         die. Well, he went into town early 
                         and was gone for a long time. And 
                         when he finally came back, he looked 
                         terrible, like he was waiting for 
                         the axe to fall all day. He said to 
                         my mother, "Good God. I just had the 
                         worst day of my life."
                              (beat)
                         "You think you've had a bad day," 
                         she said. "This morning the milkman 
                         dropped dead on the porch!" Josephine 
                         smiles, a half-laugh, which gets him 
                         smiling too.

               A long beat. Then, deadpan...

                                     EDWARD
                         Because see, my mother was banging 
                         the milkman.

                                     JOSEPHINE
                         No, I understand.

                                     EDWARD
                         He was slipping her a little extra 
                         cream.

               She nods, a bit more of a laugh.

                                     EDWARD
                         He was filling her basket. He was 
                         making deliveries around back.

               As Edward continues, she can't help but laugh harder, 
               especially as the metaphors get more vulgar.

                                     EDWARD
                         He was buttering her rolls. Pumping 
                         her churn. Splashing milk in her 
                         box.

                                     JOSEPHINE
                         Stop.

                                     EDWARD
                         They were squeezing the cheese. 
                         Clanking the bottles. Licking the 
                         popsicle.

               She's starting to cry from laughing.

                                     EDWARD
                         Cracking the eggs and making an 
                         omelet.

               With that, he stops. She regains her composure.

                                     EDWARD
                         Spooning the sherbet.

                                     JOSEPHINE
                              (interrupting)
                         Can I take your picture?

                                     EDWARD
                         You don't need a picture. Just look 
                         up handsome in the dictionary.

                                     JOSEPHINE
                         Please?

               He rolls his eyes, why not.

               Josephine leaves, heading down the hall to get her camera. 
               We STAY WITH Edward in bed.

                                     JOSEPHINE (O.S.)
                         I have photos from the wedding to 
                         show you. There's a great one of you 
                         and my father. I had an extra print 
                         made.

               Edward grimaces, a flash of pain. Around others, he's hiding 
               how much it hurts, but alone we can see how bad it is.

               He controls his breathing, trying to push through it.

                                     JOSEPHINE
                         I want to see pictures of your 
                         wedding. I've never seen any.

               She returns with her camera. Edward smiles, doing a good job 
               masking the pain.

                                     EDWARD
                         That's because we didn't have a 
                         wedding. Your mother-in-law was never 
                         supposed to marry me. She was engaged 
                         to somebody else.

                                     JOSEPHINE
                              (loading film)
                         I never knew.

                                     EDWARD
                         Will never told you that?
                              (she shakes her head)
                         Probably just as well. He would have 
                         told it all wrong anyway. All the 
                         facts and none of the flavor.

                                     JOSEPHINE
                         Oh, so this is a tall tale?

                                     EDWARD
                         Well, it's not a short one.

               A devilish smile. Pushing past Edward, we settle on the 
               whirling fan.

                                                              MATCH CUT TO:

               SPINNING PINWHEEL

               held by a LITTLE BOY. He's slumped over his FATHER's shoulder, 
               being carried towards a big-top tent. We are...

               EXT. OLYMPIA CIRCUS - NIGHT

               ...where the second-rate carnival is parked for the moment 
               in an Alabama field. To the left, we spot Edward, 20-ish, 
               halfway through a bag of peanuts. He's still carrying the 
               backpack we saw earlier, and scratched up from his trip 
               through Spectre.

                                     EDWARD (V.O.)
                         I had just left Ashton, and was on 
                         my way to discover my destiny. Not 
                         knowing what that would be exactly, 
                         I explored every opportunity that 
                         presented itself.

               Joining the crowd, he heads into the big-top.

               INT. BIG TOP - NIGHT

               A troupe of STILT-WALKING FIREBREATHERS finishes their act 
               to tremendous APPLAUSE.

               As the performers clear away, the circus' owner-and-ringmaster 
               AMOS CALLOWAY (50) approaches the stands. He may only be 
               four feet tall, but Amos has a titanic presence.

                                     AMOS
                         Ladies and Gentlemen, you may think 
                         you've seen the unusual. You may 
                         think you've seen the bizarre. But 
                         I've travelled to the five corners 
                         of the world, and let me tell you, 
                         I've never seen anything like this.

               From behind Amos, CARNIES start rolling a massive ball towards 
               the crowd.

                                     AMOS
                         When I found this man, he was picking 
                         oranges in Florida. His fellow workers 
                         called him El Penumbra -- The Shadow -- 
                         because when you were working beside 
                         him, he blocked out the daylight. He 
                         could take a whole tree in his hands 
                         and shake off the fruit. I had to 
                         pay his crew boss $10,000 just so I 
                         could take him with me.

               Amos comes up to a MIDDLE-AGED WOMAN in the first row, a 
               quieter moment.

                                     AMOS
                         Not to alarm you, Ma'am. But if this 
                         man wanted to, he could crush your 
                         head between his toes.
                              (she trembles)
                         But he won't.
                              (a long beat)
                         He's not going to hurt her, folks, 
                         because he's our own Gentle Giant. 
                         Ladies and Gentlemen, I give you 
                         Colossus!

               The carnies back away from the ball as a deep DRUM ROLL 
               begins. A moment, then the ball starts to bulge from inside.

               A foot suddenly bursts out from within. GASPS from the crowd. 
               That foot is massive. In the stands, Edward looks closer. 
               Intrigued.

               As the drum beat intensifies, a second foot breaks out. 
               Followed by hands. Shoulders. Finally, the head. This is 
               COLOSSUS.

               From a very LOW ANGLE, we look up to see just how massive he 
               is. He seems to fill the Heavens. With his shaved head and 
               giant club, he seems more ogre than man.

               In the bandstands, a YOUNG BOY's jaw drops in awe. Colossus 
               walks down the row, letting the crowd get a better look at 
               him. Some reach out to touch him, disbelieving. A tight 
               spotlight follows him, revealing faces in the crowd.

               Colossus passes Edward, who seems unimpressed. He leans with 
               the spotlight, WHISTLING to get the big man's attention.

               He points to the edge of the stands, where his friend is 
               sitting on the dirt --

               KARL THE GIANT

               stands up, so big the spotlight has to widen just to hold 
               him. He's a good foot taller than Colossus. There's a GASP 
               from the crowd, along with nervous anticipation -- what will 
               happen next?

               ANGLE ON Amos, stunned, megaphone dangling.

               ANGLE ON Colossus, realizing the gig is up. With a resigned 
               shrug, he rests his club on his shoulder and walks away into 
               the shadows.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. BIG-TOP - NIGHT / LATER

               As the stands empty, Edward and Karl talk to Amos.

                                     AMOS
                         What's his name? Does he talk? It's 
                         not important.

                                     KARL
                         Karl.

                                     AMOS
                         Tell me Karl, have you ever heard of 
                         the term "involuntary servitude?"

               Karl shakes his head.

                                     AMOS
                         "Unconscionable contract?"

               Nope.

                                     AMOS
                         Great, great. That's fantastic.

                                     EDWARD (V.O.)
                         It was on that night Karl met his 
                         destiny. And I met mine. Almost.

               INT. BIG TOP - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS

               As Amos pulls Karl aside to give him the hard sell, Edward 
               notices a BEAUTIFUL YOUNG WOMAN (16) leaving with her family. 
               She's wearing a blue dress and hat. For no good reason, she 
               looks back at Edward.

               The two make eye contact. And as they do, all motion FREEZES.

               A fiery baton remains mid-twirl, flames locked in place. A 
               spilled box of popcorn hangs in mid-air, each kernel like a 
               snowflake. Even the elephant is mid-poop.

               Only Edward is free to move, winding his way between the 
               frozen bodies, ducking underneath arms to get closer and 
               closer to this woman.

                                     EDWARD (V.O.)
                         They say when you meet the love of 
                         your life, time stops. And that's 
                         true. What they don't tell you, is 
                         that once time starts again, it moves 
                         extra fast to catch up.

               Suddenly, everything RUSHES. The crowd becomes a blur, and 
               the young woman is lost in its wake. Now it's Edward who's 
               frozen, helpless in time.

               EXT. DIRT PARKING LOT - NIGHT

               Edward checks in windows as cars pull out, searching for his 
               fated love. Not finding her, he becomes more frantic, running 
               down the rows.

                                                              CROSSFADE TO:

               THE EMPTY LOT

               Colossus is thumbing for a ride. The last pickup truck stops 
               and lets him climb in back.

               As the truck pulls out, it passes a dejected Edward. He'll 
               never find that girl, the love of his life.

               INT. BIG-TOP - NIGHT

               Amos leans over so Karl can sign a contract on his back. He 
               spots Edward walking back into the tent.

                                     AMOS
                         Hey kid! Your friend just made himself 
                         a star.

                                     EDWARD
                         That's great.

               Amos hands off the contract to a CLOWN.

                                     (INTRODUCING)
                         My attorney, Mr. Soggybottom.

                                     EDWARD
                         Good to meet you.

               Mr. Soggybottom HONKS his horn, then waddles off.

                                     AMOS
                         What's the matter with you, kid? I 
                         haven't seen a customer so depressed 
                         since the elephant sat on that 
                         farmer's wife.
                              (beat)
                         Get it? "Depressed?"

               Karl chuckles.

                                     AMOS
                         See! The big guy likes it.

                                     EDWARD
                         I just saw the woman I'm going to 
                         marry, I know it. But then I lost 
                         her.

                                     AMOS
                         Tough break. Most men have to get 
                         married before they lose their wives.

                                     EDWARD
                              (with absolute 
                              conviction)
                         I'm going to spend the rest of my 
                         life looking for her. That or die 
                         alone.

                                     AMOS
                         Jesus, kid.
                              (realizing)
                         Let me guess. Real pretty, blonde 
                         hair, blue hat?

                                     EDWARD
                         Yes!

                                     AMOS
                         I know her uncle. Friends of the 
                         family.

                                     EDWARD
                         Who is she? Where does she live?

                                     AMOS
                         Kid. Don't waste your time. She's 
                         out of your league.

               As Amos starts to walk away, Edward hurries to catch up with 
               him. Karl follows as well.

                                     EDWARD
                         What do you mean? You don't even 
                         know me.

                                     AMOS
                         Sure I do. You were hot shit back in 
                         Hickville, but here in the real world, 
                         you got squat. You don't have a plan. 
                         You don't have a job. You don't have 
                         anything but the clothes on your 
                         back.

                                     EDWARD
                         I've got a whole backpack full of 
                         clothes!

               He points to the bleachers, where no backpack is to be found.

                                     EDWARD
                              (realizing)
                         Someone stole my backpack.

                                     AMOS
                         Kid, you were a big fish in a small 
                         pond. This here is the ocean, and 
                         you're drowning. Take my advice and 
                         go back to Puddleville. You'll be 
                         happy there.

               Getting in front of Amos, Edward stops him.

                                     EDWARD
                         Wait. You said I don't have a plan. 
                         I do. I'm going to find that girl 
                         and marry her and spend the rest of 
                         my life with her.

               Amos smiles, amused.

                                     EDWARD
                         I don't have a job, but I would have 
                         a job if you gave me one. And I may 
                         not have much, but I have more 
                         determination than any man you're 
                         ever going to meet.

                                     AMOS
                         Sorry, kid. I don't do charity.

                                     EDWARD
                         I'll work night and day, and you 
                         won't have to pay me. You just have 
                         to tell me who she is.

               Amos takes a long look at him. Ultimately, there's no way he 
               can say no. He shrugs. What the hell.

                                     AMOS
                         Every month you work for me, I'll 
                         tell you one thing about her. That's 
                         my final offer.

               Edward shakes Amos's hand before he can retract the offer. 
               We move into a MONTAGE:

               INT. BIG TOP CENTER RING - NIGHT

               CLOSE ON Edward, smiling nervously. His head is tilted to 
               the side, and as we PULL BACK, we see why: he's holding it 
               in a MASSIVE LION's open mouth. The beast's sharp teeth are 
               just poking his skin. If the lion so much as flinches, Edward 
               is dead.

               The CROWD applauds, which makes the lion antsy. Which makes 
               Edward antsier.

                                     EDWARD (V.O.)
                         From that moment on, I did everything 
                         Mr. Calloway asked, and a lot of 
                         things he didn't. I'd go three days 
                         without stopping to eat, and four 
                         days without sleeping.

               EXT. THE HYDRA - DAY

               His eyes droopy from lack of sleep, Edward mans the whirling 
               amusement park ride.

                                     EDWARD (V.O.)
                         The only thing that kept me going 
                         was the promise of meeting the girl 
                         who would be my wife.

               Nodding off, Edward falls backward, into the path of the 
               spinning arms. One of the Hydra cars hits him square in the 
               gut, throwing him up and away, sailing 200 feet through the 
               air.

               EXT. FIELD - DAY

               Edward chases a costumed pig, tripping over tent cords, 
               falling in the mud.

               His hunt leads him through the back of a tent, where he's 
               unwittingly stepped in front of a line of motorized birds. 
               To the left, CUSTOMERS are shooting with rifles. He dodges 
               four SHOTS that knock down the birds around him.

               He catches his breath, lucky.

               Then a half-blind OLD WOMAN pulls her trigger, hitting him 
               in the shoulder.

               EXT. BEHIND A TENT - DAY

               Karl the Giant bandages Edward's arm as well as he can. Amos 
               is walking past.

                                     EDWARD
                         Mr. Calloway! It's been a month today.

               Amos stops, looks at the young man. Finally...

                                     AMOS
                         This girl, the love of your life. 
                         Her favorite flower is daffodils.

               He walks away. We PUSH IN on Edward, enraptured by the 
               concept.

                                     EDWARD
                         Daffodils.
                              (to Karl)
                         Daffodils!

               INT. STABLES - DAY

               Edward shovels shit in the nastiest stables you've ever seen. 
               But all he can think about is...

                                     EDWARD
                              (to himself)
                         Daffodils!

               The wonder of it. He goes back to shoveling, a smile on his 
               face.

                                     EDWARD (V.O.)
                         True to his word, every month Amos 
                         would tell me something new about 
                         the woman of my dreams.

               INT. A DARK PLACE - NIGHT

               CLOSE ON Edward, lost in quiet reverie, pondering his latest 
               bit of information.

                                     EDWARD
                         College! She's going to college!

               A sudden EXPLOSION as Edward is shot...

               INT. BIG TOP - NIGHT [CONTINUOUS]

               ...out of a giant cannon.

               INT. STABLES - NIGHT

               Under a full moon, Edward feeds the animals.

                                     EDWARD
                              (to himself)
                         Music! She likes music. I like music 
                         too!

                                     EDWARD (V.O.)
                         Over the months, I learned a lot 
                         about the woman I was going to marry, 
                         but not her name, and not where to 
                         find her.

               That time had come. I couldn't wait any longer.

               EXT. AMOS CALLOWAY'S TRAILER - NIGHT

               Under a full moon, Edward walks up to the battered camper, 
               and is about to knock when he notices it's rocking. A lot. 
               Not just that, there's MOANING coming from inside.

               But Edward KNOCKS anyway.

                                     EDWARD
                         Mr. Calloway! It's Edward Bloom. I 
                         need to talk to you.

               Suddenly, the rocking and moaning stop. A beat, then the 
               door handle begins to RATTLE. It seems to be stuck.

               Edward turns the knob.

               Suddenly, the door BURSTS OPEN. Edward is knocked down by a 
               massive black dog, biggest you've ever seen. It has green 
               glowing eyes and a lick of fire for a tongue.

               Edward wrestles with the beast, its mouth snapping at his 
               throat. 

               Blocking with an arm, Edward tries to push himself free, but 
               the creature's hands -- it has hands instead of paws -- hold 
               on tight.

               Entwined, they roll across the dirt. The other nearby CARNIES 
               scatter for cover. Mr. Soggybottom pulls a revolver out of 
               his clown suit. Loads a silver bullet.

               Edward finally succeeds in throwing the beast off. He rolls 
               to his feet.

               The hell hound squares back on its haunches, GROWLING, ready 
               for another leap. Mr. Soggybottom sheds a clown tear, aiming 
               the revolver at the dog.

               At the last moment...

                                     EDWARD
                         No, wait!

               Edward moves just as Mr. Soggybottom FIRES. The bullet catches 
               Edward in the shoulder, knocking him down.

               The carnies GASP.

               Licking its chops, the dog approaches the helpless Edward, 
               who feels the ground around him, looking for some kind of 
               weapon. He finds only a small stick. He waves it at the dog, 
               ready to strike it.

               Like magic, the dog's whole demeanor changes. It bounces 
               excitedly, ready to play fetch.

               Seeing an opportunity, Edward throws the stick as far as he 
               can. The dog bounds after it,

               SMASHING DOWN THREE CARS.

               It returns a beat later with the flaming stick, which it 
               drops at Edward's feet. Its tail whips back and forth.

                                     EDWARD
                         It was that night I discovered that 
                         most things you consider evil or 
                         wicked are simply lonely, and lacking 
                         in the social niceties.

               Edward throws the stick again. The dog takes off in a new 
               direction.

                                                             TRANSITION TO:

               EXT. FIELD - PRE-DAWN

               Exhausted from playing fetch all night, Edward throws the 
               stick into the woods. The still-spry dog goes after it. It's 
               gone for a long time, long enough that Edward becomes 
               concerned.

               He follows it into the woods.

               INT. WOODS - DAWN

               Amos Calloway stands up behind a bush, buck naked and hairy. 
               He still has the stick in his mouth, which he takes out as 
               Edward approaches.

                                     AMOS
                         Didn't kill anything, did I?

                                     EDWARD
                         A few rabbits, but I think one of 
                         them was already dead.

                                     AMOS
                         That would explain the indigestion.

               Edward tosses him his jacket to cover his privates.

                                     AMOS
                         I was wrong about you kid. You may 
                         not have much, but what you got, you 
                         got a lot of. You could get any girl.

                                     EDWARD
                         There's only one I want.

               A beat.

                                     AMOS
                         Her name is Sandra Templeton. She's 
                         going to Auburn. The semester's almost 
                         over, so you better hurry.

                                     EDWARD
                         Thank you.

                                     AMOS
                         Good luck, kid.

               Edward walks away. Then starts running. He has to get there 
               as soon as possible.

               Amos sits down and scratches his ear with his foot.

               EXT. BIG TOP - DAY

               Edward shakes Karl's giant hand. They hug.

                                     EDWARD (V.O.)
                         After saying my goodbyes, I hopped 
                         three trains to get to Auburn that 
                         afternoon.

               EXT. AUBURN UNIVERSITY - DAY

               We DESCEND ON the main quad, to find Edward Bloom dunking 
               his head in the fountain.

               He changes out of his grubby shirt into a new one, just out 
               of the package. It's the mid-1960's, but by the conservative 
               dress of the passing STUDENTS, it could be any era.

               EXT. SORORITY HOUSE - DAY

               Edward stands with a bouquet of daffodils in front of a half-
               open door. Through the crack we can see the edge of a YOUNG 
               WOMAN, talking in hushed tones with another girl we can't 
               see.

               Finally, a decision is reached. The door opens to reveal the 
               woman of Edward's dreams, Sandra Kay Templeton. She's 
               effortlessly beautiful, pure and simple as sunlight.

               He can't believe he's finally reached her. He half-laughs, 
               nervous. That makes her laugh, not sure what's going on.

                                     EDWARD
                         You don't know me, but my name is 
                         Edward Bloom and I am in love with 
                         you. I've spent the last three years 
                         working to find out who you are. 
                         I've been shot and stabbed and 
                         trampled a few times, had my ribs 
                         broken twice, but it's all worth it 
                         to see you here, now, and to finally 
                         get to talk to you. Because I am 
                         destined to marry you. I knew that 
                         from the first moment I saw you at 
                         the circus. And I know it now more 
                         than ever.

               ON SANDRA, overwhelmed. All she can finally think of to say 
               is...

                                     SANDRA
                         I'm sorry.

                                     EDWARD
                         Don't need to apologize to me. I 
                         mean, I'm the luckiest person you're 
                         going to find today...

               She puts her hand on the door frame. On her left ring finger, 
               we see a diamond.

                                     SANDRA
                         No I'm sorry, I... I'm engaged to be 
                         married.

               ON EDWARD as his heart falls 20 floors. He tries to suppress 
               the reaction, put on a brave front.

                                     EDWARD
                         Oh.

                                     SANDRA
                         But you're wrong. I do know you, at 
                         least by reputation. Edward Bloom 
                         from Ashton. See, I'm actually engaged 
                         to a boy from Ashton. Don Price. He 
                         was a few years older than you.

                                                              FLASHCUTS TO:

               EXT. CREEPY OLD HOUSE - THE GATE - NIGHT

               Young Don Price shines his flashlight on Edward.

               VARIOUS H.S. ATHLETIC COMPETITIONS 93

               Recapping earlier football, baseball and basketball 
               highlights, we find Edward beats Don every time.

               THE STREET CORNER / ASHTON PARADE

               A smoking Don Price crushes his cigarette as Edward leaves 
               town.

                                                                   BACK TO:

               EXT/INT. SORORITY HOUSE - THE DOORWAY

               Edward is dumbstruck. With all the strength he can muster...

                                     EDWARD
                         Well. Congratulations. I'm sorry to 
                         have bothered you.

               He turns and walks down the front steps.

               She stays in the doorway for a few beats, feeling genuinely 
               horrible for what's happened. But eventually she goes back 
               inside. We hear GIGGLES from inside as her sorority sisters 
               get to the bottom of this.

                                     SANDRA
                         Stop it. It's not funny. That poor 
                         boy.

               We LEAD Edward as he walks away, tears just starting to form.

                                     EDWARD (V.O.)
                         Fate has a cruel way of circling 
                         around on you. After all this work 
                         to leave Ashton, the girl I loved 
                         was now engaged to one of its biggest 
                         jerks.

               He EXITS FRAME, leaving only the sorority house in the 
               background.

                                     EDWARD (V.O.)
                         There's a time when a man needs to 
                         fight, and a time when he needs to 
                         accept that his destiny is lost, 
                         that the ship has sailed, and that 
                         only a fool would continue.

               A beat. Edward steps back INTO FRAME, looking at the sorority 
               house.

                                     EDWARD (V.O.)
                         The truth is, I've always been a 
                         fool.

               We CIRCLE as he shouts:

                                     EDWARD
                         Sandra Templeton! I love you! And I 
                         am going to marry you!

               INT. SORORITY HOUSE FOYER - DAY

               Sandra and her SISTERS peer out through the curtains. Is 
               this guy crazy?

               INT. LECTURE HALL - DAY

               The tweedy ECONOMICS PROFESSOR continues his explanation. 
               Sandra isn't paying a lot of attention.

               He switches on the overhead projector without looking at it. 
               There's a TITTER from the STUDENTS, but he doesn't notice.

               A classmate nudges Sandra, who looks up. Written on the 
               projector is "I Love Sandra Templeton." She's horrified and 
               excited at the same time. The professor finally notices what's 
               written there.

               EXT. QUAD - DAY

               Walking with her books, Sandra shakes her head, disbelieving. 
               We look up to the blue sky, where a giant sky-written heart 
               floats in the wind.

               INT. SANDRA'S BEDROOM - [THE NEXT] MORNING

               At her Sisters' prompting, a just-woken Sandra looks out the 
               second-story window to find the lawn filled with

               TEN THOUSAND DAFFODILS.

               Edward stands amid the sea of flowers. He's waited there six 
               hours.

               EXT. SORORITY HOUSE - DAY

               Sandra walks out to him. She's smiling, confused, joyful and 
               scared. All down Greek Street, STUDENTS are coming out to 
               see the display.

                                     SANDRA
                         Daffodils?

                                     EDWARD
                         They're your favorite flower.

                                     SANDRA
                         How did you get so many?

                                     EDWARD
                         I called everywhere in five states 
                         and explained this was the only way 
                         I could get my wife to marry me.

               Out of nowhere, a tear drops down Sandra's cheek. She wipes 
               it off.

                                     SANDRA
                         You don't even know me.

                                     EDWARD
                         I have the rest of my life to find 
                         out.

               From down the street...

                                     A MAN'S VOICE
                         Sandra!

                                     SANDRA
                         It's Don. Promise me you won't hurt 
                         him.

                                     EDWARD
                         If that's what you want, I swear to 
                         it.

               The adult DON PRICE arrives. He's 230 pounds of football-
               playing, Skynyrd-loving, fraternity-proud muscle. And he's 
               pissed.

               A gang of his BROTHERS walk behind him.

                                     DON PRICE
                         Bloom!

                                     EDWARD
                         Don.

                                     DON PRICE
                         What the hell are you doing? This is 
                         my girl. Mine!

                                     EDWARD
                         I didn't know she belonged to anybody.

               Don Price decks him, knocking him down. Edward gets right 
               back up, but makes no move to defend himself.

               Unfazed, Don slugs him again.

                                     SANDRA
                         Stop it!

                                     DON PRICE
                              (ignoring)
                         What the matter, Bloom? Too scared 
                         to fight back?

                                     EDWARD
                         I promised I wouldn't.

               A beat. Don shrugs, fine. Then proceeds to kick Edward's ass 
               nine ways to Sunday.

                                     EDWARD (V.O.)
                         While I took the beating of a 
                         lifetime, it was Don Price who was 
                         ultimately defeated.

               As the ass-whupping continues, we 

                                                             INTERCUT WITH:

               INT. FRATERNITY HOUSE BATHROOM - DAY [FLASHFORWARD]

               Sitting on the can, Don Price pinches a loaf while reading 
               the new Playboy.

                                     EDWARD (V.O.)
                         All the physical activity had worsened 
                         a congenital valve defect. Put simply, 
                         his heart wasn't strong enough.

               Don Price squeezes down hard, trying to shit the unshittable. 
               Suddenly, he grasps his chest and collapses face-first on 
               the tile.

                                                              MATCH CUT TO:

               EXT. WITCH'S HOUSE / GATE - NIGHT [FLASHBACK]

               The same image of Don's dead face on the tile is reflected 
               in The Eye.

                                                         RETURNING BACK TO:

               EXT. THE SORORITY HOUSE - DAY

               The thrashing continues. Edward somehow fights his way back 
               to his feet, ready to be knocked down again.

                                     SANDRA
                         Don!

               Don is about to slug Edward again when he turns.

               Sandra pulls off her engagement ring. There's an audible 
               AHH! from her sisters, and an OHH! from Don's brothers.

                                     SANDRA
                         I will never marry you.

               A beat. Don stands stunned, his mind reeling.

               Edward, whose eyes are swollen almost shut, keeps waiting 
               for the next punch. Where is it? What's going on?

                                     DON PRICE
                         What. You love this guy?

                                     SANDRA
                         He's almost a stranger and I prefer 
                         him to you. 

               She hands him the ring. Another beat, then Don storms off. 
               But not before decking Edward one last time.

               Sandra leans over Edward's broken body. His head lies on the 
               daffodils.

                                     SANDRA
                         How can I convince you to stop?

                                     EDWARD
                         Go out with me.

               He smiles, his teeth bloody.

                                     SANDRA
                         Okay.

               As the crowd of students APPLAUDS and CHEERS, we CRANE UP 
               above the flowered battlefield.

                                     EDWARD (V.O.)
                         As it turned out, Sandra was able to 
                         keep her same date at the chapel. 
                         Only the groom had changed.

               As the MUSIC reaches a crescendo, we suddenly...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. GUEST ROOM - NIGHT [PRESENT]

                                     JOSEPHINE
                         I thought you said you didn't have a 
                         church wedding.

                                     EDWARD
                         Well, we were all set to, but there 
                         was a complication.

               He reaches for his glass of water, but Josephine already has 
               it for him. She watches him while he slowly drinks the entire 
               glass, thirstier than he imagined. While he's drinking, we...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - NIGHT [CONTINUOUS]

               Will, back from the grocery store, reaches the top of the 
               stairs. He hears voices coming from the bedroom.

                                     JOSEPHINE (O.S.)
                         Is it the medicine that's making you 
                         thirsty?

                                     EDWARD (O.S.)
                         Truth is, I've been thirsty my whole 
                         life. Never really known why.

               Will quietly approaches the door, not exactly sneaking, but 
               not exactly announcing his presence. The door is open a few 
               inches, letting him look in on his father and his wife.

               INTERCUT HALLWAY / BEDROOM

                                     EDWARD
                         There was one time when I was 
                         eleven...

                                     JOSEPHINE
                              (gently)
                         You were talking about your wedding.

                                     EDWARD
                         I didn't forget. I was just working 
                         on a tangent. See, most men, they'll 
                         tell a story straight through, and 
                         it won't be complicated, but it won't 
                         be interesting either.

                                     JOSEPHINE
                         I like your stories.

                                     EDWARD
                         And I like you.

               He doesn't let the moment linger with undue sentimentality. 
               There's a story to be told.

                                     EDWARD
                         Now. The thing about working for a 
                         circus is you don't have a regular 
                         address, and after three years I had 
                         a lot of undelivered mail.

               In the hallway, Will shifts to a new position, letting himself 
               listen to the story one more time.

                                     EDWARD
                         During the four weeks I was in the 
                         hospital, the postmaster finally 
                         caught up with me.

               INT. HOSPITAL - DAY

               Bruised and bandaged, Edward sorts through a big bag of mail 
               with help from Sandra. He rips open an official-looking 
               letter. Reading it, his face drops.

               FLUTE and DRUM, music rising to a military cadence.

                                     EDWARD (V.O.)
                         It turned out that while my heart 
                         belonged to Sandra, the rest of my 
                         body belonged to the U.S. Government.

               INT. ARMY AIRPLANE - NIGHT

               With a buzz cut and paratrooper gear, Edward squats with a 
               dozen other SOLDIERS. The noise of the ENGINES is deafening, 
               but Edward is engrossed in an Asian phrasebook.

                                     EDWARD (V.O.)
                         A hitch in the Army was up to three 
                         years at that point, and having waited 
                         three years just to meet Sandra, I 
                         knew I couldn't survive being away 
                         from her that long. So I took every 
                         hazardous assignment I could find, 
                         with the hope of getting my time 
                         down to less than a year.

               The JUMP LEADER yells...

                                     JUMP LEADER
                         GO! GO! GO!

               One by one the men jump out, their chutes clipped to a main 
               line. When his time comes, Edward leaps...

               ...but he's stuck. His cord is caught up in the assembly.

               He twists and struggles, trying to free himself. Looking 
               down, he can see the white parachutes disappearing into the 
               darkness. They're already long gone.

               Digging a knife out of his pocket, Edward gets to work cutting 
               through the cable. It finally POPS. Edward jumps from the 
               plane.

               EXT. OUTSIDE STAGE - NIGHT

               A THOUSAND CHINESE SOLDIERS sit, bored, watching the 
               equivalent of a U.S.O. show.

               A CHINESE VENTRILOQUIST is on stage with his Communist puppet. 
               We have no idea what they're saying to each other, but every 
               act is fundamentally the same.

               The EMCEE comes on to usher him off the stage before he's 
               finished. The Ventriloquist protests, but finally gives in. 
               The Emcee makes a "shoot him in the neck" motion to one of 
               the ARMED GUARDS off-stage.

               EXT. HIGH ABOVE THE STAGE - NIGHT

               We LOOK DOWN with Edward, who is drifting right for the stage. 
               He can't steer. He's helpless.

               But then, a BLAST of fireworks from the sides of the stage. 
               The lights go out as a DRUM ROLL begins. It's just enough 
               cover for Edward to remain unseen.

               He lands with a CLANG on the lighting catwalk above the stage. 
               He barely grabs on, disconnecting his chute just as the 
               curtain goes up. Edward looks out at the sea of excited 
               soldiers. Every one of them would kill him. He's the legless 
               cricket left on the anthill.

               EXT. ON STAGE

               The curtain rises to reveal PING (27) at a microphone. She's 
               as gorgeous a woman as you'll ever see.

               She stands with her hips turned in profile. Her body is a 
               knockout, dress cut to reveal skin. The soldiers are on their 
               feet, WHISTLING and HOLLERING.

               UP ON THE CATWALK, Edward is surprised by an ENEMY SOLDIER. 
               The two men begin to SCUFFLE.

               MUSIC starts, a vampy torch song. Ping sings melody while an 
               off-stage voice carries perfect harmony.

                                     PING
                         Sometimes a girl can feel so alone 
                         Without a lover to call her own. 
                         Sometimes it's so bad, she wants to 
                         explode. 
                         Wants to grab the first man she sees 
                         and tear off his clothes.

               A ROAR from the soldiers. She knows what they want.

               Still fighting, Edward jumps for a pole on the far side of 
               the catwalk, sliding down it to end up

               BACKSTAGE.

               His determined opponent follows him down.

                                     PING (CONT'D)
                         But she won't.
                         No, she can't. 
                         She needs a special special different 
                         unusual man. 
                         Because that girl, 
                         Who looks like me, 
                         She has wants, but she has needs.

                                     PING
                              (speaking)
                         Any of you got needs?

               The soldiers ROAR LOUDER, STOMPING on the bleachers.

               Backstage, the two men are still fighting.

                                     PING
                              (chorus)
                         I've had twice the adventure, 
                         Cried double the tears. 
                         Two times the bad times in half the 
                         years. 
                         I need a strong man, because I've 
                         got 
                         Twice the love to give.

               For the first time, Ping turns, and now we see why she was 
               standing in profile. Ping is one-half of

               SIAMESE TWINS.

               Her identical twin is JING, who's been singing harmony all 
               this time. They are two separate women who join at the waist, 
               one set of perfect legs beneath them.

               Edward sees the twins from behind, does a double-take. It 
               costs him a punch to the jaw.

                                     PING
                         Say hello, Jing.

                                     JING
                         Hello Jing.

                                     PING
                              (to the crowd)
                         I'm Ping. She's Jing. She's the good 
                         one.
                              (closer)
                         I'm the bad one.

               As the MUSIC builds towards the climax, Edward finishes the 
               fight, knocking the guard out with a right hook.

               As Ping and Jing reach the last chorus, they strike a final 
               pose in the shape of a heart, their arms forming the arches, 
               their backs forming the curves.

               Edward slips behind curtains, trying to get away.

               The soldiers are SHOUTING for an encore, lighters waving. 
               The curtain slowly lowers, revealing

               EDWARD'S PARACHUTE.

               The APPLAUSE dies, replaced by a concerned RUMBLE. The Emcee 
               yells for the Guards to search.

               ON STAGE

               Ping has no idea what's happening. Jing reaches into her 
               cleavage to pull out her eyeglasses.

               INT. DRESSING ROOM - NIGHT

               As ARMED GUARDS search the halls below the stage, Ping and 
               Jing shut the door to their dressing room. At the closet, 
               they start to change outfits. Off-stage, their personalities 
               become quite apparent: Ping is brash, bitchy and ambitious, 
               while Jing is quiet, sweet and bookish.

               In Chinese, subtitled...

                                     PING
                         How could you miss your cue? You 
                         make me look like a fool, out there 
                         alone.

                                     JING
                         You weren't alone.

               Ping HUFFS, turning her back on her sister.

               Jing reaches deeper into the closet to find a new dress, 
               exposing Edward's hiding place. She GASPS. Ping turns to 
               look.

                                     PING
                         Who the hell are you?

                                     EDWARD
                              (in Chinese)
                         I'm not going to hurt you.

                                     PING
                         Damn right you're not.
                              (yelling)
                         GUARD!

               Jing grabs her, a hand over her mouth, but it's too late. A 
               rifle-toting GUARD looks in.

               Pretending to be her bitchy sister --

                                     JING
                         Tell your men not to bother us! And 
                         lock that door!

               The guard obeys. Ping shakes her sister off. Desperately 
               flipping through his Asian phrasebook, he finds...

                                     EDWARD
                         Please, I need your help.

                                     PING
                         What makes you think we'll help you?

               Edward pulls a photo out of his flak jacket. It's Sandra.

                                                              CROSSFADE TO:

               VARIOUS SHOTS

                                     EDWARD (V.O.)
                         Over the next hour, I described my 
                         love for Sandra Kay Templeton, and 
                         the ordeal that brought me before 
                         them. As it had always been, this 
                         love was my salvation. It was destined 
                         to be.

               Hearing the story, Jing wipes away a tear. Even Ping is a 
               little affected.

                                     EDWARD (V.O.)
                         We put together an elaborate plan 
                         for escape, involving a whaling ship 
                         to Russia, a barge to Cuba and a 
                         small, dirty canoe to Miami. We all 
                         knew it would be dangerous.

               Still subtitled:

                                     PING
                         And what are we supposed to do when 
                         we get to America?

                                     EDWARD
                         I can get you bookings. I know the 
                         biggest man in show business.

                                     JING
                         Bob Hope?

                                     EDWARD
                         Bigger.

                                                             TRANSITION TO:

               EXT. TEMPLETON FAMILY HOUSE - DAY

               Sandra checks the mail, hoping for a letter from Edward.

                                     EDWARD (V.O.)
                         And so the twins and I began our 
                         arduous journey halfway around the 
                         world. Unfortunately, there was no 
                         way to send a message back to America.

               A black car pulls up. Two ARMY OFFICERS get out.

                                     EDWARD (V.O.)
                         And so it was no surprise that the 
                         Army believed I was dead.

               Hearing the news, Sandra CRIES OUT. The pain of her shout 
               makes church bells RING.

               EXT. BEHIND THE TEMPLETON HOUSE - DAY

               Sandra hangs sheets to dry on the clotheslines, forming a 
               tunnel of fabric.

                                     EDWARD (V.O.)
                         After four months, Sandra had gotten 
                         over the worst of the nightmares. 
                         When the phone rang, she didn't think 
                         it was somehow me calling her. When 
                         a car drove past, she didn't get up 
                         to check out the window.

               Pulling a dress out of the basket, Sandra looks up to see

               A MAN'S SILHOUETTE

               on the sheet in front of her. She freezes, watching the shadow 
               ripple across the white fabric, blowing so softly in the 
               breeze. She knows it can't be him. He's dead.

               She turns away. With all the strength she can gather, she 
               hangs up that dress and digs another one out of the basket.

               Looking up, she sees not a shadow but Edward himself standing 
               before her. She GASPS, disbelieving, but his hand is real. 
               It is destiny.

               Without another moment's hesitation, she kisses him.

                                                              CROSSFADE TO:

               BRIGHT SUNLIGHT

               filters through soft sheets. We're under the covers, where a 
               man's hand traces the curves of a woman's bare back. A beat, 
               then she turns over in bed, revealing her to be

               JOSEPHINE.

               She blinks slowly, just waking up. Will is watching her. 
               He's been up for a while. We are actually...

               INT. WILL AND JOSEPHINE'S ROOM - DAY

               ...where the couple stays cocooned under the sheets, a kind 
               of limbo. A kiss good morning. Legs entangling. Neither wants 
               to get up.

                                     JOSEPHINE
                         I talked with your father last night.

                                     WILL
                         Did you?

               A look to say, should I be worried?

                                     JOSEPHINE
                         You never told me how your parents 
                         met.

                                     WILL
                         They met at Auburn.

                                     JOSEPHINE
                         What about the details? How they 
                         fell in love. The Circus. The War. 
                         You never told me any of that.

                                     WILL
                         That's because most of it never 
                         happened.

                                     JOSEPHINE
                         But it's romantic.

               A beat.

                                     WILL
                              (non-committal)
                         Mmm.

                                     JOSEPHINE
                         Mmm, what?

                                     WILL
                         Mmm, what. I know better than to 
                         argue romance with a French woman.

               He moves his head out from under the sheet. She follows him 
               to the "outside."

                                     JOSEPHINE
                         Do you love your father?

                                     WILL
                         Everyone loves my father. He's a 
                         very likeable guy.

                                     JOSEPHINE
                              (repeating)
                         Do you love him?

               Will doesn't want to answer yes or no.

                                     WILL
                         You have to understand. When I was 
                         growing up, he was gone more than he 
                         was here. And I started thinking -- 
                         maybe he has a second life somewhere 
                         else. With another house, another 
                         family. He leaves us, he goes to 
                         them. Or maybe there is no family. 
                         Maybe he never wanted a family. But 
                         whatever it is, maybe he likes that 
                         second life better. And the reason 
                         he tells all those stories is because 
                         he can't stand this boring place.

                                     JOSEPHINE
                         But it's not true.

                                     WILL
                         What is "true?" I've never heard my 
                         father say a single true thing.

               Off her silence...

                                     WILL
                         Look, I know why you like him. I 
                         know why everyone likes him. But I 
                         need you to tell me I'm not crazy.

                                     JOSEPHINE
                         You're not.

                                     WILL
                         I need you on my side.

                                     JOSEPHINE
                         I am always on your side. And I think 
                         you should talk to him.

               INT. GUEST ROOM - DAY

               The family finishes eating breakfast off TV trays set up 
               around the bed. For his part, Edward is looking better. 
               Certainly not recovered, but there's an optimism to his 
               expression. And for the first time, he's actually hungry.

               He watches as Sandra puts the cap back on the syrup.

                                     EDWARD
                         Did I ever tell you about how...

                                     WILL
                              (interrupting)
                         Yes.

               Edward is startled.

                                     WILL
                         The maple tree and the Buick. We 
                         heard it.

                                     EDWARD
                              (re: Josephine)
                         I think someone hasn't.

                                     JOSEPHINE
                         The tree fell on the car, spilling 
                         the syrup, which attracted the flies, 
                         which got stuck to it and flew off 
                         with the whole car.

               A beat.

                                     EDWARD
                              (undeterred)
                         But the real story is how I got the 
                         car. You see...

                                     WILL
                              (interrupting)
                         Dad?

                                     EDWARD
                         Son?

                                     WILL
                         Can we talk?

               Sandra SNAPS the cap back on the syrup.

                                     SANDRA
                         I'm going to get started on dishes.

                                     JOSEPHINE
                         I'll help you.

               Both women quickly gather plates.

               Will and Edward both smile. The women clearly want this to 
               happen. It settles for a beat after they leave.

                                     WILL
                         Do you know much about icebergs, 
                         Dad?

                                     EDWARD
                         Do I? I saw an iceberg once. They 
                         were hauling it down to Texas for 
                         drinking water, only they didn't 
                         count on an elephant being frozen 
                         inside. The woolly kind. A mammoth.

                                     WILL
                              (interrupting)
                         Dad!

                                     EDWARD
                         What?

                                     WILL
                         I'm trying to make a metaphor here.

                                     EDWARD
                         Then you shouldn't have started with 
                         a question. Because people want to 
                         answer questions. You should have 
                         started with, "The thing about 
                         icebergs is..."

                                     WILL
                              (frustrated)
                         The thing about icebergs is you only 
                         see 10 percent of them. The other 90 
                         percent is below the water where you 
                         can't see it. And that's what it is 
                         with you Dad. I'm only seeing this 
                         little bit that sticks above the 
                         water.

                                     EDWARD
                              (joking)
                         What, you're seeing down to my nose? 
                         My chin?

                                     WILL
                         I have no idea who you are because 
                         you have never told me a single fact.

                                     EDWARD
                         I've told you a thousand facts. That's 
                         all I do, Will. I tell stories.

                                     WILL
                         You tell lies, Dad. You tell amusing 
                         lies. Stories are what you tell a 
                         five-year old at bedtime. They're 
                         not elaborate mythologies you maintain 
                         when your son is ten and fifteen and 
                         twenty and thirty. And the thing is, 
                         I believed you. I believed your 
                         stories so much longer than I should 
                         have. And then when I realized that 
                         everything you said was impossible -- 
                         everything! -- I felt like such a 
                         fool to have trusted you. You were 
                         like Santa Claus and the Easter Bunny 
                         combined. Just as charming and just 
                         as fake.

                                     EDWARD
                         You think I'm fake.

                                     WILL
                         Only on the surface. But that's all 
                         I've ever seen.

               Edward looks away, angry and disbelieving.

                                     WILL
                         Dad, I'm about to have a kid of my 
                         own here. It would kill me if he 
                         went through his whole life never 
                         understanding me.

                                     EDWARD
                         It would kill you, huh?

               Finally --

                                     EDWARD
                         What do you want, Will? Who do you 
                         want me to be?

                                     WILL
                         Yourself. Good, bad, everything. 
                         Just show me who you are for once.

                                     EDWARD
                         I have been nothing but myself since 
                         the day I was born. And if you can't 
                         see that, it's your failing, not 
                         mine.

               EXT. BACKYARD - DAY

               With a skimmer pole, Will cleans the leaves and debris out 
               of the pool, but it's a fool's errand. The pool has long 
               since gone native, a shiny slick of algae on the surface, 
               slime covering the cemented rocks.

               Suddenly, an underwater shape RIPPLES against the water's 
               surface. Will is so startled that he drops the pole, which 
               disappears into the murky water.

               A beat. He looks around, relieved that no one saw that. He 
               casually walks away.

               INT. BASEMENT STORAGE AREA - DAY

               The doors open to reveal Sandra, Will and Josephine, staring 
               into the mouth of oblivion. The storeroom is a museum of 
               hasty decisions and half-finished projects: partially built 
               outboard motors, dead bonsai trees, Frankensteinian 
               lawnmowers. We also find boxes of products Edward used to 
               sell.

               Clearing a path, Sandra leads Will to a roll-top desk, its 
               ribs covered in dust. Two beaten metal file cabinets sit 
               beside it.

                                     SANDRA
                         Your father decided he needed to 
                         have an office, and it wouldn't do 
                         to have it in the house. You'll know 
                         better than me what's important.

               With some effort, Will forces up the desktop. With a HISS, a 
               neighbor's cat makes a run for it. Will's getting used to 
               being startled.

               INT. BASEMENT STORAGE AREA - DAY [LATER]

               Will, Sandra and Josephine have worked through two trash 
               bags of papers to throw out. Looking through a new file, 
               Sandra makes a small sound. A memory.

                                     WILL
                         What is it?

               Sandra hands Will a yellowed telegram. He shares it with 
               Josephine.

                                     SANDRA
                         It was during the war. Your father 
                         went missing. They thought he was 
                         dead.

               Will can't believe what he's reading.

                                     WILL
                         That really happened?

                                     SANDRA
                         Not everything your father says is a 
                         complete fabrication.

               A beat, then Sandra stands.

                                     SANDRA
                         I'm going to check on him.

                                     JOSEPHINE
                         I need to lie down for a bit.

                                     WILL
                         Go.

               Josephine kisses him, then follows Sandra. Will re-reads the 
               telegram, still bewildered.

               Looking for a place to put it, he tucks it into a strange 
               mechanical hand on the desk. It clamps down automatically.

               Will smiles, a memory. He hasn't thought about this device 
               in years. We slowly PUSH IN on the telegram, held in the 
               hand.

               Edward's VOICE begins as a memory...

                                     EDWARD (V.O.)
                         After the war, the sons of Alabama 
                         returned home, looking for work. 
                         Each had an advantage over me. They 
                         were alive, while I was -- officially -- 
                         deceased.

               INT. DOWNTOWN OFFICE - DAY [STORY]

               Edward shakes hands with his new boss, a TOUPEED MAN. The 
               company is called "Confederated Products." The OFFICE LADIES 
               all love Edward.

                                     EDWARD (V.O.)
                         With my prospects few, I took a job 
                         as a travelling salesman. It suited 
                         me. If there's one thing you can say 
                         about Edward Bloom, it's that I am a 
                         social person.

               EXT. COUNTY FAIR - DAY [STORY]

               On a low platform, Edward pitches a brilliant new product to 
               the crowd.

                                     EDWARD
                         I've travelled from Tennessee to 
                         Timbuktu, and if there's one thing 
                         people have in common, is we could 
                         all use a hand around the house.

               Edward sets down a contraption, which looks something like a 
               metal lava lamp. Like a flower, it unfolds to reveal five 
               fingers and a thumb. This is the Hand Around the House.(TM)

                                     EDWARD
                         Why, with this product you can...

               QUICK MONTAGE as he demonstrates:

                                     EDWARD
                         Open a jar. Open a letter. Scratch 
                         yourself while wearing mittens. Hold 
                         a book. Hold a baby. Hold the dog 
                         away from kittens. It's strong enough, 
                         you can do a handstand with no hands 
                         at all.

               Indeed, a remarkably agile Edward is able to support his 
               entire weight on it. The crowd APPLAUDS.

                                     EDWARD
                         You can use it to point out important 
                         information. Or dangers. Or beautiful 
                         women.

               The hand points a finger at an HEAVYSET MAN IN OVERALLS.

                                     EDWARD
                         We're still working on that one.

               The crowd LAUGHS.

               EXT. A COUNTRY ROAD - DAY

               Edward drives, his hand out in the wind.

                                     EDWARD (V.O.)
                         Soon I added other products, and 
                         other cities, until my territory 
                         stretched from the coast to western 
                         Texas.

               EXT. TRAILER PARK - DAY

               Edward kisses his pregnant wife goodbye, as much in love as 
               ever.

                                     EDWARD (V.O.)
                         I could be gone for weeks at a time. 
                         But every other Friday, I'd put all 
                         the money I'd made into an account 
                         set aside for a proper house with a 
                         white picket fence.

               EXT. HORIZON SAVINGS & LOAN - DAY

               Establishing this Texas institution, we come...

               INT. HORIZON SAVINGS & LOAN - DAY

               The bank is busy with the lunch-hour crowd. Taking his place 
               in line, Edward fills out a deposit slip.

               As the line snakes around through the ropes, the man in front 
               of him gets a look at Edward.

                                     THE MAN
                         Edward? Edward Bloom?

               The man is none other than...

                                     NORTHER WINSLOW
                         It's me. Norther Winslow.

                                     EDWARD (V.O.)
                         I was astonished to see the greatest 
                         poet of both Ashton and Spectre all 
                         the way out in Texas.

               The men shake, disbelieving this lucky coincidence.

                                     EDWARD
                         I don't believe it!

                                     NORTHER WINSLOW
                         I want you to know, when you left 
                         Spectre it opened my eyes. There was 
                         a whole life out there that I was 
                         not living. So I travelled. I saw 
                         France, and Africa, half of South 
                         America. Every day a new adventure, 
                         that's my motto.

                                     EDWARD
                         That's great, Norther. I'm happy for 
                         you. I can't believe I helped.

               He's genuinely proud.

                                     EDWARD
                         So what are you up to now?

                                     NORTHER WINSLOW
                         I'm robbing this place.

               Reaching the front of the line, Norther pulls two pistols 
               out of his coat, FIRING both into the ceiling.

               SCREAMS all around. The skinny SECURITY GUARD makes a 
               halfhearted reach for his gun, but Norther waves him off. 
               The guard takes out his gun and slides it over.

                                     NORTHER WINSLOW
                              (to Edward)
                         Would you mind grabbing that?

               There's nothing threatening about his delivery -- he might 
               as well be asking for a Budweiser. Still, Edward senses it 
               would be best to do as he says. He takes the guard's gun.

                                     NORTHER WINSLOW
                              (to the crowd)
                         Now, I want all of you to lie down. 
                         I'm gonna be cleaning out the cash 
                         drawers, and my associate here is 
                         going to handle the vault. 
                              (pointing to a Teller 
                              Woman)
                         You help my friend, okay?

               The TELLER WOMAN nods.

               ANGLE ON Edward, not sure what to do. He has a gun, but he 
               truly doesn't want to shoot Norther. The Teller Woman is 
               already waving him to the back.

               He decides he better go.

               INT. AT THE VAULT - DAY

               The Teller Woman is crying as she works the combination. 
               Edward feels horrible.

                                     EDWARD
                         Look, I'm really sorry. I just don't 
                         want anybody to get hurt.

                                     TELLER WOMAN
                         It's not that, it's just...

               She pulls open the vault door.

               INT. THE VAULT - DAY

               The inner sanctum of the Horizon Savings and Loan holds 
               exactly one folding chair. Nothing else.

                                     TELLER WOMAN
                         ...there's no money. We're completely 
                         bankrupt.

                                     EDWARD (V.O.)
                         It turned out the savings and loan 
                         had already been robbed -- not by 
                         armed bandits, but by speculators in 
                         Texas real estate.

                                     TELLER WOMAN
                              (dead serious)
                         You gotta promise you won't tell 
                         anybody.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. EDWARD'S CAR - DAY

               Edward drives the getaway car, though truthfully they're 
               going just a little over the speed limit. No one's following 
               them. It's an empty country road for miles.

               Norther HOLLERS with body-tingling joy as he counts the money.

                                     NORTHER WINSLOW
                         Sixty. Eighty. Four hundred dollars! 
                         Not bad for just the drawers. Let's 
                         see what you got from the vault.

               Edward winces, but doesn't say anything yet. Digging through 
               the vault bag, Norther is surprised to find only a single 
               deposit envelope. He rips it open, revealing just a little 
               cash inside. Even some dimes and pennies.

                                     NORTHER WINSLOW
                         This is it? The whole vault.

                                     EDWARD
                         'Fraid so.

                                     NORTHER WINSLOW
                         Edward, it's got your deposit slip 
                         on it.

               Caught, Edward has to confess...

                                     EDWARD
                         Look, I just didn't want you to go 
                         empty-handed. There's something you 
                         should know, Norther. You see, the 
                         reason why...

               Edward continues his narration...

                                     EDWARD (V.O.)
                         I told Norther about the vagaries of 
                         Texas oil money and its effect on 
                         real estate prices, and how lax 
                         enforcement of fiduciary process had 
                         made savings and loans particularly 
                         vulnerable.

               Hearing this news, Norther was left with one conclusion:

               EXT. TEXAS ROAD - DAY

               Norther leans in the driver's side window.

                                     NORTHER WINSLOW
                         I should go to Wall Street. That's 
                         where all the money is.

               Edward looks over at Norther, the reality sinking in.

                                     EDWARD (V.O.)
                         I knew then that while my days as a 
                         criminal were over, Norther's were 
                         just beginning.

               The two men wave at each other as Edward drives off. At the 
               last moment, Norther calls out:

                                     NORTHER WINSLOW
                         Edward, thank you for the hand!

               He's talking about his Hand Around the House. We HOLD ON 
               Norther for a beat, dreaming of his future.

                                     EDWARD (V.O.)
                         When Norther made his first million 
                         dollars, he sent me a check for ten 
                         thousand. I protested, but he said 
                         it was my fee as his career advisor.

               EXT. BLOOM HOUSE [MID/LATE '70'S] - DAY

               Sandra is watering the garden. Will (5) runs past her to 
               greet Edward, just returned from another trip.

                                     EDWARD (V.O.)
                         Ten thousand dollars is no fortune 
                         to most men. But it was enough to 
                         buy my wife a proper house with a 
                         white picket fence.

               We reveal the Bloom house, the nicest one in the neighborhood. 
               Edward kisses his wife.

                                     EDWARD (V.O.)
                         And for that, it was all the riches 
                         a man could ever want.

               Sandra drops the hose, letting it run on the lawn.

                                                             TRANSITION TO:

               INT. BLOOM HOUSE BATHROOM - DAY [PRESENT]

               CLOSE ON Edward's hand as he turns knobs.

               CLOSE ON water SPLASHING into the claw-foot bathtub, which 
               begins to fill.

               Still wearing his pajamas, Edward climbs into the tub. 
               Carefully lowers himself.

               As the water reaches the third button up on his pajama shirt, 
               Edward suddenly slides

               UNDERWATER.

               Bubbles rise from his nose for a few beats, then stop. It's 
               quiet, except for the distant SPLASHING of water from the 
               spigot. Edward's eyes are closed.

               A long beat. Another. Then the SPLASHING water goes silent. 
               Edward opens one eye. The other eye. He sits up to find

               SANDRA

               sitting on the edge of the tub. She doesn't seem particularly 
               worried -- her husband has always done this.

                                     EDWARD
                         I was drying out.

                                     SANDRA
                         I see. We need to get you one of 
                         those plant misters. We can spray 
                         you like a fern.

               He smiles, then pulls his knees up, making room for her in 
               the tub. A beat while she considers.

               Sandra steps out of her sandals and climbs into the tub, 
               facing him. Her dress is soaked, but she doesn't mind.

               He leans forward and kisses her. When they separate, she has 
               tears hanging in her eyes.

                                     EDWARD
                         Come now.

               He wipes them away.

                                     SANDRA
                         I don't think I'll ever dry out.

               INT. BASEMENT STORAGE AREA - DAY

               Perched awkwardly on a canoe, Will's made it through another 
               file cabinet. He goes through the folders page by page, but 
               usually ends up tossing the whole thing in the trash.

               He's about to toss a file when he stops. Takes another look. 
               Something doesn't make sense.

               INT. BLOOM HOUSE / STAIRS - DAY

               Will is headed upstairs when his mother comes around the 
               corner with an armful of laundry, including her wet dress.

                                     WILL
                         Is he awake?

                                     SANDRA
                         He just fell asleep. Josephine's 
                         with him.

               She passes him. He turns.

                                     WILL
                         Mom?

                                     SANDRA
                         Yes?

               Will quickly debates whether or not to ask her...

                                     WILL
                         Did you and Dad have any other 
                         property?

                                     SANDRA
                              (thinking)
                         I suppose your grandmother's house 
                         when she passed on. But we sold that 
                         right away. Your cousin Shirley bought 
                         it.

                                     WILL
                         So you never bought any land.

                                     SANDRA
                         Heavens no. We had a hard enough 
                         time keeping the mortgage on this 
                         place.

               Will nods, just curious. He continues heading up.

               INT. WILL AND JOSEPHINE'S ROOM - DAY

               Will changes his shirt. Takes his keys off the nightstand.

               EXT. COUNTY ROAD - DAY

               Will's rental car drives past a sign reading, "Ashton, 10 
               miles."

               INT. WILL'S CAR - DAY / DRIVING

               Will checks the address on one of his father's files.

               EXT. ASHTON GAS - DAY

               Will talks to the ATTENDANT, who points him in a direction, 
               then gestures a series of left, right, left, rights.

               EXT. ROAD - DAY

               Will drives down a road that seems somewhat familiar. And 
               then we realize why: a roadsign reads "Welcome to Spectre!"

               EXT. A LONE HOUSE - DAY

               Sitting at the edge of a swamp, the little two-story feels 
               lonely, set deep in its lot. Dapples of light break through 
               the trees, a light breeze swaying the branches.

               As Will walks from the car, the WHIRR of cicadas grows. He 
               checks the number: 33. This is the house. It is surrounded 
               by a white square-picket fence, identical to his mother's. 
               Will notices this.

               Reaching the porch, we hear a PIANO playing inside. Badly.

               Re-checking the number on a form he's carrying, Will KNOCKS. 
               The piano stops.

                                     WOMAN'S VOICE (O.S.)
                         Go back to the start. Right hand 
                         only.

               The piano starts again. FOOTSTEPS.

               The door opens to reveal a blonde woman in her 50's -- the 
               woman from the grocery store. Her name is Jenny Hill.

               She and Will are startled to see each other.

                                     JENNY
                         Oh. Oh.

                                     WILL
                         Hello.

                                     JENNY
                         I wasn't expecting you.

               Confused, Will checks the name on the form.

                                     WILL
                         Are you Jenny Hill?

                                     JENNY
                         I am. And you're Will. I've seen 
                         your picture, that's how I recognize 
                         you. I almost said something at the 
                         store, but it would have been awkward.
                              (a beat)
                         Like this.

               The PIANO STUDENT, a black boy of eight, has stopped. He's 
               watching the conversation at the door. Speaking of awkward...

                                     JENNY
                              (to the student)
                         Listen, Kenny. Why don't we skip the 
                         lesson today? We can go again next 
                         week.

               She hands him five dollars out of her pocket.

                                     STUDENT
                         Do I have to give it back to my Mom?

                                     JENNY
                         I won't tell her if you won't.

               You don't have to tell him twice. He's out the door in a 
               flash.

               INT. JENNY'S KITCHEN - DAY

               While Will sips his iced tea, Jenny flips through a form she 
               never expected to see again. She hands it back to Will.

                                     WILL
                         How did you know my father?

                                     JENNY
                         This was on his sales route, so he 
                         was through here all the time. 
                         Everyone in town knew him.

               A beat. Not flinching...

                                     WILL
                         Were you and my father having an 
                         affair?

                                     JENNY
                              (taken aback)
                         Wow. Wow, you just said it. I was 
                         expecting to dance around this for 
                         another half hour.

                                     WILL
                         I've seen him with women. He flirts. 
                         He always has. On some level, I 
                         presumed he was cheating on my mother. 
                         I just never had proof.

               She moves, trying to get out of the corner he's boxed her 
               into. Once she's finally free...

                                     JENNY
                         Can I ask you a question? Why did 
                         you come here today? If you found 
                         this deed, why didn't you just ask 
                         Eddie?

                                     WILL
                         Because he's dying.

               A long beat. Jenny is taken back by the suddenness of it. 
               She's a tangle of conflicting emotions.

                                     JENNY
                         Look, I don't know how much you want 
                         to know about any of this. You have 
                         one image of your father and it would 
                         be wrong for me to go and change it. 
                         Especially this late in the game.

                                     WILL
                         My father talked about a lot of things 
                         he never did, and I'm sure he did a 
                         lot of things he never talked about. 
                         I'm just trying to reconcile the 
                         two.

               Fair enough. Jenny takes a seat across from him at the table.

                                     JENNY
                         The first thing you have to 
                         understand, is that your father never 
                         meant to end up here. And yet he 
                         did, twice. The first time, he was 
                         early. The second time, he was late.

               INT. EDWARD'S CAR / DRIVING - NIGHT

               It's late, and Edward is pensive.

                                     JENNY (V.O.)
                         Those days, your father was working 
                         for himself. If there was one thing 
                         you could say about Edward Bloom, 
                         it's that he was a social person, 
                         and people took a liking to him. One 
                         night he was returning from three 
                         weeks on the road, when he hit a 
                         thunderstorm unlike any in his life.

               The first raindrops hit the windshield. Edward turns on the 
               wipers.

               INT. EDWARD'S CAR - NIGHT - [THE STORM]

               Suddenly, a deluge descends. It's not even rain anymore -- 
               there's no space between the drops. It's like being caught 
               in a waterfall. It's that loud.

               No choice, Edward stops the car. Puts on the handbrake. Just 
               as suddenly, the sound changes -- no longer pounding, but 
               softly SPLASHING. The world is close and echoing, because --

               EXT. EDWARD'S CAR - NIGHT

               -- the car is underwater. The tires are still on the road, 
               but where there used to be air is water.

               Three catfish swim in front of his headlights.

               INT. THE CAR - NIGHT

               Realizing his plight, Edward tries to remain calm. Water is 
               trickling in through the crack between the window and the 
               door, but very slowly. For now, he's fine.

               That's when he sees her -- The Girl in the River.

               She's swimming outside the car. While we never see her face 
               exactly, she remains just as beautiful, just as mysterious, 
               as the first time we saw her.

               She puts her hand to the windshield. He puts his up to meet 
               hers. And smiles.

                                                              FLASH CUT TO:

               EXT. FIELD BY DIRT ROAD - DAY

               It's morning, and the sun shines brightly. Birds CHIRP. Trees 
               drip and the grass shines, still wet from last night's rain.

               Edward gathers the clothes that have spilled out of his 
               suitcase, which broke open when he dropped it from

               HIS CAR,

               which balances precariously ten feet up in an elm tree. As 
               Edward gathers his last pair of socks, he notices a shiny 
               piece of metal sticking out of the dirt. He pulls it out, 
               rubs it off.

               It's a key. It's the Key to the City he lost years ago.

                                     JENNY (V.O.)
                         Fate has a way of circling back on a 
                         man, and taking him by surprise.

               EXT. ROAD - DAY

               Carrying his busted suitcase, a tired Edward walks toward a 
               one-street town in the distance. We pass a rusty sign...

                                  "Welcome to Spectre."

               EXT. MAIN STREET - DAY

               Amazed and disbelieving, Edward walks down the center of the 
               road, no cars coming from either direction. He looks up to 
               find his faded shoes still dangling from the power line, 
               along with the rest of the town's.

                                     JENNY (V.O.)
                         A man sees things differently at 
                         different times in his life. This 
                         town didn't seem the same now that 
                         he was older.

               EXT. TOWN OF SPECTRE - VARIOUS SHOTS

               We look around the town, on and off Main Street. There are 
               "FOR SALE" signs in many of the windows

                                     JENNY (V.O.)
                         A new road had brought the outside 
                         world to Spectre, and with it, banks, 
                         liens and debt. Almost everywhere 
                         you looked, people were bankrupt.

               EXT. SPECTRE - DAY

               We slowly MOVE THROUGH a foreclosure auction to find Edward 
               watching. Two very corporate MEN IN SUITS, stick out among 
               the bidders.

                                     JENNY (V.O.)
                         Two different corporations were 
                         looking at buying the town, if they 
                         could get the price low enough. One 
                         wanted to open a chicken processing 
                         plant. The other, a municipal dump. 
                         Either way, Spectre would be 
                         destroyed.

               Edward raises his hand.

                                     EDWARD
                         Fifty-thousand!

               Everyone turns to look at this new bidder.

                                     JENNY (V.O.)
                         And so Edward Bloom decided to buy 
                         the town, in order to save it.

               INT. NORTHER WINSLOW'S MANHATTAN - DAY

               Edward pitches his plan to Norther.

                                     JENNY (V.O.)
                         He was never a wealthy man, but he 
                         had made other men rich, and now he 
                         asked for their favors.

               INT./EXT. VARIOUS LOCATIONS - DAY

               VARIOUS SHOTS: Expressive and passionate as always, Edward 
               talks to Ping, Jing and Amos Calloway.

                                     JENNY (V.O.)
                         Most of them had never seen Spectre -- 
                         they only had Edward's words to 
                         describe it. That's all they needed. 
                         He sold them on the dream.

                                     JING
                         You can structure it as a historical 
                         trust. But you'll need every 
                         contiguous piece of property. It's 
                         all or nothing.

               As Edward takes notes...

                                     JENNY (V.O.)
                         So first he bought the farms. Then 
                         he bought the houses. Then he bought 
                         the stores.

               INT. AL'S COUNTRY - DAY

               Finishing up with AL, Edward shakes hands.

                                     JENNY (V.O.)
                         Whatever he bought, the people were 
                         not asked to leave or pay rent or 
                         anything. They were just asked to 
                         keep doing as they were doing. In 
                         that way, he could make sure the 
                         town would never die.

               EXT. ROAD IN THE SWAMP - DAY

               Edward climbs out of his car, the road having literally 
               stopped. The sun is shining, but it can barely penetrate the 
               trees' thick canopy.

                                     JENNY (V.O.)
                         Within six months, his trust had 
                         purchased the entire town. With one 
                         exception.

               In the distance, he sees a shack, so old it's nearly fallen. 
               He walks toward it, the marshy ground SQUISHING up around 
               his feet, soaking the hems of his trousers.

               We hear a PIANO playing from inside the shack. Edward KNOCKS 
               on the half-hung door, which swings open by itself.

               INT. SHACK - DAY

               The inside is nicer than you'd think, a real home. A fire 
               burns in the stove, and curtains hang in the windows.

               With her back turned to him, Jenny Hill plays the piano. 
               Edward doesn't recognize her as the little girl who used to 
               have a crush on him. Without turning, she says...

                                     JENNY
                         You must be Edward Bloom.

                                     EDWARD
                         How did you know?

               She keeps PLAYING.

                                     JENNY
                         No one would come out here unless 
                         they had business. And no one would 
                         have business with me except for 
                         you. You're buying the town.

                                     EDWARD
                         Apparently I've overlooked this one 
                         piece of it, and I'd like to remedy 
                         that. You see, in order for the town 
                         to be preserved, the trust must own 
                         it in its entirety.

                                     JENNY
                         So I've heard.

                                     EDWARD
                         I'll offer you more than it's worth. 
                         And you know you won't have to move. 
                         Nothing will change except the name 
                         on the deed, you have my word.

               Jenny stops playing, her piece not quite finished. She turns 
               to face him. Edward still doesn't recognize her.

                                     JENNY
                         Now let me get this straight. You'll 
                         buy the swamp from me, but I'll stay 
                         in it. You'll own the house, but 
                         it'll still be mine. I'll be here, 
                         and you'll come and go as you please 
                         to one place or another. Do I have 
                         that right?

               Strange to hear it put that way, but --

                                     EDWARD
                         In so many words, yes.

                                     JENNY
                         Then I don't think so Mr. Bloom. If 
                         nothing is going to change, I'd just 
                         as soon it not change in the way it 
                         hasn't been changing all this time.

                                     EDWARD
                         It's not like you're going to lose 
                         anything. You can ask anyone in town. 
                         I've been nothing if not generous. I 
                         want the best for everyone.

               A long beat.

                                     JENNY
                         Mr. Bloom, why are you buying this 
                         land? Some sort of midlife crisis? 
                         Instead of buying a convertible, you 
                         buy a town?

               He looks at her, puzzled and surprised. No one has really 
               asked before.

                                     EDWARD
                         Helping people makes me happy.

                                     JENNY
                         I'm not convinced you should be happy.

                                     EDWARD
                         I'm sorry. Have I offended you?

               She finally turns to face him.

                                     JENNY
                         No, you did exactly what you promised. 
                         You came back. I was just expecting 
                         you sooner.

                                                              FLASHBACK TO:

               EXT. SPECTRE - NIGHT

               Young Jenny Hill watches barefoot Edward leave Spectre for 
               the first time.

                                                                   BACK TO:

               INT. SHACK - DAY

               Finally realizing who this woman is...

                                     EDWARD
                         You're Beamen's daughter. Your last 
                         name is different.
                              (realizing)
                         You married.

                                     JENNY
                         I was 18. He was 28. Turns out that 
                         was a big difference.

               Before he can say anything more...

                                     JENNY
                         I won't be selling you this house, 
                         Mr. Bloom.

                                     EDWARD
                         I see. I thank you for your time.

               A bit bewildered, Edward tips his hat to her as he leaves.

               EXT/INT. SWAMP SHACK - DAY

               Edward pulls the door shut behind him as he leaves, but it 
               breaks off in his hands. It's not the clean exit he was hoping 
               for.

               Inside Jenny looks out, surprised and annoyed.

               Edward tries to lift the door back on the hinges, but they 
               SNAP off. The door frame buckles and the whole shack CREAKS.

                                     EDWARD
                         I'm sorry.

               He tries to lean the door against the frame, but it keeps 
               slipping.

                                     JENNY
                         It's okay, just leave it.

                                     EDWARD
                         I can get it. I can just...

               He leans the door a different way. It holds for a beat then 
               falls in, SMASHING a small table.

                                     EDWARD
                         Lord, I'm sorry I...

                                     JENNY
                         Please. Go. Just go.

                                     EDWARD
                         I'll...

                                     JENNY
                         Go.

               She's dead serious. Weighing the scales of chivalry, he 
               finally backs away. Turns and heads back towards his car.

               We STAY ON Jenny, watching him go. She's furious, but there's 
               something more in her feelings for him. Something softer.

                                     JENNY (V.O.)
                         Most men in that situation would 
                         accept their failure and move on. 
                         But Edward was not like most men.

               EXT. SWAMP SHACK ROAD - ANOTHER DAY

               With Karl the Giant's help, Edward unloads a brand new door 
               from a pickup truck.

               EXT. SHACK - DAY

               While Jenny watches, half-annoyed, half-amused, Edward tries 
               to set the door square. Karl pushes against the side of the 
               house until it fits.

               INT. SHACK - ANOTHER DAY

               Holding nails between his lips, Edward puts in new windows 
               himself. Jenny is making soup, laughing at the story he's 
               telling.

                                     JENNY (V.O.)
                         As the months passed, he found more 
                         and more things to fix, until the 
                         shack no longer resembled itself.

               EXT. SWAMP - ANOTHER DAY

               Edward and Karl cut down a tree, letting in a flood of light.

               Through the golden pollen hanging in the air, we RISE UP to 
               see the shack is now

               THE LOVELY HOUSE

               we saw before. It's tiny and white, with black shutters and 
               a steep roof. A white picket fence. In every detail it is 
               impossibly charming.

               INT. JENNY'S HOUSE - DAY

               Edward is screwing a hat rack into the wall in the foyer. 
               Jenny leans against the doorframe listening to his story. 
               And watching him with deepest affection.

                                     EDWARD
                         Of course, the best part was creating 
                         new material. By the time the twins 
                         and I got to Havana, we had a whole 
                         new routine worked out for them, 
                         with just a ukulele and a harmonica.

               Finished with his work, he takes his hat off the chair and 
               hangs it on the rack. Perfect.

               A beat. A look between them. With that last job done, there's 
               no reason for him to be staying any longer.

                                     EDWARD
                         I suppose I should...

               He takes his hat off the rack.

                                     JENNY
                         You can leave it there.

               A beat. Does she really mean it?

               She comes closer. Edward holds his ground. She takes his 
               hand, lifting his hat up to the peg. She's very close -- 
               just a half-inch from kissing him when --

               -- Edward gently holds her back.

                                     EDWARD
                         No.

               She freezes, stunned and humiliated. She pulls away.

                                     EDWARD
                         Don't. Don't be embarrassed. I should 
                         never have let you think that...
                              (beat)
                         I am in love with my wife.

                                     JENNY
                         I know.

                                     EDWARD
                         And from the moment I saw her until 
                         the moment I die, she's the only 
                         one.

                                     JENNY
                         Lucky girl.

                                     EDWARD
                         I'm sorry, Jenny. I am.

               With that, he begins to leaves.

                                     JENNY
                         Wait! Edward!

               She finds a pen and hastily signs the deed to the house. 
               Hands it to him. With a look, he thanks her. Then goes.

               EXT. SPECTRE - MAGIC HOUR

               Edward takes a final look at this perfect little town.

                                     JENNY (V.O.)
                         One day, Edward Bloom left, and never 
                         returned to the town he'd saved.

               He climbs in his car and starts the engine.

               EXT. JENNY HILL'S HOUSE - DAY TO NIGHT

               As we watch, the swamp begins to overtake the house, 
               swallowing it in a tangle of vines and mossy branches.

               Shoots burst up through the planks in the porch. Snakes 
               slither through the marsh.

               Day becomes night.

                                     JENNY (V.O.)
                         As for the girl, the common belief 
                         was that she'd become a witch, and 
                         crazy at that. She became something 
                         of a legend herself.

               We REVERSE to find FOUR KIDS looking in through the rusty 
               iron gate with flashlights. A beat, then they run away.

                                     JENNY (V.O.)
                         And the story ended where it began.

               INT. JENNY HILL'S KITCHEN - PRESENT DAY

               Will and Jenny are still sitting at her table, a pitcher of 
               iced tea between them.

                                     WILL
                         Logically, you couldn't be the Witch, 
                         because she was old back when he was 
                         young.

                                     JENNY
                         No, it's logical if you think like 
                         your father. See, to him, there's 
                         only two women: your mother and 
                         everyone else.

                                     WILL
                         You didn't become crazy.

                                     JENNY
                         Well, therapy. And one day I realized 
                         I was in love with a man who could 
                         never love me back. I was living in 
                         a fairy tale.

               Will smiles to hear it called that.

                                     JENNY
                         People aren't like they are in 
                         stories. They hurt each other without 
                         meaning to. They are kind and 
                         unbelievably cruel at the same moment. 
                         Like me, now. I'm not sure I should 
                         have told you any of this.

               Her composure is starting to break.

                                     WILL
                         No, I wanted to know. I'm glad I 
                         know.

               A long beat, both staring at their iced tea. Jenny is working 
               herself into more of a state by not talking.

                                     JENNY
                         I wanted to meet you for the longest 
                         time. I did.
                              (a smile)
                         I envied you so much. The way Eddie 
                         would talk about you when you were 
                         at Missouri, that award you won. 
                         Congratulations, incidentally. And 
                         when you got the job at the A.P., 
                         everything, he was so proud of you. 
                         I mean, that's the thing. Every moment 
                         he loved you.

               She's fighting tears, not the first ones she's shed over 
               this.

                                     JENNY
                         And as brightly as the sun would 
                         shine when he was with me, every 
                         time he left it disappeared. I wanted 
                         to be as important to him as you 
                         were, and I was never going to be. I 
                         was make-believe and his other life, 
                         you, were real.

               ANGLE ON Will, sorting through his swirling thoughts.

                                     JENNY
                         You knew that, didn't you?

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. WILL'S CAR - DAY / DRIVING

               Will skips through the stations on the radio, but ultimately 
               turns it off. He's trying to think.

               EXT. BLOOM HOUSE - DUSK

               Will walks up the front steps. There's a subtle change to 
               his expression, a dark cloud lifted. He unlocks the door.

               INT. BLOOM HOUSE FOYER - DUSK

               It's half-dark and quiet in the house, no talking, no TV. 
               Will sets his keys on the table.

               INT. KITCHEN - DUSK

               Will looks in. Empty.

                                     WILL
                              (calling out)
                         Hello? Mom? Dad?

               INT. UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - DUSK

               We follow Will, looking into his and Josephine's room. He 
               aims for the guest room at the end of the hall.

               INT. GUEST ROOM - DUSK

               Looking over his shoulder, we see his father's bed is empty. 
               The sheets are in a tangle on the floor.

               A beat, then Will half-runs back down the hall. Back down 
               the stairs.

               INT. FOYER - DUSK

               Headed out, Will grabs his keys off the table. We LOOK RIGHT, 
               where the "MESSAGE" light blinks on the answering machine.

               INT. HOSPITAL ENTRANCE - NIGHT

               The hospital is so new, it's not even finished -- thick 
               plastic hangs from exposed framing. There's no one at the 
               information desk, so Will forges ahead.

               INT. HOSPITAL HALLWAY - NIGHT

               Will reads a directory board, trying to decide the best place 
               to start. Then, behind him --

                                     JOSEPHINE (O.S.)
                         Will!

               He turns to see his wife at a payphone. She hangs up. She 
               was calling him.

                                     WILL
                         What happened?

                                     JOSEPHINE
                         Your father had a stroke. He's 
                         upstairs with your mom and Dr. 
                         Bennett.

                                     WILL
                         Is he going to be okay?

               A beat. How can she answer?

               He half-smiles, realizing the idiocy of his question. Of 
               course his father's not going to be okay.

                                     WILL
                         What I mean is, will he get back to 
                         the way he was when...

               She cuts him off --

                                     JOSEPHINE
                         No. He won't. I'm sorry.

               And like that, it's done. We HOLD ON Will, reeling from the 
               news.

               INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT

               Edward sleeps peacefully, just an oxygen tube under his nose. 
               There are no beeping monitors, no blinking lights. It's 
               mercifully quiet.

               Sandra squeezes Will's hand tightly. She's holding herself 
               together, but it's been a tough day.

               Dr. Bennett has just gone through the details for the third 
               time.

                                     SANDRA
                         I don't suppose one of us could stay 
                         with him. In case he...
                              (beat)
                         In case he wakes up, one of us should 
                         be there.

                                     WILL
                         I'll stay. Why don't you go home 
                         with Josephine and I'll stay tonight.

                                     SANDRA
                              (to Dr. Bennett)
                         That's okay?

                                     DR. BENNETT
                         It's fine.

                                     SANDRA
                              (to Will)
                         You'll call if...

                                     WILL
                         I will. I'll call.

               A beat.

                                     WILL
                         Mom, do you want some time with Dad?

                                     SANDRA
                         Yes. Thank you.

               A nod, then Will holds the door for Dr. Bennett and Josephine 
               as they leave. Sandra is alone in the room with her husband.

               She neatens his hair. Holds his hand. As she kisses his 
               fingers, she tweaks her chin with them -- his signature move.

                                                             TRANSITION TO:

               INT. HOSPITAL HALLWAY - NIGHT

               Sandra waits outside the women's restroom. Her face is a 
               study in strained composure -- acknowledging the inevitable 
               but refusing to surrender to it.

               Josephine emerges.

                                     JOSEPHINE
                         I'm sorry. It seems every hour I 
                         have to...

                                     SANDRA
                         I know. It was the same when I was 
                         carrying Will. Like clockwork.

               The two women start to walk, no hurry.

                                     SANDRA
                         Do you like it, being pregnant?

                                     JOSEPHINE
                         I do.

                                     SANDRA
                         I loved it. It sounds peculiar, but 
                         I loved every minute of it. I did. 
                         Eddie was travelling a lot, so he 
                         was gone, but I felt like I always 
                         had a piece of him with me. A little 
                         part of his soul inside me. I could 
                         feel it. It was alive and kicking.

               Sandra has accidentally evoked a storm of emotion. She 
               struggles to keep it in check. Almost a whisper...

                                     SANDRA
                         I really miss that.

               With a few breaths, Sandra tries to hold on. Hold back.

                                     JOSEPHINE
                         Don't stop. Don't.

               A beat, then Sandra finally melts. Josephine holds her. The 
               two women stand together in the hallway, letting the moment 
               be.

               INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT

               Will sits in a chair beside the bed, working through the 
               crossword puzzle. A KNOCK as Dr. Bennett enters with his 
               overcoat and bag, ready to leave for the night.

                                     DR. BENNETT
                         Glad to see you're not trying to 
                         have a heartfelt talk. It's one of 
                         my greatest annoyances, when people 
                         talk to those who can't hear them.

                                     WILL
                         My father and I have an advantage. 
                         We never talk.

               Dr. Bennett smiles as he checks Edward's chart.

                                     WILL
                         How long have you known my father?

                                     DR. BENNETT
                         Thirty years. Maybe more.

                                     WILL
                         How would you describe him?

                                     DR. BENNETT
                              (re: chart)
                         Five-eleven. One-eighty. Regulated 
                         hypertension.
                              (beat)
                         How would his son describe him?

               Tables turned, Will searches for an answer. He doesn't have 
               one.

               Dr. Bennett hangs the chart back on the bed.

                                     DR. BENNETT
                         Did your father ever tell you about 
                         the day you were born?

                                     WILL
                         A thousand times. He caught an 
                         uncatchable fish.

                                     DR. BENNETT
                         Not that one. The real story. Did he 
                         ever tell you that?

                                     WILL
                              (suddenly interested)
                         No.

                                     DR. BENNETT
                         Your mother came in about three in 
                         the afternoon. Her neighbor drove 
                         her, on account of your father was 
                         on business in Wichita. You were 
                         born a week early, but there were no 
                         complications. It was a perfect 
                         delivery. Now, your father was sorry 
                         to miss it, but it wasn't the custom 
                         for the men to be in the room for 
                         deliveries then, so I can't see as 
                         it would have been much different 
                         had he been there. And that's the 
                         real story of how you were born.

               A long silence, just the sounds of the hospital, doctors 
               being paged.

                                     DR. BENNETT
                         Not very exciting, is it? And I 
                         suppose if I had to choose between 
                         the true version and an elaborate 
                         one involving a fish and a wedding 
                         ring, I might choose the fancy 
                         version. But that's just me.

               Will half-smiles.

               Patting Will's shoulder, Dr. Bennett leaves. We STAY ON Will 
               and his father for a long time, then Will takes his pen and 
               starts making a list.

               INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - VARIOUS SHOTS

               Will flips to a new page. The list keeps getting longer.

               He smiles, remembering something. On his fourth page, he 
               looks up at his motionless father. A beat, then we slowly

                                                              CROSSFADE TO:

               INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - PRE-DAWN

               It's very early morning, and the first blue light of day is 
               glowing through the vertical blinds. Still in his chair, 
               Will wakes up a bit at a time. The notepad is on his lap, 
               the pen in his hand.

               He cracks his neck, crooked from sleeping on it wrong. What 
               woke him up?

               He looks to his right. Holds his gaze for a breath.

                                     WILL
                         Dad?

               His father is awake, silently GASPING for breath. His eyes 
               are open, scared and confused.

                                     WILL
                         Dad! Do you want me to get a nurse?

               Edward shakes his head unambiguously. Will already has his 
               finger on the orange "nurse call" button, but doesn't push 
               it.

                                     WILL
                         What can I do? Can I help? Can I get 
                         you something? Water?

               Edward nods. Will pours a glass from the pitcher on the 
               nightstand. He holds it to his father's lips, but Edward 
               won't drink. He pushes it away. He wanted something else.

                                     EDWARD
                              (whispering)
                         The river.

                                     WILL
                         The river?

               It takes Edward all his strength to put together each thought. 
               It's like he's only half-there, fighting to hang on to this 
               world.

                                     EDWARD
                         Tell me how it happens.

                                     WILL
                         How what happens?

                                     EDWARD
                         How I go.

               ON WILL, realizing...

                                     WILL
                         You mean what you saw in The Eye?

               Edward nods. Yes, that's what he was trying to say.

               A long beat.

                                     WILL
                         I don't know that story, Dad. You 
                         never told me that one.

               Will pushes his fingers under his father's heavy hand, and 
               holds it. There's nothing else to do.

               Edward looks around, confused and increasingly scared. He 
               sees the end approaching, but doesn't know exactly what's 
               coming. Without the story, he's lost.

               Fighting the urge to panic --

                                     WILL
                         I can try, Dad. If you help. Just 
                         tell me how it starts.

                                     EDWARD
                         Like this.

                                     WILL
                         Okay. Okay.

               Will looks around the room, increasingly desperate. He looks 
               to the nurse call button. He really wants to press it.

               ON EDWARD, waiting for Will to begin.

                                     WILL
                         Okay. It's morning, and you and I 
                         are in the hospital. I'd fallen asleep 
                         in the chair. I wake up and I see 
                         you, and...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY [STORY VERSION]

                                     WILL
                         Dad?

               It's dawn, and the first golden glow is shining through the 
               vertical blinds.

                                     WILL
                              (louder and concerned)
                         Dad?

               We LOOK OVER to find a nimble Edward sitting up in bed, 
               combing his hair.

                                     EDWARD
                         Let's get out of here.

                                     WILL (V.O.)
                         Somehow, you're better. Different. 
                         You're getting ready to go. And I 
                         say...

                                     WILL
                         Dad, you're in no condition to...

               But Edward throws back the covers.

                                     EDWARD
                         There's a fold-up wheelchair in the 
                         bathroom. Wrap a blanket around me. 
                         As soon as we get off this floor, 
                         we'll be in the clear.

               Will heads for the bathroom. Sure enough, the wheelchair is 
               there.

                                     EDWARD
                         Hurry! We don't have much time.

               INT. HOSPITAL HALLWAY - DAY

               With the blanket draped over his head like a ghost, Edward 
               points for his son to steer the wheelchair thataway.

                                     EDWARD
                         Faster!

               They pass a HEAVYSET NURSE, who turns to look.

               Rounding a corner, they nearly crash into Dr. Bennett.

                                     DR. BENNETT
                         Will! I... What are you doing?

               Before he can answer, Will spots Edward rolling the chair 
               himself, pumping both arms. Will dashes to catch up with 
               him.

               The Heavyset Nurse leans out of Edward's hospital room.

                                     NURSE
                         Security! Stop them!

               DOWN THE HALL

               At the elevators, Sandra and Josephine step out to find Will 
               and Edward barreling straight at them.

                                     EDWARD
                         No time to explain! Follow us!

               Seeing SECURITY GUARDS heading their way, a quick-thinking 
               Sandra shoves a nearby cart into them, bowling them down.

               INT. ELEVATOR - DAY

               Will brakes hard, sliding with both feet. The chair nearly 
               crashes into the back wall as the doors close.

               EXT. PARKING LOT - DAY

               Will races Edward down the row, finally reaching the 
               Chevrolet.

               AT THE CAR

               Will lifts his father out of the chair.

                                     WILL (V.O.)
                         I pick you up and you hardly weigh 
                         anything. I can't explain it.

               Will sets him in the passenger seat.

                                     EDWARD
                         Water. I need water.

               Scrambling in back, Will finds a liter of Arrowhead. Hands 
               it off. Edward unscrews the cap, but instead of drinking it, 
               he douses himself. Soaks the blanket.

               Will pops the trunk. Starts to fold up the wheelchair.

                                     EDWARD
                         Leave it! We won't need it.

               TIRES SMOKE as the car peals out.

                                                                   BACK TO:

               INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY [REALITY]

               TIGHT ON Will, trying to hold back tears as he talks.

                                     WILL
                         And we have to take Glenville to 
                         avoid all the church traffic, because 
                         those damn church people drive too 
                         slow.

               TIGHT ON Edward, enjoying that detail. He's focused completely 
               on Will's story.

                                     WILL
                         I ask...

                                                                   BACK TO:

               EXT. GLENVILLE BLVD. - DAY [STORY VERSION]

               The Chevy slaloms through the Sunday-morning traffic.

                                     WILL (O.S.)
                         Where are we headed?

                                     WILL (V.O.)
                         You say...

               INT. CHEVY - DAY

                                     EDWARD
                         The River!

               Will stops short, the traffic backed up. He HONKS, trying to 
               get around the jam. But it's no use.

               Then, up ahead, the cars start moving, shoved aside by massive 
               hands. It's Karl the Giant, clearing a path by brute force.

               Edward leans out the window and waves. Karl waves back.

               EXT. ASHTON RIVER - DAY

               The same stretch of the river where it all began. A CROWD of 
               more than 100 waiting.

                                     WILL (V.O.)
                         As we get closer to the river, we 
                         see everybody's already there. And I 
                         mean everybody.

               Amos Calloway is here with the circus folk, including Mr. 
               Soggybottom. We also find Edward's Mother and Father, the 
               Mayor, and many others from along the way. No one has aged a 
               day since we saw them last.

               While Ping scans the horizon, Jing nuzzles with her boyfriend, 
               Norther Winslow. It's Ping who first spots the Chevrolet.

                                     PING
                         He's here!

               The crowd CHEERS. The Ashton marching band PLAYS. Jenny Hill 
               smiles. So does the Old Woman.

               We PUSH IN on the Old Woman's glass eye, where we see...

               YOUNG EDWARD

               reflected. This is what he saw.

               INT. THE CHEVROLET - DAY

               Amazed, Will turns to his father.

                                     WILL
                         It's unbelievable.

                                     EDWARD
                         Story of my life.

               EXT. RIVERSIDE - DAY

               Will gets out of the Chevrolet, overwhelmed by the crowd. 
               Behind him, Sandra, Josephine and Dr. Bennett pull up. Karl 
               comes just after that.

               Crossing to the passenger side, Will lifts his father out. 
               Strangely, he's gotten even lighter. Will carries him easily.

               Edward pulls off his shoes, tying the laces together. He 
               hands them to Josephine. She throws them up at the powerline. 
               They loop over. APPLAUSE and CHEERS.

               The crowd parts to let Will and Edward get to the river. As 
               he passes, Edward shakes some hands, pats some people on the 
               cheek, and gives others a good poke in the ribs.

                                     WILL (V.O.)
                         And the strange thing is, there's 
                         not a sad face to be found. Everyone's 
                         just so glad to see you, and send 
                         you off right.

               Will walks into the river, up to his knees. He turns back so 
               his father can face the crowd. Edward waves.

                                     EDWARD
                         Goodbye everybody! Farewell! Adieu!

                                     THE CROWD (VARIOUS)
                         Goodbye Edward! / See ya! / We'll 
                         miss you!

               But one face is missing from the crowd -- Sandra. Will turns 
               to see she's already standing in the river beside them.

               The reflection of the light off the water gives Sandra an 
               unearthly glow. She's more tranquil and more beautiful than 
               we've ever seen her.

                                     EDWARD
                         My girl in the river.

               She kisses him. He tweaks her chin. The crowd HOLLERS in 
               approval, but their moment remains strangely private. Only 
               Will is there to witness.

               As the kiss ends, Edward tries to pull off his wedding ring. 
               But it's stuck. Finally, he sucks on it, pulling it free 
               with his teeth.

               A look to Will, a smile with a glint of gold. Will takes the 
               ring out of his mouth.

               Edward suddenly drops out of Will's arms with a SPLASH. For 
               he's no longer a man, but rather

               A FAT CATFISH

               swimming at his feet.

               We watch as the catfish circles, then heads for deeper water, 
               disappearing.

               Will and his mother stand knee-deep in the water, watching 
               Edward Bloom swim away into the sunlight. Josephine is back 
               on the shore, along with the entire crowd.

               MUSIC BUILDS to a climax, then...

               Down the river, a GIANT FISH suddenly jumps out of the water, 
               cutting a beautiful arc across the sunset. It then dives 
               back under with a SPLASH.

                                                         CROSSFADE BACK TO:

               INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY

               Will has tears hanging in the corners of his eyes.

                                     WILL
                         You become what you always were. A 
                         very big fish.
                              (he smiles)
                         And that's the way it happens.

                                     EDWARD
                              (a whisper)
                         Yes. Exactly.

               Edward smiles, proud of both of them. His eyes are so pale 
               and so open, we can almost see his soul. In every atom of 
               his body, in every thought, Edward Bloom is entirely happy.

               And this is how he goes.

               INT. HOSPITAL HALLWAY - DAY

               Will shuts the door to his father's room behind him. The 
               walk to the payphones seems to take a lifetime.

               He finds a quarter, starts to dial. He has to squint to see 
               through the water in his eyes. It's ringing. And ringing. 
               The other end answers.

                                     WILL
                              (voice cracking)
                         Hi.

               That's all he can get out before the dam breaks inside him. 
               He presses closer to the phone, trying to shield himself.

               MUSIC begins that will carry us through the next passage.

               INT. HOSPITAL RECEPTION - DAY

               Will waits at reception as Sandra and Josephine come off the 
               elevator.

               INT. GUEST ROOM - DAY

               Josephine opens the curtains, letting white sunlight in. She 
               strips the bed.

               INT. BEDROOM - DAY

               Will and his mother pick out one of Edward's ties, for Will 
               to wear at the funeral. Will tries to button the cuffs on 
               the shirt he borrowed, but they're the kind that need links.

               He goes through the top drawer of the dresser, trying to 
               find a matching pair. Further down, he finds a ribbon tied 
               to

               THE KEY TO THE CITY.

               He smiles, disbelieving. It's a real thing.

               EXT. CEMETERY / ROAD - DAY

               Will helps his mother out of a black sedan. She's well-
               composed, not nearly the wreck we might have expected.

               Josephine hugs Dr. Bennett and shakes hands with his WIFE. 
               The service is crowded, more than 200 people, many more than 
               expected.

               As his mother talks to a WELL-WISHER, Will looks left to see 
               an Oldsmobile parking.

               CLOSE ON the license plates. Missouri.

               The passenger side opens, but the man who steps out is barely 
               visible over the door. He shuts it to reveal himself to be 
               70.

               It's Amos Calloway. Will doesn't recognize him.

               The Driver climbs out, a size 15 foot on the gravel. We TILT 
               UP to see this man is huge.

               This man is KARL, now 55. He's not 12 feet tall, but at least 
               six-eight.

               CLOSE ON Will, bewildered to see that this man really exists.

               EXT. CEMETERY / GRAVESIDE - DAY

               As the service gets ready to begin, Will guides his mother 
               to a seat near the grave.

               Sitting beside Will, Josephine spots a stunning ASIAN WOMAN 
               (50) behind them. A beat later, an identical face with glasses 
               peers out -- the woman's twin sister.

               It's PING and JING.

               Josephine almost GASPS. She elbows Will, who turns to look. 
               From this angle the sisters seem conjoined, but then Jing 
               steps forward. They're really two separate people. 

               A sea of familiar faces, all of them aged through the years: 
               BEAMEN, NORTHER WINSLOW, the MAYOR, and ZACKY PRICE.

               EXT. CEMETERY - DAY [LATER]

               After the service, we see the crowd gathered in small groups. 
               By the LAUGHTER and hand gestures, we can see they're telling 
               stories. They're telling Edward's stories.

               We find Will watching them.

                                     WILL (V.O.)
                         Have you ever heard a joke so many 
                         times you've forgotten why it's funny? 
                         But then you hear it again and 
                         suddenly it's new. You remember why 
                         you loved it in the first place.

               Will joins in, laughing.

               We slowly CIRCLE BEHIND a monument, letting it black out the 
               screen.

                                                             TRANSITION TO:

               EXT. BLOOM HOUSE BACKYARD - DAY [SUMMER]

               Will sits on the porch with Sandra and Josephine, watching 
               his SON play in the pool with two NEIGHBOR KIDS.

                                     SON
                              (to the other boys)
                         So he said he'd fight the giant who 
                         was fifteen feet tall.

                                     KID
                         No way.

                                     SON
                              (calling over)
                         Dad, that's right, isn't it?

                                     WILL
                         Something like that.

                                     SON
                         See. So he was a giant but my grampa 
                         was going to fight him because he 
                         wasn't afraid of anything because 
                         he'd seen how he was going to die in 
                         this old lady's glass eye...

               Will smiles as his son continues the tale, which FADES. Sandra 
               takes Will's hand in hers, just listening.

                                     WILL (V.O.)
                         That was my father's final joke I 
                         guess. A man tells his stories so 
                         many times he becomes the stories. 
                         They live on after him.

                                                              CROSSFADE TO:

               EXT. RIVER / UNDERWATER - DAY

               A fat and happy catfish swims towards us.

                                     WILL (V.O.)
                         And in that way, he becomes immortal.

               The fish passes us with a SPLASH.

               CUT TO BLACK.

          EXT. FOREST - DAWN
          
          Bare as all hell. The trees stripped of their bark and white
          like ghosts. Some torn violently from their roots and felled.
          
          STARK GRAY SUNLIGHT shafts between the trees, clouded by a
          creeping fog that obscures the true color of everything. A
          LIGHT SNOW flutters. The world monochrome, lifeless and cold.
          
          A CAT prowls across the dead earth. Barely recognizable as
          the domestic breed it might once have been. Its fur mangy and
          rank, body rib-thin from starvation. Entirely feral.
          
          It moves slowly, cautiously. Sniffing the air, scanning the
          forest, alert. Trusting nothing of its surroundings. It paces
          across a leaf-strewn clearing, closing stealthily on:
          
          A DEAD MAN, splayed face-down in the earth. His feet bare.
          Face frozen in a grim death mask. A GAPING GUNSHOT WOUND in
          his head, the dried blood caked around it matting his hair.
          
          As the cat moves closer, approaching warily:
          
          P.O.V. FROM ACROSS THE CLEARING
          
          About thirty yards away. Someone is watching. Waiting. SLOW,
          DEEP BREATHS, heard through a GASMASK RESPIRATOR.
          
          CLOSE ON A PAIR OF INDUSTRIAL GOGGLES
          
          The MIRRORED LENSES reflecting the forest clearing, locked
          onto the cat. The slow, metered breathing continues.
          
          THE CAT slows, but continues pacing toward the corpse. More
          cautious than ever. It inches forward, sniffing at the body.
          
          ON THE WATCHER. Crouched behind the mangled stump of a felled
          tree. Concealed beneath a camouflaging mesh of leaves, twigs
          and bracken. A "ghillie suit" of the kind used by snipers.
          
          THE CAT sniffs at the dead man's hand, frozen by death in a
          grotesquely contorted claw. The animal still unsure. Looks
          around again, checking its surroundings for predators.
          
          THE WATCHER moves almost imperceptibly. The leaves covering
          him rustle ever so slightly as we hear - just barely - the
          familiar creaking sound of a BOW STRING BEING DRAWN TAUT.
          
          THE CAT hears it. Looks up, alert. Staring right at the
          watcher, but he is too well camouflaged to be seen. An
          interminable, tense BEAT - is the prey going to flee?
          
          Finally, the cat turns its attention back to the carcass,
          nibbling gingerly at the flesh of the man's fingers.
          
                                                                  2.
          
          
          THE WATCHER looses the arrow. It sails across the clearing
          and SKEWERS THE CAT clean through. It drops to the ground.
          
          THE WATCHER STANDS, shaking off the ghillie suit, revealing
          him to us for the first time.
          
          He wears a weather-beaten knee-length duster. Hooded sweater
          with more layers beneath that. Torn pants and scuffed work
          boots. Everything filthy and battered from years of wear.
          
          Along with the goggles, his face remains obscured by a
          DISPOSABLE PAPER DUST MASK and a CRUDELY-FASHIONED FUR HAT
          with dangling ear flaps that may once itself have been a cat.
          
          Around his neck he wears a silver SAINT CHRISTOPHER PENDANT
          hanging from a frayed twine cord.
          
          His name is ELI.
          
          He shoulders the bow and walks across the clearing. Crouches
          beside the dead cat and pulls out the arrow. Wipes the blood
          from the shaft, then reaches down to collect the body.
          
          Suddenly the cat SCREECHES AND FLAILS WILDLY! Eli recoils,
          falling backward, stunned, as the cat - MORTALLY WOUNDED BUT
          FIGHTING TO THE DEATH - bites and claws desperately at him.
          
          Eli struggles violently with the cat, wrestling it to the
          ground and grabbing up a HUNK OF FALLEN BRANCH. He holds the
          writhing animal down and CLUBS IT until it lays still.
          
          He sits back, breathing harder than the dustmask will allow.
          He yanks it down, revealing the dirty, unshaven face beneath.
          Impossible to tell his age, but certainly not a young man.
          
          For a moment he just sits there. Then bundles up the dead cat
          and returns to the mangled tree stump. Folds away his ghillie
          suit into a nearby RUCKSACK which he hauls up onto his back.
          
          A canteen dangles from the backpack, a SHOTGUN strapped to
          its side. Eli reaches down for his final possession - an old
          SAMURAI SWORD in a scabbard which he slings across his back.
          
          He gazes up at the sky. A snowflake drifts down and lands on
          his cheek. He reaches up and brushes it away, leaving a BLACK
          SMEAR on his face. Not snow after all, but some kind of ASH.
          
          EXT. FOREST ROAD - DAY
          
          Eli emerges from the treeline onto the cracked and ruptured
          asphalt. Lined by more of those ghostly, stripped-bare trees.
          
                                                                    3.
          
          
          He sniffs the air, breathing it in. Checks the road in both
          directions. Deserted. A few yards away is the rusted, burned-
          out chassis of a CAR. He heads toward it.
          
          The car rests half on the road, half in the adjacent ditch.
          Stripped of its tires and engine. In the driver's seat is a
          MUMMIFIED BODY. A BULLET HOLE piercing its forehead.
          
          Eli regards the body dispassionately. Tries the door handle
          but it's jammed. He yanks on it harder and eventually
          wrenches it open. He leans in and checks the man's feet.
          
          They're bare. No shoes or socks. Eli curses under his breath.
          
          He leaves the car behind and heads on down the road. As he
          walks away, we see that the sole of one of his boots has worn
          loose, held in place now only by a rubber band.
          
          EXT. ROAD - DAY
          
          Eli continues down the road. He ambles along slowly, a man in
          no hurry. A man who has been walking a long time.
          
          The road has since emerged from the forest. Passing now
          through a wasteland of dead scrub brush and urban junk.
          
          The sun beats down from directly overhead. The sky has no
          color to it, paper-white. The unfiltered sun's stark light
          leaves everything seeming bleached-out, over-exposed.
          
          CRANE UP as Eli walks on. On the horizon is the silhouette of
          a CITY. Or what was once a city. Columns of BLACK SMOKE rise
          from within, casting a deathly pall over the skyline. BURNED
          AND BROKEN SKYSCRAPERS jut out like tombstones.
          
          Eli reaches a fork in the road and stops. The road he's on
          appears to wind off in the direction of the ruined city on
          the horizon. The other fork continues on into the wasteland.
          
          After a brief pause, Eli changes direction and heads off down
          the other fork, away from the city.
          
          EXT. ABANDONED TOWN - DAY
          
          Little more than a main street lined with storefronts. Eli
          walks steadily along, side-stepping rubble and debris.
          Ignoring the petrified corpses lying in the street.
          
          He passes by abandoned stores, every one picked clean. Empty
          shelves, smashed windows. Looted and burned. He doesn't even
          look inside, knowing already that he will find nothing.
          
          Until he comes to a store that does cause him to stop. An old-
          fashioned sign squeaks on rusted hinges in the breeze.
          
                                                                    4.
          
          
                    ED'S SHOES - GENTLEMEN'S AND LADIES' FOOTWEAR
          
          He steps into the doorway and pushes open the door. It swings
          open on its one remaining hinge before splintering away from
          the frame and crashing to the floor in a cloud of dust.
          
          INT. SHOE STORE - CONTINUOUS
          
          Eli steps inside. Like all the others, the store has been
          cleaned out. Shoe racks and empty boxes strewn over the
          floor. The whole place reeking of dead, musty air.
          
          Eli looks around, just to be sure. Drags his sheathed sword
          idly along the empty racks as he checks them. Nothing.
          
          As he turns back for the door, his foot nudges against a shoe
          box. It's not empty. He crouches down, flips the lid off
          hopefully... and pulls out a LADY'S HIGH-HEELED SHOE.
          
          He strokes the shoe leather with his hand. Shakes his head
          grimly, then tosses the shoe back into the box and leaves.
          
          EXT. ABANDONED HOUSE - DAY
          
          On the outskirts of town. In disrepair - peeling paint,
          broken windows, damp-stained walls - but habitable.
          
          Eli stands in the front yard, surrounded by brownish,
          overgrown weeds. Thinking it over. Turns to face the setting
          sun. It will be dark soon. He turns back toward the house.
          
          INT. ABANDONED HOUSE - DAY
          
          The front door is sent CRASHING OPEN with a hard kick,
          revealing Eli silhouetted in the fading sunlight. The shotgun
          unhitched from his pack and held ready. He moves inside.
          
          Another dead place. Flies buzzing in the still, dank air.
          Everything covered in a thick layer of dust but otherwise
          largely preserved. An eerie snapshot of a world long gone.
          
          KITCHEN
          
          Every cupboard empty. Eli checks each one, poking around in
          the dark corners with his sword, but finds nothing but dust.
          
          He opens the freezer, checks inside. Empty save for a small
          ICEBOX. The lid stuck fast with mildew and gunk. Eli digs at
          it with his grimy fingernails and manages to pry it open.
          
          Inside are the wizened, petrified remains of a HUMAN HAND.
          Floating in slimy, discolored water. The smell vile and thick
          enough to make Eli retch. He quickly jams the lid back on.
          
                                                                  5.
          
          
          BEDROOM
          
          A wooden bedframe stripped clean. The dresser drawers have
          been emptied and lie strewn across the floor. Eli moves
          toward a large walk-in closet and opens the door.
          
          No clothes inside - just the near-fossilized corpse of a MAN
          HANGING BY A NOOSE. Twisting gently back and forth.
          
          Unfazed, Eli crouches down and checks the man's feet. An old
          pair of Converse All-Stars hang limp from the man's skeletal
          ankles. Eli calmly sets about unlacing them.
          
          He checks the size; they're a fit. He upturns each shoe and
          shakes the old flakes of mummified flesh from them. Discards
          his ruined boots and puts on the sneakers, laces them up.
          
          He walks around, pacing up and down, getting a feel for the
          new shoes. They feel good. For the first time, he smiles.
          
          LATER
          
          Eli sits in the corner, roasting the carcass of the dead cat
          over a small CAMPFIRE. He cleans the animal's pelts as he
          watches it cook. Pokes at the meat with a pen-knife, checking
          it for done-ness. It appears ready to eat.
          
          He clasps his hands together in prayer.
          
                              ELI
                    Dear Lord, thank you for your
                    generosity in providing us today
                    with this bountiful feast.
          
          He speaks QUIETLY, his voice barely above a whisper. Even so,
          we catch the accent - a RASPY, OLD-WORLD MIDWEST DRAWL, like
          John Wayne or some other long-forgotten western icon.
          
                              ELI
                    Thank you for the many gifts that
                    you have given me. Thank you for
                    your protection and your guidance.
                    Thank you for bringing me this far.
                    I know my long journey's end is
                    near. I ask now only for the
                    strength and the courage to
                    complete the task that you in your
                    infinite wisdom saw fit to bestow
                    upon me over all men. I won't let
                    you down. Amen.
          
          He signs a cross over himself, then uses the knife to saw off
          a chunk of meat. Takes a bite, savoring the taste with great
          relish. To him, it's grade-A filet mignon.
          
                                                                  6.
          
          
                              ELI
                    Hey. You hungry?
          
          It appears as though he is talking to himself... until a RAT
          emerges from his coat pocket, whiskers twitching keenly. Eli
          offers it some meat. The rat gnaws enthusiastically at it.
          
          SUNDOWN
          
          The last of the waning sunlight shafts through the bedroom's
          broken window. Eli rummages through his backpack, pulls out a
          SMALL PACKAGE wrapped in cloth and tied fast with string.
          
          He sits back in his corner and carefully unwraps it. It's an
          OLD LEATHER-BOUND BOOK. The binding cracked and pages dog-
          eared, thumbed through a thousand times and more.
          
          Eli gazes lovingly at it. Lets his fingers play across the
          beat-up old leather cover. A cherished thing.
          
          He begins to read, half-hidden in the shadows of the fading
          sunlight. Silently mouthing the words as he reads them.
          
          MANY PAGES LATER
          
          Eli closes the book and parcels it back up as before.
          Replaces it in his pack, then reaches in for something else.
          
          A CAR BATTERY. Old and streaked with acid stains. Attached to
          a tangled bunch of ELECTRICAL WIRING and JUMPER CABLES. Eli
          reaches into his pocket and produces:
          
          AN IPOD. Badly beat-up, the case pretty much held together
          with duct tape. But functional. Eli attaches the battery
          cable to the iPod and places the headphones in his ears.
          
          The music plays. Mozart's Piano Concerto No. 20 in D Minor.
          Eli rests back against the wall and pushes the volume way up.
          
          THE MUSIC SWELLS. Eli's fingers dance and swoop in the air,
          as though conducting an orchestra, as he is transported by
          the music to another world, a world far from this one.
          
          MORNING
          
          Sunlight shafts through the window. Eli sits slumped in the
          exact same position, headphones still in his ears. Asleep.
          
          The rat scurries up Eli's chest and licks his face. Slowly,
          he wakes, realizing he fell asleep with his music still on.
          Checks the battery. It's dead, drained overnight. He frowns.
          
          He gets to his feet, moves to the window and checks outside.
          All seems quiet. He loads up his backpack and weapons.
          
                                                                  7.
          
          
                              ELI
                    Come on now.
          
          The rat scurries up his leg, onto his duster and disappears
          into the breast pocket. Eli turns and moves out.
          
          EXT. ABANDONED HOUSE - MORNING
          
          The gate squeaks shut behind Eli as he exits the front yard.
          
          He breathes in the air, turns to feel the warm morning sun on
          his face. Then turns away from it and walks on down the road.
          
          EXT. ROAD - DAY
          
          The landscape barren and featureless, road lined with dead
          trees. Eli walks along the warped and broken asphalt.
          
          The road is strewn with burned-out cars and debris from a
          world long dead. A warped metal sign by the side of the road
          reads: LITTER REMOVAL NEXT TWO MILES BY: "CIRCUIT CITY".
          
          Up ahead is a HUNCHED FIGURE by the side of the road. Eli
          arrives to see that it's a YOUNG WOMAN. Bone-thin, dressed in
          filthy rags. Skin plagued by an unpleasant rash.
          
          The SHOPPING CART she was pushing has overturned into a
          roadside ditch, spilling its contents. Blankets, tins of
          food, old clothes. She's on her knees trying to gather it up.
          
          She looks up as she sees Eli approaching. Instantly cowers
          from him, raising her hands to protect herself. Terrified.
          
                              YOUNG WOMAN
                    Oh. Please don't hurt me. Here,
                    take anything you want. You want
                    some food? Take it.
          
          She offers him a can of pet food with a trembling hand. Eli
          stands there looking at her. His expression impossible to
          read behind the mirrored goggles.
          
                              ELI
                    I'm not going to hurt you.
          
                              YOUNG WOMAN
                    That's what the last guys said.
          
          Eli bends down and picks up a couple of the cart's spilled
          contents. Steps forward and offers them to her.
          
                              ELI
                    Here.
          
                                                                    8.
          
          
          She blinks. Unsure. Cautiously she reaches out and takes it.
          
                              YOUNG WOMAN
                    Could you help me? The wheel came
                    off. I can't fix it. Maybe if I
                    could get it out of the ditch. But
                    I can't.
          
          Eli looks at the cart. It has come to rest in the ditch just
          inches from a THICK BRACKEN HEDGEROW that lines the road.
          
          He looks again at the girl. Her faded blouse is unbuttoned,
          revealing a little cleavage. Her skirt torn along the leg,
          showing more than a little thigh. Almost deliberate.
          
          He sniffs the air. Watches the hedgerow warily. Just like the
          cat he hunted, his senses heightened and on alert.
          
          Behind the hedge, THREE ROADSIDE BANDITS are crouched,
          waiting to pounce. Each armed with a crude blunt weapon. They
          exchange anxious looks.
          
          ELI sniffs the air again - then backs away from the girl.
          
                              ELI
                    One good thing about no soap any
                    more. You can smell the road agents
                    a mile off.
          
          The girl's face falls as Eli backs up. The three bandits
          EMERGE FROM THE HEDGEROW, brandishing their weapons. A couple
          of them wear old sunglasses and goggles similar to Eli's.
          
          The BANDIT LEADER grabs the girl by a fistful of hair as he
          passes, yanking her painfully to her feet.
          
                              BANDIT LEADER
                    Dumb bitch. What did we tell you?
          
          He pushes her away, she crumples to the road in a heap.
          
          Eli backs away, but TWO MORE ARMED BANDITS drop from hiding
          in the trees behind, cutting off his escape, surrounding him.
          
                              BANDIT LEADER
                    What you got there in the pack?
          
                               ELI
                    Nothing.
          
                              BANDIT LEADER
                    Yeah, that's what they all say. How
                    about you take it off real slow and
                    tip it out so's we can take a look?
          
                                                                  9.
          
          
          BANDIT #2 notices the shotgun strapped to the pack.
          
                              BANDIT #2
                    He's got a gun.
          
                               BANDIT LEADER
                    Shit, it ain't loaded. They never
                    are. Ain't that right, old man?
                        (BEAT)
                    Open the fucking pack or die.
          
                              ELI
                    I can't do that.
          
          The bandit leader steps forward aggressively. Now within
          striking distance of Eli. He grins, teeth filthy and rotten.
          
                              BANDIT LEADER
                    Want us to do it for you? We can
                    get it off real easy after we've
                    hacked your fucking arms off.
          
          Eli remains perfectly calm. And though he speaks with a soft,
          even tone, there is something formidable about his voice.
          
                              ELI
                    It's real important you boys listen
                    to me and understand. The man I
                    work for, you do not want to cross
                    him. See, I'm under his protection.
                    You stand in my way, you stand in
                    his. And he will cut you down with
                    a righteous fury - through me. For
                    I am his faithful instrument.
          
          BEAT. The bandit leader looks at Eli incredulously... and
          then LAUGHS. The other bandits laugh along nervously.
          
                              BANDIT LEADER
                    What the hell are you, some kinda
                    preacher?
          
                              ELI
                    Something like that.
          
                              BANDIT LEADER
                    Well I got news for you, preacher
                    man. Whatever kinda God you reckon
                    yourself to be working for, he left
                    these parts a long time ago. He
                    ain't here to protect your ass. Now
                    take off the pack and set it on the
                    ground.
          
                                                                 10.
          
          
          Eli doesn't move, doesn't say a word. The bandit leader takes
          another step forward and shoves him in the shoulder.
          
                              BANDIT LEADER
                    You fucking listening to me?
          
                              ELI
                    I hear you. You lay that hand on me
                    again and you will not get it back.
          
          The other bandits exchange nervous looks. This is not how
          it's supposed to go.
          
                              BANDIT LEADER
                    All right, I had just about enough
                    of this shit...
          
          He lunges forward, grabs the shoulder strap of Eli's pack.
          
          If you blinked, you missed it. But somehow Eli has now drawn
          his sword. A RIVULET OF BLOOD snakes down along the blade and
          drips onto the asphalt.
          
          Bandit leader's hand is still gripped firmly around Eli's
          shoulder strap. But it's no longer connected to his arm. The
          SEVERED HAND hangs there from the strap, dripping blood.
          
          Bandit leader staggers backward and raises the bloody stump
          where his hand once was. Looks at it in shock and horror.
          
                              BANDIT LEADER
                    What... you just... he just cut my
                    fucking hand off! My fucking hand!
          
          Eli pries the hand loose from the strap and tosses it onto
          the road as bandit leader's legs give out and he slumps to
          the asphalt. His eyes dart around, as though confused.
          
                              BANDIT LEADER
                    What you standin' around for? Kiss
                    him!
          
                              BANDIT #3
                    What's he talkin' about, kiss him?
          
                              ELI
                    He's in shock. He means "kill him".
          
          A tense BEAT. And then the four remaining bandits ATTACK ELI
          ALL AT ONCE, weapons flailing.
          
          Eli flourishes the sword. A BLUR, TOO FAST TO FOLLOW. But
          it's clear he is possessed of an inhuman level of skill.
          
                                                                    11.
          
          
          It is over in moments. The four bandits LAY SLAIN IN THE
          ROAD, blood pooling out onto the asphalt.
          
          The bandit leader crawls toward his severed hand, a few yards
          away. Eli steps in and kicks it out of his reach.
          
                               ELI
                    I told you you wouldn't be getting
                    that back.
          
          Bandit leader looks up to see the figure of Eli bearing down
          on him, silhouetted ominously against the sun. He looks for a
          moment like an avenging angel, something not of this world.
          
                              BANDIT LEADER
                    Who are you?
          
                              ELI
                    My name is Eli.
          
          And with that, Eli runs him through with his sword.
          
          He turns to see the young woman slumped in the road, sobbing.
          She cowers again as he approaches, certain that she is next.
          
          He WALKS PAST HER. Sheathes his sword, then pulls out the
          shopping cart from the ditch and rights it. The woman watches
          incredulously as he gathers up her supplies into the cart.
          
                              ELI
                    Take it and go on your way. And
                    don't fall in with men like these
                    again. No good can come.
          
          She looks at him, puzzled.
          
                              YOUNG WOMAN
                    Why are you doing this?
          
          Eli says nothing. Walks back to the slain bandits, crouches
          beside them and begins searching their bodies.
          
          He takes a scarf from around the neck of one. Finds a Zippo
          lighter on another, checks that it works and pockets it.
          
          LATER
          
          The five bodies are lined neatly in the ditch, half-covered
          with dirt. The best burial they are going to get.
          
          Eli stands before them, head bowed in prayer. He speaks
          quietly and quickly, a speech he has given many times.
          
                                                                   12.
          
          
                              ELI
                    God, the father of mercies, through
                    the death and resurrection of his
                    son has reconciled the world to
                    himself and sent the holy spirit
                    among us for the forgiveness of
                    sins.
          
          The young woman stands a few yards away, watching him,
          transfixed. She has never seen anyone like him.
          
                              ELI
                    Through the ministry of the church
                    may he give you pardon and peace,
                    and I absolve you from your sins in
                    the name of the father, and of the
                    son, and of the holy spirit. Amen.
          
          He turns and walks away down the road, passing the woman.
          
                              YOUNG WOMAN
                    Thank you. You're... a good man.
          
                              ELI
                    There are no good men on the road.
          
                              YOUNG WOMAN
                    Where are you going?
          
                              ELI
                    West.
          
                              YOUNG WOMAN
                    Can... can I come with you?
          
          He doesn't even turn back to look at her.
          
                              ELI
                    No.
          
          He walks on, into the horizon.
          
          EXT. FREEWAY OVERPASS - DAY
          
          Straddling the desert like a giant, crumbling monument to a
          long-dead civilization. Eli steadily climbs his way up.
          
          He comes to an abrupt stop as we realize suddenly that the
          overpass has COLLAPSED at mid-point. RUSTED IRON RODS jut out
          from where the roadway has been severed.
          
          Eli just stands there at the edge for a moment, feeling the
          wind whip around him, his coat fluttering in the breeze.
          
                                                                 13.
          
          
          The overpass's collapsed section is now just a MOUNTAINOUS
          PILE OF RUBBLE that leads down to the road below.
          
          Eli steps onto the rubble. About to make his way down when he
          FREEZES. He hears something. The faintest of sounds. He takes
          cover, peering down at the road beneath the overpass to see:
          
          TWO PEOPLE walking together on the road. We see everything
          from ELI'S P.O.V. - too far to make out much detail, but
          apparently it is a MIDDLE-AGED COUPLE.
          
          The man pushes along an OLD WHEELBARROW covered by a tarp as
          the woman, seemingly his wife, walks alongside. The barrow's
          rusted wheel gives out a plaintive, rhythmic SQUEAK.
          
          Eli ducks down again as he hears something else. This time
          much louder. The menacing growl of MOTORCYCLE ENGINES.
          
          FOUR BIKES IN TOTAL. Riding out of the horizon, closing in on
          the couple. They see the bikes coming and panic. Try
          desperately to steer the barrow off the road.
          
          The bikes screech to a halt and the FOUR RIDERS dismount.
          Brandishing a variety of weapons. The couple make a run for
          it but they're quickly chased down and tackled to the ground.
          
          The woman SCREAMS and struggles helplessly as the bikers
          swarm over the man like a pack of predatory animals.
          
          The woman is pulled to the ground and the clothes stripped
          from her. Eli turns away. He knows what comes next.
          
          Eli listens as the woman screams and screams. He reaches for
          his shotgun... hesitates... then withdraws his hand.
          
                              ELI
                    It ain't your concern. Stay on the
                    path. It ain't your concern. Stay
                    on the path.
          
          Eli repeats it like a mantra. He clearly wants to intervene,
          but will not permit himself to. Instead, he simply sits and
          waits grimly as the woman continues to scream for help. And
          then finally, suddenly, is silenced.
          
          Down below, the bodies of the man and woman lay dead and
          bloodied in the dirt. The bikers tear the tarp from the
          wheelbarrow, spilling its contents onto the asphalt.
          
          They ferret through the items, scavenging a few items - we
          don't see what - and stuffing them into an old cloth satchel.
          They leave the rest strewn in the road and ride off in the
          direction they came, dust pluming in their wake.
          
                                                                 14.
          
          
          Eli waits until the sound of the motorcycles has receded into
          the far distance before emerging from his hiding place.
          
          EXT. ROAD BENEATH OVERPASS - DAY
          
          Eli crouches on one knee before the murdered couple. He signs
          a cross over their ravaged bodies as he mutters a prayer
          under his breath. Then stands and continues on down the road.
          
          EXT. ROAD FORK - DAY
          
          More desolate wasteland as far as the eye can see. The road
          forks again here. Eli arrives at the junction and stops.
          
          The road Eli is on leads further into the west. The other
          fork heads toward a SMALL TOWN just visible on the horizon.
          
          A HAND-PAINTED SIGN has been driven into the dirt nearby. No
          words, just a series of CRUDE PICTOGRAMS. A BED. A PLATE OF
          FOOD. A WATER FAUCET. AN ARROW points toward the town.
          
          Eli pauses, thinking it over. Retrieves the iPod from his
          pocket. Clicks the button, but no response. He sighs.
          
          He turns and heads down the other fork, toward town.
          
          EXT. DESERT TOWN - OUTSKIRTS - DAY
          
          A primitive, sprawling village of tents and barn-like
          structures. Built from corrugated iron, rotted wood, molded
          plastic, tarpaulin - materials scavenged from the old world.
          
          HUDDLED RESIDENTS are dressed in little more than rags, many
          wearing goggles like Eli's to shield their eyes from the sun.
          
          Eli stands at the edge of town. Reluctant to enter, but he
          braces himself and walks on in. And as he rounds a corner,
          entering the center of town, an astonishing sight:
          
          EXT. DESERT TOWN - MAIN STREET - CONTINUOUS
          
          The broad thoroughfare now all that remains of whatever town
          once stood here. Many of the old storefronts still largely
          intact but patched up with salvaged materials. The asphalt
          street warped and cracked, parking meters bent and smashed.
          
          It's a lot like the abandoned town Eli passed through
          earlier, except VERY MUCH ALIVE - BUSTLING WITH TOWNSFOLK.
          
          It's at once a familiar and also a disturbing sight - like an
          old Norman Rockwell painting of classic small-town America,
          but filtered through the devastating eye of an apocalypse. An
          unsettling juxtaposition of the old world and the new.
          
                                                                 15.
          
          
          The centerpiece of the town is a GRAND THEATER at the head of
          the main street. THE PALLADIUM. Like the rest of the town,
          badly damaged and shoddily fixed-up. But still standing.
          
          Eli walks down the street and approaches a BLACKSMITH,
          hammering out a metal plate over an anvil outside his store.
          
                              ELI
                    You got an engineer or a fuelman
                    around here?
          
          The blacksmith doesn't look up from his work but motions
          toward a storefront at the far end of the street.
          
                              ELI
                    Thanks.
          
          Eli heads down the street. Stopping when he comes across a
          STATUE erected in the center of the road. A TALL MAN crudely
          fashioned in clay. One hand placed paternally on the head of
          a SMALL CHILD, the other outstretched toward the sun.
          
          As he observes the statue, Eli notices that passing residents
          take a moment to PAUSE AND GENUFLECT before it. Worshipping.
          
          Curious, Eli reaches up and runs his hand over the statue's
          face. Then hears SHUFFLING FEET behind him and turns as a
          PARADE OF EMACIATED MEN AND WOMEN trudges past. Roped
          together at the waist, each man leading the one behind.
          
          Heads shaved, thin from malnutrition. And each one BLIND.
          They gaze at the ground with pale, dead eyes. They carry
          picks, shovels and other tools - a sightless CHAIN GANG.
          
          Eli watches as the pathetic parade shuffles past, herded like
          cattle by a brutish CHAIN GANG BOSS who swats at them with a
          stick to keep them moving and indicate direction.
          
                              CHAIN GANG BOSS
                    Come on, move it!
          
          The gang boss glares at Eli as he passes by. Eli doesn't
          return the look, just continues crossing the street as the
          blind are herded away. Headed toward a wooden building with a
          pictogram of a LIGHTNING BOLT suspended above the door.
          
          INT. ENGINEER WORKSHOP - CONTINUOUS
          
          Whatever this place once was, it's now a kind of POST-
          APOCALYPTIC RADIO SHACK. Shelves display a variety of goods.
          Engine parts. Old electrical wiring. Small appliances.
          
          An old ELECTRIC GENERATOR rumbles noisily, powering strings
          of multi-colored CHRISTMAS LIGHTS that hang all around.
          
                                                                  16.
          
          
          Behind the main counter a convoluted Rube Goldberg-esque
          STILL is running. An ENGINEER in a leather apron pours the
          remnants of a can of motor oil into the still's funnel.
          
          Attached to the still is an old MOTORCYCLE MIRROR. In its
          reflection the engineer sees Eli checking out the store.
          
          Without turning around, he reaches surreptitiously behind the
          counter for something.
          
          Eli turns toward the counter - to find the engineer training
          a PUMP-ACTION SHOTGUN right at him.
          
                              ENGINEER
                    I don't know you.
          
          Eli slowly raises his hands.
          
                              ELI
                    I'm not from around here.
          
                              ENGINEER
                    No shit. Who are you?
          
                              ELI
                    I'm just a customer.
          
                              ENGINEER
                    A customer with a shotgun?
          
          He nods toward the shotgun visible on Eli's backpack.
          
                              ENGINEER
                    You come in here to rip me off?
          
          The engineer's hands tremble, his finger tight on the
          trigger. This man needs to be talked down carefully.
          
                              ELI
                    No. I'll set it down. Okay?
          
                              ENGINEER
                    Slowly!
          
          Eli nods. Unhitches the pack and sets it down, steps away.
          
                              ENGINEER
                    You carry a gun in the outland, you
                    don't bring one into town less you
                    live there. Don't you know that?
          
                              ELI
                    I'm sorry, I forgot. I've been on
                    the road a long time.
          
                                                                    17.
          
          
          This seems to make the engineer more suspicious of Eli.
          
                              ENGINEER
                    Show me your hand.
          
                                 ELI
                    I'm not a-
          
          The engineer jerks the shotgun at Eli nervously.
          
                              ENGINEER
                    I said show me your fucking hand!
          
          Eli raises his hand and holds it outstretched, palm faced
          downward. The engineer watches it closely for any sign of
          ticks or tremors, but Eli's hand stays steady as a rock.
          
                              ELI
                    I'm not one of them.
          
          The sight of the steady hand seems to reassure the engineer a
          little. Finally, he lowers the shotgun.
          
                              ENGINEER
                    What do you want?
          
                              ELI
                    I'm just passing through. I need
                    some help. I can pay.
          
                              ENGINEER
                    What kinda help? And what kinda
                    pay?
          
                              ELI
                    I'm going to get something out of
                    my pack. Okay?
          
          The engineer raises the shotgun nervously again.
          
                              ELI
                    I know, I know. Slowly.
          
          The engineer watches him like a hawk as Eli opens up his pack
          and pulls out the car battery. When he sees it, he gasps.
          
                                 ENGINEER
                    Holy shit.
          
          Eli places it on the counter. The engineer looks it over with
          awe, like it's a priceless historical artifact.
          
                              ENGINEER
                    Where'd you find this?
          
                                                                 18.
          
          
                              ELI
                    Years ago, in the outland back east
                    aways.
          
                              ENGINEER
                    Does it work?
          
                              ELI
                    Yeah, it just needs a charge. Can
                    you do it? I got the cables.
          
                              ENGINEER
                    Depends if you also got the coin.
          
          Eli pulls the Zippo lighter from his pocket. The engineer
          picks it up, sparks the flint, watches the flame flicker.
          
                              ENGINEER
                    It'll take a couple hours. There's
                    a bar across the street you can
                    wait, they just opened up.
          
                              ELI
                    I'll wait here.
          
                              ENGINEER
                    You don't trust me?
          
                              ELI
                        (SMILES)
                    I don't know you.
          
          INT. PALLADIUM - AUDITORIUM - DAY
          
          This once grand theater have been largely gutted - seats torn
          out, fixtures and fittings stripped, curtains ripped from the
          stage. But still, there's a sense of grandeur to this place.
          
          Looking out over the stage, a ROYAL BOX - once the most
          prestigious seat in the house - has been converted into an
          OFFICE of sorts. Seats removed and replaced by an ORNATE
          MAHOGANY DESK facing inward, a CHANDELIER suspended above it.
          
          The whole set-up is gaudy and ostentatious - the work of
          someone who wants to project an aura of power and wealth, but
          has no taste whatsoever.
          
          A TALL MAN is seated in a battered leather armchair behind
          the desk, deeply involved in an OLD PAPERBACK BOOK.
          
          The book's cover is faded and partially torn away, the title
          still just visible: 7 HABITS OF HIGHLY EFFECTIVE PEOPLE.
          
                                                                   19.
          
          
          The man is OLDER than most we've seen. His skin weathered by
          the elements and by a long life's experience. One of the very
          few people we've seen in this world close to Eli's age - and
          unlike everyone else we've seen, he appears healthy and well-
          groomed. A rich mane of hair, full set of teeth.
          
          He wears a tattered SUIT AND TIE. None of it matches,
          everything scavenged from different outfits and eras. But he
          looks almost civilized. Respectable. His name is CARNEGIE.
          
          He looks up from his book at the sound of a POLITE COUGH O.S.
          
          REDRIDGE stands before him. Tall, powerfully built.
          
                              CARNEGIE
                    What is it?
          
          His accent is like caramel. A RICH, DEEP-SOUTH DRAWL.
          
                              REDRIDGE
                    Survey team just finished up their
                    inspection. It ain't good.
          
          Carnegie lowers his book. Concerned.
          
                              CARNEGIE
                    How bad is it?
          
                              REDRIDGE
                    Pressure is down again, and going
                    by the new rod they sank levels're
                    lower than they've ever been.
          
          Carnegie stands. Thinking. This is bad news.
          
                                CARNEGIE
                    How long?
          
                              REDRIDGE
                    Hard to say. Six months, maybe. A
                    little longer if we're careful. But
                    we're already-
          
                              CARNEGIE
                    Halve the rations.
          
                              REDRIDGE
                    We just halved `em last-
          
                              CARNEGIE
                    So halve them again!
          
          BEAT. Carnegie stares Redridge down. Nobody but nobody
          questions his orders.
          
                                                                 20.
          
          
                              REDRIDGE
                    You're going to have to say
                    something. Folks were none too
                    happy last time. Gonna be worse
                    now, you can count on it.
          
          Carnegie sighs, rubs his brow. He knows Redridge is right.
          
          EXT. DESERT TOWN - MAIN STREET - DAY
          
          A LARGE CROWD OF TOWNSFOLK - several hundred strong - has
          assembled outside the Palladium theater. AN ARMED CREW OF
          CARNEGIE'S GOONS keeps watch over the crowd.
          
          Carnegie stands on a BALCONY above the theater marquee. He
          treats the balcony like a pulpit, speaking through a
          MICROPHONE connected to an old PA SYSTEM that carries his
          words to the far reaches of the crowd.
          
                              CARNEGIE
                    I want you all to remember how far
                    we've come together. And how far we
                    still can go, if only we believe.
                    When I brought us here to this
                    oasis - this promised land - we
                    knew there would be hardships. Knew
                    there would be sacrifices. But we
                    also knew that we were creating for
                    ourselves a world where we could be
                    safe from the horrors of the
                    forsaken lands beyond our borders.
          
          The crowd listens intently, hanging on Carnegie's every word.
          He is an incredibly charismatic and persuasive speaker - his
          cultivated image and inspiring, confident delivery remind us
          of a TELEVISION EVANGELIST.
          
                              CARNEGIE
                    And I want you all to remember
                    above all that it is not the water
                    with which we have been blessed
                    that is the true lifeblood of this
                    town... but faith.
          
          This sends a MURMUR OF DISCONTENT through the crowd. Many
          don't like where they suspect this may be going. Carnegie
          senses this and dials up his rhetoric - delivering it now
          with the fire-brand passion of an old-time baptist preacher.
          
                              CARNEGIE
                    It is our faith that sustains us,
                    brothers and sisters! Hallelujah!
          
                                                                 21.
          
          
          The crowd is divided. Many return the "Hallelujah" with
          varying levels of conviction. Others are not convinced. But
          Carnegie continues unabated, selling it harder than ever.
          
                              CARNEGIE
                    And mark me, the ultimate
                    validation of that faith is coming!
                    The sacred Word of Our Lord that
                    formed the world before and will
                    reform it once again is coming to
                    this town to bring it succor, bring
                    it nourishment, bring it new life!
                    For the Almighty Himself has spoken
                    unto me and promised it!
          
          Carnegie is such an impassioned and inspiring speaker it's
          almost impossible not to get caught up and swept away by his
          words. His apparently unshakable belief is infectious.
          
                               CARNEGIE
                    In the meantime, He has asked us
                    all to be patient. To walk the hard
                    road of the faithful just a little
                    longer. And to do that, we must
                    give just a little more.
                        (BEAT)
                    Water rations will be halved until
                    further notice.
          
          This sends a much broader ripple of discontent through the
          crowd - this news has not been received well at all. Some
          still "keep the faith" but many more are perturbed by this.
          
          Carnegie motions for the crowd to settle down.
          
                              CARNEGIE
                    I understand your frustration. The
                    road to salvation is a difficult
                    one - but what lies at the end of
                    that road is a greater glory,
                    beyond anything you can imagine.
          
          A DISCONTENTED VILLAGER steps forward, pushing through the
          crowd and jabbing his finger angrily up at Carnegie.
          
                              DISCONTENTED VILLAGER
                    We've heard this all before! When
                    are you going to-
          
          Carnegie's goons quickly move in and efficiently SILENCE THE
          MAN, removing him from the crowd. Dissent is not tolerated
          here. Carnegie goes on speaking as if nothing had happened.
          
                                                                 22.
          
          
                               CARNEGIE
                    I know each and every one of you
                    will understand the necessity of
                    this action. It was faith that
                    built this town - and faith that
                    will sustain it even through the
                    dark times that may lie ahead. But
                    it is always darkest before dawn -
                    and the new dawn is coming.
                        (BEAT)
                    May God go with you all.
          
          Carnegie steps back inside, leaving the crowd to talk among
          themselves, clearly mixed about what they have heard.
          
          As the assembled townsfolk disperse, FOUR MOTORCYCLES roar
          into town and pull up outside the Palladium.
          
          As the riders dismount, one detaches a CLOTH SATCHEL from his
          bike's cargo rack. The four riders head inside. They each
          have long, straggly hair and brutish expressions.
          
          We recognize them now as the BIKER BANDITS who killed the
          couple on the road under the freeway overpass.
          
          INT. PALLADIUM - SECOND FLOOR - DAY
          
          Carnegie emerges into the second-floor hallway from the
          balcony, mopping his brow. Exhausted and stressed from his
          grand theatrical display, and from its mixed reception.
          
          Redridge climbs the stairs to meet him.
          
                               REDRIDGE
                    One of the road crews just rolled
                    into town.
          
          Carnegie looks at his cracked old wristwatch.
          
                              CARNEGIE
                    Of course they did, the bar's open.
                    Outlanders, always looking for
                    answers at the bottom of a bottle.
          
                               REDRIDGE
                    Not these guys.
                        (BEAT)
                    These guys say they got something.
          
          That gets Carnegie's attention.
          
                              CARNEGIE
                    Get them up here now.
          
                                                                 23.
          
          
          INT. PALLADIUM - MAIN LOBBY - DAY
          
          What was once a grand, gilded entrance foyer has, like the
          rest of the theater, been largely gutted. But it's still
          impressive - a spacious bar area with a grand staircase
          leading up to a second floor, entrance to balcony seats, etc.
          FADED OLD THEATER POSTERS still hang from the walls.
          
          The place has been shabbily converted into a kind of SALOON.
          Old ripped-out theater seats arranged around tables. A
          FIREPLACE sputters dimly.
          
          A MANGY TABBY CAT walks across the straw-laden floor. A dozen
          or so CUSTOMERS in the place, a mixed, rough-looking bunch.
          
          Redridge emerges from an upstairs room and nods to a group of
          his MEN who are holding the bikers at the foot of the stairs.
          
          INT. PALLADIUM AUDITORIUM - CARNEGIE'S BOX
          
          Carnegie checks his reflection in a CRACKED HAND MIRROR,
          licks his palm and slicks his hair back. He adjusts his tie
          as Redridge's men usher the bikers into his "office".
          
          Carnegie wheels around and flashes a smile at them. Just as
          when he gave his balcony address, Carnegie is in performance
          mode - charismatic and slick like a campaigning politician.
          
                              CARNEGIE
                    Gentlemen! It's truly a delight to
                    see you again! I understand your
                    latest excursion into the outland
                    has been a profitable one?
          
          The bikers exchange looks. They understood maybe half the
          words in that sentence. The lead biker - named HOG - speaks.
          
                              HOG
                    We did good.
          
                              CARNEGIE
                    Well, let's see, shall we?
          
          Hog tips the satchel's contents out onto Carnegie's desk.
          
          BOOKS. About a dozen different volumes of all shapes and
          sizes. Carnegie rifles excitedly through the collection.
          
          We see various titles as he sorts through them. Treasure
          Island. The Da Vinci Code. A volume of encyclopedia. The
          Diary of Anne Frank. Tuesdays with Morrie.
          
          In amongst the books are a few MAGAZINES. An old issue of
          OPRAH magazine. A torn copy of SPORTS ILLUSTRATED...
          
                                                                 24.
          
          
          ...And a NEWSWEEK. The cover graphic illustrates OPPOSING
          NUCLEAR ARSENALS over a world globe. On one side the STARS
          AND STRIPES, on the other flags indicating a SINO-ISLAMIC
          ALLIANCE. The headline reads: "IS THERE NO TURNING BACK?"
          
                              CARNEGIE
                    No. No. No. No. No.
          
          As Carnegie rejects each book with growing disappointment and
          frustration, it's clear he's looking for a specific volume.
          
                              CARNEGIE
                    It's not here.
          
                              HOG
                    These ain't worth nothin'?
          
                              CARNEGIE
                    When you bring me the book I asked
                    you for, it'll be worth something.
          
          The bikers exchange more looks. An unspoken conversation.
          
                              HOG
                    We been doin' this a long time now.
                    Had to make a whole lotta corpses
                    to bring you all these books. You
                    want us to keep at it, reckon it's
                    worth more than a few free glasses
                    of that swill you call liquor.
          
          Carnegie's guards bristle, ready for a confrontation.
          Carnegie just smiles, always ready to smooth things over.
          
                              CARNEGIE
                    Gentlemen, gentlemen. I urge you
                    once again to take the long view
                    here. When we find this book - and
                    believe me, we will find it - we
                    are going to build a new world. A
                    world far greater, far more
                    righteous than this one. And you
                    and I are going to be perched right
                    on top of it, looking down upon it,
                    masters of all creation!
          
          As always, his carefully stage-managed rhetoric is delivered
          with the utmost conviction, every word dripping with passion
          and persuasion. He's a master salesman, a true huckster.
          
                              CARNEGIE
                    And you know, I think you're
                    absolutely right.
                              (MORE)
          
                                                                 25.
          
                              CARNEGIE (cont'd)
                    That is worth more than a few
                    glasses of liquor. A whole lot
                    more.
          
          He steps forward and looks Hog right in the eye. His gaze
          like a laser beam, utterly disarming.
          
                              CARNEGIE
                    The book I want is out there
                    somewhere, just waiting to be
                    found. Once there were millions of
                    copies - you only need to find one!
                    Find it and bring it here. And I
                    promise you, you will be rewarded
                    beyond anything you can imagine.
          
          It's impossible not to be swayed by this guy. He's just so
          full of fiery passion and infectious belief, you almost want
          to reach into your pocket and hand over your wallet.
          
          Hog snatches up his empty satchel.
          
                              HOG
                    This better not be bullshit.
          
          He turns and marches to the door, the other bikers following.
          The guards escort them out, only Redridge remains.
          
          Carnegie slumps back into his chair, frustrated, pissed off.
          
                              REDRIDGE
                    Might help if they knew just what
                    they were looking for.
          
                              CARNEGIE
                    Not one of them can read. How would
                    they even know when they found it?
          
                              REDRIDGE
                    So how's about you just tell me?
          
          Carnegie and Redridge lock eyes. BEAT.
          
                              REDRIDGE
                    Two years now you been sending
                    these crews into the outland.
                    Burning up gas we can barely spare.
                    For a goddamn book? What the hell
                    kinda book can be worth all this?
          
          Carnegie ignores him. Stands, walks toward the door. Redridge
          sighs, gestures toward the books piled on Carnegie's desk.
          
                                                                 26.
          
          
                              REDRIDGE
                    What about these?
          
                              CARNEGIE
                    Put them with the others.
          
          INT. PALLADIUM - MAIN LOBBY - DAY
          
          Redridge stands by the marble fireplace, tossing the books
          into the fire. The flames flicker and leap around the books
          as their pages blacken and are consumed by the fire.
          
          INT. ENGINEER WORKSHOP - DAY
          
          Eli watches as the engineer charges the battery with the gas
          generator, which chugs noisily.
          
          He licks his lips, dry as sand. Unscrews his canteen to take
          a drink, but it's down to its last few drips.
          
                              ELI
                    What's this place across the
                    street? They got any water?
          
                              ENGINEER
                    We got our own underground spring
                    here. Only fresh water in a hundred
                    miles - if's you can pay for it.
          
          Eli thinks a while longer. Then stands and stuffs his shotgun
          inside his pack, shoulders his gear and makes for the door.
          
                              ELI
                    I'll be back.
          
          Eli stops in the doorway and turns back to the engineer.
          
                              ELI
                    If that battery ain't here when I
                    get back, I will use this gun on
                    your kneecaps and I will put this
                    building to the torch and I will
                    watch it burn to the ground with
                    you alive inside it. So help me
                    God.
          
          And with that he turns and leaves. The engineer gulps. Not a
          hint in Eli's voice that he didn't mean every word.
          
          INT. PALLADIUM - CARNEGIE'S BEDROOM - DAY
          
          This old second-floor DRESSING ROOM has been converted into a
          bedroom, simply furnished.
          
                                                                   27.
          
          
          A WOMAN stands in front of an old DRESSING ROOM MIRROR, the
          bulbs around the frame burned-out and broken. She washes her
          face in murky water in an old PORCELAIN BOWL on the dresser.
          
          Her name is CLAUDIA. Early 30s, pretty. She gazes into the
          mirror as she dries her hands, but it's so cracked and warped
          it's near impossible to see a reflection.
          
          The door opens and Carnegie enters. He still looks steamed.
          Claudia doesn't turn to look at him, keeps facing the mirror.
          
                              CLAUDIA
                    Is that you, honey?
          
          Carnegie says nothing. Just paces angrily up and down.
          Finally Claudia turns to face him.
          
                              CLAUDIA
                    Something wrong?
          
                              CARNEGIE
                    More books came in from the road
                    today.
          
                              CLAUDIA
                    Oh? It's been a while.
          
                              CARNEGIE
                    And it'll be a while longer. Just
                    another pile of useless junk. If we
                    don't find the right one soon - if
                    I can't give these people what they
                    want to hear...
          
          Carnegie trails off, the thought too awful to contemplate.
          Claudia adopts a sympathetic expression, supportive.
          
                              CLAUDIA
                    You'll find what you're looking
                    for. It's out there somewhere. You
                    just have to have faith.
          
          This seems to anger Carnegie. He wheels on her.
          
                              CARNEGIE
                    Faith? Is that what you think we're
                    missing around here?
          
          She detects the aggressive tone in his voice and goes quiet,
          head bowed. Carnegie moves toward her angrily.
          
                              CARNEGIE
                    My old man used to have faith. He
                    had it in spades. My mother, too.

                              CARNEGIE (cont'd)
                    You know where it got them? You
                    know where it got me?
          
          He's in her face now. Claudia avoids eye contact, submissive.
          
                              CARNEGIE
                    Faith is for the weak. It's for
                    them out there, the sheep. This
                    world is what you can see and touch
                    and taste. It's what you make it.
                    All these years with me, you still
                    don't have any grasp of that?
                    What's wrong with you, woman?
          
          He's shouting now, and she's trembling, afraid to speak.
          
                                 CLAUDIA
                    I'm sorry.
          
          Carnegie realizes he's frightened her. He softens.
          
                              CARNEGIE
                    No, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to
                    scare you. Hey. You okay?
          
          He lifts her chin up, wipes away a tear.
          
                              CARNEGIE
                    You just get me all riled up with
                    that kind of talk. It's not what I
                    need from you right now.
                        (SMILES)
                    You know what I need right now?
          
          He puts his hands on her lustfully. It's clear she's not in
          the mood, but she halfheartedly responds anyway. More out of
          a sense of wifely duty than reciprocated passion.
          
          As they kiss, Carnegie pushes her excitedly against the wall
          and feverishly begins unbuckling his pants.
          
          INT. PALLADIUM - MAIN LOBBY - DAY
          
          The original customers have now been joined by the four
          bikers, who sit at their own table drinking a clear and
          pungent moonshine-type liquor from a shared jar.
          
          Eli enters. All eyes are on him immediately, regarding him
          with guarded interest as he pulls up a stool at the bar.
          
          The BARTENDER approaches, looks him up and down. Suspicious.
          
                              BARTENDER
                    Outlander? Let me see-
          
                                                                 29.
          
          
          Eli raises his hand as before. Holds it outstretched, steady.
          
                              BARTENDER
                    What'll it be?
          
          Eli places the canteen on the bar.
          
                              ELI
                    Water.
          
                              BARTENDER
                    That's the good stuff. Gotta eat
                    into my own ration to sell it - so
                    I don't sell it cheap.
          
          Eli takes off his scarf and puts it on the bar. The bartender
          takes it and looks it over. Not particularly impressed.
          
                              BARTENDER
                    That'll get you maybe half-way.
          
          The bartender spies Eli's silver Saint Christopher pendant.
          
                              BARTENDER
                    What about that?
          
          Eli stuffs the pendant inside his shirt. No way that's for
          sale. Instead, he reaches into his coat and produces the fur
          pelts he skinned from the dead cat, lays them out on the bar.
          
                              ELI
                    That's the best I got.
          
          The bartender takes a pelt and examines it. The mangy cat
          leaps up onto the bar and approaches. Sniffs at the pelts
          with suspicion and HISSES at Eli.
          
          Eli shoos the cat off the bar with a wave of his hand. At the
          biker's table Hog watches this, not happy about this.
          
          Satisfied with the pelts, the bartender gathers them up along
          with the scarf, then turns away toward the back room.
          
                              BARTENDER
                    Solara!
          
          A TEENAGE GIRL emerges from the back. No older than 16 or 17.
          Dressed in unflattering work clothes, face grimy, blonde hair
          tied back in a ponytail. But even through all this, it's
          clear she is a strikingly beautiful young woman.
          
          The bartender takes Eli's canteen and hands it to Solara
          along with a RATION CARD he keeps around his neck.
          
                                                                 30.
          
          
                              BARTENDER
                    Take this out back and get it
                    filled.
          
          Solara takes the canteen, pausing for a moment to look Eli up
          and down. Unsure quite what to make of him, but intrigued.
          There's something about him she can't put her finger on...
          
          He doesn't look back at her. She turns and exits.
          
          EXT. DESERT TOWN - MAIN STREET - CONTINUOUS
          
          Solara exits via the Palladium's STAGE DOOR and walks across
          the busy street to where TWO OF CARNEGIE'S ARMED MEN stand
          guard around an ENCLOSURE OF CHAIN-LINK FENCE TOPPED WITH
          RAZOR WIRE. TOWNSFOLK wait in line with bowls and buckets.
          
          One of the guards recognizes Solara and lets her cut to the
          front of the line. He punches two holes in her ration card
          and lets her inside the chain-link enclosure.
          
          Inside is an OLD RUSTED SPIGOT attached to a pipe emerging
          from the earth. Solara cranks hard on the handle - it takes a
          few pulls before the water comes, and then only at a weak
          trickle; it will take a while to fill the canteen.
          
          INT. PALLADIUM - MAIN LOBBY - CONTINUOUS
          
          As Eli sits at the bar, a SHADOW comes into view and looms
          large over him. Hog is standing behind him, glaring, cutting
          a menacing figure in his armored cycle leathers.
          
          Solara senses trouble brewing and moves off, taking Eli's
          canteen away into the back room.
          
                              HOG
                    That was my cat.
          
          Eli doesn't turn. Just looks straight ahead. Impossible to
          read him behind those mirrored goggles. Utterly inscrutable.
          
                              ELI
                    Fine specimen.
          
                              HOG
                    I saw you push him off the bar.
          
                              ELI
                    I didn't push him.
          
                              HOG
                    You raised your hand at him.
          
                                                                 31.
          
          
                              ELI
                    Sorry. It won't happen again.
          
          The bartender looks at Hog nervously.
          
                              BARTENDER
                    Hey, how about another drink, Hog?
          
                              HOG
                    That cat's been comin' in here for
                    nigh on two years. It got more
                    right to be here than you. Who the
                    fuck do you think you are?
          
                              ELI
                    I don't want any trouble.
          
          Hog grabs him by the arm.
          
                              HOG
                    Well, that's too bad, `cause-
          
          Blink. Suddenly Hog's head is pinned to the bar by nothing
          more than Eli's thumb. Pressed deep into a nerve cluster in
          his neck. Eli leans in close as Hog whimpers, paralyzed.
          
                              ELI
                    I know you. Murderer of innocent
                    travelers on the road. You're going
                    to spend eternity drowning in a
                    lake of fire for the things that
                    you've done. Did you know that?
          
          The other bikers stand and approach, the OTHER CUSTOMERS
          following suit. Eli senses the trouble gathering behind him.
          
                              ELI
                    You go on back to your table and
                    I'll be on my way. All right?
          
          It's all Hog can do to just barely nod his head. Eli releases
          his thumb. Hog staggers backward, gasping for breath.
          
          Eli stands and makes toward the door, but the bikers and
          other patrons have moved to block his exit.
          
                              BURLY PATRON
                    You push Hog, you push all of us.
          
          Eli sighs, looks down at the floor. He's been pushed one time
          too many today. For the first time, we see anger in his face.
          
                                                                    32.
          
          
                              ELI
                    Cursed be the ground because of
                    you. By toil shall you eat of it.
                    Thorns and thistles shall it sprout
                    for you. From the ground were you
                    taken. For dust you are.
          
          The patrons look at Eli strangely. Who is this guy?
          
          Eli reaches back and draws the samurai sword. Carves a line
          in the dirt at his feet with the tip of the blade.
          
                              ELI
                    And to dust you shall return.
          
          INT. PALLADIUM - CARNEGIE'S BEDROOM - DAY
          
          Carnegie has Claudia pinned against the wall, his pants
          bunched around his ankles, ass bared as he pounds away at
          her. Not making love. This is mechanical, loveless sex.
          
          Claudia stares vacantly over his shoulder into space as
          Carnegie thrusts into her again and again. Deeply
          uninterested, just waiting for it to be over.
          
          Suddenly, we hear a CRASH O.S. Carnegie stops and listens.
          
                              CARNEGIE
                    Did you hear that? What was that?
          
          Claudia sees an opening to get out of this.
          
                              CLAUDIA
                    Maybe you should go check.
          
          BEAT. Carnegie keeps listening. Then comes another CRASH.
          
                              CARNEGIE
                    What in the hell is going on?
          
          He pulls up his pants, grabbing a RIFLE propped by the door
          as he rushes out. Claudia just stands there for a moment,
          then reaches down and pulls up her panties.
          
          She moves from the wall and makes her way across the room,
          feeling her way with her hands, gazing off into nothingness.
          Only now do we finally realize that she is BLIND.
          
          INT. PALLADIUM - MAIN LOBBY - CONTINUOUS
          
          Carnegie emerges from the bedroom onto the balcony. Looks
          down over the railing - and is stunned by what he sees.
          
                                                                 33.
          
          
          CHAOS in the bar below. Eli cutting a one-man swath of mayhem
          through the dozen brawlers. Most already lie dead. TWO MORE
          MEN ATTACK Eli and are effortlessly felled by his sword.
          
          Carnegie rushes hurriedly along the landing, banging loudly
          on the doors of the upstairs rooms.
          
                              CARNEGIE
                    Get your asses out here!
          
          ON ELI. Surrounded by the dead, only one man left standing.
          Hog. He backs away as Eli circles him like a predator. Sword
          held ready, the blade glistening with dark red blood.
          
          SOLARA re-emerges from the back room with Eli's refilled
          canteen. She stops and emits a horrified GASP when she sees
          the bloody carnage laid out in the bar before her.
          
          She watches, mortified, as Eli moves toward the helpless,
          terrified Hog, going in for the kill. Raising his sword...
          
          Suddenly, Solara steps forward and CRIES OUT:
          
                                 SOLARA
                    Stop!
          
          Eli FREEZES. Sword hanging in the air, poised to strike. He
          turns his head to where Solara stands behind the bar.
          
                              SOLARA
                    Please don't.
          
          BEAT as Eli considers. He looks back at Hog, still completely
          at his mercy... and then LOWERS THE SWORD.
          
                                 ELI
                    Go.
          
                              HOG
                        (CONFUSED)
                    ...What?
          
                              ELI
                    It ain't for me to judge you. Your
                    time for that's gonna come. Believe
                    me. Now go on. Get out of here.
          
          Hog stumbles backward through the door, into the sunlight.
          Eli moves toward Solara, who stands petrified behind the bar.
          Reaches out and gently pries the canteen from her loose grip.
          
                                 ELI
                    Thank you.
          
                                                                    34.
          
          
          In the exitway, Hog turns back inside, grabbing up a BROKEN
          BOTTLE from the bloody floor as he goes.
          
          Hog rushes Eli from behind. Solara sees him coming and goes
          to SCREAM - but before any sound can come, Eli flips his
          sword backward and Hog runs right onto it, SKEWERING HIMSELF.
          
          BEAT. Hog just stands there for a moment, eyes wide, frozen
          in shock. His fingers go limp, dropping the bottle.
          
          He slides off the sword and collapses to the floor, dead.
          
          Eli wipes the sword clean and sheathes it. Looks around at
          the bloodied, fallen bodies. Then back at Solara.
          
                              ELI
                    I'm sorry for all the mess.
          
          As he turns and heads toward the door:
          
                              CARNEGIE (O.S.)
                    Hold it right there.
          
          Accompanied by the sound of MULTIPLE GUNS COCKING.
          
          Carnegie is on the landing, training his rifle down at Eli.
          Alongside him, FIVE GUNMEN do the same. They've got him cold.
          
          INT. PALLADIUM AUDITORIUM - CARNEGIE'S BOX
          
          Carnegie sits at his desk, the huge auditorium and stage area
          visible behind him. Eli stands before him. Around him are the
          other gunmen, who keep their weapons trained on him.
          
          Standing at Carnegie's side are REDRIDGE and CLAUDIA.
          
                              CARNEGIE
                    So, who are you?
          
                              ELI
                    Nobody. A walker in the outland.
          
                              CARNEGIE
                    I've met walkers before. Not a
                    particularly civilized bunch. Some
                    have even taken to eating their own
                    kind, did you know that? You
                    wouldn't be one of those savages
                    now, would you?
          
          Carnegie's gunmen look him over, inspecting him warily.
          
                              CARNEGIE GUNMAN
                    He ain't got the shakes.
          
                                                                  35.
          
          
          Carnegie's confident gaze remains fixed on Eli throughout.
          
                              CARNEGIE
                    Good. This is a civilized town.
                    Under God. Do you know what that
                    means?
          
          Eli can't help but react at the mention of that word.
          
                              CARNEGIE
                    It means we have laws here. Laws
                    set down long before any of us ever
                    walked this earth. And one of them
                    is, you don't eat the flesh of your
                    brother. Else you're no better than
                    an animal. And not welcome here.
          
          Eli doesn't respond. Just stands there in Carnegie's gaze.
          
                              CARNEGIE
                    So what's your business here,
                    friend? Walkers don't usually come
                    into town less they want something.
          
                              ELI
                    I had a battery needed charging and
                    a canteen needed filling. I didn't
                    come here looking for trouble.
          
          Barely noticeable, Carnegie gestures to one of the gunmen,
          who nods in acknowledgement and leaves.
          
                              CARNEGIE
                    Well, you sure as hell found it. Do
                    you know who I am?
          
                              ELI
                    No.
          
                              CARNEGIE
                    My name's Carnegie. I own this bar.
                    I own the whole town. You've never
                    heard of me?
          
                              ELI
                    That's you out there on the street.
          
                              CARNEGIE
                    Remarkable likeness, isn't it?
                    You'd never guess half the men who
                    built it were blind. A small
                    tribute from a grateful people. I
                    was deeply touched.
          
                                                                 36.
          
          
                              ELI
                    You had slaves build you a monument
                    to yourself?
          
          The mention of that word rankles Carnegie. He walks around
          the desk toward Eli, waves an admonishing finger at him.
          
                              CARNEGIE
                    Don't call them slaves. That's an
                    old word. I'm not a slaver. I'm
                    trying to help these people.
          
          Carnegie can't help himself - once again he is in his natural
          element, spinning the argument his way, pitching. Selling.
          
                               CARNEGIE
                    In the outland the sightless are
                    preyed upon like sick animals. Here
                    at least they're protected. They do
                    the essential work others don't
                    want. And in return they eat, they
                    drink, they survive. Last year, a
                    couple of them even got married -
                    performed the ceremony myself.
                        (BEAT)
                    You see, I'm not exploiting these
                    people - I'm saving them! Any one
                    of them is free to leave whenever
                    they wish. But here they stay. And
                    they thank me every single day for
                    their salvation!
          
          An impressive, impassioned performance. He sounds just like
          an old-school TV evangelist. But Eli is unmoved.
          
                              ELI
                    It's none of my business what you
                    do here. Like you said, it's your
                    town. I just want to be on my way.
          
                              CARNEGIE
                    What's your name, walker?
          
          Eli doesn't respond. Just stands there.
          
                              CARNEGIE
                    All right, I guess we just call you
                    Walker. Don't see too many folks
                    your age these days. You lived in
                    the world before? You can read?
          
                              ELI
                    I read every day.
          
                                                37.
          
          
                    CARNEGIE
          That's good. Good man. We educated
          folk, we need to stick together, if
          we're ever going to rebuild this
          world. People like you and me,
          we're the future.
          
                    ELI
          What do you want with me?
          
                     CARNEGIE
          Straight to the point. I like that.
          Fact is, you could be in a lot of
          trouble. This is a peaceful town.
          You walk in here, armed, and the
          next thing a dozen of my good
          citizens are dead. I've hanged men
          for less. I could hang you.
              (BEAT)
          Or, you could come work for me.
          
                    ELI
          What?
          
                    CARNEGIE
          I never once saw anyone handle
          themselves the way you did down
          there in that bar. I don't know
          where you learned it, but I sure as
          hell could use it.
          
                    ELI
          I'm not interested.
          
                    CARNEGIE
          People who work for me can live
          better than any walker ever
          dreamed. Real beds, clean water,
          hot food. Women, even. You could do
          a lot worse, my friend.
          
                    ELI
          I'm not your friend. And I'm not
          staying. I got someplace I need to
          be. Out west.
          
                    CARNEGIE
          West? There is nothing west. It's
          all gone, a long time ago.
          
                    ELI
          I've been told different.
          
                                                                    38.
          
          
                              CARNEGIE
                    By who?
          
          Eli doesn't reply. Carnegie smiles, dials up the charm.
          
                              CARNEGIE
                    All right, look. I'm going to make
                    you an offer of goodwill. Stay the
                    night, think it over. Try a little
                    local hospitality. We'll talk again
                    in the morning. If you're still not
                    interested, you're free to go. No
                    hard feelings.
          
                              ELI
                    Thank you for your offer. But I'd
                    prefer to just leave right now. So
                    you can either let me out of here,
                    or I can kill my way out.
          
          The gunmen bristle, exchange nervous looks. Carnegie appears
          unfazed. He smiles. BEAT. He looks to the gunman at the door.
          
                              CARNEGIE
                    Let him go.
          
          The gunman opens the door. Eli turns and exits.
          
          INT. ENGINEER WORKSHOP - DAY
          
          The engineer stands behind the counter, looking worried. His
          heart sinks when he sees Eli enter.
          
                              ENGINEER
                    Oh, shit...
          
                              ELI
                    How's my battery?
          
                              ENGINEER
                    It's, uh... it's gonna take a
                    little longer than I thought.
          
                              ELI
                    How much longer?
          
                              ENGINEER
                    It's gotta charge overnight. You,
                    uh, you can always stay here in
                    town, pick it up in the morning.
          
          Eli leans in a little closer. He smells a rat.
          
                                                                    39.
          
          
                              ELI
                    You remember what I said would
                    happen if I came back here and you
                    didn't have my battery?
          
                              ENGINEER
                    It's right here! It's just gonna
                    take a while longer. I swear.
          
          Eli looks at the engineer. Hard to be certain, but he's
          pretty sure he's lying. Somebody got to him.
          
          INT. PALLADIUM AUDITORIUM - CARNEGIE'S BOX
          
          A VIOLENT COMMOTION is heard from down the hall. Suddenly one
          of Carnegie's henchmen comes flying into view as he is THROWN
          HARD INTO A WALL and slumps to the floor, unconscious.
          
          Eli storms into the box, pissed. MORE GUARDS rush in behind
          him. Carnegie, seated behind his desk, waves the guards off
          as he stands to greet Eli, smiling ingratiatingly as ever.
          
                              CARNEGIE
                    I knew you'd reconsider.
          
                              ELI
                    Yeah? How'd you know that?
          
                              CARNEGIE
                    None of the walkers I've seen come
                    here from the outland were ever
                    what you'd call smart. I mean all
                    those years out there alone on the
                    road, some with their brains half-
                    fried from eating each other - it's
                    understandable why you people
                    aren't the brightest bulbs in the
                    box. But I never met one so dumb
                    that he'd turn down a meal and a
                    bed if it was offered.
          
                              ELI
                    So you didn't send someone across
                    the street to the engineer?
          
                              CARNEGIE
                    Engineer? I don't know what you're
                    talking about. If there's something
                    wrong, maybe I can help.
          
          Carnegie is a practiced liar. Much more difficult to read.
          
                                                                 40.
          
          
                              CARNEGIE
                    This is Redridge. He's kind of my
                    right-hand man around here.
          
          Redridge - one of the two men who chased Eli into the room -
          steps forward. He regards Eli with a distrustful eye.
          
                              CARNEGIE
                    He'll show you to your room.
          
          INT. PALLADIUM - GUEST BEDROOM - DUSK
          
          Redridge opens the door and ushers Eli inside.
          
          It's another of the dressing rooms converted into a bedroom,
          less well-appointed than Carnegie's own. A threadbare rug.
          Bed with relatively clean sheets. A sink for washing.
          
                              REDRIDGE
                    Enjoy your stay. There'll be
                    someone outside your room all
                    night. If you need anything.
          
          Redridge smirks and closes the door, leaving Eli alone. Eli
          paces across the room. Finally sits down on the creaky old
          bed. Trying to figure out how he managed to get stuck here.
          
          He unshoulders his pack, sets it down. Lies down on the bed.
          It's been a while since he felt a real bed on his back.
          
          A KNOCK at the door. Eli gets quickly to his feet.
          
                              ELI
                    Hello?
          
          The door opens and CLAUDIA enters. Carrying a metal tub of
          water in both hands and, atop that, a dinner tray.
          
                              CLAUDIA
                    I have this for you. Water for
                    washing and some food.
          
          Eli just stands there. Totally unfamiliar with this kind of
          situation, it's been too long. She smiles, embarrassed.
          
                              CLAUDIA
                    Well... are you going to take it?
          
                              ELI
                    Oh. Thank you.
          
          He takes the stuff from her, sets it on the table.
          
                                                                 41.
          
          
                              CLAUDIA
                    You're very welcome.
          
          We get the impression that Claudia is as unfamiliar with this
          kind of polite interaction as Eli. But she likes it.
          
                              CLAUDIA
                    It'll be dark soon.
          
          She strikes a match and lights the oil lamp on the table. The
          room is lit by its flickering glow.
          
                              CLAUDIA
                    Can I get you anything else?
          
                              ELI
                    No, thank you.
          
                              CLAUDIA
                    Well. Have a good night.
          
          As she turns for the door:
          
                              ELI
                    You're Carnegie's woman?
          
                              CLAUDIA
                    Why do you ask?
          
                              ELI
                    Just making conversation is all.
                    Haven't had one of those in a
                    while. Not a real one, leastways.
          
          Claudia smiles. Neither has she.
          
                              CLAUDIA
                    He found me in the outland. I was
                    sixteen, my family had been...
                    well, they were gone. There was
                    just me and my baby.
          
                              ELI
                    You had a baby?
          
                              CLAUDIA
                    I'd met some men on the road. Bad
                    men. They...
          
          BEAT. She trails off, struggling with this unhappy memory.
          Eli gets it, raises a hand reassuringly.
          
                              ELI
                    It's all right.
          
                                                                  42.
          
          
                              CLAUDIA
                    I was on the road for a year after
                    that. I couldn't feed myself, let
                    alone my little girl. And then Bill
                    found us and he promised he'd take
                    care of us. He told me he was going
                    to make a place where we could be
                    safe. And he did. He did all that.
                    He built this whole town. He kept
                    us safe. And he raised that child
                    like she was his own. He's been so
                    good to both of us. He saved us,
                    really.
          
          There's a bittersweet quality to Claudia's words. As though
          there is more to the story than she is telling.
          
          Eli pulls out a chair at the table, offers it to her.
          
                              ELI
                    You want to eat some?
          
          She smiles and sits. Eli sits across from her.
          
                              ELI
                    When did you go blind? In the war?
                    You get caught in a flash?
          
                              CLAUDIA
                    No, I was born this way. I think
                    I'm lucky like that.
          
                              ELI
                    Lucky?
          
                              CLAUDIA
                    It's not like I ever knew what I'm
                    missing. I was already used to
                    being like this by the time... by
                    the time it all happened. So I got
                    around pretty good even when I was
                    on my own. And now it's easy. I
                    know every creaky old floorboard in
                    here, and it's not like I ever go
                    any place else. Bill would never
                    allow it. He worries about me so
                    much.
          
          Again, bittersweet. The sense that Claudia feels trapped.
          Thinking about it begins to upset her. She gets up.
          
                              CLAUDIA
                    I should go. He'll be wondering
                    where I am.
          
                                                                 43.
          
          
          Eli stands, escorts her to the door and opens it.
          
                              CLAUDIA
                    Thank you. I enjoyed our
                    conversation.
          
                                ELI
                    So did I.
          
          Eli closes the door, then sits back at the table.
          
          INT. PALLADIUM - CARNEGIE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
          
          Carnegie washes, looking at himself in the old dressing-room
          mirror. He sees Claudia enter the room in its dim reflection.
          
                              CARNEGIE
                    You took your time in there. How
                    long does it take to deliver a
                    plate of food and some water?
          
          A subtly accusing tone. It makes Claudia nervous.
          
                              CLAUDIA
                    He wanted to talk.
          
                              CARNEGIE
                    Oh? What about?
          
                              CLAUDIA
                    Nothing really. He asked me what it
                    was like to be blind.
          
                              CARNEGIE
                    He tell you anything about him?
          
                              CLAUDIA
                    No. I don't think he likes to talk
                    about himself much.
          
                              CARNEGIE
                    Yeah, I got that.
          
          Claudia moves to the bedside, begins to undress.
          
                              CLAUDIA
                    I don't think he's going to change
                    his mind by morning. I don't think
                    he's going to stay.
          
                              CARNEGIE
                    What makes you say that?
          
                                                                44.
          
          
                              CLAUDIA
                    Just strikes me as the kind of man
                    who's of a mind, is all. Doesn't
                    seem like the type to go changing
                    it once it's set.
          
                              CARNEGIE
                    Well, we'll just see about that.
          
                              CLAUDIA
                    You saw him. He's not like the
                    others. You won't be able to smooth-
                    talk him and wrap him around your
                    finger like you usually do.
          
                               CARNEGIE
                    Who said anything about me?
                        (BEAT)
                    I'm sending Solara.
          
          Claudia reacts suddenly to this. Shocked and angry.
          
                              CLAUDIA
                    You're doing what?
                              CARNEGIE
                    You know how often these walkers
                    get laid? Never. Least not by
                    anything living or willing. Girl
                    like her can be very persuasive.
          
                              CLAUDIA
                    You can't send her in there with
                    him. He's dangerous, he's a killer!
          
                              CARNEGIE
                    You went in there readily enough.
          
                              CLAUDIA
                    That's different. Solara's just a
                    child, she can't-
          
          Carnegie sighs, tiring of this.
          
                              CARNEGIE
                    She's a grown woman now, Claudia.
                    Sooner or later you're going to
                    have to accept that. She has to
                    earn her keep around here, same as
                    the rest of us.
          
                              CLAUDIA
                    By working as a whore? That's all
                    you think she's fit for?
          
                                                                    45.
          
          
                              CARNEGIE
                    We've each been given a talent to
                    help us make our way in this world.
                    Some people's gift is more evident
                    than others. Solara's sure as hell
                    is.
          
          Claudia looks at Carnegie in disgust.
          
                              CLAUDIA
                    What kind of a man are you?
          
          Now it's Carnegie's turn to get angry. He rounds on her
          menacingly. She backs off as he approaches.
          
                              CARNEGIE
                    I'm the kind of man who'd pull a
                    helpless blind girl off the road, a
                    girl who'd been beaten and raped,
                    and give her a place where she can
                    live without fear! Without me you'd
                    be just another no-eye, lying dead
                    in the outland, picked clean by the
                    buzzards, or shoveling dirt down
                    there with the others. That's the
                    kind of man I am!
          
          He has her against the wall, his face just inches from hers.
          
                              CLAUDIA
                    I don't live without fear. I
                    haven't for a long time now.
          
          Carnegie calms himself, backs off. Claudia goes to leave.
          
                              CARNEGIE
                    Where are you going?
          
                              CLAUDIA
                    I'm not going to let you do this.
          
          Carnegie surges forward and pins Claudia to the wall.
          
                               CARNEGIE
                    You're not going to let me?
                        (BEAT)
                    Nobody tells me what I can and
                    can't do in my own town. Nobody. I
                    built this world, and I am God
                    here! So don't go thinking about
                    screwing with my plans. You know
                    how this works. Solara goes against
                    me, you get hurt. You go against
                    me, she gets hurt.
          
                                                                 46.
          
          
          He releases his grip on her.
          
                              CARNEGIE
                    So let's not see anybody get hurt.
                    Okay?
          
          He speaks more softly now. As he strokes his hand tenderly
          through Claudia's hair, a tear runs down her cheek.
          
          INT. PALLADIUM - GUEST BEDROOM - NIGHT
          
          Dark outside, but the room is brightly lit by the glow of the
          oil lamp. Eli sits up on his bed, quietly reading the old
          leather-bound book from his backpack.
          
          Another KNOCK at the door. Eli jumps up and hurriedly hides
          the book inside his shirt.
          
                               ELI
                    Come in.
          
          The door opens to reveal Solara. Looking very different than
          she did before. Cleaned up and wearing a flowery summer
          dress, blonde hair let down over her shoulders. Stunning.
          
          Unlike everyone else we have met, she seems - physically, at
          least - totally unscarred by the horrors of the times. Far
          too beautiful a thing to belong in a world like this.
          
                              SOLARA
                    Hi. Can I come in?
          
                              ELI
                    Someone was already here with food
                    and water. I got everything I need.
          
                              SOLARA
                    You sure about that?
          
          She glides into the room, closing the door. She's good. Very
          seductive. Eli is totally disarmed in her presence.
          
                              SOLARA
                    It's too bright in here. Mind if I
                    turn it down a little?
          
          She doesn't wait for an answer. Moves to the table and turns
          down the oil lamp. A darker, more seductive lighting scheme.
          
                              SOLARA
                    That's better. I'm Solara. You're
                    Walker, right?
          
                                                                   47.
          
          
                              ELI
                    No. My name's Eli.
          
                              SOLARA
                    That short for something? Elias?
          
                               ELI
                    Elijah.
          
                              SOLARA
                    Elijah. I never heard that one
                    before. It's kinda cute.
          
          She sits on the bed, kicks her legs playfully. Her light
          cotton dress revealing in all the right places. The
          silhouette of her body bathed in the seductive glow of the
          oil lamp. No red-blooded man on earth could resist her.
          
                              ELI
                    Look, I don't mean to be rude. But
                    I'm really not interested.
          
                              SOLARA
                    You sure about that? It gets mighty
                    lonely out there on the road.
          
          She leans over on the bed, resting on her elbow. Her hair
          cascades down. God damn, she looks good.
          
                              SOLARA
                    If you're worried about money, this
                    is all paid for. The whole night.
          
                              ELI
                    It's not that. You're a very nice
                    girl. But I'm not that kind of man.
          
          She slides off the bed, approaches him. Begins to work the
          buttons of his shirt.
          
                              SOLARA
                    They're all that kind of man.
          He moves her hand away. Gently pushes her back a step.
          
                               ELI
                    I'm not.
          
          She is stunned. No man has ever turned her down before. And
          then she seems a little insulted.
          
                              SOLARA
                    They told me you were crazy. Maybe
                    they were right.
          
                                                                 48.
          
          
          Eli opens the door for her.
          
                              ELI
                    I'm sorry. Good night.
          
          Suddenly all her other emotions give way to fear. She moves
          to the door and slams it shut again. Looks Eli in the eye.
          
                              SOLARA
                    Please don't make me leave. I have
                    to stay the night. If I don't...
          
                              ELI
                    If you don't, what?
          
                              SOLARA
                    He'll hurt my mom.
          
                              ELI
                    Who will? Carnegie?
          
          She nods, fighting back a tear. This angers Eli.
          
                              ELI
                    Maybe he and I oughta have words.
          
          He goes for the door handle, but she stops him.
          
                              SOLARA
                    No! Please, don't!
          
                              ELI
                    He's hurting you. He's hurting your
                    mother. He's-
          
                              SOLARA
                    He's my dad.
          
          BEAT. Eli moves his hand away from the door.
          
                              SOLARA
                    Look, if you want to help me, just
                    let me stay here tonight. We don't
                    have to do anything. I'll sleep on
                    the floor. Tomorrow you can tell my
                    dad that we had a good time. I'll
                    be no trouble, I swear.
          
          She looks up at Eli imploringly. Transformed. No longer the
          teenage sex kitten. Now she's just a frightened little girl.
          
                              ELI
                    You want to have a conversation?
          
                                                                 49.
          
          
          She smiles, wiping the tear from her cheek.
          
          LATER
          
          Eli and Solara sit together on the bed. A silent BEAT. At
          first, it appears as though they have nothing to say.
          
                                ELI
                      You know, you don't have to be
                      afraid of me. What happened down
                      there in the bar...
          
                                SOLARA
                      I'm not afraid of you. I know you
                      didn't start that trouble. When I
                      first saw you, I knew you weren't
                      the type to go looking for it.
          
                                ELI
                      How'd you know that?
          
                                 SOLARA
                      My mom says I'm a good judge of
                      character. She says I can read
                      people. That I know a good man when
                      I see one.
          
          She smiles. Eli is surprised to find himself smiling back.
          
                                SOLARA
                      So... you're pretty old, right?
          
          Eli smiles, amused by the bluntness of the question.
          
                                SOLARA
                      I'm sorry. I just mean, I haven't
                      seen too many people your age. How
                      old are you exactly?
          
                                ELI
                      You know, I don't rightly remember.
          
                                SOLARA
                      But you're old enough. I mean, you
                      remember what it was like? In the
                      world before?
          
          Eli nods.
          
                                SOLARA
                      What was it like?
          
          Eli thinks about this. Dredging through old, old memories.
          
                                                                    50.
          
          
                               ELI
                    Better than this.
                        (BEAT)
                    People lived longer back then.
                    Longer than me. Some were more than
                    a hundred years old.
          
          Solara smiles like she's having her leg pulled.
          
                               SOLARA
                    Come on.
          
                              ELI
                    I swear, it's true. Nowadays it's
                    not the same. If you're sick or
                    you're weak or you're old you won't
                    last long out on the road.
          
                              SOLARA
                    So how come you have?
          
          BEAT. Eli thinks. Should he or shouldn't he?
          
                              ELI
                    Can I read you something?
          
                              SOLARA
                    Wait. You can read?
          
          Eli pulls the book from his shirt. Solara's eyes widen.
          
                              SOLARA
                    And you have a book?
                              ELI
                    Not just any book.
          
          For the first time we see that it's a KING JAMES BIBLE. An
          embossed GOLD CROSS on its old leather cover.
          
          Eli opens it up, scans the page with his finger until he
          finds the passage he's looking for.
          
                              ELI
                    The Lord is my shepherd. I shall
                    not want. He makes me lie down in
                    green pastures. He leads me beside
                    still waters. He restores my soul.
                    He leads me in the paths of
                    righteousness.
          
          ON SOLARA as she listens to Eli read. Transfixed.
          
                                                                  51.
          
          
                              ELI
                    Though I walk through the valley of
                    the shadow of death, I will fear no
                    evil. For you are with me. Your rod
                    and your staff, they comfort me.
                    You prepare a table before me in
                    the presence of my enemies. You
                    anoint my head with oil. My cup
                    runs over. Surely goodness and
                    mercy shall follow me, all the days
                    of my life. And I will dwell in the
                    house of the Lord forever.
          
                              SOLARA
                    That's beautiful. Did you write
                    that?
          
                                ELI
                          (SMILES)
                    No.
          
                              SOLARA
                    What book is it from? Is it poetry?
          
                              ELI
                    I guess you could think of it that
                    way. It's from the Holy Bible.
          
                              SOLARA
                    I never heard of it. What's it
                    about?
          
          BEAT as Eli thinks. How on earth to answer that?
          
                              ELI
                    It's about love, and forgiveness,
                    and life and death, and mercy, and
                    revenge, and the beginning and the
                    end of the world. I guess it's
                    about a little bit of everything.
          
                                 SOLARA
                    Can I see?
          
          She reaches out for the book but he snatches it away.
          
                              SOLARA
                    What? I'm not going to do anything.
          
                              ELI
                    I'm sorry. I'm charged to protect
                    this book. I can't trust it with
                    anyone. Not even for a while.
          
                                                                 52.
          
          
                              SOLARA
                    What's so special about that book?
          
          BEAT. Eli runs his fingers across the embossed gold cross on
          the beat-up leather cover.
          
                              ELI
                    It's the last one. There are no
                    other books like this. All the
                    others are gone - destroyed by the
                    war or in the burnings that came
                    after. This is the only one that
                    survived until now. The last one
                    anywhere.
          
                              SOLARA
                    How can you know that?
          
                               ELI
                    I just know.
                        (BEAT)
                    For a long while after it happened,
                    I just wandered on the road like
                    most everybody else. There were
                    still a lot of people around back
                    then, in the beginning. I didn't
                    really know what I should do or
                    where I was going. I was just
                    moving from place to place, trying
                    to stay alive. And then one day I
                    heard this voice. I don't know how
                    to explain it, it's like it was
                    coming from inside me. But I could
                    hear it, clear as day. Clear as I
                    can hear you talking to me now.
          
                              SOLARA
                    What did it say?
          
                              ELI
                    It led me to this place, I don't
                    really know where. And I found this
                    book buried deep under some rubble.
                    No way no-one was ever going to
                    find it if they didn't know exactly
                    where to look.
          
                              SOLARA
                    But you knew because the voice told
                    you?
          
                              ELI
                    That's right. And that voice told
                    me to carry the book west.

                               ELI (cont'd)
                    It told me that a path would be
                    laid out before me, that I'd be led
                    to a place where this book would be
                    safe. It told me I'd be protected
                    against anyone or anything that
                    tried to stand in my way. If only I
                    would have faith.

                        (SKEPTICAL)
                    Because a voice you heard in your
                    head told you to.
          
                              ELI
                    I'm not crazy. I didn't imagine it.
                    I know what I heard.

                    So who was it? The voice?
          
          BEAT as Eli considers his answer.
          
                              ELI
                    A very important, very powerful
                    man.
          
                              SOLARA
                    More powerful than my dad?
          
                              ELI
                        (SMILES)
                    I should say so, yes.
          
          BEAT. The two of them sit in silence for a moment.
          
                              SOLARA
                    Would you teach me to read?
          
                              ELI
                    What?
          
                              SOLARA
                    I never learned. No-one around here
                    knows how. Only my dad, and he
                    won't teach me. I think he likes
                    being the only one who can read. I
                    think it makes him feel powerful.
          
                              ELI
                    I think you're probably right.
          
                                                                 54.
          
          
                              SOLARA
                    So would you teach me?
          
                              ELI
                    I'm sorry. I'm leaving tomorrow.
                    And I won't be back this way, ever.
          
          She looks down, sad. She likes this guy. She doesn't want him
          to leave. Eli can sense her sadness.
          
                              ELI
                    Are you hungry?
          
                              SOLARA
                    I guess a little.
          
                              ELI
                    There's some food on the table over
                    there. Let's eat.
          
          She walks over to where the dinner tray is covered by a small
          cloth. She whips it away - to reveal ELI'S RAT nibbling on a
          piece of cheese. Solara SHRIEKS and backs away.
          
          The rat scurries down the table leg and leaps up onto Eli's
          shoulder, just as afraid of her as she is of it.
          
                              ELI
                    It's okay, it's okay. He's with me.
                        (to the rat)
                    Don't be afraid, pal. This is
                    Solara. She's our friend.
          
          Solara approaches warily. Reaches out and strokes him. The
          rat scurries up her arm. She almost shrieks again.
          
                              ELI
                    It's okay. It means he likes you.
          
                                 SOLARA
                    It does?
                              ELI
                    Trust me, if he didn't like you,
                    you'd know about it.
          
          Solara pets the rat on her shoulder. Then:
          
                              SOLARA
                    Did you really mean that?
          
                                 ELI
                    Mean what?
          
                                                                 55.
          
          
                              SOLARA
                    That I'm your friend.
          
          BEAT. Eli finds himself surprised that he admitted such a
          thing. When is the last time he had someone he could call a
          friend? He can't even remember.
          
                              ELI
                    Sure.
          
          She smiles. Giggles as the rat's whiskers tickle her ear.
          
          Eli breaks the cheese in two and gives half to Solara. She's
          about to eat but stops as Eli clasp his hands in prayer.
          
                              ELI
                    Our father, we thank you for this
                    meal which you have been so
                    gracious to place before us.
          
          Unsure of what to do, Solara mimics Eli, putting her hands
          together and bowing her head.
          
                               ELI
                    We thank you for a warm bed and a
                    roof over our heads on a cold night
                    such as this.
                        (BEAT)
                    And we thank you for the gift of
                    friendship in these hard times.
          
          Solara looks at him, touched by that.
          
                               ELI
                    Amen.
                        (BEAT)
                    You say that last part too.
          
                              SOLARA
                    Amen. And now we eat?
          
                              ELI
                    And now we eat.
          
          They sit and eat together, sharing the simple meal.
          
          PULL OUT from the window as they eat, away from the theater.
          Away from the town and its flickering points of torchlight.
          Moving farther and farther away until the entire town is
          consumed by the darkness of the world.
          
          EXT. DESERT TOWN - MAIN STREET - DAWN
          
          The pale sun rises over the town. To establish:
          
                                                                    56.
          
          
          INT. PALLADIUM - DINING ROOM - MORNING
          
          What was once the theater's COSTUME ROOM - OLD MANNEQUINS
          still stand around in the corners, creating an eerie feel.
          
          Carnegie and Claudia sit at a DINING TABLE, eating breakfast
          in silence. A third place is set, but no-one is seated there.
          
          Solara enters and sits down without a word.
          
                              CARNEGIE
                    Good morning, Solara.
          
          Solara doesn't say anything.
          
                              CARNEGIE
                    I said good morning, Solara.
          
                              SOLARA
                    Morning, dad.
          
                              CARNEGIE
                    How was your night? Did you sleep
                    well?
          
          Claudia appears perturbed by Carnegie's subtle probing.
          Solara flashes him a frosty look.
          
                              SOLARA
                    I did like you asked. Isn't that
                    what you really want to know? Just
                    come out and say it.
          
          Carnegie glares at her sternly.
          
                              CARNEGIE
                    You don't speak to your father like
                    that. When I ask you a civil
                    question, I expect a civil answer.
          
          Solara lowers her head, scorned. Carnegie continues eating.
          
                              CARNEGIE
                    Did he say anything?
          
                              SOLARA
                    No. We didn't talk much.
          
                              CARNEGIE
                    Well, do you think you managed to
                    change his mind about staying?
          
                              SOLARA
                    I don't know. He said he had to go.
          
                                                                 57.
          
          
          Carnegie puts down his food, looks angrily at her.
          
                              CARNEGIE
                    So he did talk? What else did he
                    say? Come on, I want all of it!
          
                              SOLARA
                    That's all he said. That he was
                    going to be leaving this morning.
          
                              CARNEGIE
                    We'll see. This is my town, nobody
                    leaves until I say they leave.
          
          He glances knowingly at Claudia.
          
                              CLAUDIA
                    Solara, honey, eat something.
          
          She looks at the food on the plate before her. Then closes
          her eyes and clasps her hands in prayer.
          
                              SOLARA
                    Our father, thank you for this meal
                    which you have been so gracious to
                    place before us.
          
          Claudia and Carnegie freeze. Carnegie stares at her, agape.
          
                              SOLARA
                    Thank you for my mother. Please
                    watch over her and keep her safe.
          
                                CARNEGIE
                    Solara...
          
                              SOLARA
                    Thank you for all the-
          
                                CARNEGIE
                    Solara!
          She snaps suddenly out of it, looks at her father.
          
                              CARNEGIE
                    What the hell are you doing?
          
          She doesn't respond. Looks embarrassed.
          
                               CARNEGIE
                    God didn't put this food on the
                    table. Do you hear me?
                        (BEAT)
                    Who put this food on the table?
          
                                                                 58.
          
          
          Solara says nothing, just looks down at the table.
          
                              CARNEGIE
                    I said who put this food on the
                    table?
          
                              SOLARA
                        (SOFTLY)
                    You did.
          
                              CARNEGIE
                    Who taught you that?
          
                              SOLARA
                    Eli taught me.
          
                              CARNEGIE
                        (PUZZLED)
                    Who the hell is Eli?
          
                              SOLARA
                    The walker. That's his name.
          
                              CARNEGIE
                    And he taught you how to say those
                    words? How did he know them?
          
                              SOLARA
                    He had them written down in a book.
          
          This piques Carnegie's interest greatly.
          
                              CARNEGIE
                    What kind of a book?
          
          He barks the question at her. Solara is rattled.
          
                              SOLARA
                    I don't remember! It was an old
                    leather book. It had kind of a...
                    thing on the front of it.
          
                               CARNEGIE
                    Show me.
          
          Solara makes the SIGN OF A CRUCIFIX with her index fingers.
          Carnegie's eyes widen; he can barely believe it.
          
                              CARNEGIE
                    He had a bible?
          
                              SOLARA
                    That's what it was. A holy bible.
                    Daddy, what's wrong? Did I...
          
                                                                 59.
          
          
          Carnegie BOLTS SUDDENLY FROM THE TABLE, overturning his chair
          and sending his plate of food crashing to the floor.
          
          INT. PALLADIUM - LOBBY BALCONY - CONTINUOUS
          
          Carnegie races across the landing, toward the ARMED GUARD
          posted outside Eli's bedroom. The guard steps aside as
          Carnegie flings the door open and barges inside.
          
          INT. PALLADIUM - GUEST BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS
          
          Empty. No sign of Eli or his gear anywhere. The window is
          WIDE OPEN, the curtains fluttering gently in the breeze.
          
          INT. ENGINEER WORKSHOP - CONTINUOUS
          
          His hands shaking, the engineer disconnects Eli's battery
          from the generator and places it on the counter.
          
          Eli stands on the other side of the counter with his SHOTGUN
          TRAINED RIGHT AT THE MAN'S HEAD. He takes the battery from
          him and stuffs it into his backpack.
          
          EXT. PALLADIUM - CONTINUOUS
          
          Carnegie races from the lobby entrance and looks up at the
          open window to Eli's room. He could have easily jumped.
          
          Redridge emerges onto the street behind him.
          
                              REDRIDGE
                    Something wrong, boss?
          
                              CARNEGIE
                    Something wrong? Something wrong?
                    The walker's gone!
          
                              REDRIDGE
                    That can't be. I had a man outside
                    his room the whole time.
          
                              CARNEGIE
                    He jumped out the window, you
                    idiot! You didn't think to put a
                    man outside the fucking window?
                        (beat; fuming)
                    Find him. Now!
          
                              REDRIDGE
                    Boss, he could be anywhere. He...
                        (REALIZATION)
                    A battery. Didn't he say something
                    about a battery?
          
                                                                  60.
          
          
          They turn to face the engineer's storefront - just as ELI
          EMERGES ONTO THE STREET, shotgun still in his hand.
          
          EVERYBODY FREEZES. Like a wild west stand-off. Redridge's
          fingers play over the butt of the pistol on his hip.
          
          BEAT as time hangs perfectly still for a second... and then
          ALL HELL BREAKS LOOSE.
          
          Redridge draws and FIRES, SHATTERING A PARKING METER just
          inches from Eli and showering quarters all over the sidewalk.
          
          Eli rushes along the sidewalk, RETURNING FIRE. The shot wings
          Redridge in the shoulder. He goes down, wounded.
          
          Carnegie dives for cover as FOUR MORE GUNMEN rush from the
          theater. Carnegie waves frantically in Eli's direction.
          
                              CARNEGIE
                    Go! Go!
          
          They spot Eli sprinting away and rush off in pursuit.
          
          Carnegie gets to his feet and storms back inside the theater.
          
          INT. PALLADIUM - DINING ROOM - CONTINUOUS
          
          Solara and Claudia watch through the window. Turn suddenly
          when they hear the door slam open behind them.
          
          Carnegie stands in the doorway, glaring at them.
          
          EXT. DESERT TOWN - MAIN STREET - CONTINUOUS
          
          LOCAL RESIDENTS scream and rush to and fro in panic as Eli
          darts along the boardwalk.
          
          CARNEGIE'S GUNMEN pursue, firing their rifles wildly on the
          run. The bullets splinter wood, pierce barrels and crates,
          narrowly missing Eli as he dashes, keeping his head down.
          
          Eli aims the shotgun and FIRES without even looking. The shot
          HITS A GUNMAN SQUARE IN THE CHEST, dropping him to the dirt.
          
          Eli hits the deck, diving for cover behind a JUNKPILE as more
          gunfire ricochets all around him. He takes a moment to
          collect himself, reloads the shotgun.
          
          The three remaining gunmen close in on the junkpile warily.
          
          Eli signs a cross over himself with the shotgun, looks to the
          sky and offers up a silent prayer. Then emerges from around
          the junkpile back into the street. All three gunmen OPEN
          FIRE, their bullets whipping past on either side of him.
          
                                                                 61.
          
          
          In one swift motion Eli raises the shotgun and FIRES. Three
          shots in quick succession. And then there is silence. Smoke
          wisps from the shotgun's sawn-off barrel.
          
          The three gunmen LIE DEAD IN THE STREET. One hit square in
          the chest. The other two each have maybe one half of their
          heads remaining.
          
          Eli looks around. He's right at the end of the main road, the
          perimeter where the town meets the open desert. He's free.
          
          And then, A GIRL'S SCREAM. Distant but unmistakable.
          
          Eli whips around. In the upstairs window of the theater,
          Carnegie shoves Solara roughly against the wall. Barking
          angrily at her, shaking her.
          
          Eli looks at the road. Then up at the theater. Then back to
          the road again.
          
                              ELI
                        (quietly; to himself)
                    It ain't your concern. Stay on the
                    path.
          
          But he sounds less resolute now than before. Until today this
          was always a simple decision for him to make. But now...
          
                                ELI
                    Dammit...
          
          He marches back toward the theater, stepping over the fallen
          bodies of the gunmen, re-loading his shotgun as he goes.
          
          EXT. PALLADIUM - CONTINUOUS
          
          Redridge finally manages to clamber back up to his feet,
          wincing as he clutches his painful shoulder wound.
          
          He looks up just in time to see Eli coming right at him.
          Without breaking stride, he COLD-COCKS Redridge in the jaw
          with the shotgun, sending him back to the deck, out cold.
          
          INT. PALLADIUM - DINING ROOM - CONTINUOUS
          
          Eli kicks the door wide open, finds Carnegie holding Solara
          against the wall. She sobs, terrified. Eli levels the shotgun
          at Carnegie's head.
          
                              ELI
                    Let her go.
          
                                                                 62.
          
          
                              CARNEGIE
                    That cannon of yours casts a pretty
                    wide net. I don't reckon you can
                    hit me without hitting her.
          
                              ELI
                    I reckon you're right.
          
          He holsters the shotgun. Then in the same fluid motion draws
          a PISTOL from his belt that we never even knew he had.
          
                              ELI
                    This, though? With this I'll shave
                    the hairs clean off your balls at a
                    hundred paces. You believe me?
          
          Carnegie releases his grip on Solara, steps away, hands up.
          
                              CARNEGIE
                    I believe you. I have to say I'm
                    surprised to hear that language
                    coming from you, though. I mean,
                    you being a holy man and all.
          
          BEAT. Eli glances at Solara.
          
                               CARNEGIE
                    She told me all about it. Told me
                    all about the bible, too.
                        (BEAT)
                    Can I see it?
          
                              ELI
                    No.
          
          Carnegie takes a small step forward. Suddenly, his whole
          demeanor changes, and he now looks at Eli imploringly.
          
                              CARNEGIE
                    You know, I've been searching for a
                    book like that one for years. All
                    I've ever wanted was to bring the
                    word of God to these poor
                    unfortunates here. To shine its
                    light upon them and give them
                    something in this wretched world
                    that they could believe in.
                    Something to live for! It's why I
                    built this town, did you know that?
                    All we've been missing is the word
                    to show us the way. And now, praise
                    the Lord, you've brought it to us.
          
                                                                 63.
          
          
          Carnegie takes a step closer. He appears entirely sincere -
          but then he is very good at doing so.
          
                              CARNEGIE
                    It's not right to keep that book
                    hidden away, all to yourself. The
                    word is meant to be shared with
                    others. It's meant to be spread!
                    Isn't that what you want? I could
                    help you do that. You and me, we
                    could do it together.
          
          BEAT. Eli seems to be considering what he's heard carefully.
          
                              ELI
                    The Lord himself told me that if I
                    carried this book west, one day I
                    would find the place where it was
                    needed. Where it would be safe.
                    Where it belonged.
          
          Carnegie smiles broadly... and then with a sudden blur of
          movement Eli PISTOL-WHIPS him to the floor.
          
                              ELI
                    But this ain't it.
          
          He turns to Solara and offers her his hand.
          
                               ELI
                    Come on.
          
          EXT. PALLADIUM - CONTINUOUS
          
          Eli emerges from the theater, leading Solara onto the street.
          RESIDENTS part before them, staring at Eli with astonishment.
          
          Eli passes the statue of Carnegie - and STOPS. Something
          about that thing is bothering him.
          
                              SOLARA
                    What? What is it?
          
                              ELI
                    You shall not make for yourself any
                    graven image...
          
          He turns, drawing his samurai sword and in the same fluid
          motion SLICING across the base of the statue.
          
          BEAT. And then the STATUE TOPPLES from the neat cut just
          below the knees, CRASHING DOWN to the ground and SHATTERING.
          The assembled residents GASP at this defiant display.
          
                                                                    64.
          
          
          Eli sheathes his sword and takes Solara by the hand again.
          
                              ELI
                    Now we can go.
          
          CRANE UP over the main street as they both head out of town.
          
          EXT. ROAD - DAY
          
          The town barely visible on the distant horizon behind Eli and
          Solara. Eli walks as he always has, his pace steady and slow.
          Still, Solara lags along behind. She's already tired.
          
                              SOLARA
                    Where are we going?
          
                              ELI
                    I told you where I'm going. You're
                    free to go wherever you want.
          
          She stops in the road.
          
                              SOLARA
                    Wait... I'm not coming with you?
          
                              ELI
                    You're only going to slow me down.
          
          Eli doesn't stop walking. Solara is forced to catch up.
          
                              SOLARA
                    So what the hell was all that about
                    back there?
          
                              ELI
                    The man was hurting you. I don't
                    like that, so I put a stop to it.
                    Now you're free. He can't hurt you
                    any more.
                        (off her stare)
                    No need to thank me.
          
                              SOLARA
                    Thank you? For what? What am I
                    supposed to do now?
          
                              ELI
                    Whatever you want. That's what
                    being free is.
          
                              SOLARA
                    Whatever I want. Except go with
                    you.
          
                                                                   65.
          
          
                              ELI
                    I have to get where I'm going. I
                    can't be worrying about someone
                    else along the way.
          
          Solara is incredibly hurt by this. Blinks back a tear.
          
                              SOLARA
                    I thought you were my friend.
          
          BEAT. Eli stops and turns back to face her.
          
                              ELI
                    It's dangerous in the outland. I
                    wouldn't want you to get hurt.
          
                              SOLARA
                    I'll be safe so long as I'm with
                    you. I know it.
          
          Eli sighs. He's not getting through to her. So now comes the
          harsh truth of it:
          
                              ELI
                    You don't want this life. I gotta
                    do what I gotta do. Don't have no
                    choice in it. But you do. And I
                    can't let you choose this. You
                    don't want to be like me. You don't
                    want to spend your life alone.
          
          Solara steps closer, her eyes pleading.
          
                              SOLARA
                    If I came with you, I wouldn't be
                    alone. And neither would you.
          
          A long BEAT as Eli considers this. For a moment it appears as
          though Solara might have won him over. But then:
          
                              ELI
                    I'm sorry. Look, maybe it's best
                    you just go on back to town.
          
          He turns and walks off, leaving her in the road. She stands
          there, furious, screaming at his back as he walks away.
          
                              SOLARA
                    Fine! I'll do just that! I had a
                    life there! A family! I didn't ask
                    you to save me! I didn't ask you
                    for anything!
          
                                                                 66.
          
          
          He doesn't turn or acknowledge her at all. Just keeps walking
          off into the horizon. Getting smaller all the time.
          
          Solara stands there in the road, weeping. All alone.
          
                              SOLARA
                        (SOFTLY)
                    Fine.
          
          She turns and walks back in the direction she came.
          
          EXT. DESERT TOWN - BARNYARD - DAY
          
          A small, penned-in area to the rear of the Palladium
          containing an eclectic bunch of farmyard animals. Goats,
          sheep, geese, pigs. Mostly mangy, sad-looking specimens.
          
          Carnegie stands in the yard, tossing handfuls of animal feed
          from a nearby sack onto the ground. He watches with
          satisfaction as the animals gather at his feet to feed.
          
          Claudia emerges from the theater with an ice-pack.
          
                              CARNEGIE
                    Thank you, darling.
          
          Carnegie applies it to his jaw, red and swollen from Eli's
          pistol-whip. Redridge appears nearby, his arm in a sling.
          
                              REDRIDGE
                    He killed four of my men and walked
                    out of town without a scratch. They
                    shot off a hundred rounds at him
                    and he didn't get hit once. I never
                    even heard of anything like that.
          
          Carnegie doesn't appear to be listening. He is lost in a
          world of his own as he tends to the farm animals.
          
                              CARNEGIE
                    You know, I always thought of
                    myself as a shepherd. Bringing
                    together the wayward and the lost.
                    Tending to my flock. But all the
                    things I want to do, I can't do
                    them on my own. The one thing I've
                    needed is the one thing that's
                    always been missing. Then one day
                    it walks right into town - so close
                    I can almost touch it - and then
                    walks right on out again.
          
          Carnegie finally looks up from his animals, at Redridge.
          
                                                                 67.
          
          
                              CARNEGIE
                    I want you to put a crew together
                    and go out after him.
          
                              REDRIDGE
                    He's not going to work for you. I
                    think he's made that plain.
          
                              CARNEGIE
                    I'm not interested in him any more.
                    I only want the book he's carrying.
          
                              REDRIDGE
                    If I'm gonna risk my ass hunting
                    down this maniac in the outland, I
                    need to know it's gonna be worth
                    it. I need to know what's so
                    special about this goddamn book.
          
          BEAT as Carnegie considers this.
          
                              CARNEGIE
                    You have no idea. You're too young,
                    you don't remember the world
                    before. But I do. I remember.
          
          He turns back to his animals, summoning up old memories.
          
                               CARNEGIE
                    When I was a kid my parents used to
                    read that book every goddamn day.
                    My mother, she'd read it along with
                    this smooth-talking preacher on the
                    TV screen. They used to be able to
                    beam these guys right into your
                    house, into every house in the
                    world, through the air. Like magic.
                        (BEAT)
                    She worked two jobs and she sent
                    every spare penny she had to that
                    fucking guy on the TV. My old man,
                    he'd read that book, then he'd get
                    liquored up and kick my ass, tell
                    me all about the power and the
                    glory and how I was going to burn
                    forever in hell for the sins I was
                    born with. He made sure he beat it
                    into me good.
          
          He snaps out of his reverie and looks at Redridge.
          
                              CARNEGIE
                    Don't you see? It's not just any
                    book.
                              (MORE)
          
                                                                 68.
          
                               CARNEGIE (cont'd)
                    It has the power to motivate
                    people. It can give them hope, it
                    can terrify them. It can shape
                    them. Control them.
                        (BEAT)
                    Do you remember how I built this
                    town? It wasn't done with force,
                    and it wasn't done just with water.
                    It was done with the power of
                    words. I created this place out of
                    nothing, because people believed in
                    a promise that I sold to them.
                    Those guys on the TV, they were
                    richer than you could ever dream,
                    and it was all built the same way.
                    With words. With promises. And with
                    that book.
                        (BEAT)
                    That book is a weapon. Aimed right
                    at the hearts and minds of the weak
                    and the desperate. Just imagine
                    what I could do with it.
          
                              REDRIDGE
                    Boss... we're running out of water
                    and the people are running out of
                    patience. You're trying to tell me
                    that a book is going to keep them
                    in line?
          
                              CARNEGIE
                    Oh, it'll do much more than that.
                    The water in this town may run dry,
                    but faith - that springs eternal!
                    And that faith will help turn this
                    town into a city. And this city
                    into a nation. It will help me
                    build a new world. In my image.
                    People will come from far and wide
                    to hear what's inside of it.
                    They'll follow me anywhere just to
                    get a taste of it. And they'll do
                    whatever I tell them.
          
          As usual, Carnegie's slick rhetoric has worked - Redridge has
          totally bought into it. Claudia, however, looks appalled.
          
                               REDRIDGE
                    And what if this book don't work?
                    What if it don't say what you want
                    it to say?
          
                                                                 69.
          
          
                               CARNEGIE
                    Oh, it'll say what I want, I can
                    promise you that. Because I'm going
                    to rewrite it. I'll keep the parts
                    that work for me and make the rest
                    whatever I need it to be.
                        (BEAT)
                    A new bible, for a new world.
          
          He reaches out and takes Claudia by the hand.
          
                              CARNEGIE
                    What do you think, darling? A whole
                    new world, to do with as we will.
                    Won't that be grand?
          
          She smiles halfheartedly, but it's clear she is mortified.
          
          Carnegie turns back to Redridge.
          
                              CARNEGIE
                    Find that book.
          
                              REDRIDGE
                    He has half a day on us already.
          
                              CARNEGIE
                    So use the motor pool.
          
                              REDRIDGE
                    There ain't much gas in reserve.
          
                              CARNEGIE
                    Whatever there is, use it.
          
          Redridge nods and goes to leave.
          
                              CLAUDIA
                    What about Solara?
          
          BEAT. In all this excitement about the book, she had been
          completely forgotten about.
          
                              CLAUDIA
                    She's still out there. With him.
          
                              CARNEGIE
                    Right. Right. Of course. Bring her
                    back, too, if you can. But-
          
                              REDRIDGE
                    The book. I know.
          
                                                                    70.
          
          
          Redridge turns and leaves. Claudia scowls at Carnegie, but he
          doesn't even notice, just goes back to feeding his animals.
          
          EXT. DESOLATE ROAD - DAY
          
          Solara wanders the road. She's tired. The sun beats down
          mercilessly. Nothing but desolation and wasteland all around.
          
          She comes to a FORK IN THE ROAD. Stops at the junction,
          unsure. Was this here before? She doesn't remember.
          
          There are no signs. Both paths look the same. Which one is
          which? She turns and looks back, looks around. She's lost.
          
                              SOLARA
                    Shit. Shit.
          
          She alternates her finger between the two paths. Eeny-meeny-
          miney-moe. Picks a path and follows it, headed down the road.
          
          EXT. ROAD - DAY
          
          Eli walks on. Slow and steady. His gaze, as ever, fixed
          firmly on the horizon. Takes a swig from his canteen.
          
          Suddenly, he STOPS and stands stock still in the center of
          the road. Impossible to know what he's thinking.
          
          He stands there for a long time.
          
          EXT. WASTELAND GAS STATION - DAY
          
          Solara comes upon an abandoned CHEVRON STATION. She doesn't
          remember passing this. Looks back up and down the road.
          
                              SOLARA
                    Where the hell am I?
          
          There's a RUSTED CAR parked at one of the pumps. Like every
          other car we've seen, stripped of its tires and engine.
          
          She walks around to the driver's side. A PETRIFIED FEMALE
          BODY lies on the ground, half-in, half-out of the car.
          
          Solara claps her hand to her mouth and recoils, horrified.
          
          In the dead woman's hand is a dusty bottle of MINERAL WATER.
          Solara hesitates. Not wanting to get closer. But so thirsty.
          
          She braces herself, grimacing, and tries to take the bottle,
          but the dead woman's hand is closed tight around it. She
          pulls harder and wrenches it free. In the process she falls
          on her butt and flips the corpse over onto its back.
          
                                                                  71.
          
          
          In the other woman's arm, she has a SKELETAL BABY cradled to
          her bosom. It seems to be staring right at Solara.
          
          Solara SCREAMS and frantically shuffles backward away from
          it. Gets to her feet and runs across the forecourt.
          
          She stops by the station shop and rests against the wall,
          hyperventilating, heart pounding. Trying to get it together.
          
          She inspects the water in the bottle. It looks clean.
          Unscrews the cap with shaking hands and takes a sip.
          
          She SPITS IT BACK OUT, coughing. It's rank. Undrinkable.
          
          INT. WASTELAND GAS STATION - FOOD COURT - DAY
          
          Solara enters. Gloomy inside. Comprehensively looted. Empty
          shelves coated in thick sheets of dust.
          
          She moves further in, searching for something, anything. But
          the place has been gutted. There's nothing. She checks the
          wall of dead refrigerators. Shattered glass, all empty.
          
          She's never known desolation and emptiness like this. It's
          beginning to scare her. She wheels around in a panic.
          
                              FEMALE VOICE (O.S.)
                    Hello?
          
          Distant, calling from outside. Solara hears it and freezes.
          
                              FEMALE VOICE (O.S.)
                    Hello? Can anyone help me?
          
          EXT. WASTELAND GAS STATION - CONTINUOUS
          
          She runs out across the forecourt, onto the road.
          
          A FEMALE FIGURE is hunched by the side of the road about
          fifty yards up ahead. Hard to see what she's doing from here.
          
                              SLUMPED FEMALE
                    Hello? Is anybody there?
          
          Solara starts walking toward her.
          
          The woman has her back to Solara. She's on her knees,
          muttering to herself. Gathering objects up from the road.
          
          As Solara moves closer, we see that the woman is struggling
          with an UPTURNED SHOPPING CART. Stuck in a roadside ditch,
          its contents spilled out next to a few BRACKEN BUSHES.
          
                                                                   72.
          
          
          We see her face now. It's the SAME YOUNG WOMAN from before.
          The same shopping cart. The same trap.
          
                                SOLARA
                      Are you all right?
          
          The woman looks around, sees Solara standing nearby. She's
          shocked to see that it's a girl.
          
                                YOUNG WOMAN
                      Oh. Yes, I'm fine. Thank you. You
                      go along, I'll be okay.
          
                                SOLARA
                      You look like you need some help.
          
                                YOUNG WOMAN
                      No, really! I'm fine. Really... I
                      need a man to help. Not you. You
                      just keep along. Please.
          
          The woman seems anxious to get rid of her. Tries to indicate
          the threat silently with her eyes, but Solara doesn't get it.
          
                                SOLARA
                      It'll just take a minute.
          
          She steps into the ditch and starts to haul the cart out.
          
                                YOUNG WOMAN
                      Really, it's fine! Please!
          
          Too   late. THREE ROAD BRIGANDS POUNCE FROM THE BUSHES. Every
          bit   as brutish and horrifying as the group that Eli killed on
          the   road in our opening. They grab Solara and drag her from
          the   road into the desert, screaming and kicking all the way.
          
                                YOUNG WOMAN
                      Let her go! She ain't got nothing!
          
          The BRIGAND LEADER looks Solara up and down lustfully.
          
                                BRIGAND LEADER
                      I ain't too sure about that.
          
          Solara is reviled by the man. He's filthy, his stench
          overpowering. One eye missing, just a dark, empty socket. He
          licks his lips, revealing a mouth almost devoid of teeth.
          
                                YOUNG WOMAN
                      This wasn't the deal!
          
          The brigand leader lashes out and grabs her by the throat.
          
                                                                    73.
          
          
                              BRIGAND LEADER
                    Shut your mouth, bitch. You oughta
                    be grateful you're getting a break.
          
          He releases her. She slumps to the dirt, whimpering.
          
                              BRIGAND LEADER
                    Never did care much for that dried-
                    up old snatch anyhow.
          
          He looks back to the struggling Solara.
          
                              BRIGAND LEADER
                    This one, though... this one looks
                    fresh. You a virgin?
          
          She says nothing, just sobs helplessly.
          
                              BRIGAND LEADER
                    Well, let's find out.
          
          He unbuckles his pants, lets them drop to his ankles.
          
          We hear a sound. It's hard to place. Something like a THHUP.
          
          The brigand leader is frozen in shock. His face goes pale,
          the blood draining from it. The two bandits holding Solara
          look at their leader in dismay. Staring down at his crotch.
          
          A quiet whimper escapes from his lips as he looks down.
          
          There is an ARROW IMBEDDED IN HIS CROTCH. What was once down
          there is now just a bloody mess of mangled meat. More blood
          streams down his thighs. A real horror show.
          
          He staggers backward, shrieking. Hands shaking. Staring down
          at the awful wound from which the long arrow shaft extends.
          
          The two other brigands release Solara and whip around,
          scanning the horizon. They see nothing. One of them has a
          RIFLE. He unslings it and aims it frantically around.
          
          Then they both see it. Coming right at them. The most
          terrifying thing either has ever seen.
          
          ELI, WALKING TOWARD THEM FROM THE ROAD, OUT OF THE SUN. His
          silhouette distorted in the rippling heat. An avenging angel.
          
          He pulls another arrow and draws it back as the rifle bandit
          trains his weapon on him, finger tightening on the trigger.
          
          Eli SHOOTS. The arrow sails through the air and RIGHT INTO
          THE RIFLE BARREL. The feathers at the end of the shaft
          plugging the muzzle tight.
          
                                                                  74.
          
          
          Rifle bandit pulls the trigger. The gun EXPLODES, BLOWING HIS
          HANDS CLEAN OFF. He falls to the ground, screaming.
          
          Eli only had two arrows. He shoulders the bow and draws his
          sword. All the remaining brigand has is a small knife. The
          two now square off at arm's length. A hopeless mismatch.
          
          BEAT. The knife brigand hesitates, trembling. And then RUSHES
          ELI WITH THE KNIFE. Eli deftly sidesteps, flourishes the
          sword. So quick it almost seems like he didn't move at all.
          
          The knife bandit staggers forward a couple more steps. His
          hand goes limp and drops the knife.
          
          And then his HEAD FALLS BACKWARD like a Pez dispenser. Almost
          completely decapitated, but not quite. Blood fountains from
          the neck stump as his body falls to the dirt.
          
          Eli moves to the other two bandits who lay horribly wounded
          on the ground, but still breathing. He stands over their
          fallen bodies. They stare back up at him, helpless.
          
          He crouches down between them in the dust.
          
                              ELI
                    I offer you both one final chance
                    in this life to seek forgiveness
                    for your sins so that your souls
                    may find salvation. Will you say
                    with me the act of contrition?
          
          The brigand leader defiantly spits blood at him.
          
                                BRIGAND LEADER
                    Fuck you.
          
          Eli sighs. Stands and looks down on him without pity.
          
                              ELI
                    Some might think it'd be most
                    fitting to leave you here like
                    this. Let you die slow in the sun.
                    But I know better. I know where
                    you're going. And the sooner you
                    get there, the sooner you'll get
                    what's coming to you.
          
          He plunges his sword into the bandit leader, finishing him
          off. Pulls the arrow from his crotch and wipes it clean.
          
          He turns to the other man, raising his sword.
          
                                RIFLE BANDIT
                    Wait!
          
                                                                   75.
          
          
          Eli pauses, sword hovering over him, poised to strike.
          
                              RIFLE BANDIT
                    I want to say it. I want to be
                    forgiven.
          
          Eli crouches once more by his side.
          
                              ELI
                    Repeat after me. Oh God, I am
                    heartily sorry for having offended
                    thee, and I detest all my sins.
          
          The bandit follows along with Eli, mouthing the words
          quietly. The life ebbing from him with each moment.
          
                              ELI
                    I firmly resolve, with the help of
                    thy grace, to confess my sins, and
                    do penance, and to amend my life.
                    Amen.
          
                              RIFLE BANDIT
                    Amen...
          
          His eyes roll back as his final breath leaves him. Dead. Eli
          signs a cross over his body, then stands and walks away.
          
          Solara sits on the ground nearby, a wreck. Eli approaches and
          gathers her up in his arms. She clings on to him tightly.
          
                              SOLARA
                    You came back for me.
          
                              ELI
                    What are friends for?
          
          She laughs, a tear rolling down her cheek. Grips him tighter.
          
          He helps her up and escorts her back to the road.
          
                              ELI
                    This is the deal. You keep up. You
                    pull your weight. You fall behind,
                    I can't help you. Okay?
          
                              SOLARA
                    Okay.
          
          She looks back at the young woman still slumped in the dirt.
          
                              SOLARA
                    What about her?
          
                                                                    76.
          
          
                              ELI
                    There's nothing can be done for
                    her.
          
          They walk on down the road.
          
          EXT. DESERT TOWN - MAIN STREET - DAY
          
          METAL GARAGE DOORS roll back to reveal darkness within.
          
          A PAIR OF HEADLIGHTS fires up. Full beam right at us.
          
          A VEHICLE roars out of the darkness onto the street. Heavily
          modified with plate armor and turret-mounted weapons. But its
          original form still recognizable underneath.
          
          It's a HONDA ODYSSEY minivan. Once the #1 choice of soccer
          moms, transformed now into an armored personnel carrier.
          
          Another minivan roars from the garage behind it. A DODGE
          GRAND CARAVAN, similarly customized and armed to the teeth.
          
          THREE MORE CARS follow. As eclectic an assortment as you
          could imagine. A MINI COOPER. FORD EXPLORER. A PRIUS. Each
          adorned with plate armor and weapons.
          
          In the lead Minivan is REDRIDGE, heavily armed. He nods to
          the DRIVER, who guns the engine.
          
          The fleet of armored vehicles moves out, kicking up a great
          funnel of dust in their wake as they roar out of town.
          
          EXT. DESERT - DAY
          
          Late afternoon. The sun hangs low on the horizon. We're far
          from the road. Nothing but scrub brush and a few PRAIRIE DOG
          BURROWS dotted around.
          
          A PRAIRIE DOG pops its head up, scans the horizon. Sniffing
          the air, whiskers twitching... and is SKEWERED BY AN ARROW.
          
          Thirty yards away, one of the pieces of scrub brush appears
          to COME ALIVE. And then we realize it is Eli's GHILLIE SUIT,
          camouflaging both he and Solara beneath it.
          
          Eli casts off the camouflage net and walks toward the dead
          prairie dog. Solara just stands there, appalled.
          
                              SOLARA
                    You killed it! That cute little
                    thing!
          
          Eli picks up the dead animal by the scruff.
          
                                                                    77.
          
          
                              ELI
                    It's good eating, is what it is.
          
          He yanks out the bloody arrow. Solara looks away.
          
          When she turns back, Eli is standing right there, holding the
          dead animal in front of her face. She YELPS in surprise and
          staggers backward, falling on her butt.
          
                              SOLARA
                    That's not funny.
          
                              ELI
                    If you're going to be on the road,
                    you can't be picky about what you
                    eat. You eat what's there to eat.
          
                              SOLARA
                    I'm not eating that.
          
                              ELI
                        (SHRUGS)
                    More for me.
          
          EXT. WASTELAND CAVE - DUSK
          
          Eli and Solara sit in the mouth of a desert cave, around a
          flickering campfire. The prairie dog roasts on a spit.
          
          Eli digs his knife into the carcass, the blade comes out
          clean. It's done. He clasps his hands together and gazes down
          penitently at the ground.
          
                              ELI
                    Father, we thank you for your
                    generosity in providing us with
                    this meal. Bless this food to our
                    use and us to thy service, and keep
                    us ever mindful of the needs of
                    others. Amen.
          
          Eli carves off a piece of meat. Juicy and succulent. He bites
          into it, teasing Solara by making a show of how good it
          tastes. He feeds a piece to the rat perched on his shoulder.
          
          Solara tries to appear uninterested, but she's starved.
          
                              SOLARA
                    What does that taste like?
          
          He takes another bite, thinks on this as he chews.
          
                              ELI
                    Tastes like chicken.
          
                                                                 78.
          
          
          She tries to fight the temptation to try it... but she can't.
          She reaches out and tears off a piece. Sniffs at it, takes a
          small bite... then quickly wolfs down the rest. Eli smiles.
          
          As she eats, she gestures toward Eli's Saint Christopher.
          
                              SOLARA
                    What is that?
          
          Eli reaches up and touches his hand to it.
          
                              ELI
                    It's a Saint Christopher medal.
          
                              SOLARA
                    Who's Saint Christopher? Is he a
                    character from your book?
          
          Eli smiles and shakes his head.
          
                              ELI
                    Christopher was a man who lived a
                    long time ago. He wanted to be a
                    good man, he wanted to help people.
                    So he would stand by a river that
                    had no bridge and carry people
                    across. He was a big strong man and
                    there was no one he couldn't carry.
          
          Solara listens, rapt. Eli is a good storyteller.
          
                              ELI
                    Then one day a young child came to
                    the river and asked to be carried
                    across. Christopher tried to carry
                    him but he was too heavy. He was
                    just a small boy but he was heavier
                    than any man he had ever carried.
                    The boy explained that he was the
                    son of God, and that he was so
                    heavy because he bore all the sins
                    of the world. After that,
                    Christopher was able to carry him
                    across and when they got to the
                    other side the boy baptized him in
                    the river. And that's how he became
                    a saint. Later on, he was known as
                    the patron saint of travelers.
          
                              SOLARA
                    What is a saint, anyway?
          
                                                                 79.
          
          
                              ELI
                    It's someone who spent their life
                    doing good things for others.
                    Enough that God himself took a
                    special interest in them.
          
          Solara looks at Eli tenderly, with admiration.
          
                              SOLARA
                    Someone like you.
          
          Eli looks away, down at the ground. He appears sad.
          
                              ELI
                    No. Not like me. Saints ain't
                    killers. And I done too much of
                    that. Spilled too much blood.
          
          BEAT. No words, just the flickering firelight.
          
                              SOLARA
                    Will you read me some more from the
                    book?
          
                              ELI
                    It's late. You should get some
                    sleep. Maybe tomorrow.
          
          LATER - NIGHT
          
          The fire down to its last embers. Eli sleeps next to his
          pack, half-hidden in the looming shadows of the cave. His hat
          and goggles hung up for the night on the hilt of his sword.
          
          Solara sleeps nearby... then opens her eyes. Not asleep after
          all. She looks over at Eli - his face hidden in shadow and so
          impossible to tell if he's asleep or awake.
          
                              SOLARA
                    Eli?
          
          No response. Quietly, she moves forward, kneeling by his
          side. She opens his coat and checks the pockets. Empty.
          
          She goes deeper, peeling back the layers of clothing,
          stealthily frisking him. She finds something on his lapel,
          hidden under several layers, that causes her to stop.
          
          It's a RECTANGULAR PLASTIC BADGE. The red, white and blue
          colors faded and worn. It reads:
          
                               WELCOME TO WAL-MART
                                 MY NAME IS "ELI"
                               HOW MAY I HELP YOU?
          
                                                                  80.
          
          
          She stares at it for a moment, not knowing what to make of
          it. Then moves on, continuing to pat him down.
          
          Whatever she's looking for is not here. She turns her
          attention to the backpack. Slowly, carefully, opens it up.
          
          There it is. THE BIBLE, wrapped carefully in its neat little
          package of cloth and twine. She reaches in for it.
          
          Suddenly, ELI'S HAND SHOOTS OUT AND GRABS HER BY THE WRIST.
          She cries out, startled. Eli sits up, his face just a dark
          shape in the shadows. For the first time he appears a little
          scary to Solara.
          
                              ELI
                    What are you doing?
          
                              SOLARA
                    You scared me! I thought you were
                    asleep.
          
                              ELI
                    On the road you sleep with one eye
                    open. I asked you what you were
                    doing.
          
                              SOLARA
                    I just wanted to see the book.
          
                              ELI
                    You want to see the book, you ask
                    me. Nobody touches it but me. Ever.
                    Until it gets where it's going. Do
                    you understand?
          
          He's very forceful. She nods, a little afraid of him.
          
                              ELI
                    Tell me you understand!
          
          He grips her wrist tighter.
          
                              SOLARA
                    Okay! I understand! Ow!
          
          Eli releases her wrist. Takes the pack from her and closes it
          up. Pulls it closer to him and lies back down.
          
                              ELI
                    It's no use to you anyway. You
                    don't know how to read it.
          
                                                                 81.
          
          
                              SOLARA
                    Well... now we have the time, maybe
                    you can teach me.
          
                              ELI
                    Maybe. Get some sleep.
          
          She lies back down beside him, but doesn't close her eyes.
          She just lies there, watching him.
          
          EXT. WASTELAND - DAWN
          
          The sun rises out of the east. And out of the sun comes the
          FLEET OF ARMORED VEHICLES. Racing side-by-side down the road.
          
          The lead vehicle comes to a halt. A door opens and Redridge
          gets out. MORE ARMED MEN emerge from the other vehicles and
          follow him as he marches into the wasteland by the roadside.
          
          The DEAD BRIGANDS are splayed out in the dirt where Eli slew
          them. A FLOCK OF BUZZARDS is picking their bones clean.
          
                              REDRIDGE
                    He's been here.
          
          Redridge looks at the footprints in the dirt headed from the
          bodies and back onto the road. Two sets of tracks.
          
                              REDRIDGE
                    The girl's with him.
          
          He moves back to the cars.
          
                                REDRIDGE
                    Move out!
          
          The other men hold for a moment, still looking at the half-
          eaten bodies in the dirt. Redridge turns back.
          
                              REDRIDGE
                    I said move out!
          
                              CARNEGIE GUNMAN
                    I heard this guy's protected
                    somehow, some... power from up
                    above. That there ain't nothing on
                    this earth can touch him.
          
                              REDRIDGE
                    He's just a man. You put a bullet
                    in him, he'll go down like any
                    other. I don't want to hear no more
                    of this superstitious horseshit!
          
                                                                 82.
          
          
          Hesitantly, they make their way back to the vehicles. The
          cars gun their engines and move on down the road, past the
          abandoned Chevron station. Dust pluming in their wake.
          
          EXT. ROAD - DAY
          
          Eli and Solara walk together, passing by a few burned-out
          buildings. It appears we might be headed toward a town.
          
          Solara looks up at the sweltering sun. Then around at her
          surroundings. Nothing but devastation and decay.
          
                              SOLARA
                    You say you've been walking for
                    twenty-five years. Have you ever
                    considered that you might be lost?
          
                                 ELI
                    No.
          
                              SOLARA
                    But how can you know? How can you
                    know this is the right way?
          
                              ELI
                    I told you. My path has been laid
                    out before me.
          
                              SOLARA
                    Yeah, but laid out by who?
          
                              ELI
                    By Almighty God.
          
                              SOLARA
                    Well if this God guy's so mighty,
                    how come it's taking you so long to
                    get where you're going? Doesn't he
                    know the way?
          
          Eli wheels around and jabs a scolding finger at her.
          
                              ELI
                    You want to stay on this road with
                    me, don't ever let me hear you take
                    his name in vain like that again.
          
          Solara is surprised by the severity of his reaction.
          
                                 SOLARA
                    Sorry.
          
          Eli resumes walking.
          
                                                                  83.
          
          
                              ELI
                    God has a reason for everything
                    being the way it is. It's not
                    always apparent to us. But it is
                    his plan nonetheless.
          
                              SOLARA
                    So, is he talking to you right now?
                    Telling you where to go?
          
                              ELI
                    It's not like that. It's kinda hard
                    to explain. I'm guided by faith.
          
                              SOLARA
                    I don't know what that word means.
          
          BEAT as Eli thinks on how to explain it.
          
                              ELI
                    It means you know something even
                    though you don't know it.
          
          Solara thinks about this, shakes her head.
          
                              SOLARA
                    That doesn't make any sense at all.
          
                              ELI
                    It doesn't have to.
          
          They walk on.
          
          EXT. HOUSE - DAY
          
          On the outskirts of a small town that lies in ruins. Almost
          every building burned or reduced to rubble.
          
          Except for one SMALL HOUSE. The building is damaged and worn
          but in mostly decent condition. It stands out among its
          surroundings for being the only structure still intact.
          
          The windows are BARRED. The outer structure fortified with
          SHEET METAL and other custom patch-ups. The whole plot
          surrounded by a CHAIN-LINK FENCE TOPPED WITH RAZOR WIRE.
          
          Eli and Solara crouch behind a pile of rubble nearby.
          
                              SOLARA
                    I don't get it. It looks almost...
                    normal. Like nothing ever happened.
                    How can it still be out here?
          
                                                                  84.
          
          
                              ELI
                    I don't know.
          
                              SOLARA
                    Maybe we should look inside. There
                    might be food.
          
          BEAT as Eli considers. Then stands and unhooks his shotgun.
          
                              ELI
                    Stay behind me.
          
          They approach the house cautiously. Arrive at the perimeter
          fence. There's a gate held in place by a PADLOCK.
          
          Eli pulls a pair of BOLT-CUTTERS from his belt and snips the
          padlock free. Swings open the gate with a metallic SQUEAK.
          
          They move inside, up the garden path. Though the soil in the
          yard is dead, it's been carefully raked and tended. WEEDS
          arranged in thoughtful patterns, like real flowers.
          
                              SOLARA
                    This is weird.
          
                              ELI
                    Yeah.
          
          Eli steps forward, his foot planting on a CRACKED PAVING
          STONE that shifts almost imperceptibly under his feet.
          Accompanied by a barely audible SOUND. He looks down.
          
                              ELI
                    Shit.
          
                              SOLARA
                    What?
          
          A ROPE NOOSE suddenly whips around their feet, tightening at
          their ankles and YANKING THEM UPSIDE-DOWN INTO THE AIR. Eli
          drops his shotgun to the ground.
          
          They hang there for a moment, twisting in the breeze.
          
          The front door to the house SWINGS OPEN to reveal...
          
          AN ELDERLY COUPLE. The woman's gray hair tied into a neat
          bun. The man bald, squinting through wire-frame glasses. They
          look like the couple from Grant Wood's "American Gothic."
          
          Instead of a pitchfork the man holds a 12-GAUGE RIOT SHOTGUN
          which he keeps trained from the hip on Eli and Solara.
          
                                                                 85.
          
          
          They step outside, regarding their new visitors carefully.
          The man seems more suspicious than his wife. He drags Eli's
          shotgun toward him with his foot, hands it to his wife.
          
                              ELDERLY MAN
                    Who are you?
          
                              ELI
                    My name is Eli. This is Solara.
                    We're travelers, that's all. We
                    don't mean you any harm.
          
                              ELDERLY MAN
                    You cut my padlock. I saw you.
                    Trying to break into our house.
          
                              ELI
                    I'm sorry. We didn't think anybody
                    lived here. We thought it was
                    abandoned, like all the rest.
          
          This seems to annoy the man.
          
                              ELDERLY MAN
                    Take a look around you. Look at
                    this yard. Does it look abandoned
                    to you?
          
          Clearly he's proud of the work he's done with the pitiful
          means at his disposal.
          
                              ELI
                    No, sir. I... like what you've done
                    with the place.
          
                              ELDERLY MAN
                    What's your business here?
          
                              ELI
                    No business. We're sorry to have
                    troubled you. If you'll let us down
                    we'll happily be on our way.
          
          The wife steps forward, she's much warmer, less guarded.
          
                              ELDERLY WOMAN
                    George, look at them! They're not
                    robbers or road agents! One of
                    them's just a girl!
          
                              ELDERLY MAN
                    Seen that before. Oldest trick in
                    the book.
          
                                                                   86.
          
          
                              ELDERLY WOMAN
                    Oh, stop! It's no trick. Let them
                    down!
          
          The woman glares at him. The husband reluctantly accedes and
          moves to the concealed trap apparatus. Releases the rope,
          dropping Eli and Solara to the ground in a heap.
          
          The old woman helps them to their feet. They shake off the
          noose from their ankles.
          
                                ELDERLY WOMAN
                    I'm so sorry about my husband. We
                    so rarely get visitors these days,
                    he's suspicious of everybody.
                         (BEAT)
                    I'm Martha and this is my husband
                    George. Would you care for some
                    tea?
          
          Eli and Solara exchange a look. What the hell is this?
          
          INT. HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY
          
          It's like something out of the world before. The interior is
          almost perfectly preserved. Chintzy couches. A mahogany
          table. A TV set in the corner. Lace curtains. Unreal.
          
          Eli and Solara sit on the couch, feeling self-conscious and
          looking entirely out of place in this cozy environment.
          
          George sits across from them on the couch, scowling at them
          inhospitably. The shotgun resting across his lap.
          
          Martha emerges from the kitchen, carrying a tray laden with a
          tea pot and old china cups. Cracked and faded, but intact.
          She places the tray on the coffee table and sits.
          
                              MARTHA
                    I'm afraid we don't have any cake
                    or biscuits for the tea. They ran
                    out some time ago.
          
          She lifts the tea port and pours into the cups. But it's not
          tea, only water. Somewhat murky water. Eli and Solara stare
          at the cups, unsure. Martha gestures toward them.
          
                              MARTHA
                    Please.
          
          They raise their cups and take a sip. Martha watches eagerly.
          It's clearly a thrill for her to be doing something as
          civilized and elegant as serving "tea" to guests.
          
                                                                 87.
          
          
                              MARTHA
                    How do you like it?
          
                              ELI
                    It's.. uh...
          
                              SOLARA
                    It's very good.
          
          Martha smiles, delighted. She lifts her own cup to her lips.
          HER HANDS TREMBLE, the cup rattling against the saucer.
          
                              ELI
                    Have you always lived here?
          
                              MARTHA
                    For almost forty years now. This
                    home is our pride and joy, isn't
                    it, George?
          
          George just grunts. Not interested in conversation.
          
                              MARTHA
                    We refused to leave, even during
                    the troubles. We said, didn't we
                    George, we said if we're going to
                    die anywhere, we're going to die
                    right here, in our own home.
          
                              ELI
                    I don't understand how you've
                    survived out here this long.
          
                              MARTHA
                    Well, George is something of a
                    handyman, aren't you, dear? He did
                    a lot of work on the place, making
                    it safe. We may be old, but we're
                    resilient. We've had more than a
                    few who've tried to take this place
                    from us. Haven't we, George?
          
                              GEORGE
                    Yes. Yes we have.
          
          He stands and moves toward the back door. Opens it up and
          beckons Eli and Solara to come look.
          
          EXT. HOUSE - BACK YARD - CONTINUOUS
          
          Eli and Solara stand in the doorway, looking out on the yard.
          Solara is horrified by what she sees.
          
                                                                 88.
          
          
          The entire back yard is a GRAVEYARD. Maybe twenty human
          graves dug shallow into the earth. Some were dug long ago,
          others look like they're very recent.
          
                              SOLARA
                    Are these... graves?
          
                              MARTHA
                    Of course. It would be uncivilized
                    not to bury them. We're not
                    barbarians.
          
                              GEORGE
                    Plus, it's good for the soil.
          
                              MARTHA
                    Come on back inside. I think I
                    might be able to rustle up some
                    sandwiches.
          
          George and Martha go back inside, leaving Eli and Solara
          gazing at the little graveyard.
          
                              ELI
                    We have to get out of here.
          
                              SOLARA
                    They look so sweet... I would never
                    have believed they were killers.
          
                              ELI
                    They're worse than that.
          
                                 SOLARA
                    What?
          
                               ELI
                    They didn't just kill these people.
                        (BEAT)
                    They ate them.
          
          Solara is stunned.
          
                                 SOLARA
                    They what?
                              ELI
                    There's a disease in the outland.
                    Spread by eating human meat. It
                    affects the brain. Dementia, loss
                    of motor function. Did you notice
                    the old woman's hands shaking?
                    She's got it. They've both got it.
          
                                                                 89.
          
          
                              SOLARA
                    Oh my God...
          
          INT. HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS
          
          Eli and Solara re-enter. Solara looks at George nervously.
          He's still carrying that shotgun.
          
          Martha's voice drifts in from the nearby KITCHEN.
          
                              MARTHA (O.S.)
                    I found some meat for those
                    sandwiches! Are you hungry?
          
                              SOLARA
                    No! Thank you!
          
                              ELI
                    We really must be going.
          
                               GEORGE
                    So soon?
          
          An unnerving glint in his eye. Eli moves toward the door.
          
                              ELI
                    Yes, I'm afraid so.
          
          As he gets to the door, George moves to intercept. Hard to
          tell if he's blocking his path or moving to open the door for
          him. A tense BEAT.
          
          Martha emerges from the kitchen.
          
                              MARTHA
                    Are you sure you won't stay?
          
                              ELI
                    Yes. Thank you again for the tea.
          
          Eli stares George down. Reluctantly, George steps aside. Eli
          opens the door and escorts Solara outside.
          
          EXT. HOUSE - CONTINUOUS
          
          Eli and Solara emerge into the sunlight. Walk down the garden
          path. And FREEZE IN THEIR TRACKS.
          
          THE ARMED VEHICLES ARE COMING. Driving toward them out of the
          horizon in a hazy cloud of dust.
          
                              SOLARA
                    Oh no... it's my dad. It's his men.
          
                                                                 90.
          
          
                              ELI
                    Are you sure?
          
                              SOLARA
                    I recognize the cars.
          
                              ELI
                    Back inside.
          
          Eli bundles Solara back into the house. George stands in the
          doorway, squinting at the approaching convoy.
          
          INT. HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS
          
          George follows them back in, furious.
          
                              GEORGE
                    What did you bring upon us?
          
                              MARTHA
                    George? What's wrong?
          
                              GEORGE
                    A whole convoy of armed
                    degenerates, that's what's wrong!
                    Coming here for them! And they led
                    them right to us!
          
          Martha rushes to the window, pulls aside the lace curtain.
          Outside she sees the armored vehicles SCREECHING TO A HALT.
          
          The men spill out from the vehicles and take cover behind
          them, locking and loading weapons.
          
                              MARTHA
                    Oh no they don't...
          
          She rushes across the room, teeth gritted with determination.
          
                              GEORGE
                    Martha, what are you doing?
          
                              MARTHA
                    I finally got this house just the
                    way I want it. I'm not going to let
                    anybody tear it apart!
          
          She goes to the couch and yanks off the seat cushions.
          Underneath is a WOODEN LID which she throws open to reveal:
          
          A HUGE CACHE OF WEAPONS. Automatic rifles. Shotguns. Pistols.
          Grenades. And enough ammunition for everything.
          
                                                                 91.
          
          
          She pulls out an M-60 MACHINE-GUN, slings the strap over her
          shoulder and locks in a CHAIN OF BULLETS. She looks like a
          post-apocalyptic Martha Stewart.
          
                              SOLARA
                    Where did you get all this stuff?
          
          George pulls out an AK-47, slots in a magazine.
          
                              GEORGE
                    Took `em off them who came looking
                    to take the place from us. Built up
                    quite the stash over the years.
          
          He offers a .44 MAGNUM to Solara.
          
                              GEORGE
                    You know how to fire a gun?
          
                              SOLARA
                    My daddy showed me once.
          
                              GEORGE
                    Just like riding a bike.
          
                              SOLARA
                    I never rode a bike.
          
          George sighs, turns instead to Eli.
          
                              GEORGE
                    How about you, you know how to-
          
          Eli is already reloading his shotgun, checking the barrel.
          Readying the weapon in the practiced manner of an expert.
          
                              GEORGE
                    Never mind.
          
          EXT. HOUSE - CONTINUOUS
          
          Redridge steps forward, raises a BULLHORN.
          
                              REDRIDGE
                    We know you're in there! Come on
                    out with your hands up and your
                    weapons on the deck and nobody
                    needs to get hurt.
          
          SILENCE. No sign of activity inside the house.
          
          Redridge turns back to his men. Their hands trembling. They
          didn't sign up for this, and they're not ready for it.
          
                                                                    92.
          
          
          Redridge turns back to the house. Into the bullhorn:
          
                              REDRIDGE
                    All right, look. I'm gonna make it
                    easy on y'all. Bring out the girl
                    with the book.
          
          INT. HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS
          
          Eli is crouched beneath the window. George and Martha have
          taken up positions at other windows, peering out.
          
                              REDRIDGE (O.S.)
                    That's all we want. The girl and
                    the book. The rest of you's can go
                    your way.
          
                              SOLARA
                    What are we going to do?
          
          BEAT as Eli thinks.
          
                              ELI
                    Hand me my pack.
          
          EXT. HOUSE - DAY
          
          Redridge waits. Still no sign of a response. His nervous
          gunmen exchange worried looks.
          
                              CARNEGIE GUNMAN #2
                    They ain't comin' out. They-
          
          Redridge raises his hand to silence him. Looks up as an
          UPSTAIRS WINDOW slides open.
          
          A CLOTH PACKAGE is tossed from the window. It lands in the
          dirt outside the perimeter fence a few yards from Redridge.
          
          Cautiously, he approaches. The package is wrapped in cloth
          and tied up with twine. It looks like Eli's bible.
          
          He picks it up and tugs at the twine, untying it. Folds away
          the cloth wrapping. Looks for a moment in puzzlement at the
          object, at the words written on the front of it.
          
                                THIS SIDE TO FACE ENEMY
          
          It's a MINIATURE CLAYMORE MINE. The small red light on top of
          the unit ILLUMINATES WITH A BEEP. Armed.
          
                              REDRIDGE
                    Holy shi...
          
                                                                    93.
          
          
          He drops the package in the dirt and races for his life back
          toward the vehicles.
          
                                REDRIDGE
                      Get down! Everybody get down!
          
          He dives across the trunk of the Explorer into cover as THE
          MINE EXPLODES, SHATTERING EVERY WINDOW OF EVERY VEHICLE. The
          lightweight Mini Cooper takes the main brunt and EXPLODES,
          cartwheeling through the air, a burning wreck.
          
          Redridge looks around. Three men lie dead already. Flaming
          wreckage all around him. Suddenly, it's a war zone.
          
          MACHINE-GUN FIRE ERUPTS FROM THE HOUSE, peppering the
          vehicles' armor. The gunmen cower behind cover.
          
                                REDRIDGE
                      Damn you, return fire!
          
          Redridge aims at the house and OPENS FIRE. Inspired by his
          example, the others follow. A HAIL OF BULLETS CRISS-CROSS
          BACK AND FORTH. The house's faded paint facade is shredded.
          
          INT. HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS
          
          Martha continues firing wildly with the M-60. Screaming at
          the top of her lungs, loving every minute of it.
          
                                MARTHA
                      Come and get it, you god-damn sons
                      of mother-fucking bitches!
          
          George and Eli also open fire from their windows,
          periodically ducking to take cover from incoming fire.
          
          Solara sits across the room, in the corner, sobbing.
          
                                ELI
                      It's all right. We're going to be
                      all right. Trust me.
          
          MORE GUNFIRE splinters the window frame above his head.
          
                                ELI
                      You remember what I told you about
                      faith?
          
          She nods.
          
          Eli peeks out and FIRES OUT THE WINDOW, dropping one of the
          enemy gunmen with a crack shot. Ducks back down as the return
          fire impacts around him.
          
                                                                 94.
          
          
                              ELI
                    We're going to get out of this
                    alive. Both of us. I know.
          
                              SOLARA
                    Because God told you?
          
                              ELI
                    Because God told me.
          
          Amidst all the chaos and gunfire, George has been listening
          to this exchange.
          
                              GEORGE
                    What about us?
          
          BEAT.
          
                              ELI
                    He didn't mention you.
          
          BEAT. George chambers a round and RESUMES FIRING.
          
          EXT. HOUSE - CONTINUOUS
          
          Redridge's men continue the hail of gunfire. Six of them dead
          now, six more still standing. No lessening of fire from
          inside the house. They're losing.
          
          Redridge races between the vehicles, ducking from gunfire
          until he makes it to the back of the Dodge Caravan. Pops the
          trunk and pulls out a ROCKET-PROPELLED GRENADE LAUNCHER.
          
          He sets it on his shoulder, rests on the trunk to steady his
          aim. And FIRES. The rocket screams toward its target, tearing
          through the chain fence and TEARING AN ENTIRE CORNER FROM THE
          HOUSE in a fiery explosion.
          
          INT. HOUSE - CONTINUOUS
          
          Filled with smoke. The sounds of COUGHING.
          
          Dazed, George pushes his way through the smoke, waving his
          arms to clear it. A BLOODY GASH on his forehead.
          
                              GEORGE
                    Martha? Martha!
          
          He finds her lying on the tile floor in what remains of the
          kitchen. Or at least her top half. The rest of her is gone.
          
          George slumps to his knees with tear-filled eyes. Takes his
          wife tenderly by the hand for a moment.
          
                                                                    95.
          
          
          Then the anger returns. He gets up and turns, consumed now by
          a wild fury. Firing with rage over the torn brick wall. He
          CLIPS ANOTHER GUNMAN IN THE HEAD, killing him.
          
          George moves back toward the LIVING ROOM, firing as he goes.
          
          EXT. HOUSE - CONTINUOUS
          
          Redridge moves between the cars again, staying behind cover.
          George's hail of gunfire has them pinned down.
          
                              REDRIDGE
                    We got any more of those RPGs?
          
                              CARNEGIE GUNMAN #3
                    That was it.
          
                              REDRIDGE
                    Screw this.
          
          Redridge jumps into the driver's seat of the minivan, turns
          the key in the ignition. Jams the accelerator down with the
          butt of his rifle, then shifts the transmission into DRIVE.
          
                                 REDRIDGE
                    Get clear!
          
          The gunmen leap clear as the minivan HURTLES TOWARD THE
          HOUSE, engine roaring. CRASHES THROUGH THE CHAIN FENCE.
          
          INT. HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS
          
          Eli looks up from cover and see the van coming RIGHT AT HIM.
          He dives clear as the van CRASHES THROUGH THE WALL INTO THE
          LIVING ROOM. It SMASHES INTO THE FAR WALL, finally coming to
          a stop.
          
          More dust and debris, more coughing. Eli tries to get up, but
          winces in pain. Puts his hand to his side, it comes back WET
          WITH BLOOD. A bad wound. He covers it with his coat, stands
          and moves through the smoke.
          
                                 ELI
                    Solara?
          
                                 SOLARA (O.S.)
                    Eli!
          
          He finds her in the smoke. She embraces him.
          
                              ELI
                    Are you all right?
          
                                                                 96.
          
          
                                SOLARA
                    I'm fine.
          
          As the smoke clears, Solara sees George PINNED AGAINST THE
          WALL BY THE MINIVAN. His body crushed. Dead.
          
                                SOLARA
                    Oh God...
          
                              ELI
                    Come on. We're going out the back.
                    We're running.
          
          As he helps her to her feet, we hear the sound of MOVEMENT
          THROUGH THE RUBBLE.
          
          They turn around. The gunmen are ENTERING THE HOUSE, passing
          through the smoking hole left by the minivan.
          
          Eli reaches for his sword. Met by the sound of MULTIPLE GUNS
          COCKING. Redridge steps out from among the gunmen. Smiles.
          
                              REDRIDGE
                    Go ahead and try it, holy man. You
                    ain't that fast.
          
          EXT. HOUSE - DAY
          
          Eli and Solara are shoved out of the house at gunpoint and
          marched past the torn perimeter fence to the vehicles.
          
          Eli has been stripped of his weapons and backpack. Redridge
          faces him and points a pistol at his head.
          
                              REDRIDGE
                    Where's the book?
          
          BEAT. Eli doesn't answer. Redridge cocks the pistol.
          
                              REDRIDGE
                    I ain't playing.
          
          Redridge stares him down. Eli just stares right back. Totally
          unflappable. Redridge motions to his men.
          
                              REDRIDGE
                    Check the pack.
          
          The gunman carrying Eli's pack opens it up and tips its
          contents out onto the ground. The ghillie suit, battery, some
          old canned goods, other odds and ends. No sign of the book.
          
                              CARNEGIE GUNMAN #4
                    It ain't here.
          
                                                                 97.
          
          
                              REDRIDGE
                    It's gotta be.
          
          Redridge holsters his gun and frisks Eli, going through his
          pockets. Finds nothing. He opens Eli's coat and checks the
          inside pockets. Digs around deep inside.
          
                              REDRIDGE
                    Hello, what have we here?
          
          And then suddenly he SHRIEKS IN PAIN. Yanks his hand out to
          reveal ELI'S RAT, TEETH SUNK DEEP INTO HIS FLESH.
          
          Redridge flails around violently, trying to get the rat off
          him, but it won't let go. His hand is bleeding badly.
          
                              REDRIDGE
                    Fuck! Get it off! Get it off me!
          
          He finally manages to shake it free. It hits the floor dazed.
          Redridge STOMPS ON IT with his boot, reducing it to a bloody
          smear in the dirt. Eli lowers his head in sadness.
          
          Redridge clutches his bloody hand, glares at Eli furiously.
          Pulls his gun again and marches right up to him, pressing the
          muzzle tight against his forehead.
          
                              REDRIDGE
                    If you don't got the book, what
                    fucking use are you?
          
          His finger tightens on the trigger.
          
                                SOLARA
                    Wait!
          
          She breaks from the gunmen holding her and rushes toward
          Redridge. Reaches inside her dress and PRODUCES THE BIBLE.
          
                              SOLARA
                    It's here! I've got it! Please
                    don't kill him.
          
                                ELI
                    Solara...
          
                              SOLARA
                    It's just a book, Eli. No book is
                    worth giving up your life for.
          
                              ELI
                    You're wrong.
          
                                                                   98.
          
          
          Satisfied, Redridge takes the book. Runs his hand over the
          leather cover, gazes admiringly at the gold-embossed cross.
          
                              REDRIDGE
                    You did good, sweetheart. Your
                    daddy would be proud. He knew you'd
                    come through for him.
          
          Solara looks at Eli guiltily. She feels terrible.
          
                              SOLARA
                    He said he would hurt my mom. If I
                    didn't help him.
          
                              REDRIDGE
                        (SMILING)
                    Daddy's little girl...
          
          Solara stands between him and Eli. Deadly serious now.
          
                              SOLARA
                    I want you to let him go.
          
                              REDRIDGE
                    What?
          
                              SOLARA
                    You've got what you came for. You
                    don't need him. Let him go.
          
                              REDRIDGE
                    He's killed a dozen of my men.
          
                              SOLARA
                    If you hurt him, I'm not coming
                    back with you. You'll have to drag
                    me kicking and screaming.
          
          Solara glares at Redridge. He sighs. He can tell she means
          it. It's not worth the aggravation. He turns back to Eli.
          
                              REDRIDGE
                    Take your shit and get out of here.
          
          Eli gathers up his stuff into his pack. Shoulders it and goes
          to pick up his sword, but Redridge puts his boot on it.
          
                              REDRIDGE
                    No weapons.
          
          Eli still has a half-dozen guns trained on him. He turns and
          walks away, toward the road. As he passes Solara:
          
                                                                   99.
          
          
                              ELI
                    I told you we'd both live. Now do
                    you have faith?
          
          A tear runs down Solara's cheek as she watches him walk away.
          
          Redridge grabs her by the arm and pulls her toward the
          vehicles as his men load up and prepare to move out.
          
          IN THE REARMOST VEHICLE
          
          Solara sits in the back seat, staring out the rear window as
          it drives down the road at the tail end of the convoy.
          
          She watches as Eli moves away down the road, getting smaller
          and smaller until he is just a speck on the horizon.
          
          She bursts into floods of uncontrollable tears.
          
          LATER
          
          Solara in the back seat, calmer now. The tears dried on her
          cheeks. She sits staring blankly at the DRIVER in front.
          
          And then she LUNGES VIOLENTLY FORWARD. Clawing and biting at
          the driver, who struggles to fight her off. His hands come
          off the wheel and the car FISHTAILS WILDLY.
          
          REDRIDGE'S VEHICLE
          
          The DRIVER sees something odd in the rear-view mirror.
          
                              DRIVER
                    What the hell...?
          
          Redridge turns to see the car behind VEERING ERRATICALLY then
          SLAMMING ON THE BRAKES, stopping in the middle of the road.
          
                              REDRIDGE
                    Stop, stop!
          
          The car screeches to a halt. Redridge watches through the
          rear window as the driver's side door opens and the driver is
          KICKED OUT ONTO THE ASPHALT.
          
          The door closes again, the engine revs and the car TURNS
          AROUND, racing back down the road in the direction it came.
          
                              REDRIDGE
                    Shit. Turn around!
          
                              DRIVER
                    We ain't got the gas for it!
          
                                                                   100.
          
          
                              REDRIDGE
                    She's getting away!
          
                              DRIVER
                    We got the book! And we got barely
                    enough gas to make it back as it
                    is! We can't go chasin' her!
          
          BEAT. Redridge knows he's right.
          
                               REDRIDGE
                    Stupid little bitch...
                        (BEAT)
                    Drive on.
          
          The car moves on, following the rest of the convoy.
          
          EXT. HOUSE - DAY
          
          Solara screeches the car to a halt outside the smoking
          wreckage of the besieged house. She runs from the vehicle to
          where ELI'S SWORD lies in the dirt and grabs it up.
          
          EXT. ROAD - DUSK
          
          Solara races down the road in the car, pedal to the metal.
          
                              SOLARA
                    Come on, come on...
          
          Eventually, she sees him. At first just a dot on the horizon.
          But unmistakably Eli. By now, she'd know him anywhere.
          
          Suddenly the engine SPLUTTERS. She checks the fuel gauge; the
          needle deep in the red. She pounds the wheel in frustration.
          
                                SOLARA
                    No... No!
          
          The car grinds to a halt, dead. She flings open the door and
          leaps out of the vehicle, rushing after Eli on foot.
          
          ON ELI. As always, his pace steady and slow. The sun directly
          ahead of him as it sets on the horizon. Headed always west.
          
          Solara is running up behind him, a hundred yards back.
          
                                SOLARA
                    Eli! Eli!
          
          He doesn't stop or look back. Just keeps on walking.
          
          She finally catches up with him, breathing hard, exhausted.
          
                                                                  101.
          
          
                                 SOLARA
                    Eli...
          
                              ELI
                    Thought you'd gone back to town.
          
                              SOLARA
                    I can't go back there. Eli, I'm so
                    sorry.
          
                                 ELI
                    For what?
          
                              SOLARA
                    For what? I betrayed you! I gave
                    them the book!
          
                              ELI
                    You did what you believed you had
                    to.
          
                              SOLARA
                    You're not mad at me?
          
          BEAT.
          
                              ELI
                    I forgive you.
          
          She continues walking alongside him. Trying to process this.
          This kind of compassion is totally foreign to her.
          
          She holds out the sword, offering it to Eli by way of
          atonement.
          
                               SOLARA
                    Here. I thought you might still
                    need this.
          
          Eli seems appreciative that she would think to return it to
          him. He takes it and slings it over his shoulder.
          
                                 ELI
                    Thank you.
          
                              SOLARA
                    What are you going to do now?
          
                              ELI
                    Same as always. Keep heading west.
          
                              SOLARA
                    Why? I mean, you don't have the
                    book any more.
          
                                                                  102.
          
          
                              ELI
                    But I still have my faith.
          
          They walk on together, into the sunset.
          
          EXT. NORTHERN CALIFORNIA - MONTAGE - DAY
          
          Eli and Solara follow the road through burned-out towns and
          retail neighborhoods. Gutted and dead, like every place else.
          
          But something is different here. Things are greener. Tufts of
          grass here and there. They attract Solara's attention.
          
                              SOLARA
                    What's that?
          
          Eli reaches down and runs his hand through the grass.
          
                              ELI
                    It's grass. It used to grow all
                    over the place.
          
                              SOLARA
                    How come it's here?
          
                              ELI
                    I don't know. Less poison in the
                    air this near to the ocean, maybe.
          
          They keep walking. Eli groans, clutches his side. Does his
          best to hide his pain from Solara. She notices anyway.
          
                              SOLARA
                    What's wrong?
          
                              ELI
                    Nothing. Just a cramp.
          
          EXT. FREEWAY - NIGHT
          
          They walk on through the night. Eli stops and sniffs the air.
          
                                 SOLARA
                    What?
          
                              ELI
                    Do you smell that?
          
                              SOLARA
                    Smell what?
          
                              ELI
                    Salt in the air. We're close to the
                    ocean. We're almost there.
          
                                                                103.
          
          
          EXT. CALIFORNIA ROAD - DAWN
          
          They keep on along the road. A shallow uphill incline. They
          follow it uphill, finally reaching its crest, where they stop
          and take in the view before them.
          
          THE PACIFIC OCEAN. Straddled by the GOLDEN GATE BRIDGE - the
          once-great structure has partially collapsed from decades of
          neglect and disrepair. The span sags and hangs low over the
          ocean, the asphalt cracked and ruptured.
          
          On the other side of the bay, SAN FRANCISCO - or the little
          that remains of it. The city has been almost TOTALLY
          DESTROYED - entire areas reduced to rubble, the few buildings
          still standing looking on the verge of collapse.
          
          Solara looks at it all in horrified awe. Eli, unperturbed,
          keeps on moving, still clutching his side.
          
                               ELI
                    Come on.
          
          EXT. GOLDEN GATE BRIDGE - DAY
          
          Eli and Solara make their way south across the bridge, side-
          stepping the fractures in the road.
          
          EXT. SAN FRANCISCO RUINS - DAY
          
          Eli leads Solara through the rubble of what used to be San
          Francisco. It's like walking through the wreckage of 9/11's
          Ground Zero, but a hundred times the scale. Horrifying.
          
          They pass by the wreckage of a HOTEL, nothing but the lobby
          still standing. A HILTON sign protruding from the rubble.
          
          Eli uses his sheathed sword as a walking stick, poking around
          ahead of him for loose rubble underfoot. He steps carefully.
          
                              ELI
                    Watch your footing. Step where I
                    step.
          
          EXT. SAN FRANCISCO - FINANCIAL DISTRICT - DAY
          
          More buildings are still standing here, but they're nothing
          more than great dead monoliths. Solara looks up at the
          blasted skyscrapers - she's never seen anything like it.
          
          The buildings loom over her like giant tombstones. It scares
          her - like walking through the graveyard of a dead world.
          
                              SOLARA
                    This... this is the world before?
          
                                                                104.
          
          
                              ELI
                    What's left of it.
          
          They keep walking, passing the TOPPLED TRANSAMERICA PYRAMID.
          
          EXT. SAN FRANCISCO - FISHERMAN'S WHARF - DAY
          
          Once a bustling oceanside tourist spot, now a ghost town.
          
          Eli and Solara walk along the litter-strewn street, passing
          the old RIPLEY'S BELIEVE-IT-OR-NOT and WAX MUSEUMS. The
          celebrity mannequins are still in fair condition, but slumped
          at their feet are CHARRED HUMAN SKELETONS.
          
          Eli is struggling now. He looks pale from the blood loss. His
          breathing labored. Solara takes him by the arm to help him.
          
          EXT. SAN FRANCISCO - PIER 39 - DAY
          
          A dead, ruined place, like everywhere else. We hear the sound
          of SEAGULLS nearby - the only sign of life at all.
          
          Eli and Solara walk along the pier, until they reach its end.
          The original end has long since collapsed into the sea, but a
          RICKETY HAND-MADE ROPE BRIDGE has been affixed to the pier's
          sheared-off edge.
          
          Eli and Solara stand at the pier's end, looking out to sea.
          
                              ELI
                    Do you see that?
          
                              SOLARA
                    I see it. Is that it?
          
                                 ELI
                    That's it.
          
          Reveal now that the rope-bridge leads out across the bay to:
          
          ALCATRAZ ISLAND
          
          Looking much the same as it always has, old and dilapidated.
          The coastal fog shrouding it gives it an ethereal look. It
          feels almost like a mythic place - the "promised land" Eli
          has sought for so many years.
          
          A tattered STARS AND STRIPES still flutters in the breeze
          atop the prison lighthouse.
          
                                                                  105.
          
          
          EXT. BAY ROPE BRIDGE - DAY
          
          Eli and Solara make their way carefully across the bridge. It
          feels highly unstable and sags low over the bay, the waters
          below close enough to lap around their ankles.
          
          EXT. ALCATRAZ ISLAND - DAY
          
          Eli and Solara arrive at the prison gates. Securely locked.
          As they inspect it for a possible way to enter:
          
                              VOICE (O.S.)
                    Who goes there?
          
          They look up. A GUARD in paramilitary fatigues is stationed
          in one of the perimeter towers. Training a rifle on them.
          
                              ALCATRAZ GUARD
                    Identify yourselves!
          
          In the opposite tower ANOTHER GUARD has his rifle trained on
          them too. Eli looks up, raises his hands.
          
                              ELI
                    My name is Elijah Stone. I have a
                    message for your boss. I need you
                    to tell him that I have a King
                    James Bible in my possession.
          
          BEAT.
          
                              ALCATRAZ GUARD
                    Remain where you are! Do not
                    attempt to move or you will be
                    fired upon!
          
          Keeping the gun trained on them, the tower guard uses his
          free hand to talk into a WALKIE-TALKIE RADIO. We don't hear
          the conversation. All Eli and Solara can do is wait.
          
          The guard puts away his radio and shouts back down:
          
                              ALCATRAZ GUARD
                    Be prepared to surrender any
                    weapons at the gate!
          
          BEAT. And then the massive front gates SLOWLY OPEN ON
          MECHANICAL RUNNERS with the low groan of rusted iron.
          
          Eli and Solara look at each other, then step gingerly inside.
          
                                                                106.
          
          
          INT. ALCATRAZ - MAIN GATES - CONTINUOUS
          
          As soon as they step inside they are SURROUNDED BY DOZENS OF
          HEAVILY-ARMED SOLDIERS. Not U.S. military, more like a semi-
          official militia. But every bit as deadly.
          
          Eli and Solara raise their hands. A pair of SOLDIERS take
          Eli's pack and sword, pat them both down for other weapons.
          
                              SOLDIER
                    They're clean.
          
          The soldiers before them part - to reveal a THIN, BALDING MAN
          wearing spectacles. He wears Kevlar body armor over his tweed
          jacket and tie. Professorial, academic.
          
          He approaches, shakes Eli's hand vigorously - very excited.
          
                              THIN MAN
                    Welcome, both of you. I'm Professor
                    Lombardi. I'm the curator here.
          
                              ELI
                    Elijah Stone.
          
                                 SOLARA
                    Solara.
          
                              LOMBARDI
                    Solara. What a delightful name. Is
                    that by any chance Shakespearean?
          
                              SOLARA
                    I, uh, I think it's Japanese.
          
                                 LOMBARDI
                    Wonderful.
          
          He turns back to Eli.
          
                              LOMBARDI
                    Is it true what they tell me? You
                    have a King James Version?
          
                              ELI
                    Been carrying it with me for twenty-
                    five years.
          
          Solara looks at Eli, puzzled. Lombardi finds it hard to
          contain his excitement.
          
                              LOMBARDI
                    My goodness. I can't tell you how
                    exciting this is. Well, come, come!
                              (MORE)
          
                                                                107.
          
                              LOMBARDI (cont'd)
                    I'll give you the nickel tour and
                    then we can all sit down and take a
                    look at it.
          
          He leads them across the courtyard into the prison buildings.
          
          EXT. DESERT TOWN - MAIN STREET - DAY
          
          Redridge's remaining vehicles drive back into town and come
          to a halt outside the theater. Redridge emerges from his car,
          carrying the bible. Walks up to the Palladium and enters.
          
          INT. ALCATRAZ - CELL BLOCK - DAY
          
          What was once a cell block is now an IMMENSE LIBRARY. Stacked
          floor to ceiling with books. Lombardi shows Eli and Solara
          around. Behind them, a pair of ARMED GUARDS follow closely.
          
                              LOMBARDI
                    Yes, we've been doing this for some
                    time now. Collected over thirty
                    thousand volumes from generous
                    donors all across the nation. We
                    even have a printing press that we
                    hope to have operational soon.
          
          Solara is stunned as she surveys the endless stacks of books.
          She's never seen anything like it.
          
                              SOLARA
                    You turned the whole prison into a
                    library?
          
                               LOMBARDI
                    Well, not exactly. We're more like
                    a storage facility. We're holding
                    these books here in trust, if you
                    like. When society gets back on its
                    feet and no longer needs us to
                    preserve these volumes, they'll be
                    here waiting.
                        (BEAT)
                    I must ask you, how did you hear
                    about us? We've been doing
                    everything we can to get the word
                    out, but we always like to know
                    where our benefactors come from.
          
                              ELI
                    I was sent here by God.
          
          Lombardi raises a quizzical eyebrow.
          
                                                                 108.
          
          
                               LOMBARDI
                    Is that right? Well, it's good to
                    know we're getting such high-
                    profile referrals these days.
                        (BEAT)
                    I must say, I am so excited that we
                    finally have a King James. You
                    know, we have a Talmud here, we
                    have two Korans, we even have that
                    Scientology book. But never a
                    Christian bible, until now. I
                    honestly believed it was the one
                    book I'd never see again, after
                    what happened...
          
          BEAT. Lombardi appears sad for a moment.
          
                              LOMBARDI
                    May I ask what condition it's in?
          
                              ELI
                    It's a little beat-up. But it'll do
                    the job.
          
                              LOMBARDI
                    Well, then. What say we take a look
                    at it?
          
          Lombardi looks at Eli with anticipation. So does Solara,
          interested to know where this is going to go next.
          
          Eli winces in pain, puts his hand to his side.
          
                              ELI
                    Is there someplace we could sit?
          
                              LOMBARDI
                    Of course. Right this way.
          
          INT. PALLADIUM AUDITORIUM - CARNEGIE'S BOX
          
          Redridge appears. Carnegie looks at him eagerly.
          
                              CARNEGIE
                    Did you get it?
          
          Redridge holds the bible up proudly. Carnegie beams.
          
                               CARNEGIE
                    Show me.
          
          Redridge hands it over. Carnegie sits back in his chair,
          running his hand lovingly over the battered leather cover.
          
                                                                   109.
          
          
                              CARNEGIE
                    The new world begins here...
          
          He opens the book and looks inside.
          
          BEAT. And then he looks up at Redridge, confused.
          
                              CARNEGIE
                    What the fuck is this?
          
          INT. ALCATRAZ - CAFETERIA - DAY
          
          Eli, Solara and Lombardi sit at one of the long lunch-room
          tables. The two armed guards keep watch nearby.
          
                              ELI
                    Do you have something you can write
                    with?
          
                              LOMBARDI
                    Mmm? Oh, yes of course!
          
          He pulls a pen from his pocket, motions to one of the guards.
          
                              LOMBARDI
                    Could you please bring us some
                    writing paper?
          
          The guard nods and moves toward the door. As he does so:
          
                              ELI
                    Bring a lot of it.
          
          INT. PALLADIUM AUDITORIUM - CARNEGIE'S BOX
          
          Carnegie looks at the open bible, jaw hanging loose, his
          complexion ashen. Like he's just been slapped in the face.
          
                              REDRIDGE
                    What? What is it?
          
          INT. ALCATRAZ - CAFETERIA - DAY
          
          The guard brings a THICK SHEAF OF WRITING PAPER to the
          cafeteria table, sets it down by Lombardi.
          
                              ELI
                    Are you ready?
          
                              LOMBARDI
                    What exactly am I writing?
          
                                                                 110.
          
          
                              ELI
                    Pay close attention and write down
                    every word exactly as I say it.
          
          Eli removes his goggles. Solara can't believe what she sees.
          
          His eyes are pale, milky-white, dead. TOTALLY BLIND.
          
                              ELI
                    The First Book of Moses called
                    Genesis. Chapter one, verse one. In
                    the beginning God created the
                    heavens and the earth. Verse two.
                    The earth was without form, and
                    void; and darkness was on the face
                    of the deep. And the spirit of God
                    was hovering over the face of the
                    waters. Verse three. And God said,
                    "Let there be light," and there was
                    light.
          
          Lombardi hurriedly writes down every word.
          
          INT. PALLADIUM AUDITORIUM - CARNEGIE'S BOX
          
          Carnegie sits at his desk, still in shock. Eli's bible sits
          open on the desk before him.
          
          A BRAILLE BIBLE.
          
          Claudia is ushered in by a guard.
          
                              CLAUDIA
                    What's wrong?
          
          He rushes forward and thrusts the bible into her hands.
          
                              CARNEGIE
                    You told me once that you know how
                    to read this. This blind language.
          
                              CLAUDIA
                    Well, a long time ago, when I was a
                    little girl...
          
                              CARNEGIE
                    You're going to read it for me.
                    Every word. And I'm going to write
                    it down. Start at the beginning.
          
          As Carnegie hunts on his desk for a paper and pen, Claudia
          opens the book and trails her fingertips across the raised
          lettering.
          
                                                                111.
          
          
          For a moment there is a glimmer of recognition... a faint
          smile... but then it fades as Carnegie turns back to her,
          eagerly clutching the writing materials.
          
                               CLAUDIA
                    I'm sorry. It's been so long. I
                    don't remember. I don't remember
                    any of it.
          
          Carnegie is aghast. BEAT as the anger swells within him,
          threatening to explode...
          
                              CARNEGIE
                    God fucking dammit!
          
          He swipes violently at the bible, knocking it out of
          Claudia's hands. He grabs it up and tries to rip it in two,
          but it's too thick to tear. Red-faced with rage, he tosses it
          out over the box balcony. It lands somewhere in the dark
          auditorium below, between the rows of gutted theater seats.
          
          As he paces angrily back past Claudia:
          
                              CLAUDIA
                    Bill, is there something-
          
                              CARNEGIE
                    Just go. Just get out of my sight.
          
          He slumps in his chair, exhausted and furious. Claudia sadly
          turns and leaves him alone with his thoughts.
          
          INT. ALCATRAZ - CAFETERIA - NIGHT
          
          Some considerable time later. Great stacks of paper have been
          filled with Lombardi's handwriting.
          
          Lombardi's pen races across the paper, struggling to keep up
          with Eli's recitation.
          
          Solara is curled up on a nearby bench, asleep. Eli's coat
          covering her to keep her warm.
          
          Eli clutches his wound painfully as he continues to recite.
          He looks paler now than ever. Close to death.
          
                              ELI (V.O.)
                    Dear Lord, thank you for giving me
                    the strength and the conviction to
                    complete the task you entrusted to
                    me. Thank you for guiding me
                    straight and true, through the many
                    obstacles in my path.
                              (MORE)
          
                                                                112.
          
                              ELI (V.O.) (cont'd)
                    And for keeping me resolute when
                    all around seemed lost.
          
          EXT. ALCATRAZ - EXERCISE YARD - PRE-DAWN
          
          The prison yard shrouded in the dim light just before dawn.
          
          Solara crosses the yard. She looks more mature somehow.
          Determined and strong. She carries with her ELI'S SWORD - and
          something else, tucked under her arm.
          
                              ELI (V.O.)
                    Thank you for your protection and
                    for your many signs along the way.
          
          She stops in a nondescript corner of the yard.
          
          At her feet is a SHALLOW MOUND OF DIRT. At the head of the
          mound, a SIMPLE TOMBSTONE.
          
          She kneels and places a SINGLE FLOWER on the grave.
          
          INT. PALLADIUM - CARNEGIE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
          
          Lit only by the pale moonlight, barely enough to see by.
          
          Carnegie sleeps soundly in bed. Next to him lies Claudia,
          wide awake. She checks that Carnegie is sound asleep, careful
          not to wake him before she creeps out of bed and exits.
          
          INT. PALLADIUM AUDITORIUM - NIGHT
          
          Claudia is on her hands and knees in the darkness, searching
          blindly in the aisles and beneath the theater seats.
          
          She finds Eli's bible in some litter strewn on the floor.
          
                              ELI (V.O.)
                    Thank you for the good that I have
                    done. For whatever light you were
                    able to shine into the darkness of
                    this world through me.
          
          Sitting in the darkness, Claudia opens the book and runs her
          fingers across the braille, reading. And though we can barely
          see in the dim light, we see the smile on her face. The joy.
          
          EXT. ALCATRAZ - EXERCISE YARD - DAWN
          
          As Solara kneels by the grave, we see now that she wears
          Eli's SAINT CHRISTOPHER PENDANT around her neck.
          
          The tombstone reads:
          
                                                                113.
          
          
                               HERE LIES ELIJAH STONE
                                DIED AUGUST 21, 2048
                            FAITHFUL SERVANT TO THE LORD
                                AND FRIEND TO SOLARA
          
          She unsheathes Eli's sword, plants it in the ground before
          his grave. Takes the BOOK from under her arm and opens it up.
          
          It's a NEW BIBLE. Crudely typeset from Lombardi's original
          transcription and printed on the prison press.
          
          She opens it up and begins to read a passage from the bible
          over Eli's grave. We don't hear what she says.
          
          As Solara finishes her reading and closes the bible, LOMBARDI
          appears behind her.
          
                              LOMBARDI
                    You know, you don't have to leave.
                    You're welcome to stay here with
                    us. You'll be safe.
          
                               SOLARA
                    Thanks.
          
          She stands, pulling Eli's sword from the earth.
          
                              SOLARA
                    But I gotta do what I gotta do.
          
                              LOMBARDI
                    Where will you go?
          
          BEAT. Solara looks at the sword, her fingers playing across
          its hilt. The blade glimmers in the light of the rising sun.
          
          There is a determined, purposeful look in her eye.
          
                               SOLARA
                    Home.
          
          EXT. ALCATRAZ ISLAND - DAWN
          
          The sun rises through the fog on the horizon.
          
          The great iron gates grind open. Solara emerges from inside
          the prison, steps out onto the island rock.
          
          She is dressed in a flak jacket, combat pants and boots.
          Eli's old pack across her back. Hair tied in a neat pony
          tail. Atop that, Eli's ragged fur hat.
          
                              ELI (V.O.)
                    Thank you for the friend I made.
          
                                                                114.
          
          
          In her hand she clutches a copy of the newly-printed bible.
          Eli's sword slung over her shoulder.
          
                              ELI (V.O.)
                    Please watch over her as you
                    watched over me.
          
          MONTAGE as Solara walks back along Fisherman's Wharf...
          through the San Francisco rubble... across the Golden Gate
          bridge...
          
                              ELI (V.O.)
                    Thank you for allowing me finally
                    to rest. I'm so very tired. The
                    time of my departure is at hand and
                    now I surrender my soul into your
                    care, at peace in knowing that I
                    have carried out your will. That I
                    have done right with my time on
                    this earth.
          
          EXT. ROAD - DAY
          
          ...and finally back onto a desolate road leading off into the
          desert wasteland. She looks up and down the road, then turns
          and heads toward the sun on the horizon. Headed east.
          
                              ELI (V.O.)
                    I have fought the good fight. I
                    have finished the race.
          
          As she walks away into the sun, her lonely silhouette on the
          road reminds us of Eli as we saw him so many times before.
          
                              ELI (V.O.)
                    I have kept the faith.
          
          She grows smaller and smaller as she walks into the distance,
          until she consumed by the rising sun and we

               DARKNESS. THE SOUND OF WIND AND SPRAY.

               MUSIC. TITLES.

               EXT. OCEAN -- NIGHT

               The darkness is actually water. A SEARCHLIGHT arcs across 
               heavy ocean swells. Half-a-dozen flashlights -- weaker beams -- 
               racing along what we can see is the deck of an aging FISHING 
               TRAWLER.

               FISHERMEN struggling with a gaff -- something in the water --

               A HUMAN CORPSE.

               EXT. FISHING BOAT DECK -- NIGHT

               THE BODY sprawled there. The Sailors all talking at once -- 
               three languages going -- brave chatter to mask the presence 
               of death --

                                     SAILOR #1
                         -- Jesus, look at him --

                         -- what? -- you never saw a dead man 
                         before? --

                                     SAILOR #3
                         -- look, look he was shot --

                                     SAILOR #2
                         -- he's dead, you think he cares? --

                                     SAILOR #1
                         -- so have some respect -- it's a --
                              (stopping as --)

               THE BODY MOVES! -- convulsing -- coughing up sea water -- 
               the Sailors -- freaked -- jumping back -- standing there, as --

               THE MAN begins to breathe.

               INT. FISHING BOAT BUNK ROOM -- NIGHT

               A wreck. Too small for all the people in here right now -- 
               SAILORS sweeping off the table -- rough hands laying THE MAN 
               down --

               THE CAPTAIN -- brutal and impatient -- watching from the 
               door as --

               GIANCARLO tears through the clutter -- searching for a medical 
               kit buried in the shambles. GIANCARLO is sixty. A bloodshot 
               soul.

                                     GIANCARLO
                         -- it's here -- hang on -- it's here 
                         somewhere -- give me a minute -- get 
                         some blankets -- get some blankets 
                         on him --
                              (finding the kit --)
                         -- here we go -- here it is --

               GIANCARLO with an old trunk -- just getting it open, as --

                                     THE CAPTAIN
                         Giancarlo.
                              (Giancarlo turns back --)
                         We pick him up? Okay, we have to 
                         pick him up. But that's as far as it 
                         goes.

                                     GIANCARLO
                         He needs a doctor.

                                     CAPTAIN
                         Fuck that. He lives? He dies? I don't 
                         care. We've wasted two hours on this 
                         shit already. You do what you can, 
                         but we're not going back.
                              (pure steel now)
                         You understand me?

                                     GIANCARLO
                         Yes, sir.

                                     CAPTAIN
                              (to the rest of them)
                         Let's get back to work!

               GIANCARLO watching them run out. Snagging a quick pull on a 
               pint of rum he's got stashed and --

               INT. FISHING BOAT BUNK ROOM -- DAWN -- TIME CUTS

               Transformed into a makeshift operating room. A light swings 
               overhead. THE MAN layed out across the table. Sounds -- groans -- 
               words -- snatches of them -- all in different languages.

               GIANCARLO playing doctor in a greasy kitchen apron. Cutting 
               away the clothes. Turning THE MAN on his side. Two bullet 
               wounds in the back. Probing them, judging them.

               Now -- GIANCARLO with a flashlight in his teeth -- TINK -- 
               TINK -- TINK -- bullet fragments falling into a washed-out 
               olive jar.

               Now -- something catching GIANCARLO'S EYE -- A SCAR ON THE 
               MAN'S HIP -- another fragment -- exacto knife cutting in -- 
               tweezers extracting A SMALL PLASTIC TUBE, not a bullet at 
               all, and as it comes free --

               THE MAN'S HAND SLAMS down onto GIANCARLO'S and we SMASH CUT 
               INTO A --

               FIRST PERSON POV -- we are staring up at --

                                     GIANCARLO
                         You're awake. Can you hear me?
                              (we're blinking --)
                         You've been shot. I'm trying to help 
                         you.
                              (we're trying to find 
                              our voice --)
                         You were in the water. You've been 
                         shot. It's okay now.

                                     THE MAN
                         Where am I?

                                     GIANCARLO
                              (switching to English)
                         You're American. I thought so. From 
                         your teeth -- the dental work --

                                     THE MAN
                         Where am I?

                                     GIANCARLO
                         You're on a boat. A fishing boat. 
                         Italian flag. We're out of Vietri.
                              (he smiles)
                         It's the cold that saved you. The 
                         water. The wounds are clean. I'm not 
                         a doctor, but the wounds, it looks 
                         okay. It's clean.

                                     THE MAN
                         How did I get here?

                                     GIANCARLO
                         You we're lost at sea. They pulled 
                         you out.
                              (we say nothing)
                         Who are you?
                              (still nothing)
                         You were shot -- two bullets -- in 
                         the back. You understand me?
                              (we try to nod)
                         Who are you?

               Long dead pause.

                                     THE MAN
                         I don't know.

               EXT. OCEAN -- DAY

               The Trawler plows through heavy seas.

               INT. FISHING BOAT BUNK ROOM -- DAY

               GIANCARLO is hunched over a desk -- tweezers and flashlight -- 
               busy working at that strange plastic tube that came out of 
               THE MAN's hip.

               THE MAN is bandaged. He's sitting up, and it must hurt like 
               hell, but physical pain is not the thing troubling him right 
               now. He's staring around the room -- at his body -- at the 
               walls -- haunted --

                                     THE MAN
                         What if it doesn't come back?

                                     GIANCARLO
                              (still working that 
                              tube)
                         I told you. You need to rest.

               Silence. THE MAN can't rest. Too busy trying to make sense 
               of all this.

                                     THE MAN
                         I can read. I can read that sign on 
                         the door. I can count. I can talk...
                              (focusing now --)
                         What are you doing?

               GIANCARLO rummaging around -- finding a magnifying glass --

                                     THE MAN
                         What is that?

               INSERT -- MAGNIFIED POV -- a slip of plastic from the tube -- 
               written there -- 000-7-17-12-0-14-26.  GEMEINSCHAFT BANK, 
               ZURICH.

                                     GIANCARLO
                         It came from your hip. Under the 
                         skin.
                              (turning back --)
                         You have a bank in Zurich.
                              (waiting)
                         You remember Zurich?

                                     THE MAN
                         No.

               GIANCARLO staring at him now. Different suddenly. Suspicious.

                                     GIANCARLO
                         Look, I'm just on this boat, okay? 
                         I'm an engineer. Whatever this is, 
                         it's not for me to be involved, okay?

                                     THE MAN
                         I don't remember Zurich.

               GIANCARLO pulls his pint. Takes a hit.

                                     GIANCARLO
                              (offering the bottle --)
                         You drink rum?

                                     THE MAN
                         I don't know.

               EXT. FISHING BOAT DECK -- NIGHT

               THE MAN stands at the rail, staring out to sea. So lost. He 
               turns to head inside -- there, a surfcasting rod propped 
               against a locker.

               THE MAN picks up the rod -- flips the bail -- traps the line -- 
               now he's casting far out into the darkness. And for the first 
               time, he smiles.

               INT. FISHING BOAT GALLEY -- NIGHT

               A ratty old espresso machine. THE MAN standing there, staring 
               at the thing like it's a test. Then his hands begin to move -- 
               trying to pack a grind -- trying to fit it in -- turning on 
               the steam and --

               The whole thing explodes.

               EXT. FISHING BOAT DECK -- DAY

               THE MAN alone doing chin-ups on the deck rail. He's still 
               bandaged and the wounds must hurt like hell, but he's pushing 
               himself. Using the pain -- bathing in it -- maybe even hoping 
               that it will hold some answer for him.

               INT. FISHING BOAT GALLEY -- NIGHT

               A chess board. Wooden pieces jumbled in a box. THE MAN 
               hesitates -- takes a black knight from the box -- lingers 
               for a moment -- and then places it on the board. He's off 
               and running. He knows this. Placing pieces faster and faster -- 
               still setting it up, as we --

               INT. FISHING BOAT HEAD -- NIGHT

               One of the ugliest bathrooms on the planet. THE MAN standing 
               before a pitted, tarnished, cataract of a mirror. Staring at 
               himself.

               And then he speaks.

                                     THE MAN
                              (in perfect French)
                         I don't know who I am. Do you know 
                         who I am? Do have any idea who I am?

               And then he stops. Blinks. Wipes away the perspiration just 
               beading on his forehead.

                                     THE MAN
                              (in perfect Dutch)
                         Tell me who I am. If you know who I 
                         am, please stop fucking around and 
                         tell me.

               No answer. Just that face. His face. Who am I?

               And what else is inside there?

               EXT. FISHING BOAT -- DAY

               SAILORS hauling in the nets. THE MAN -- still bandaged, but 
               healing -- working beside them. Earning his keep. Getting 
               healthy.

               EXT. ITALIAN COASTLINE -- DAWN

               A small, colorful fishing village. The trawler motoring in.

               INT. THE FISHING BOAT BUNK ROOM -- SAME TIME

               THE MAN buttoning up borrowed clothes. GIANCARLO pulling 
               some cash from his pocket --

                                     GIANCARLO
                              (offering the money)
                         It's not much, but it should get you 
                         to Switzerland.

                                     THE MAN
                         I won't forget this.

               GIANCARLO gives him a look. Shakes his head, and --

               INT. POKEY ITALIAN TRAIN STATION -- DAY

               The ticket window. THE MAN and a TICKET AGENT.

                                     TICKET AGENT
                         Una sola via?

                                     THE MAN
                         Si. One way. Una sola via.

               EXT. TGV -- DAY

               A HELICOPTER SHOT -- a bullet train speeds through snow- 
               capped Alps. We move in on a window -- and staring out is...

               INT. TGV TRAIN -- DAY

               ...THE MAN. People all around him -- families -- businessmen -- 
               normal people going about their lives. THE MAN turns back to 
               the window, but he's not watching the scenery -- he's looking 
               at his reflection. So lost. His face suddenly plunged into 
               darkness as the train bombs into a tunnel...

               EXT. TRAIN -- NIGHT

               ...and out of the darkness into night and the HELICOPTER 
               SHOT, as the train races toward ZURICH.

               INT. CIA HEADQUARTERS CONFERENCE ROOM -- DAY

               A VIDEO MONITOR -- FULL FRAME -- meet WOMBOSI. He's an African 
               ex-dictator, think Idi Amin crossed with Mobutu. He's in 
               some sort of throne room. And he's angry. Bodyguards and a 
               translator hovering nervously around him. What this is, is 
               NEWS FOOTAGE -- an interview conducted by a German TV station.

                                     WOMBOSI
                              (he speaks english)
                         ...no, no, no -- the time is not 
                         right, my enemies are too strong. 
                         I'm telling you to wait for this, 
                         you understand? I'm telling you this, 
                         and I'm making a warning to all those 
                         peoples out there that think that my 
                         powers have become so weak that they 
                         can play with me as they wish. You 
                         will see -- I will tell you when the 
                         evidence is clear. Then you will 
                         have a story. My old friends will 
                         hear about themselves.
                              (stopping, freezing 
                              on that image, and --)

               MARSHALL, a CIA bigwig has the remote control. And the floor.

                                     MARSHALL
                         That's Nykwana Wombosi speaking in 
                         Paris the day before yesterday. I'm 
                         sure most of you have a passing 
                         knowledge of Mr. Wombosi. Some of 
                         you on the African desks have worked 
                         with him over the years. Some of you 
                         very closely...

               TWELVE CIA MANDARINS sitting around the table like kids in 
               detention. We will tour the faces as MARSHALL continues, but 
               the guy we're interested in is named WARD ABBOTT. Picture a 
               sawier, slicker John Poindexter.

                         ...He was an irritation before he 
                         took power. He was a problem when he 
                         was in power. And he's been a disaster 
                         for us in exile.
                              (the tape --)
                         Wombosi likes to send us messages 
                         through the European media. This is 
                         an interview we pulled down from a 
                         local German television station in 
                         Dresden. We've been getting these 
                         little broadsides every couple of 
                         months. He knows this -- he knows 
                         that -- he's writing a book about 
                         the Agency's history in Africa -- 
                         he's going to name names. It's 
                         basically a shakedown...

               ABBOTT'S FACE says this is news to him. HIS HANDS suggest 
               otherwise.

                                     MARSHALL
                         This interview -- and I'll make the 
                         tape available for anyone who wants 
                         it -- he goes on to claim that he 
                         has just survived an assassination 
                         attempt. He says it's us. He says 
                         he's got proof.
                              (beat)
                         The overwhelming negative 
                         ramifications of this should be 
                         obvious.
                              (hard and dry)
                         The Director wants to know if there 
                         is any possible shred of truth in 
                         this accusation.

               Long pause. No hands go up.

               INT. ZURICH TRAIN STATION -- NIGHT

               THE MAN wandering through the terminal. Passing A PIZZA PLACE 
               closing up for the night.

               THE MAN checks his funds. Just enough for one cold slice.

               EXT. ZURICH STREETS -- NIGHT

               THE MAN walking aimlessly.

               EXT. ZURICH PARK -- NIGHT

               THE MAN trying to get comfortable on a bench. It's chilly 
               but this will have to do until morning.

               Just settling in, when --

                                     ZURICH COP #1 (O.S.)
                              (authority German)
                         Can't you read the signs?

               THE MAN turns. TWO ZURICH COPS coming toward him.

                                     ZURICH COP #2
                         On your feet. Let's go. Right now.

               THE MAN makes his feet. They're on top of him now.

                                     ZURICH COP #1
                         The park is closed. There's no 
                         sleeping in the park.

                                     ZURICH COP #2
                         Let's see some identification.

               THE MAN not sure what to do. Eyes moving. Mouth shut.

                                     ZURICH COP #1
                         Come on. Your papers. Let's go.

                                     THE MAN
                         I've lost them. I've...
                              (German now)
                         My papers. They are lost.

                                     ZURICH COP #1
                              (not sympathetic)
                         Okay. Let's go. Put your hands up.

                                     ZURICH COP #2
                              (pulling his nightstick)
                          -- come on -- hands up -- up --

               THE MAN raising his hand slowly -- ZURICH COP #1 reaching up 
               to pat him down --

                                     THE MAN
                         -- look, I'm just trying to sleep 
                         okay? --
                              (German again)
                          -- I just need to sleep --

               ZURICH COP #2 has heard enough -- giving a sharp poke with 
               the nightstick -- into THE MAN's back -- and that's the last 
               thing he'll remember because --

               THE MAN is in motion.

               A single turn -- spinning -- catching COP #2 completely off 
               guard -- the heel of his hand driving up into the guy's throat 
               and --

               COP #1 -- behind him -- trying to reach for his pistol, but 
               THE MAN -- still turning -- all his weight moving in a single 
               fluid attack -- a sweeping kick and --

               COP #1 -- he's falling -- catching the bench -- trying to 
               fight back but -- THE MAN -- like a machine -- just 
               unbelievably fast -- three jackhammer punches -- down-down- 
               down and -- COP #1 -- head slammed into the bench -- blood 
               spraying from his nose -- he's out cold and --

               COP #2 -- writhing on the ground -- gasping for air -- 
               struggling with his holster -- THE MAN -- his foot -- down -- 
               like a vise -- onto COP #2's arm -- shattering the bone -- 
               COP #2 starting to scream, and then silenced because --

               THE MAN -- he's got the pistol -- so fucking fast -- he's 
               got it right up against COP #2's forehead -- right on the 
               edge of pulling the trigger -- he is, he's gonna shoot him --

                                     ZURICH COP #2
                              (gasping, pleading)
                         -- no -- please God no -- please 
                         don't -- please no -- my Go

               -- stopping as --

               THE MAN slams the gun against his temple and --

               This fight is over.

               THE MAN standing there. In the silence. Two unconscious cops 
               at his feet. Blood on his pants. What just happened? How did 
               he do this? And there's THE GUN in his hand. And God, it 
               just feels so natural -- checking it -- stripping it down -- 
               holding it -- aiming it -- like this is something he's done 
               a million times before...

               This is something he definitely knows how to do.

               And then he stops cold. Throwing down the gun. Running off 
               into the darkness --

               INT. TREADSTONE -- DAY

               A deep, inner office. An ops office. Operations. Unlabeled 
               and anonymous. A backwater project center hidden deep within 
               the Langley facility. Utilitarian. Several rooms linked like 
               a suite.

               Small staff. SEVERAL TECHNICIANS. One or two for 
               communications. A couple for research. People are at their 
               posts. And it's all quiet. But they are busy. Quietly urgent. 
               This is a place under siege.

               ZORN is the number two here. Brilliant bloodless lapdog. 
               He's coming through the suite. Coming through quickly. Heading 
               toward the boss's little office at the back --

               TED CONKLIN. Ivy League Ollie North. Buttoned down. Square 
               jaw. Everything tucked away. But there's tension in the air. 
               Work on the desk. Cot in the corner.

                                     CONKLIN
                              (looking up)
                         What?

                                     ZORN
                         Abbott wants to talk.

                                     CONKLIN
                         Tell him we're busy.

                                     ZORN
                         I tried.

               INT. CIA COMMISSARY -- NIGHT

               ABBOTT with coffee. CONKLIN not lingering.

                                     ABBOTT
                         Storm clouds are gathering, Ted. It 
                         looks like rain and I don't have a 
                         thing to wear.

                                     CONKLIN
                         I don't know what we're talking about.

                                     ABBOTT
                         We're talking about Marseille. We're 
                         talking about Nykwana Wombosi. And 
                         I'm asking you if this abortion in 
                         Marseille has anything to do with 
                         Treadstone.
                              (silence)
                         Was this Treadstone?

                                     CONKLIN
                         You're asking me a direct question?

                                     ABBOTT
                         Yes.

                                     CONKLIN
                         I thought you were never going to do 
                         that.

               Silence. Pressure drop.

                                     ABBOTT
                         They're putting together an agency 
                         oversight committee. They're going 
                         to look through everyone's budgets. 
                         Treadstone is a rather sizable line 
                         item in my ledger.
                              (beat)
                         What am I going to do about that?

                                     CONKLIN
                         You'd want to make that go away. 
                         You'd want to remind them that 
                         Treadstone is a training organization. 
                         That it's all theoretical. You'd 
                         want to sign off on that.

                                     ABBOTT
                         And what if I couldn't do that?

                                     CONKLIN
                         Then I'd have to explain Treadstone. 
                         And you'd have to explain how you 
                         let me get this far.
                              (silence)
                         Doesn't sound like much of a Plan-B, 
                         does it?
                              (Abbott staring)
                         We'll clean up the field. You clean 
                         up your budgets.

               EXT. ZURICH -- DAY

               Morning in the financial district. Upscale. Uptight.

               GEMEINSCHAFT BANK just one of many elegant fortresses on 
               this street. Everything just now opening for business. TWO 
               GUARDS unlocking the front door and --

               THE MAN across the street. Tucked in the shadows. Checking 
               for cops and trouble. Looks clear. He's walking and --

               INT. BANK RECEPTION AREA -- DAY

               Ornate, formidable and tech at the same time.

                                     RECEPTIONIST
                         Can I help you?

               THE MAN standing before her. Looking very out of place.

                                     THE MAN
                         I'm here about a numbered account.

               THE RECEPTIONIST nods. Pulls a pen and bank card.

                                     RECEPTIONIST
                              (instant English)
                         If you'll just enter your account 
                         number here I'll direct you to the 
                         appropriate officer.

               THE MAN takes the pen, as we --

               INT. BANK SECURITY CHECKPOINT -- DAY

               A BIO-METRIC SCANNER. A piece of ultra-tech amidst the 
               Baroque. TWO SERIOUS BANK GUARDS manning the equipment.

               THE MAN standing there, staring down at this machine. 
               Something ominously decisive about this. What if it's him? 
               What if it's not?

                                     BANK GUARD #1
                         They've been waiting your hand, sir...

               THE MAN focuses. Here we go -- BANK GUARD #2 guiding his 
               open palm onto the mirrored scanning surface.

               THE MAN catching his reflection for a moment before a wave 
               of white light passes beneath his hand and now --

               INT. BANK HALLWAY -- DAY

               THE MAN being led by A THIRD GUARD to a special elevator.

               INT. DEEPER INSIDE THE BANK -- DAY

               Elevator doors open. THE MAN steps out. MR. APFEL -- anal 
               Zurich banker -- waiting there.

                                     APFEL
                         Good morning, sir. I assume you're 
                         here about your box.

                                     THE MAN
                         ...yes...
                              (what now?)
                         The box.

               APFEL nods. Gestures down the corridor --

               INT. BANK SAFETY DEPOSIT VIEWING ROOM -- DAY

               Sterile and kind of odd. But total privacy. THE MAN sitting 
               there, as A DEPOSIT GUARD places a large SAFETY DEPOSIT BOX 
               before him. THE GUARD leaves the room. Closing the door behind 
               him.

               THE MAN is alone. And there it is, right in front of him. 
               This is it. Here are the answers. He lifts the lid.

               THE BOX. There's a shallow tray on top. In this tray: a beat-
               up passport in the name of Jason Bourne. A French driver's 
               license with a Parisian address. Credit cards for Jason 
               Bourne.

               THE MAN. Holding these objects close -- as if by holding 
               them he might absorb their essence. Forcing himself to 
               believe. This is him. His picture. There it is. He's Jason 
               Bourne.

                                     BOURNE
                         My name is Jason Bourne.
                              (sounds good)
                         Hi, I'm Jason. Jason Bourne. Jason 
                         Bourne, nice to meet you.

               BACK TO -- THE BOX -- the shallow tray on top. There's 
               Kleenex. Several sets of contact lenses. A knife. A comb. 
               Three sticks of gum. A ring. A pair of sunglasses. A Rolex.

               BOURNE setting these things aside.  Lifting the top tray.  
               Staring into THE DEEP BOTTOM TRAY and --

               First of all...

               MONEY. Lots of it. Ten thousand dollar stacks of hundreds. 
               Lots of them. Close to a million dollars. There's A GUN. A 
               very good gun. Several clips of ammo. And...

               FIVE MORE PASSPORTS. All clean. Crisp. Brand new. All with 
               his photo inside. Five different names. Three different 
               Countries. Each one of these pristine passports clipped to a 
               piece of card stock that says:

               NAME: 
               NATIONALITY: 
               PLACE OF ISSUE: 
               SIGNATURE SAMPLE:

               And a bar code. 
               Two Dutch passports. A French. A South African. A Belgian.

               And...

               There's one piece of card stock still with the paper clip in 
               place. And no passport. This card reads:

               NAME: John Michael Kane 
               NATIONALITY: U.S.A. 
               PLACE OF ISSUE: Paris, France 
               There's a signature sample. 
               And a bar code. But no passport. This one is missing.

               BOURNE sitting there. Trying to push his confusion away.

                                     BOURNE
                         Bourne. My name is Jason Bourne. I 
                         live at 121, Rue de la Jardin, Paris.

               But there's something hollow about this. He came looking for 
               one identity and now he's faced with six. The money... The 
               gun...

               Suddenly, it's all fucked up.

               BOURNE into gear. Looking around the room -- there -- there's 
               a pile of red canvas burn bags in the corner. BOURNE grabbing 
               one -- stuffing everything into it -- everything except...

               The gun. He doesn't want the gun. No guns.

               INT. BANK SAFETY DEPOSIT OUTER AREA -- DAY

               BOURNE is done. Handing the box back to THE DEPOSIT GUARD --

                                     BOURNE
                         I'm trying to think how long it's 
                         been since I was here.

                                     DEPOSIT GUARD
                         I'm not sure. Must be three weeks.

               EXT. STREETS OF ZURICH -- DAY -- VARIOUS SHOTS

               BOURNE exits the bank. The red bag full to its limit. He's 
               walking briskly now. Looking for a taxi. Nothing in sight.

               BOURNE crossing the street. Shit, there's A COP on the corner -- 
               turn -- change pace -- make it look natural --

               BOURNE around a corner. And it's looking good for a moment -- 
               but only a moment -- TWO MORE COPS walking a beat -- walking 
               this way -- turn -- cut -- cross the street --

               BOURNE heading down a boulevard. Trying to look small. Pulse 
               starting to race. Fighting the paranoia. Where the hell is a 
               cab? Turning back fast as A SIREN starts bleeding in from 
               behind him --

               It's just an ambulance.

               BOURNE turning back. Forcing himself to focus. And fuck -- 
               there's A METER MAID, and she's stopped writing up a ticket -- 
               she's staring at him and --

               BOURNE trying not to panic -- don't run -- smile -- stay 
               small -- get to the corner -- scan the options -- but --

               THE METER MAID -- she's watching him go and she's pulling 
               her radio and --

               BOURNE hitting this next corner -- banging a right -- forcing 
               himself not to run -- glancing back and --

               THERE'S ANOTHER COP -- but this one is jogging -- searching -- 
               he's got his radio out and --

               FINALLY TO --

               BOURNE bailing on the street -- disappearing into --

               EXT. U.S. EMBASSY COMPOUND -- DAY

               Big gates. Speed barricades. SEVERAL U.S. MARINES standing 
               guard near a gate house. An American flag. Lots of people 
               coming and going. BOURNE playing it as normal as possible as 
               he heads for the entrance.

               INT. U.S. CONSULATE ZURICH -- VISA ROOM -- DAY

               The passport and visa office. Big room. No windows. Unpleasant 
               on purpose. Two lines: A short one for U.S.  Citizens, a 
               marathon for everyone else. CONSULATE CLERKS stationed in 
               open cubicles along the back wall. And it's a zoo. American 
               tourists who've lost their passports. Foreigners looking for 
               visas. Asylum seekers. Everyone here has a problem.

               BOURNE on the U.S. line. Standing there trying to think. 
               What's he gonna say? What can he say? With the cops outside, 
               and the incident in the park, then the bank...

                                     MARIE (O.S.)
                         -- no, this is not my current address. 
                         It was my current address two days 
                         ago when I started standing in line 
                         outside --

               A NEARBY CUBICLE. Meet MARIE KREUTZ. German. Big energy. 
               Real beauty hidden beneath the armor. And armor it is, because 
               this is a warrior in full, crisis battlemode.

                                     MARIE
                         -- and so now I lost my apartment, I 
                         have no address, and I have no visa, 
                         and you keep telling me how much 
                         help you cannot give me!

               A CONSULATE CLERK caught in her headlights.

                                     CLERK
                         Miss Kreutz, please... I'm gonna 
                         have to ask you to keep your voice 
                         down.

                                     MARIE
                         All the papers -- all the papers 
                         they asked for -- I brought all the 
                         papers --

                                     CLERK
                         Miss Kreutz, excuse me, but you 
                         entered into a fraudulent marriage 
                         in an effort to circumvent the 
                         immigration laws of the United States --

                                     MARIE
                         You only know that because I told 
                         you!
                              (she's incredulous)
                         Ask the case officer -- find his 
                         name -- it's on the papers -- I told 
                         him all this myself! --
                              (tearing through the 
                              papers now --)

                                     CLERK
                         -- it's not the source of the 
                         information that's important here --

                                     MARIE
                         -- I paid this fucking guy -- I paid 
                         him four thousand dollars -- my last 
                         four thousand dollars to marry me, 
                         okay? -- I told this to the case 
                         officer last week...
                              (she's found it --)
                         ...here -- Mr. Thomas. I told Mr.  
                         Thomas I didn't know this guy was 
                         already married -- I admitted this!

                                     CLERK
                         -- Miss Kreutz, please --

                                     MARIE
                         -- I'm the one that got ripped off! -- 
                         not you -- not the United States 
                         government -- me -- I'm the one being 
                         ripped off!

                                     CLERK
                         So now you're asking for a student 
                         visa?

               That shuts her up. Yes. Today she's a student.

               INT. CIA OFFICE COMPLEX -- NIGHT (BUT SAME TIME)

               Motion -- CONKLIN racing down a staircase -- ZORN chasing 
               after --

                                     CONKLIN
                         -- and they're sure it's him? --

                                     ZORN
                         -- he accessed the account --

                                     CONKLIN
                         -- but it was him --

                                     ZORN
                         -- yes, sir, it's confirmed --

               INT. U.S. CONSULATE -- VISA ROOM -- DAY

               BOURNE on line. Fear meter rising by the minute.

               BOURNE'S POV

               Scanning the room -- the perimeter -- the people -- A TURKISH 
               MAN almost in tears as he tries to explain his case to a 
               DESK CLERK -- TWO AMERICAN BACKPACKERS that have lost their 
               passports -- MARIE still in the midst of her madness -- A 
               SECURITY CAMERA high on the wall capturing everything -- 
               lots of data -- too much going on and --

                                     MAN ON LINE (O.S.)
                              (from behind him)
                         You're up.

               BOURNE comes to. Shit. It's his turn.

               A WOMAN CLERK waving him forward. BOURNE trying to think -- 
               what the fuck is he doing? -- what's he gonna say? -- now 
               he's at the window, and if he was looking for a friendly 
               face, he came to the wrong place --

                                     WOMAN CLERK
                              (cold shit)
                         You're a U.S. Citizen?

                                     BOURNE
                         Yes.
                              (pause)
                         I mean, I think so. Yes. Yes...

                                     WOMAN CLERK
                         Well, either you are, or you aren't.

                                     BOURNE
                         Right.

                                     WOMAN CLERK
                         You have your passport?

                                     BOURNE
                         I have a passport. I've got...
                              (the bag there, but...)
                         Actually, it's a little complicated.

                                     WOMAN CLERK
                         Do you have your passport, sir?

                                     BOURNE
                         Look, maybe I should just...

                                     WOMAN CLERK
                         Sir, you waited on line.

                                     BOURNE
                         Yeah, I know...

               But he's already bailing, walking away from the woman, the 
               window, the room -- he's out of here --

               INT. U.S. CONSULATE LOBBY -- DAY

               BOURNE on the move -- hustling back toward the lobby -- trying 
               to snag a view out to the street -- there's a window just 
               ahead and --

               BOURNE'S WINDOW POV -- ZURICH COPS -- outside -- on the street -- 
               half-a-dozen of them lingering around the entry gate and --

               BOURNE stalled for a moment -- options dwindling -- he can't 
               go back to the passport office -- he can't go out the front 
               and --

               The lobby looks tough -- there are two other points of entry 
               into the main building, but they're both guarded by MARINES 
               and METAL DETECTORS --

               As he gets closer -- it gets worse --

               A ZURICH POLICE INSPECTOR near the door, in deep conversation 
               with TWO MARINES and THE EMBASSY SECURITY OFFICER and --

               BOURNE trying to burrow through the human traffic -- trying 
               to get to THE LARGER OF THE TWO ENTRY GATES -- this one the 
               farthest from the front door and the passport office corridor, 
               and it's the most crowded -- A COUPLE PEOPLE lined up here -- 
               waiting for one of THE THREE MARINES STAFFING THIS POST to 
               check their bags and pass them through a metal detector and --

                                     SECURITY CHIEF (O.S.)
                         -- stop! -- stop right there! --

               BOURNE turns back -- as does everyone else in the lobby --

                                     SECURITY CHIEF
                              (from across the lobby)
                         -- YOU -- red bag -- the red bag -- 
                         stop right there! -- hands up! --

               BOURNE glancing back -- ONE OF THE GATE MARINES BEHIND HIM -- 
               the guy's raising his M-16 --

                                     GUN MARINE
                         -- you heard him -- let's move it! -- 
                         down -- let's go! --

               BOURNE nodding -- total compliance -- starting to drop -- 
               but only starting, because now --

               He's swinging the backpack and --

               THE GUN MARINE -- nailed -- blind-sided -- no chance and --

               BOURNE -- all motion -- all forward -- all perfect -- vaulting 
               the metal detector even as he pulls ONE OF THE PEOPLE ON 
               LINE around to shield his back and --

               ANOTHER GATE MARINE -- right there -- trying to grab him -- 
               making his move -- BOURNE -- almost an afterthought -- his 
               boot -- like a knife -- out of nowhere -- SNAP! -- the guy's 
               arm just shattered and --

               THE SECURITY CHIEF -- freaking out -- TWO MARINES WITH HIM -- 
               they're raising their weapons and there's people in the lobby 
               and --

                                     SECURITY CHIEF
                         -- no -- no -- hold your fire! --

               BOURNE -- landing hard on THE GUN MARINE -- rolling away 
               from the gate -- into the building now -- coming up with the 
               backpack and --

               coming up on the move -- swinging it around as he searches

               BOURNE still hanging there -- looking down -- up -- there's 
               no choice -- he has to go down --

               BOURNE finding a toehold below him -- reaching -- touching 
               down -- it gives way -- crumbling and --

               BOURNE hesitates. Does he know how to do this or not? Stalled 
               for a moment, then...

               BOURNE starts climbing down. And this is all one shot. No 
               cutaway. No cheating.

               We are watching a master at work...

               Handhold to a drain pipe. Swinging to a better ledge.

               Dropping to an air-conditioner. Grabbing a window frame just 
               before the air-conditioner gives way. Teetering there. Now 
               he's on the fourth floor.

               Below, there's an open window on the third floor. Struggling 
               to keep his balance, he reaches behind him to shift the weight 
               of the bag, and as he does --

               THE RED BAG falls. Thump. Into the courtyard. Forget the 
               open window. Now he's got to go all the way.

               Timing his next move and --

               He's pushing off -- reaching -- there's another drainpipe 
               and he's snagged it -- he's got a dragline now -- starting 
               to fall -- straining to hold the pipe -- slowing his descent -- 
               the drainpipe pulling away from it's housing and --

               BOURNE letting go -- just before he falls backward -- one 
               last grab -- catching a gutter -- holding it just long enough 
               to slow his fall and --

               A LITTLE RED CAR. A beat-to-shit Euro car. A shitty little

               parking ticket on the windshield.

               MARIE grabbing the ticket -- tearing it up -- tearing the 
               shit out of it -- blind with misfortune -- throwing the pieces

                         Get the fuck away from my car.

                                     BOURNE
                         I'll give you ten thousand dollars 
                         to drive me to Paris.

                         fuck away from me before I start 
                         screaming my head off.

                         You don't want the police any more 
                         than I do.

               BOURNE tosses cash -- a stack of hundreds -- across the car 
               into her hands -- she catches it. Looks at it.

                         What?

                                     ZORN
                         Zurich police are looking for an 
                         American with a red bag. Apparently 
                         he put two cops in the hospital last 
                         night.

               Silence. Like the floor just fell away. So heavy.

                                     CONKLIN
                         What the fuck is he doing?

                                     ZORN
                         Maybe it's a game. Maybe he's trying 
                         to send us a message.

                                     CONKLIN
                         It doesn't matter now. We've just 
                         got to be the first ones there.
                              (decision time)
                         Get everybody up. I want them all 
                         activated.

                                     ZORN
                         All of them?

               A moment between them. CONKLIN all steel here now.

                                     CONKLIN
                         You heard me.

                         cold...

               Meet THE PROFESSOR. He's a piano teacher. Late fifties. 
               Deceptively fit. He's sitting here, listening to a NINE- 
               YEAR-OLD STUDENT struggle through the music.

               Meet CASTEL. He's thirty-five. Slender. Clean-cut. Easy to

               The little red car parked. MARIE pacing around. BOURNE poring 
               over a map spread out over the hood.

                                     MARIE
                         So what's in Paris?

                                     BOURNE
                         I want to go home.

                                     MARIE
                         For twenty thousand dollars.

               BOURNE looks back from the map.

                                     BOURNE
                         I said ten thousand.

                                     MARIE
                         You have blood on your pants.

                                     BOURNE
                         Okay.
                              (beat)
                         Twenty thousand. Ten now. Ten there.

                                     MARIE
                         No. No, that was too easy --
                              (pacing away --)

                                     BOURNE
                         Wait up --
                              (after her now --)
                         -- just wait up --

                                     MARIE
                         -- get the fuck out of here -- all 
                         this money, this crazy offer, I mean 
                         give me a fucking break with this, 
                         this is --
                              (stopping because--)

               BOURNE just grabbed her. Both of them shocked that he's done 
               this. He immediately pulls back.

                                     BOURNE
                         Look, I want a ride to Paris.
                              (wide open now)
                         That's all I want. I swear.

                                     MARIE
                         You swear?
                              (cold here)
                         That's great. I feel so much better 
                         now.

                                     BOURNE
                         I don't want anything but a ride. 
                         All I want to do is go home.

               Silence now. She looks back. Measuring him.

                                     MARIE
                         You could buy a car for twenty grand. 
                         You could buy this car.

                                     BOURNE
                         I don't want to go alone. I want you 
                         to drive me to Paris. Like we're a 
                         couple. Like we're a couple and we're 
                         travelling together. That's all we're 
                         doing.

                                     MARIE
                         And I don't get hurt. I get twenty 
                         thousand dollars and I don't get 
                         hurt.

                                     BOURNE
                         I won't hurt you.

                                     MARIE
                         What if I say no?

                                     BOURNE
                         Then I'll find another ride.

               EXT. ROME STREET -- DAY

               CASTEL through the streets on a motorcycle. Whipping to a

               CASTEL and THE ELEVATOR OPERATOR -- rising slowly through 
               the dark warehouse and --

               INT. CASTEL'S STORAGE UNIT -- DAY

               Darkness -- a key turning -- door opening -- light goes on 
               to reveal CASTEL standing there and we're in --

               CASTEL'S STORAGE UNIT. What's in here? Like nothing. Like a 
               stack of old newspapers in the corner. Some mildewed books 
               piled along one wall. Some shitty plastic chairs.

               QUICK TIME CUTS

               CASTEL working fast. Closing the door. Moving to the pile of 
               books. Taking the top book off. Opening it.

               INSIDE THE BOX -- a timer. A small bomb. A booby-trap. An 
               LED light stops flashing as CASTEL'S HANDS code in his 
               password and --

               CASTEL moving to the newspapers stacked in the corner.  
               Pulling away the top pile and --

               A METAL LOCK BOX. Hidden here. CASTLE pulling it out. Opening 
               it. An empty tray on top and --

               CASTEL taking off his watch. Taking off his rings. Taking 
               out his wallet. His Spanish passport. Emptying his pockets. 
               All of this goes into the empty tray and --

               CASTEL lifting away this top tray -- setting it aside and --

               THE METAL LOCK BOX -- there's more -- a much larger bottom 
               compartment -- and it's deja-vu all over again -- we're 
               looking at the identical contents we saw Bourne find in the 
               Zurich safe-deposit box.

               First of all...

               MONEY. Lots of it. Ten thousand dollar stacks of hundreds. 
               Lots of them. A GUN. A very good gun. A dozen clips of ammo. 
               And FIVE MORE PASSPORTS. All clean. Brand new. All with his 
               photo. Five different names. Four different countries. Each 
               one of these pristine clipped to a piece of card stock that 
               says:

               NAME: 
               NATIONALITY: 
               PLACE OF ISSUE: 
               SIGNATURE SAMPLE: 
               A BAR CODE: 
               Two Italian. Two Spanish. A Portuguese.

               CASTEL going for the Portuguese passport and --

               The little red car driving through The Alps.

               INT. THE RED CAR -- DUSK

               BOURNE staring out the window. MARIE driving. Long silence 
               until --

                                     MARIE
                         Just so you know, if you're gonna 
                         burn me on the money, you might as 
                         well kill me.
                              (Bourne looks over)
                         I was supposed to have this car back 
                         three days ago. It's not my car.

                                     BOURNE
                         I know that.

               MARIE staring at him -- glancing back to the road -- just in 
               time -- almost rear-ending a slow moving truck --

                                     MARIE
                         Shit --
                              (trying to settle)
                         Can I tell you how much you're 
                         freaking me out? Okay? Because you 
                         are -- you're completely freaking me 
                         out.

                                     BOURNE
                         I'm sorry. Really. What do you want 
                         me to do?

                                     MARIE
                         I don't know. Smile. Sneeze. 
                         Something. You've got a bag full of 
                         money and a ride to Paris. Fuck it, 
                         I don't know...
                              (the radio)
                         What kind of music do you like?

                                     BOURNE
                         I don't know.

                                     MARIE
                         What does that mean?

                                     BOURNE
                         Listen to what you want.

                                     MARIE
                              (out of nowhere)
                         Who pays twenty thousand dollars for 
                         a ride to Paris?

               There it is. And she wants an answer --

                                     BOURNE
                         I don't know. I don't know who I am.

                                     MARIE
                         Yeah, well, welcome to the club.

                                     BOURNE
                         No. No, I mean, I really don't know 
                         who I am. I can't remember anything 
                         earlier than two weeks ago.
                              (it's not flying)
                         I'm serious.

                                     MARIE
                         What? Like amnesia?

                                     BOURNE
                         Look, go ahead... put the radio on...

                                     MARIE
                         Amnesia?
                              (total incredulity)
                         You're saying you don't remember 
                         anything that happened before two 
                         weeks ago?

                                     BOURNE
                         That's what I'm saying.

                                     MARIE
                              (German)
                         Give me a fucking break.

               BOURNE staring at her. She's furious. She's downshifting -- 
               she's accelerating -- pulling out to pass the truck on a 
               blind turn, as we --

               APFEL emerges from the bank. Leaving work. Turns the corner 
               into a quiet side street and --

               Up ahead, here comes another guy in a suit. It's MANHEIM 
               walking toward us, deep into a cell phone conversation. Barely 
               noticing Apfel as they get closer and --

               As they pass -- MANHEIM -- it's completely out of the blue -- 
               he's jabbing the cellphone down into Apfel's shoulder and --

               APFEL -- no clue -- already clutching at the coronary 
               exploding in his chest -- dead before his body hits the street 
               and --

               MANHEIM -- still walking -- he's never broken stride -- and 
               as he goes he's fiddling with the cellphone and --

               INSERT -- THE CELLPHONE -- MANHEIM'S HANDS working to retract 
               a syringe into the device and --

               MANHEIM striding away. Disappearing into Zurich...

               INT. PARIS MORGUE -- NIGHT

               Not the best morgue in town. Cold tile. A wall of freezers. 
               Death lighting. Now add some color. Meet NYKWANA WOMBOSI in 
               the flesh.

               Meet HIS ENTOURAGE -- eight or ten of his thirty children -- 
               two of his wives -- three of his bodyguards -- the whole 
               crew spread out in this horrible basement room. THE WIVES 
               are chatting. THE KIDS are playing, fighting and eating candy.

               THE BODYGUARDS -- three of them here -- are white. These 
               guys are French/Corsican mercs. Not quite the A-Team. The 
               guy in charge of this ugly little unit is named DEAUVAGE. 
               Into it. Too into it.

               TWO MORGUE ATTENDANTS hanging back. THE MORGUE BOSS -- who's 
               clearly suffering this for a bribe -- moves to one of the 
               freezer lockers...

                                     MORGUE BOSS
                              (French)
                         Okay, Monsieur Kane... number 121...

               And he pulls open FREEZER #121. And thank God we can't see 
               it, because whatever's inside there is clearly horrible. THE 
               MORGUE BOSS barely takes a glance, standing back as quickly 
               as possible.

               DEAUVAGE -- lead bodyguard -- moves to clear a zone for his 
               boss --

                                     WOMBOSI
                         Get the fuck out of my way --
                              (pushing Deauvage 
                              aside --)

               WOMBOSI moves to the freezer box. Stares down. As if it were 
               nothing. He's seen -- he's made -- much, much worse. And now 
               he reaches down into the box -- hands on -- literally feeling 
               around this dead, awful corpse with his bare hands -- feeling 
               around for something -- feeling and feeling and not finding --

                                     WOMBOSI
                              (turning to Deauvage --)
                         It's not him.

               DEAUVAGE looking pale as WOMBOSI slams shut the freezer.

                                     WOMBOSI
                              (quiet hard fury)
                         So who's crazy now?

               EXT. PARIS STREET -- NIGHT

               A MINI-MOTORCADE driving towards Neuilly. Two security cars. 
               A van full of kids and mothers. And one big Mercedes stretch.

               INT. THE MERCEDES STRETCH LIMO -- NIGHT

               WOMBOSI alone in the back. Looking haunted.

               INT. TRUCKSTOP CAFE -- NIGHT

               It's a weird spot. Open all night. But Euro-style. Quiet 
               tonight. A few Alpen-truckers chowing down. A local or two 
               at the bar and --

               BOURNE AND MARIE at a back table. Drinking coffee. He's got 
               the red bag open. All the passports -- the personal junk -- 
               the money -- all the shit from the Zurich bank box -- he's 
               been showing it to her --

               And he's got her attention now.

                                     MARIE
                         And you have no idea -- not a clue -- 
                         what came before that?

                                     BOURNE
                         No.

                                     MARIE
                         When you think of it, before the 
                         ship -- before you wake up on the 
                         ship, what do you see?

                                     BOURNE
                         Nothing. It's just not there.

                                     MARIE
                         Well, this is great.
                              (she sits back)
                         I'm sick of myself and you have no 
                         idea who you are.

                                     BOURNE
                         I kept trying things, I thought if I 
                         could find all the things I could 
                         do, I could --

                                     MARIE
                         -- you could put it together --

                                     BOURNE
                         -- which was okay for a while, I was 
                         okay with it...
                              (hesitating now)
                         But then -- there's all these other 
                         things -- all these other things I 
                         know how to do -- and this -- this 
                         stuff from the bank and...
                              (suddenly flat out --)
                         I think something bad happened.

                                     MARIE
                         What are you talking about?

                                     BOURNE
                         I don't know.

                                     MARIE
                         Sounds like you were in an accident 
                         or something.

                                     BOURNE
                         I was shot twice in the back.

                                     MARIE
                         Okay, so you're a victim.

                                     BOURNE
                         There was a gun. Who has a safe 
                         deposit box with a gun and all this 
                         money and all these passports?

                                     MARIE
                         Lots of people have guns. You're 
                         American. Americans love guns.

                                     BOURNE
                         I fought my way out of an embassy.  
                         I climbed down a fifty-foot wall -- 
                         I went out the window and I was doing 
                         it -- I just did it. I knew how to 
                         do it.

                                     MARIE
                         People do amazing things when they're 
                         scared.

                                     BOURNE
                         Why do I? -- I come in here -- 
                         instinctively -- first thing I do -- 
                         I'm looking for the exit -- I'm 
                         catching the sightlines -- I know I 
                         can't sit with my back to the door --

                                     MARIE
                         You're paranoid. You were shot. It's 
                         natural.

               She's not listening. He leans in. Flat out now.

                                     BOURNE
                         I can tell you the license plate 
                         numbers of all three cars out front. 
                         I can tell you that the waitress is 
                         left-handed and the guy at the counter 
                         weighs two-hundred and fifteen pounds 
                         and knows how to handle himself. I 
                         know that the best, first place to 
                         look for a gun is the cab of that 
                         grey truck outside. I know that at 
                         this altitude I can run flat out for 
                         half a mile before I lose my edge. I 
                         knew that you were my first, best 
                         option out of Zurich? How do I know 
                         all that? How can I know all that 
                         and not know who I am? How is that 
                         possible?

               Long dead pause.

                                     MARIE
                         God, you're not kidding, are you?

               INT. TREADSTONE RESEARCH DESK -- DAY

               BOURNE'S FACE -- a video image frozen on A COMPUTER SCREEN -- 
               it's Bourne looking at the camera -- Bourne looking up at 
               the camera in the consulate passport office and --

               PULL BACK TO REVEAL

               HALF A DOZEN COMPUTER MONITORS -- and lots of shots of Bourne -- 
               twenty angles -- twenty different locations -- twenty candid 
               perspectives of Bourne and his mad scramble through the 
               consulate --

               CONKLIN and RESEARCH TECH #1 poring over these surveillance 
               tapes downloaded from Zurich --

                                     CONKLIN
                         And that's the best angle of the 
                         courtyard?

                                     RESEARCH TECH #1
                         That's the only angle.

                                     CONKLIN
                         What do they have on the streets? 
                         The area. They must have something.

                                     RESEARCH TECH #1
                         Hang on...
                              (typing away --)

               CONKLIN rubbing at the tension in his temples as ZORN enters --

                                     CONKLIN
                         What?

                                     ZORN
                         Abbott. He knows about the embassy. 
                         He's coming down for a show and tell.

                                     CONKLIN
                         That'll solve all our problems.

                         Sir...

                                     CONKLIN
                              (turning back --)
                         What's that?

                                     RESEARCH TECH #1
                         It's an angle of the street -- some 
                         sort of alleyway -- you can just...

                                     CONKLIN
                         Enhance it.

               INSERT -- THE MONITOR -- as the image enlarges to fill the 
               screen. And there's Bourne. And the little red car. And Marie.

               EXT. ZURICH AIRPORT HOTEL -- NIGHT

               A drone barn. Practically on the runway.

               INT. ZURICH AIRPORT HOTEL ROOM -- NIGHT

               One of those rooms. Just a plain functional box. MANHEIM 
               laying on the bed. Fully dressed. Suit and tie. Just laying 
               there, staring at the ceiling. Who knows how long he's been 
               like this.

               Just waiting.

               ON THE NIGHTSTAND -- A gun. A knife. His e-phone pager. His 
               fresh credentials. And a photo of Jason Bourne.

               INT. WOMBOSI'S PARIS COMPOUND -- NIGHT

               Quick orientation: Picture a heavily-walled palace just off 
               the Bois Du Boulogne. But once inside you could be back in 
               Brazzaville. It's just a buffet of oddness. Home to fifty 
               children and nine wives. The decor blends money and nouveau 
               riche materialism with a hard, back-home tribal esthetic. 
               It's a visual treat. Not condescending or stupid, but flat-
               out strange and menacing.

               It's late. And the palace is dark and sleepy now, but carry 
               all that through this next series of quick shots --

               WOMBOSI HOUSE SECURITY STATION

               Just inside the door. BODYGUARD #1 slouched before a bank of 
               SECURITY MONITORS.

               WOMBOSI MAIN HALLWAY

               Littered with toys. Children's crap everywhere. BODYGUARD 
               #3. Snoozing on a Louis Quatorze chair draped with African 
               cloth.

               WOMBOSI THRONE ROOM DOORS

               DEAUVAGE -- head bodyguard -- posted outside this imposing 
               set of doors. He's trying to stay awake. Reading a spy 
               thriller.

               FINALLY TO

               WOMBOSI'S THRONE ROOM

               And there he is -- the emperor himself -- WOMBOSI on his 
               throne. Except the room is dark and empty. And he's sitting 
               there by himself. A king without a country.

               Sitting there. With a gun in his lap. Drinking hard from a 
               bottle of Jack Daniels.

               Stewing.

               EXT. FRENCH ROADSIDE -- DAWN

               Beautiful morning. The red car parked along the road. BOURNE 
               alone in the passenger seat. Deep asleep. Nestled there.

               And then, he wakes suddenly. Starts. Freaked for a moment. 
               Instantly feeling for the red bag. There it is in his lap. 
               He looks around and --

               MARIE sitting away from the car. She's got a loaf of bread. 
               A soda. Smoking a butt. Same clothes, but her make-up's been 
               washed away. Clean. Simple. Gorgeous.

               BOURNE steps out. Morning legs.

                                     MARIE
                         I needed a break.

                                     BOURNE
                         Where are we?

                                     MARIE
                         We're about an hour away.

                                     BOURNE
                         I can't believe I slept.

                                     MARIE
                         You were tired. Here...
                              (bread and soda --)
                         For twenty-thousand I like to throw 
                         in breakfast.
                              (he takes it)
                         So what do you dream about?

                                     BOURNE
                         I dream I'm asleep. I dream that I'm 
                         asleep and I can't wake up.
                              (he takes a hit from 
                              her smoke and coughs --)
                         I don't think I smoke.

               Another silence. She's watching him.

                                     MARIE
                         You ever think maybe you have a 
                         family?

                                     BOURNE
                         I thought about it. I don't know.

               She looks away. Was she hoping for another answer?

                                     MARIE
                         I guess it's like Christmas every 
                         day for you, huh?

               INT. TREADSTONE CONKLIN'S OFFICE -- DAY

               MARIE'S FACE -- A PASSPORT PHOTO -- she's eighteen -- she's 
               smiling -- really alive and fresh and --

               CONKLIN behind his desk. ABBOTT staring grimly at the picture --

                                     ABBOTT
                         Who is she?

                                     ZORN
                         Marie Helene Kreutz. She's twenty- 
                         six. Born outside Munich. Father was 
                         a welder. He died in '91. We don't 
                         have the mother. There might be a 
                         step-sister, we're trying to track 
                         that down.
                              (apologetic)
                         It's tough. She's a wanderer. She 
                         pops up on the grid here and there 
                         but... I mean, the last time she 
                         paid an electric bill in Europe was 
                         '94. No taxes. No steady employer. 
                         She's got three arrests. Two 
                         shoplifting cases, one in Spain, one 
                         in Germany. And she actually did 
                         three months in an Italian detention 
                         center for credit card fraud.

                                     ABBOTT
                         No political affiliations?

                                     CONKLIN
                         She's a gypsy. If it's a cover, it's 
                         a great one.

                                     ABBOTT
                         I'm assuming we're exploring that 
                         possibility.

                                     CONKLIN
                         We're exploring every possibility.
                              (tighter by the moment)
                         We are in pursuit. How much more do 
                         you want me to tell you?

                                     ABBOTT
                         Pursuit would indicate that you know 
                         exactly where he is.

                                     CONKLIN
                         No. Pursuit ends when we know exactly 
                         where he is.

                                     ABBOTT
                         Yes, well, I think we need some fresh 
                         eyes on this problem. I'm bringing 
                         in some people from upstairs.

               CONKLIN hesitates. Inside he's screaming.

                                     CONKLIN
                         We've been down here for two weeks 
                         banging our heads against the wall. 
                         We've been sleeping down here. We 
                         just got our first lead fourteen 
                         hours ago, and now? -- now that we 
                         finally have something to work with -- 
                         you want to bring planning personnel 
                         down here?
                              (real steam)
                         I'd rethink that.

                                     ABBOTT
                         I want a second opinion.

                                     CONKLIN
                         This is an operations desk.

                                     ABBOTT
                         I'm not asking.

               EXT. PARIS STREET NEAR BOURNE'S APARTMENT -- DAY

               THE LITTLE RED CAR cruising through town.

               INT. THE LITTLE RED CAR -- DAY

               MARIE driving. BOURNE checking building numbers as they pass --

                                     BOURNE
                         Slow down. No, don't stop. Just...

                                     MARIE
                              (looking over)
                         That's it? Is that it?

               AN APARTMENT BUILDING. Big building. Elegant but cold.

                                     BOURNE
                         Four-fifty. That's the address...

                                     MARIE
                         Looks familiar?

                                     BOURNE
                         No.
                              (staring back as they 
                              pass --)
                         No. Go around. Keep going...

               MARIE pulling up -- turning a corner -- watching him as she 
               does. But he's pre-occupied -- eyes scanning -- taking it 
               all in --

                                     MARIE
                         Where?

                                     BOURNE
                         Yeah. Pull in here. Park it.

               MARIE angles into an alleyway. Cuts the engine.

                                     MARIE
                         So this is it, right?

                                     BOURNE
                         I guess.

               Dead pause. She's waiting. He's still scanning the street.

                                     MARIE
                         I should go.

                                     BOURNE
                         I don't remember any of this.

                                     MARIE
                         Jason...

               He turns back. She's staring at him.

                                     BOURNE
                         Sorry. The money, right?

               Before she can say anything, he's digging in the backpack. 
               He pulls out another stack of hundreds. Hands it over. She 
               takes it. It's not what she wanted, but she's used to being 
               disappointed. Fighting it.

                                     MARIE
                         Okay, so...

                                     BOURNE
                         Thanks for the ride.

                                     MARIE
                         Anytime.

               Silence. That moment. He focuses. Getting it.

                                     BOURNE
                         Look, I don't know what's up there.

                                     MARIE
                         You got me pretty fucking curious.

                                     BOURNE
                         Look, you could come up. Or you could 
                         wait if you want. I could go check 
                         it out. You could wait.

                                     MARIE
                         Nah...
                              (hide the pain)
                         With you, I mean, you'd probably 
                         just forget about me, right?

                                     BOURNE
                         How could I forget about you?
                              (he smiles)
                         You're the only person I know.

               MARIE smiles. We've never seen it before. Worth waiting for.

               INT. PARIS APARTMENT BUILDING FOYER -- NIGHT

               BOURNE and MARIE standing at the directory. Five apartments. 
               One per floor. Five names. A buzzer. An intercom. There it 
               is.

               J. Bourne.

               BOURNE presses the buzzer. After a moment, he presses again. 
               Nothing.

                                     MARIE
                         I guess you're not home.

               BOURNE checking the door. How to pop it open? Just about to 
               get into it, when --

                                     CONCIERGE (O.S.)
                              (from the shadows 
                              inside --)
                         Monsieur Bourne...I'm coming...

               THE CONCIERGE is sixty. Plump and proper.

                                     CONCIERGE
                              (opening the door --)
                         Mr. Bourne, there you are -- I was 
                         wondering -- I haven't seen you --

                                     BOURNE
                         Here I am.

               THE CONCIERGE looking at BOURNE like maybe she's never seen 
               him look like this before. And she's looking at MARIE like 
               here's the reason her tenant looks like such shit.

                                     BOURNE
                              (he tries a smile)
                          I seem to have lost my key.

               THE CONCIERGE nods. Instant chilly disapproval.

                                     CONCIERGE
                         I've been ringing your bell. It's 
                         good you were away. We had some 
                         trouble with the hot water. It's 
                         been repaired.

                                     BOURNE
                         Great. We could use a shower.
                              (they look like shit --)
                         It was a long drive.

               THE CONCIERGE steps aside and --

               INT. PARIS APARTMENT FIFTH FLOOR LANDING -- DAY

               BOURNE and MARIE at the apartment threshold. He has a key 
               now.

               Turning it. And the door opens...

               Nothing...

               No bombs. No wife and kids. No one.

               INT. PARIS APARTMENT -- DAY

               A huge, rambling flat. Large entry hallway. Large rooms beyond 
               that. It's obviously expensive. But cold. Completely 
               impersonal. No photographs. No mementoes. No human history.

               WE'RE MOVING NOW

               THE LIVING ROOM

               BOURNE and MARIE exploring.

                                     MARIE
                         It's big.

               BOURNE silent. Struggling to get a feel for the place.

                                     MARIE
                         This is like a real apartment.
                              (she likes it)
                         This is really yours?

                                     BOURNE
                         I guess so.

               MARIE taking it in fast. BOURNE seems paralyzed. Trying to 
               soak it all in. Willing himself home. Touching things as he 
               passes. As if a texture, a smell -- something will become 
               familiar. He's deep into this as we go to --

               THE BEDROOM

               MARIE in the doorway. Checking it out. It's so clean and 
               simple. But it's not the decor she's most interested in...

               MARIE opening an armoire...

               Nothing but men's clothes. No competition. She's feeling 
               better by the moment as we go to --

               THE KITCHEN

               Like a stage set. Lots of props and no sign of food. BOURNE 
               picking up a frying pan.

                                     BOURNE
                         This is my frying pan.
                              (and then --)
                         This is my spoon.
                              (trying harder)
                         I'm Jason Bourne and this is my 
                         kitchen.

               THE MASTER BATHROOM

               MARIE still on the prowl. Mirror city. Big tub. One 
               toothbrush.

               AN OFFICE STUDY

               There's a desk. Chair. Phone. Basic. BOURNE with a folder in 
               his hand. Staring at the bookshelves. Binders, reference 
               materials and hardbound volumes -- all of it about maritime 
               law. Ship schedules. Registry catalogs. All about boats.

                                     MARIE
                         This is your office?
                              (from the doorway)
                         God, you live like a monk...

                                     BOURNE
                         All this stuff -- it's all about 
                         boats.
                              (looking up)
                         I think I'm in the shipping business.

                                     MARIE
                         See. It's starting to come back, 
                         yeah?
                              (he sort of nods)
                         You mind if I take a bath?

                                     BOURNE
                         Go ahead.

               MARIE backs out. BOURNE alone again. Standing there for a 
               moment. Dealing with it.

               And then he sits down in a chair.

               BOURNE sitting there. Staring. The room, the desk -- it's 
               all so devoid of personality. And then, something catches 
               his eye and --

               INSERT -- THE DESK TOP -- a faint silhouette through the 
               dust and grime. Outlines of where a computer used to sit.

               BOURNE reaching suddenly under the desk. Bingo. Pulling out 
               a retractable computer keyboard tray. But it's empty. No 
               keyboard. Now he's really confused and --

               INSERT -- A PHONE/ANSWERING MACHINE -- BOURNE pressing the 
               playback button and --

                                     PHONE MACHINE
                         "You have no messages."

               BOURNE leaving that for a moment -- about to anyway -- and 
               then he turns back -- new idea -- pressing for the speaker 
               phone -- and then hitting redial and --

               THE PHONE stars dialing...

               RINGING and...

                                     OPERATOR/PHONE
                         Bonjour, Hotel Marboeuf...

               BOURNE quick grabbing the receiver. Taking it off speakerphone 
               and --

                                     BOURNE
                         ...yes -- oui -- uh...

                                     OPERATOR/PHONE
                         Yes, sir. Hotel Marboeuf, Paris.  
                         How can I direct your call?

                                     BOURNE
                         Paris?

                                     OPERATOR/PHONE
                         Yes, sir...
                              (switching to English, 
                              thinking that's his 
                              problem --)
                         How can I help you?

                                     BOURNE
                         Yes, I'm...I'm looking for Mr. Jason 
                         Bourne.

                                     OPERATOR/PHONE
                         One moment, please...
                              (a long pause, and 
                              then --)
                         I'm afraid, I have no one by that 
                         name registered, sir.

                                     BOURNE
                         D'accord... Merci.
                              (about to hang up--)
                         Un moment -- un moment --

                                     OPERATOR/PHONE
                         -- sir? --

                                     BOURNE
                         -- hang on -- I need you to check 
                         another name for me -- hang on -- un 
                         moment, s'il vous plait --

               BOURNE grabbing the backpack -- tearing through it -- where 
               is it? -- where is it? -- shit and money falling out and --

               There it is -- from the safe-deposit box -- that piece of 
               card stock -- the one with no passport attached to it --

                                     BOURNE
                              (reading it)
                         Kane. Do you have Mr. John Michael 
                         Kane?

                                     OPERATOR/PHONE
                         One moment, sir.

               BOURNE waiting. And then there's muzak -- holding music and --

               THE MASTER BATHROOM

               Water running in the tub. MARIE pulling off her boots. 
               Checking the temperature.

               THE OFFICE STUDY

               Bourne still on hold. And then --

                                     MANAGER/PHONE
                              (a new voice suddenly)
                         Bonjour? Monsieur? Allo...

                                     BOURNE
                         Yes, I'm here...

                                     MANAGER/PHONE
                         You call about Monsieur Kane? John 
                         Michael Kane?

                                     BOURNE
                         Yes. Is he there?

                                     MANAGER/PHONE
                         You are a friend of his?

                                     BOURNE
                         Yes.

                                     MANAGER/PHONE
                         I have some very bad news for you, 
                         sir. I'm terrible sorry to have to 
                         tell you this, but Monsieur Kane has 
                         passed away almost two weeks ago...

               Silence. BOURNE is rocked. But the Manager, it's natural, he 
               interprets the silence as grief...

                                     MANAGER/PHONE
                         There was an accident. On the 
                         motorway. Apparently, he was killed 
                         instantly. Really, I'm terrible sorry 
                         to be the one to tell you this...

                                     BOURNE
                         ...I understand...

                                     MANAGER/PHONE
                         ...we actually, we were unaware for 
                         several days that this had happened. 
                         When they came for his things, it 
                         was made known for us, you see?

                                     BOURNE
                         Who? Who came?

                                     MANAGER/PHONE
                         His brother. You know his brother?

                                     BOURNE
                         Right. Yes. Of course.

                                     MANAGER/PHONE
                         It's very bad this. Terrible sad. 
                         Such a young man.

                                     BOURNE
                         Do you -- his brother -- do you have 
                         a phone number?

                                     MANAGER/PHONE
                         I think not...
                              (quick French to 
                              someone in the office 
                              there --)
                         No, I'm sorry. It was very sudden. 
                         He was here very briefly.

               BOURNE just hands up the phone. Just like that. Not even 
               goodbye. Standing there frozen. Stunned. John Michael Kane 
               is dead. And he had the passport.

               Suddenly, everything's changed. They shouldn't be here. This 
               is bad. Danger.

               THE MASTER BATHROOM

               MARIE playing with her hair in the mirror. Checking the water --

                                     MARIE
                              (calling out to him --)
                         She wasn't kidding about the water. 
                         It's freezing.

               THE OFFICE

               BOURNE frozen there. On alert. He forces a smile. Decoy mood.

                                     BOURNE
                         Hang on. I'll check the kitchen...
                              (moving out of the 
                              office --)
                         Maybe it takes a while to get all 
                         the way upstairs.

               THE KITCHEN

               BOURNE moving to the sink. He's smiling. Upbeat. But it's an 
               act. His eyes are everywhere. Turning on the water. But 
               ignoring it. What he's really doing is searching out a weapon. 
               Pulling A KNIFE very quietly from behind the stove. Holding 
               it. Feels pretty comfortable. Hiding it down by his side. On 
               the move again, now --

                                     BOURNE
                         Yeah, it's cold in here, too...
                              (calling to her as he 
                              goes --)
                         Let's give it another minute.

               BOURNE like we've ever seen him. Like an animal. Every sound -- 
               every breeze -- everything carries information.

               Standing still. Taking it all in.

               Real quick layout -- there's big windows along one wall that 
               face out to the street below. The hallway to the bedroom and 
               bath feeds into the living room from one side. There is a 
               large frosted airshaft window along that hallway wall. Simple 
               furniture.

                                     MARIE
                              (suddenly --)
                         -- omigod! --
                              (she's behind him --)
                         -- what're you? -- no -- no --

               MARIE backing away -- completely freaked -- BOURNE standing 
               there with the knife in his hand and --

                                     BOURNE
                         -- no -- Marie -- no! -- it's not 
                         like that --

                                     MARIE
                         -- please -- Jason -- omigod --

                                     BOURNE
                         -- quiet -- quiet --

               MARIE -- frightened -- confused -- paralyzed for a moment --

               BOURNE glancing back -- a curtain fluttering behind him -- 
               motioning for MARIE to get down -- do it -- now -- down!

               MARIE hesitating and --

               BOURNE -- what's he doing? -- he's unscrewing a lightbulb 
               from a lamp beside him and --

               MARIE about to say something -- he shakes her off --

               BOURNE -- knife in one hand -- lightbulb in the other -- 
               putting his foot on a chair in front of him and --

                                     MARIE
                         ...what are you doing?...

               BOURNE waving her to shut up -- crawl -- now -- back up -- 
               get under the window -- go! --

               MARIE -- he seems so sure -- it's weird, but she's doing it -- 
               she's under that frosted window -- down below the sill -- 
               looking back -- what the fuck is he doing now? --

               BOURNE -- the lightbulb -- he's tossing it across the room -- 
               over her head -- into that frosted window and --

               As she ducks down --

               As it SHATTERS --

               EVERYTHING STARTS HAPPENING AT ONCE

               PHFT!-PHFT!-PHFT!-PHFT!-PHFT!-PHFT! -- silenced automatic 
               weapons fire -- raking into the apartment and --

               THE FROSTED WINDOW peppered with holes and --

               MARIE on the floor as THE WINDOW SHATTERS above her and --

               CASTEL -- he's in the airshaft! -- hanging from an abseil 
               rope -- but off guard -- FIRING BLIND -- strafing the 
               apartment and --

               BOURNE kicking that chair across the room and --

               CASTEL reacting -- instinct -- moving target --

               THE CHAIR just strafed to shit and --

               BOURNE rolling away and --

               CASTEL -- he's coming in -- last pieces of window frame 
               CRASHING AWAY as he swings into the apartment and --

               MARIE -- right below him -- shit raining down as he flies in 
               and --

               BOURNE throwing the knife and --

               CASTEL -- turning -- too late -- the knife catching him in 
               the neck and --

               BOURNE -- in motion -- attacking and --

               CASTEL -- knife impaled in his neck -- clawing for it with 
               one hand -- trying to get off a shot and --

               APARTMENT WALL -- PHFT!-PHFT!-PHFT!-PHFT!-PHFT! -- gunfire 
               tearing wildly around the room and --

               BOURNE -- full-stop -- kicking the gun -- kicking it up -- 
               ROUNDS TEARING ACROSS THE CEILING and --

               MARIE -- SCREAMING NOW -- trying to crawl away and --

               CASTEL -- no chance -- off balance -- BOURNE -- his open 
               palm driving up into CASTEL'S JAW -- the body wants to fall 
               backward, but BOURNE has the guy's arm in his free hand -- 
               jerking it like rope -- tearing it from it's socket and --

               THE GUN CLATTERING FREE across the floor and --

               BOURNE -- his knee -- like a piston -- hard into CASTEL'S 
               GUT -- and then down -- his foot -- down into CASTEL'S KNEE, 
               shattering it and --

               CASTEL is on the floor -- stunned -- wiped -- knife pouring 
               blood from his neck -- arm hanging like a rag doll -- bone 
               torn through his pant leg above the knee and --

                                     MARIE
                         omigod -- omigod -- what're you doing? -- 
                         what're you doing? --
                              (incoherent fear and 
                              confusion, German 
                              and English and--)
                         -- what is he? -- what've you? -- 
                         omigod -- what is this? --

               BOURNE ignoring her -- grabbing the guy's backpack --

                                     MARIE
                         -- what're you doing? -- Jason, 
                         please, tell me what's happening!

                                     BOURNE
                         Open it --
                              (tossing Castel's 
                              backpack behind him --)
                         -- do it -- what's he got in there?

               CASTEL -- eyes wild -- tries to make his feet --

                                     BOURNE
                         Who are you?
                              (kicking him down--)
                         -- who are you?

               CASTEL -- crablike against a wall -- bloody hands leaving a 
               mess as he struggles to get to his feet --

                                     BOURNE
                         -- who are you? -- tell me who you 
                         are -- who sent you? --
                              (bearing down)
                         -- what is this about? -- YOU'VE GOT 
                         TO TELL ME WHAT THIS IS ABOUT! --

               CASTEL -- staring back -- eyes wild -- mouth shut -- his 
               expression -- is it terror or pure steel? --

                                     BOURNE
                         WHY ARE YOU TRYING TO KILL ME?

                                     MARIE
                              (suddenly from behind)
                         ...omigod, no...

               MARIE -- the guy's backpack -- something in her hand -- and 
               as freaked out as she was a moment ago -- this is worse --

                                     BOURNE
                         What? -- what? --
                              (attention split --)
                         -- what is it?

                                     MARIE
                         ...this is my picture... he's got my 
                         picture --
                              (holding it up, in 
                              horror --)
                         -- this is me -- this is Zurich -- 
                         this... this... this is yesterday --

                              (to Castel)
                         How do you have my picture?

                                     BOURNE
                         Marie, just --
                              (waving her back --)
                         -- just stay there! -- just --

                                     MARIE
                         -- he's got my picture! -- this is 
                         yesterday! -- this is me! --
                              (out of control now --)
                         -- where did you get my picture? --

                                     BOURNE
                         -- let me do this, okay? --

                                     MARIE
                         -- do what? -- what are you doing? -- 
                         he's got my picture --
                              (just apoplectic --)
                         -- he's -- my God -- look at him -- 
                         he's bleeding to death -- my picture -- 
                         look! -- he was trying to kill us! -- 
                         omigod --

               Now there's KNOCKING AT THE DOOR and --

                                     THE CONCIERGE
                              (muffled but urgent)
                         Mister Bourne! Mister Bourne! What's 
                         going on? Is everything all right in 
                         there?
                              (-- and she keeps 
                              banging and --)

               MARIE is past the point of rationality and CASTEL is bleeding 
               and shaking and BOURNE is trying to think and it's just 
               impossible and --

               Suddenly -- CASTEL is moving! -- and fast -- it's superhuman -- 
               unbelievable -- just enough spring in his good leg and --

               BOURNE bracing himself but --

               CASTEL isn't attacking! -- he's running away -- he's crossing 
               the living room -- but there's nowhere to go -- absolutely 
               nowhere -- except --

               THE WINDOW

               CASTEL hurling himself into the glass and --

               EXT. THE PARIS APARTMENT BUILDING -- DAY

               WINDOW SHATTERING! -- CASTEL -- in a cloud of broken glass -- 
               sixty feet above the street --

               Falling and falling and...

               IMPACT! -- landing on the roof of a parked car and --

               INT. THE PARIS APARTMENT -- DAY

               THE APARTMENT -- BOURNE in motion -- five things at once -- 
               checking the window -- kicking the gun away -- grabbing the 
               red bag -- grabbing what he can -- no time to spare and --

                                     THE CONCIERGE
                              (still outside the 
                              door--)
                         --I'm calling the police, Mr.  Bourne -- 
                         you give me no choice -- I'm calling 
                         them right away! --

                                     BOURNE
                         -- your shoes -- Marie! -- where? -- 
                         where are your shoes? -- Marie --

               MARIE standing there in utter shock -- paralyzed -- the 
               picture in her hand -- the broken glass -- all of what just 
               happened --

                                     MARIE
                         He's dead isn't he?

                                     BOURNE
                         Marie -- look at me -- there's no 
                         time for this --

                                     MARIE
                         He went out the window -- why? -- 
                         why would someone do that?

                                     BOURNE
                         -- we can't stay here -- I can't 
                         stay here -- it's not safe here --

                                     MARIE
                         He came to kill us.

                                     BOURNE
                         -- we can go -- I can get us out of 
                         here -- but we have to go now --

                                     MARIE
                         You knew he was coming.

                                     BOURNE
                         No.

                                     MARIE
                         I trusted you.

                                     BOURNE
                         You're wrong. I didn't know.

                                     MARIE
                         I don't trust anybody and I trusted 
                         you!

                                     BOURNE
                         I didn't know this would happen.

                                     MARIE
                         He had my picture! He knew I was 
                         here! He came here to kill us!

                                     BOURNE
                         And where is he now?
                              (that gets her quiet)
                         You believe what you want, but I'm 
                         telling you the truth -- I never 
                         would have brought you here if I 
                         thought it was dangerous.

                                     MARIE
                              (totally overwhelmed)
                         Oh, Jesus...

                                     BOURNE
                         You stay -- if you want, you stay -- 
                         it's okay -- it's better -- maybe 
                         it's better -- I don't know --
                              (starting to back 
                              away --)
                         But I can't stay here. I can't.

                                     MARIE
                         But the police --

                                     BOURNE
                         -- there's no time --

                                     MARIE
                         -- we'll explain it --

                                     BOURNE
                         -- how? --

                                     MARIE
                         -- there's two of us -- we'll tell 
                         them -- we'll just --

                                     BOURNE
                         -- forget it --

                                     MARIE
                         -- we'll tell them what happened --

                                     BOURNE
                         I don't know what happened!
                              (huge here)
                         I don't know who he is! I don't know 
                         what he wants! I don't even know who 
                         I am! The only thing I know is that 
                         if I stay here, I'm never gonna find 
                         out!

               BOURNE -- that's it -- grabbing the backpack -- pulling it 
               on -- just about to make his move --

               She's standing there. Just utterly swamped. Lost.

                                     BOURNE
                         Come with me.
                              (she turns back, he's 
                              waiting --)
                         I can get us out of here. I know it. 
                         Then we can think. Then we can work 
                         it out. We'll explain it then.  Once 
                         we're safe.
                              (rock solid)
                         I can protect you.

               EXT. THE PARIS APARTMENT BUILDING -- DAY

               A CROWD is gathered around CASTEL'S BODY. Rubberneckers and 
               people pointing up to the broken window -- THE CONCIERGE 
               running out to the street and getting the news and THE SOUND 
               OF SIRENS bleeding in from the distance and --

               THE CAMERA PULLS BACK TO FIND

               THE LITTLE RED CAR pulling out of the alley. Turning away 
               from the scene. Disappearing into the streets of Paris --

               INT. WOMBOSI COMPOUND MAIN HALLWAY -- DAY

               THRONE ROOM DOORS flying open -- WOMBOSI exploding out into 
               the hallway --

                                     WOMBOSI
                         -- No! -- I say, no! -- they go this 
                         far -- out a body in the grave -- 
                         another body! -- no! -- this isn't 
                         over -- these people are not finished -- 
                         nothing will make them finish until 
                         they have Wombosi! -- the real Wombosi -- 
                         until I'm the one in the box! --

               SIX KIDS -- TWO WIVES -- THREE BODYGUARDS -- all startled by 
               this steamrolling mass of energy and paranoia --

                                     WOMBOSI
                         -- what are you doing? --
                              (bearing down on 
                              Bodyguard #2 --)
                         -- sleeping? --
                              (to Deauvage --)
                         -- he's sleeping! -- this man is 
                         sleeping at his post! --
                              (kicking the chair 
                              out from under him --)
                         -- I've had men killed for this! --
                              (but he's still moving --)
                         -- you think these people? -- these 
                         people who come for me -- you think 
                         they sleep? -- they never sleep! -- 
                         they spend all the day -- all the 
                         night -- all time thinking about how 
                         to put Wombosi in that box! --
                              (he's just gonna keep 
                              going, and we're 
                              into--)

               A MASSIVE ONE-TAKE TRACKING SHOT

               DEAUVAGE on his feet -- racing to follow -- KIDS scattering 
               out of the way -- THE WIVES completely unfazed and --

                                     WOMBOSI
                         -- there is no box for Wombosi! -- 
                         they don't have a box that can hold 
                         me! -- I know these people -- I know

                         -- what is the window? -- this window 
                         is open! -- who leaves this open! --

                              possibly respond --)

                         careless people? -- these people see 
                         an open window, they reach in with a 
                         big hand and grab your heart until 
                         you die! --

                              he's trying to get

                         Yes, sir. All clear.

               WOMBOSI stops to look at DEAUVAGE. In the background, we can 
               hear A CHILD CRYING by the pool --

                                     WOMBOSI
                         This man is out there. Kane is out 
                         there. And they pretend he's dead. 
                         That means he's coming back.

               WOMBOSI moving quickly now and WE'RE STILL TRACKING -- taking

               PULL BACK TO REVEAL

               A secret studio buried deep in the Langley facility. Equipment 
               up the ass. Five people in this darkened room: AN ENGINEER 
               working the board. CONKLIN looking sour. ZORN in the shadows. 
               ABBOTT sitting there waiting for analysis from --

               MRS. DOYLE. She's late sixties. A long-time spy shrink. An 
               eminence. A diamond-hard, seen-it-all intelligence.

                                     BOURNE/TAPE
                         "Kane. John Michael Kane."

                                     OPERATOR/TAPE
                         "One moment, sir."

               MRS. DOYLE nods to THE ENGINEER. She's heard enough.

                                     MRS. DOYLE
                         He's not lying. He's very highly 
                         stressed, but he's not lying. He's 
                         confused. He's aggressively searching 
                         for a way out of the chaos. This 
                         conversation, the video from the 
                         consulate -- the body language, vocal 
                         pattern -- it's my sense he's really 
                         lost here.
                              (beat)
                         I think he snapped.

                                     CONKLIN
                         Is that a medical term?

               She turns. Battle lines drawn.

                                     MRS. DOYLE
                         You want clinical terminology? It's 
                         called, "conversation hysteria."
                              (to Abbott now --)
                         I don't know exactly how you train 
                         these people. I'm not sure I want to 
                         know. I'll take a guess there's some 
                         extremely rigorous behavior 
                         modification going on here.

               Silence. The idea dangling for a moment.

                                     ABBOTT
                         Let's assume that's true.

                                     MRS. DOYLE
                         You can only wind people so tight. 
                         Even machines break down.

                                     CONKLIN
                         This unit has an unblemished record 
                         of success.

                                     MRS. DOYLE
                         Then I guess I'm in the wrong meeting.

               INT. CIA HALLWAY UPSTAIRS HALLWAY -- DAY

               ABBOTT and CONKLIN walk and talk. They want to get loud, but 
               they can't. Too many people passing by --

                                     CONKLIN
                         That was two hours -- two hours to 
                         get a second opinion -- and nothing 
                         changes. He's loose. He's out of 
                         control. It's very clear what needs 
                         to happen.
                              (point blank)
                         I have work to do.

                                     ABBOTT
                         What if he is working for someone 
                         else? What if he turned?

                                     CONKLIN
                         Turn? To who? Where does he turn? 
                         What does he have to offer? He's got 
                         nothing. He's a killer. He's a piece 
                         of equipment for crissake. Where's 
                         he gonna turn?

               EXT. HOTEL DE LA PRIX -- NIGHT

               Funky. Out of the way. Cash and carry. No-questions-asked

               PROPRIETOR and HIS DOG.

               INT. THE HOTEL ROOM BATHROOM -- NIGHT

               HAIR DYE washing down a rusted drain. It's MARIE alone in 
               this crappy little bathroom. Jeans and bra. All of it soaking 
               wet.

               A new hair color.

               A MIRROR. There she is. Her turn to stare at herself and 
               wonder.

               And then she smells something. Smoke...

               INT. THE HOTEL ROOM -- NIGHT

               It's a shitty little room. BOURNE sitting on the bed. And 
               the smoke is coming from...

               HIS PASSPORT -- the Jason Bourne passport -- on fire. BOURNE 
               holding it as it burns away. Bourne's face -- melting -- 
               bubbling -- finally disappearing, -- BOURNE letting go just 
               before it burns his fingers and --

               BOURNE sits back. And there's MARIE standing there. And she's 
               holding out her passport --

               He looks at her. Big moment.

                                     BOURNE
                         No.
                              (he won't do it)
                         You know who you are. You know what 
                         that's worth? That's everything.
                              (pause)
                         I can't live like this. I can't do 
                         anything until I know who I am. 
                         Believe me, you don't want what I 
                         have.

               He looks away. Silence. And then, she touches him. His 
               shoulder.

               BOURNE almost recoils. Almost. He doesn't know what to do. 
               Doesn't know how to react.

               MARIE in front of him now -- she's taking his hand -- and he 
               hesitates -- looking at her -- is this happening? -- she's 
               taking his hand -- moving it down her body -- staring at him -- 
               both of them silent -- his hand -- her skin -- his mind racing -- 
               he wants this -- wants it in every way -- but it's 
               overwhelming -- when was the last time something like this 
               happened? -- he can't remember -- he doesn't care -- he's 
               pulling her toward him -- and they're kissing -- and you 
               know the rest...

               INT. CDG AIRPORT -- NIGHT

               THE PROFESSOR arriving in Paris.  Coming through the terminal 
               as his pager goes off -- never even stopping as he reads and --

                   ...................................................

               HOTEL SEQUENCE -- SKETCHED ONLY

               HOTEL MARBOEUF PARIS. This is the place that answered the 
               phone when Bourne hit redial in his apartment. This is the 
               place that John Michael Kane was staying when he "died."

               And so begins, the investigation...

               Now, since the presence of danger -- ie Wombosi's guys and/or 
               Treadstone -- is still up in the air, and since this scene 
               could either play very quickly or very long, and since we're 
               not exactly sure where we stand with page count -- this scene 
               is not finished.

               The rules of the scene, however, seem to be thus: Bourne 
               would have to be very nervous about being recognized. If he 
               was Kane and Kane stayed here, he's not the guy to do whatever 
               "social engineering" needs doing.

               Long version? Bourne sets the table and Marie gets the goods. 
               Somehow there's a threat from Treadstone or Wombosi.

               Fast version? It's all results -- we see them execute a plan 
               rather than work it up. MARIE is already in the hotel. In a 
               hotel uniform? Posing as a guest? In any case, she looks 
               very much different than we've ever seen her before.

               She gets close to the office. Hides. Waits. BOURNE calls the 
               desk from a pay phone. Asks for something. We see that some 
               sort of improvised booby-trap has been set inside the hotel 
               to start a fire. In the confusion -- MARIE -- very bravely -- 
               gets into the office. We do a quick cut outside to Bourne 
               waiting and --

               EXT. STREET OUTSIDE THE HOTEL MARBOEUF -- DAY

               Walk and talk. BOURNE and MARIE leaving the hotel fast. He's 
               on alert -- always on alert now -- making sure they're not 
               being watched. And she's excited and pumped -- she did it! -- 
               she's got the hotel record in hand --

                                     MARIE
                         You stayed there five times in the 
                         past six months. But I didn't have 
                         time -- I could only get the bill 
                         from the last stay -- you were there 
                         for two days. Some room service -- 
                         there's half a dozen phone calls 
                         here so that's someth--

                                     BOURNE
                              (cutting her off)
                         Who paid the bill?

                                     MARIE
                         It's a company... MPG Capital.

               INT. AN EMPTY OFFICE SUITE -- DAY

               Vacancy wasteland. Dead phone lines hanging. Carpet pulled 
               up. Completely stripped out. BOURNE and MARIE standing there 
               staring.

                                     MARIE
                         This can't be it.

               She turns around -- and what's he doing? -- BOURNE with a 
               piece of paper and pencil -- or something/anything resourceful 
               and handy -- maybe it's carpet lint -- maybe it's breaking 
               the glass on the door and holding it up to the light -- or a 
               rubbing -- anyway, he's doing something ingenious with the 
               glass door --

               And as he's doing this, we're hearing --

                         Richard? Is he there.

               We're watching the MPG LOGO emerge and seeing BOURNE and 
               MARIE react, as we hear --

               INT./EXT. SHITBAG PARISIAN PHONE BOOTH -- NIGHT

               BOURNE on the pay phone. MARIE behind him at the bar. He's 
               got a pad and paper. This is all business.

                                     BOURNE
                         Well, where are you? Where am I 
                         calling?

                         The company's located in Southampton, 
                         but --

                                     BOURNE
                         -- this is a tire dealership, right?

                                     TELEPHONE VOICE
                         No sir, this is a navigational chart 
                         registry. I'm afraid you have the 
                         wrong number.

               Dial tone. BOURNE making a note. And as he does --

                                     BOURNE

               Monolithic tech. Reflection city.

               INT. ELEVATOR -- LA DEFENSE -- DAY

               BOURNE dressed for success. Suit. Cleaned up good. Catching 
               his reflection in the elevator's mirrored ceiling. Nerves on 
               edge.

               INT. PETER RAWLINS' OFFICE -- DAY

               Meet RAWLINS. He's a young, jolly Brit -- pink and overfed -- 
               and quite shocked to see...

                                     RAWLINS
                         Mr. Kane...
                              (hastily tidying up)
                         Come right in... please... have a 
                         seat.

                                     BOURNE
                         Thanks.

               BOURNE just trying to feel his way through this...

                                     RAWLINS
                         Well...
                              (really thrown)
                         I must admit, when my assistant told 
                         me you were here I was, really -- I 
                         was quite -- I was surprised.

                                     BOURNE
                         Really.

                                     RAWLINS
                         We thought you were gone for good.

                                     BOURNE
                         Did you?

                                     RAWLINS
                         Well, I mean it's a tough business, 
                         isn't it? Cutthroat.

               A long awkward beat. Neither of them sure where to go.

                                     RAWLINS
                              (finally)
                         Look, our bid -- it was competitive -- 
                         but definitely at the high end of 
                         competitive -- when we didn't hear 
                         back from you, we did some re-analysis 
                         of the numbers, and honestly, we'd 
                         really like a chance to do a bit 
                         better.
                              (pitching now)
                         I'm assuming you're still in the 
                         market. It's the same vessel?

                                     BOURNE
                         Yes.

                                     RAWLINS
                         We just picked up a job quite like 
                         the one we were bidding for you. 
                         Gorgeous boat, hundred-and-seventy- 
                         five-foot pleasure cruiser. I think 
                         we learned a few things that might 
                         allow us to make our proposal for 
                         your job, as I said, a bit more 
                         competitive.

                                     BOURNE
                         Okay.

               Another beat. Rawlins holding back until now...

                                     RAWLINS
                         Was it the break-in?

                                     BOURNE
                         Excuse me?

                                     RAWLINS
                         We also thought we hadn't heard from 
                         you -- we've had a bit of a publicity 
                         nightmare, people have been talking.
                              (the meat)
                         Our offices were broken into -- 
                         vandalism mostly -- shortly after we 
                         last spoke.

                                     BOURNE
                         I hadn't heard.

               RAWLINS smiles. Reset. Sales mode.

                                     RAWLINS
                         Let me get you a new copy of the 
                         proposal.

                                     BOURNE
                         That'd be great.

               INT. A CAFÉ NEAR LA DEFENSE -- DAY

               BOURNE entering. And there's MARIE in the back working a 
               payphone -- waving for him to sit -- she's onto something.

               BOURNE sits. Pulls out the Alliance Security Brochures and 
               literature. Flipping through it. Boats. Water. He's getting 
               closer. Pictures of yachts and various security blurbs and a 
               list of references for huge yachts -- jobs they've done in 
               the past...

                                     MARIE
                         I found it.
                              (standing there)
                         It took six calls.
                              (she's creeped out)
                         I found Kane. I found the body.

                                     BOURNE
                         Let's go --
                              (already standing --)
                         We got to get away from this phone.

               INT. PARIS MORGUE FRONT DESK -- NIGHT

               THE TWO MORGUE ATTENDANTS watching BOURNE put down a hundred 
               dollar bill. MARIE standing a little off -- she will not be 
               comfortable in the morgue.

                                     ATTENDANT #1
                              (picking up the cash)
                         What was the name again?

                                     BOURNE
                         Kane. John Michael Kane.

                                     ATTENDANT #2
                         It's number 121.

                                     BOURNE
                         I want to see the body.

                                     ATTENDANT #1
                         Our boss could come back. We're not 
                         supposed to.

               BOURNE pulling out another hundred and --

               MORGUE FREEZER ROOM

               It's showtime. MARIE back by the door. BOURNE right on it. 
               ATTENDANT #1 pulling open the freezer and...

               BOURNE sags. ATTENDANT #1 looking baffled.

                                     MARIE
                         What?

                         What the hell's going on here?

               Here comes the boss back from his break -- a little drunk?

                                     ATTENDANT #1
                         This guy, he came to see the American, 
                         but the body, it's missing.

                                     MORGUE BOSS
                         They came last night.  His brother.

                                     ATTENDANT #2
                         It's not in the book.

                                     MORGUE BOSS
                         Who are these people?
                              (now English to Bourne)
                         Who are you? What's going on here?

                                     BOURNE
                         Where did this body go?

                                     MORGUE BOSS
                         I said, someone came last night --
                              (big attitude now)
                         Look, this isn't a carnival -- people 
                         call and they make an appointment 
                         and they follow the rules -- everyone 
                         signs in and out -- this is a serious 
                         place -- serious work -- it's not 
                         just to come in whenever you like --

                                     BOURNE
                              (like a shot)
                         Shit, we didn't sign in.

                         So get the hell out of here.

                                     BOURNE
                         Fine. But I'd like to sign in. In 
                         fact, I insist on it. Where's the 
                         book? I gotta sign in --
                              (off and running now --)

               Everybody following -- all of them confused -- and into --

               FRONT DESK AREA

               BOURNE there first -- all forward motion here -- balls out --

                                     BOURNE
                         Is this it? --
                              (the book)
                         -- this is it, right? --

                                     MORGUE BOSS
                         -- slow down -- you can't just take 
                         the book like that --

                                     BOURNE
                         -- don't sweat it, I have a pen -- 
                         no problem -- just let me find the 
                         page --
                              (then quick to Marie)
                         -- honey, why don't you wait for me 
                         outside, okay? --

               MARIE trying to take the hint, but she's curious what he's 
               doing --

                                     MORGUE BOSS
                         -- we have rules here, this is a 
                         very serious place -- I'm the one 
                         who decides who gets in here, okay? --

                                     BOURNE
                         -- what do I? -- I put the name of 
                         the person I came to see? --

                                     BOURNE
                         -- here we go -- I found it --

               But he's not writing -- he's ripping -- tearing the page out 
               of the book --

                                     MORGUE BOSS
                         -- what are you? -- what are you 
                         doing? -- you crazy fuck -- you ripped

                              (no chance to finish 
                              this, because --)

               BOURNE just slammed him against the wall. Hard. Like a tractor 
               hit him. And fast.

               And that shuts up the room.

               THE TWO ATTENDANTS rushing to help their boss --

               BOURNE grabbing MARIE and pulling her out the door --

               EXT. PARIS STREET -- NIGHT

               Moments after the morgue. BOURNE striding away. MARIE 
               struggling to keep up. And BOURNE is different now -- zoning 
               in -- he's close -- he's hardening --

                                     MARIE
                         What are you doing? --
                              (he's scaring her)
                         -- Jason -- stop -- talk to me...

               BOURNE ignoring her -- ripping through the Alliance Security 
               brochures -- scanning them as he walks --

                                     MARIE
                         -- I don't know what you're doing 
                         and you're scaring me -- what are 
                         you looking for? -- what just happened 
                         in there? --

                                     BOURNE
                         Nykwana Wombosi.
                              (he stops, holding up 
                              the brochure --)

                                     MARIE
                         What is that?

                                     BOURNE
                         It's a name. Mr. Wombosi owns a thirty 
                         million dollar yacht. He's the proud 
                         owner of an Alliance Security package.
                              (handing her the 
                              brochure --)
                         He also paid a visit to the morgue 
                         to see John Michael Kane.
                              (the ripped-out page --)

                                     MARIE
                         What does that mean?
                              (but he's walking 
                              again --)
                         Jason, what does that mean?
                              (she's trying to catch 
                              up, but he's walking 
                              really fast --)
                         Jason, please... who is he?

                                     BOURNE
                         I don't know.
                              (he's not turning 
                              back again --)

                                     MARIE
                         So what are we doing?

                                     BOURNE
                         Go back to the hotel.

               MARIE just stops. Reeling.

               BOURNE walking away. Into Paris night and --

               INT. CONKLIN'S TREADSTONE OFFICE -- DAY/NIGHT?

               ABBOTT alone here. On the phone. Looking up to see --

                                     ZORN
                         They found him. They found Bourne.

               ABBOTT jumps off the call. Eyes never leaving ZORN.

                                     ABBOTT
                         Where?

                         You better come in.

               EXT. L'ETOILE -- NIGHT

               THE PROFESSOR -- A MOTORCYCLE -- screaming through traffic 
               and --

               INT. WOMBOSI'S SECURITY ROOM -- NIGHT

               EXT. WOMBOSI COMPOUND -- NIGHT

               BOURNE live. On the street. Bathed in a streetlight. Staring 
               up at a security camera.

               Total hero moment.

               I'm here. I'm waiting. I know you're watching.

               EXT. WOMBOSI COMPOUND -- NIGHT

               Confusion to say the least -- WOMBOSI -- pistol in hand -- 
               moving as fast as he can through the clutter -- KIDS 
               scattering as he follows DEAUVAGE -- racing for THE SECURITY

               BOURNE standing there as the FRONT GATE opens. The moment. 
               The big deep breath. He's walking in --

               INT. TREADSTONE COMMUNICATIONS DESK -- NIGHT

               Uglier by the second -- desperation madness --

                                     ABBOTT
                         -- he went inside! --

                         -- that's what they're trained for -- 
                         just a surgical strike.

                                     ABBOTT
                         Forget it.

                         What do you want to do?

                         We don't know what we're into!

                                     CONKLIN
                         We're in the shitter, man! Pick your 
                         poison. Maybe he's in there to finish 
                         the job. Maybe he's working for 
                         Wombosi. Maybe they want to go on TV 
                         together. Every possibility sucks -- 
                         we've got to move!

               INT. WOMBOSI COMPOUND MAIN HALLWAY -- NIGHT

               DEAUVAGE and BODYGUARD #1 giving BOURNE a serious pat down.

                                     BOURNE
                         Is he here?

               DEAUVAGE doesn't answer -- spinning BOURNE around -- they're 
               really going over him --

               INT. TREADSTONE COMMUNICATIONS ROOM -- NIGHT

               CONKLIN on his feet -- ABBOTT beet red -- this is getting 
               loud --

                                     CONKLIN
                         You don't have the stones for this. 
                         You people come down here and wink 
                         and whisper and we send these guys 
                         out and get it done. And you're clear. 
                         And the guys upstairs get what they 
                         want. And the whole bunch of you are 
                         so stuffed on deniability it's coming 
                         out of your ears.

                         Well, you know what? You're here 
                         now. What do you want to do?

               ABBOTT just shaking his head no.

               And CONKLIN snaps -- suddenly he's over the console -- there's 
               the button -- and he's pressing it and --

               BOURNE being marched toward the throne room doors -- DEAUVAGE 
               and BODYGUARD #1 flanking him -- KIDS and WIVES staring as 
               he passes -- the way you'd look at a prisoner on the way to 
               the gallows --

               THE BIG DOORS thrown open wide and --

               WOMBOSI on the throne.

                                     WOMBOSI
                         Come in.
                              (an imperial gesture)
                         Please...

               BOURNE steps up to the plate.

                                     WOMBOSI
                         Did you bring investment advice for 
                         me tonight? It was tax shelters, 
                         wasn't it? Swiss debenture-swaps.

                                     BOURNE
                         MPG Capital.

                                     WOMBOSI
                         I think investment advice from a 
                         dead man, it's a bad idea.
                              (beat)
                         How does it feel to be dead?

                                     BOURNE
                         It's a lot more stressful than I 
                         thought.

               KIDS have started sneaking into the room -- DEAUVAGE is trying 
               to scoot them out but --

                                     WOMBOSI
                         -- no -- no, let them in! -- let 
                         them in.
                              (to the kids)
                         Come in -- on y va -- come in...
                              (to Bourne)
                         I think everyone wants to see the 
                         dead man.

               BOURNE watching the kids -- they are all staring --

                                     WOMBOSI
                         What do you do?
                              (on his feet now --)
                         You get an appointment with me? You 
                         make sure it's on the boat? You come 
                         visit me -- you pitch me this bullshit 
                         investment package. You drink my 
                         water -- eat my bread -- play with 
                         my children -- and what? -- two nights 
                         later you come back and you put this 
                         death --
                              (slamming something 
                              down onto the throne --)
                         -- you put this in my engine room!

               There is A BOMB on the throne now.

                                     WOMBOSI
                         So this is a different kind of 
                         meeting.
                              (steam building)
                         Maybe now we talk some truth, okay? 
                         One dead man to another.

               BOURNE -- caught off guard as -- WOMBOSI suddenly rips away 
               his jacket -- so hard that he tears straight through to the 
               shirt --

               BOURNE'S BACK -- bare -- two bullet scars -- still raw --

                                     WOMBOSI
                         You see this?
                              (calling to Deauvage --)
                         I told you my shot was better!

                                     DEAUVAGE
                         He went in the water -- how did he 
                         live?

                                     WOMBOSI
                         No, no no...
                              (and he means this --)
                         This is a strong killer. This is a 
                         crazy strong killer. Oh, yeah...
                              (circling)
                         To make a killer that looks like 
                         you? This young? This face?
                              (he means this)
                         It's bloody fucking amazing.

               BOURNE imploding -- this news -- the kids staring at him -- 
               the bomb -- it's all getting loud around him --

                                     BOURNE
                         Who do you think sent me?

                                     WOMBOSI
                         I know who sent you. I don't know 
                         why.
                              (this could get 
                              physical at any moment 
                              now --)
                         I learned many, many things from the 
                         CIA. Many things. I learned the way 
                         they think.
                              (beat)
                         Was the bomb on my boat supposed to 
                         go off or not?

               BOURNE distracted by the kids -- these faces -- it's...

                                     WOMBOSI
                         You didn't set the bomb. Why?

               BOURNE not sure -- about any of it --

                                     WOMBOSI
                         Was this a game or a fuck up?

                                     BOURNE
                         I don't know.

                                     WOMBOSI
                         Get the kids out!

               He doesn't have to say it twice -- they know the drill -- 
               they're gone.

                                     WOMBOSI
                         And the door.

               DEAUVAGE closing the doors and as he does --

               THE PROFESSOR ATTACKS...

                   ...................................................

               THIS SCENE HAS NOT BEEN WRITTEN

               It's a shootout.

               The Professor is infinitely more talented at this than the 
               bodyguards.

               Bourne needs to get out of there -- without looking wimpy --

               No children are harmed.

               As the Professor rallies -- he will shoot Wombosi -- he will 
               find Bourne's jacket left on the floor (in which later he 
               will find a clue leading him to Belleville) and last but 
               hardly least, he will take a parting shot at the bomb still 
               sitting there on the throne.

               There will be a huge, trailer-worthy explosion.

               This might not want to be very long. There is an extensive 
               action sequence just around the corner.

               So Bourne escapes. Physically he's just weary. Emotionally 
               he's fucked.

               All of that happens and we cut to --

                   ...................................................

               INT. TREADSTONE COMMUNICATIONS DESK -- NIGHT

               CONKLIN flipping out -- THE PROFESSOR is not responding --

               CONKLIN grabbing shit -- like a madman --

                                     CONKLIN
                         I'm going to Paris.

                                     ABBOTT
                         No you're not. You're not going 
                         anywhere. I'm shutting this down.

                                     CONKLIN
                         You're not doing shit. You're so 
                         scared you can't even think.

                                     ABBOTT
                         You just blew up a house in Paris!

                         I can't call it off. He's not 
                         responding. Get out of my way.

               CONKLIN splits and --

               INT. THE HOTEL ROOM -- NIGHT

               It's really late. BOURNE enters the room. MARIE in the corner. 
               Smoked out. Cried out. Lifed out.

               Silence. Not a word.

               His shirt is torn to shit. He scraped-up -- blood here and 
               there. He moves past her into --

               THE BATHROOM

               His hands shaking as he tries to wash them. He bags it.

               THE ROOM

               BOURNE comes out. And there's a long silence until --

                                     MARIE
                         It doesn't matter who you were before. 
                         It's who you want to be. That's all 
                         that matters.
                              (is he listening?)
                         We have this money. We have what we 
                         have. I had nothing before and now, 
                         I don't know, maybe I have more, 
                         maybe it's nothing, but...
                              (he looks over)
                         I say we leave here. We leave this 
                         place. We go until we can't go 
                         anymore.

                                     BOURNE
                         You could do that?

                                     MARIE
                         Yes. That's who I want to be.

               BOURNE nods. Turns off the light. Takes her hand. And they 
               lay in bed. Just laying there.

               INT. PARIS SOMEWHERE -- NIGHT

               THE PROFESSOR cooping somewhere. Tending to his wounds. 
               Ignoring his pager. He's slipped off the grid.

               INT. HOTEL ROOM -- DAWN

               BOURNE and MARIE packing up to hit the road. Together.

                   ...................................................

               DOUG'S ROUGH DRAFT OF THE BIG ACTION SEQUENCE

               INT. HOTEL DE LA PAIX -- LOBBY -- DAY

               MARIE dropping off the key. Hope hangs in the air --

                                     CLERK
                         xxxxxx...

                                     MARIE
                         xxxxxx

               BOURNE enters. He's got the black duffel. Car keys.

                                     BOURNE
                         xxxxxx.

                                     MARIE
                         xxxxxx

               And now they're headed for the door. Something doesn't feel 
               right for BOURNE -- and then he notices --

                                     BOURNE
                         Stop where you are.

                                     MARIE
                         What?

               Bourne turns back to the CLERK.

                                     BOURNE
                         Where's the dog?

                                     CLERK
                         My husband's out looking for him.

                                     BOURNE
                         He run away often?

                                     CLERK
                         That old beast? Miss his breakfast? 
                         Not a chance.
                              (returning to cleaning)
                         It's always something, right?

               Suddenly -- just like that -- everything's different --

                                     BOURNE
                         Get in the basement.

                                     CLERK
                         What?

                                     BOURNE
                              (to Marie)
                         Get everyone down in the basement.

               Now MARIE doesn't need a second warning --

                                     CLERK
                         What the hell're you talking about?

                                     BOURNE
                         You're in danger. All of you. I have 
                         no time to explain.

                                     CLERK
                         Wait a minute --

                                     BOURNE
                         I'm sorry.

               -- those words -- the way he said it -- she's grabbing her 
               purse, clearing out of the room. Slamming the door behind 
               her -- click -- it's locked.

                                     MARIE
                         Jason...

               No answer -- too busy -- reaching under the check-in desk, 
               coming up with -- A SHOT GUN, an old one, but nonetheless a 
               gun --

                                     MARIE
                         Who is it? Who's out there?

               And now BOURNE is moving, pulling open a drawer.  A box of 
               shells. Filling his pockets.

                                     BOURNE
                         xxxxxx

                                     MARIE
                         xxxxxx

                                     BOURNE
                         I won't let that happen.

               And he is moving down the small hallway.  Away from the front 
               door -- towards the back door under the stairs.

               EXT. HOTEL DE LA PAIX -- COURTYARD -- DAY

               THE HOTEL BACK DOOR -- kicked open -- BOURNE coming out of 
               the house -- coming hard -- and --

               The small courtyard is empty -- but now the ALARM is going 
               off -- and BOURNE turns back to MARIE -- races to grab her 
               as --

               RATATATAT -- The FRONT DOOR -- WINDOWS -- ARE SHREDDED and -- 
               here comes the PROFESSOR.

                                     BOURNE
                         xxxxxx

                                     MARIE
                         xxxxxx

               And now they are running, across this little courtyard. To a 
               wall -- BOURNE is up, on it -- reaching down for MARIE -- 
               grabbing her -- swinging her over the wall as --

               ABM!!! The PROFESSOR SHOOTS.

                                     BOURNE
                         Go!

               MARIE takes off running. BOURNE leans over the wall, FIRES 
               BACK TWICE -- RATATAT -- The WALL IS SHREDDED. BOURNE takes 
               off running -- reloading on the fly.

               Rounds a bend, is chambering two rounds when he sees -- a 
               WOMAN is in her kitchen -- staring at him -- no time to 
               explain -- he turns back --

               The PROFESSOR is just vaulting over the wall. BOURNE FIRES 
               TWICE -- BAM! BAM! But the spray is too wide from this 
               distance. Windows are shattered to both sides of him but -- 
               the PROFESSOR stumbles but keeps going -- blood on his face 
               now -- RATATAT --

               BOURNE has to move. Reloading his almost useless gun. Reaching 
               MARIE -- facing a choice and they climb a wall -- FLOWER 
               POTS EXPLODE around them but they make it -- now --

               RUNNING IN A LABYRINTH -- right -- then left -- through a 
               small staircase. LEAPING a wall -- landing on a STEEP ROOF -- 
               sliding, falling, crashing to the ground in --

               A SMALL COURTYARD -- steep walls on all sides. But there's a 
               large window -- and it's open. And they step through and 
               find themselves --

               INT. CHINESE RESTAURANT -- BATHROOM -- DAY

               They close the window behind them -- catch their breath --

                                     MARIE
                         Did we lose them?

               BOURNE shakes his head. Tucks the gun under his coat.

                                     MARIE
                         Who is it?

                                     BOURNE
                         We have to keep moving.

               And now he is opening the door -- they step into --

               INT. CHINESE RESTAURANT -- DAY

               STARTLED KITCHEN WORKERS stare as BOURNE and MARIE calmly 
               walk out of the bathroom and head towards the front door of 
               the empty restaurant. Quiet.

               And then they open the door to the street and --

               EXT. BELLEVILLE -- COMMERCIAL STREET -- DAY

               The first thing we notice is noise. The street is burgeoning 
               with life. The second thing we notice are SIRENS. POLICE 
               CARS approaching. BOURNE and MARIE head down the street, 
               blending in.

               Up ahead -- TWO POLICE CARS snaking through traffic. BOURNE 
               steers them off this crowded street.

                                     BOURNE
                         xxxxxx

                                     MARIE
                         xxxxxx

               EXT. BELLEVILLE -- QUIET STREET -- DAY

               And BOURNE and MARIE are hurrying down this street when -- 
               BAM -- The PROFESSOR comes out of a building -- across and 
               down the street. No time to hide -- he's seen them -- he's 
               FIRING.

               BOURNE tackles MARIE to the ground behind a car. RATATAT -- 
               The PROFESSOR is literally shredding it. And now BOURNE is 
               moving --

                                     MARIE
                         What are you doing?

               And BOURNE is on the offensive. BAM! BAM! Moving towards the 
               PROFESSOR who is ducking behind cars on the other side.

               They are shredding the street -- FIRING ruthlessly at each 
               other and -- NOW THE POLICE ARE HERE -- BLOCKING both ends 
               of the street. GUNS are drawn -- BOURNE's vulnerable on two 
               flanks. The COPS are YELLING. And now --

               THE PROFESSOR BLASTS the COPS -- And now things have changed.

               THREE WAY FIREFIGHT and BOURNE grabs MARIE and they dive 
               into --

               INT. SMALL EPICERIE -- DAY

               And the PROFESSOR shreds the store as BOURNE attemps to fire 
               back. SHIT flying everywhere in here -- hard to see and -- 
               The PROFESSOR is advancing on them -- cops are no match for 
               his fire power. They move to the back -- kick open a door --

               INT. HIGHWALLED COURTYARD -- DAY

               BOURNE and MARIE cross this small courtyard, the PROFESSOR 
               is right on their heels. CRASH through a door -- and now 
               they are in --

               INT. SMALL SWEATSHOP -- DAY

               COUPLE of ASIAN WOMEN sewing in here. One MAN in charge -- 
               and BOURNE and MARIE charging through -- the MAN about to 
               say something -- but now the PROFESSOR is on their tail and --

               INT. SMALL AFRICAN SHOP -- DAY

               Making god knows what in here -- vats of something. Small 
               grouping of workers -- BOURNE shutting the door behind him -- 
               it's shredded with BULLET HOLES. BOURNE and MARIE racing to 
               the next door as -- BAM -- the PROFESSOR kicks the door open -- 
               BOURNE about to fire -- but there is a WOMAN right behind 
               the PROFESSOR! Can't do it -- turns to run as -- RATATATAT --

               The PROFESSOR FIRES as BOURNE and MARIE dive into --

               INT. LIVE POULTRY SHOP -- DAY

               And now CHICKEN feathers are flying everywhere -- the glass 
               at the front of the door is shattering. BOURNE and MARIE 
               make it through the gauntlet.

               EXT. BELLEVILLE -- STREET -- DAY

               And BOURNE and MARIE are running. And he is reaching into 
               his pocket -- fishing around -- and just as he pulls out the 
               car keys -- we recognize this as the street they parked their 
               car on and --

               BY MARIE'S CAR

               BOURNE unlocks the door -- pops MARIE's open. And --

               THERE'S A COP -- yelling at them and -- BOURNE hits the gas -- 
               they fly out of their parking space -- BAM!! The COP fires, 
               shattering their windshield and there -- up ahead -- THE 
               PROFESSOR coming out -- about to FIRE -- BOURNE aims for him -- 
               forces him to dive out of the way and -- ONE QUICK MOVE around 
               a TRUCK and they are free.

               INT. THE LITTLE RED CAR

               BOURNE and MARIE looking back nervously -- so far all over --

               ON THE STREET

               The PROFESSOR looking around. PEOPLE staring at him -- covered 
               in blood -- the COP racing up -- yelling -- not yelling for 
               long because the PROFESSOR is firing at him and --

               Now the PROFESSOR is moving -- not running -- just a swift 
               walk and now he's past the truck -- and --

               A MOTORCYCLIST comes flying down the street -- oblivious -- 
               going way too fast for these streets and -- the PROFESSOR 
               swings his gun stock like a bat -- takes him out -- clean 
               and smooth -- bike crashing to the ground and --

               The PROFESSOR grabs the bike and takes off -- SHOOTING at 
               TWO POLICE CARS just racing to the scene and we are into --

               EXT. BELLEVILLE BLVD -- DAY

               HIGH SPEED CAR CHASE. And BOURNE better do some fancy driving 
               because here comes the PROFESSOR -- and he's a lot faster -- 
               much better armed.

               INT. MARIE'S CAR

               BOURNE driving. MARIE looking back -- seeing the PROFESSOR 
               gain on them --

                                     MARIE
                         xxxxxx

                                     BOURNE
                         xxxxxx

               And -- THE PROFESSOR FIRES -- SHREDS the back off their car --

                                     MARIE
                         Give me the gun --

               And now she's got his shotgun, leaning out the window.

                                     BOURNE
                         Wait 'till he's close.

               BOURNE swerves, up on the sidewalk back onto the street -- 
               slaloms through the traffic -- racing towards an intersection 
               and --

               IN THE INTERSECTION

               CARS coming the other way, BOURNE just makes it through -- 
               the PROFESSOR tries to squeeze through -- skidding and --

               CRACK! The PROFESSOR hits the front of a car sideways on his 
               bike -- he is THROWN clear through the intersection, right 
               into the windshield of an oncoming car and --

               He gets up, grabs his gun and works his way towards his bike 
               and now we see --

               EXT. VARIOUS SHOTS AROUND PARIS -- DAY

               COPS are mobilizing -- swarming into this area and --

               BACK TO THE CAR CHASE --

               BOURNE and MARIE pick up a few cops on their tail -- shed 
               all of them -- the last car goes into an EXPLOSIVE FLIP -- 
               the PROFESSOR is now right behind them. And now we are into --

               CRAZY CAR CHASE WITH COPS RIGHT ON THEIR TAIL

               BOURNE, MARIE and the PROFESSOR leave a trail of totaled 
               cars that the cops have to try and navigate through -- finally 
               saying fuck it and hitting a few cars themselves and now we 
               are into --

               CAR CHASE THROUGH NARROW STREETS

               MARIE'S CAR and the MOTORCYCLE can pass where the police 
               cars cannot. BOURNE may be able to shed the cops, but not 
               the PROFESSOR. And now one quick move and they are --

               EXT. QUAI -- DAY

               Racing against traffic up the Seine. Past the Louvre. COPS 
               pursuing on the other side of the river. BOURNE and the 
               PROFESSOR leaving behind a trail of carnage. And now --

               The PROFESSOR is pulling up along side them -- one lane over.  
               Both swerving to avoid oncoming cars and --

               MARIE FIRES -- TWICE -- TAKES out a few windshields. The 
               PROFESSOR fires at the same time -- MARIE'S CAR DOOR -- GONE -- 
               she's totally exposed but --

               THE PROFESSOR -- his BIKE is SPOUTING GAS -- one of the 
               pellets nailed his tank.

               BOURNE AND MARIE --

                                     MARIE
                         xxxxxx

               THE PROFESSOR --

               No problem -- he's unwrapping a piece of duct tape from the 
               barrel of his gun -- two seconds and the hole is patched and -- 
               BOURNE AND MARIE -- the side of the car is completely gone -- 
               the PROFESSOR is gaining -- across the river dozens of police 
               cars are racing alongside. Many more can be seen on their 
               side -- a road block ahead -- running out of options and --
               BOURNE turns hard -- crashes over the sidewalk and flies 
               down a side street. A POLICE CAR pulls out behind them -- 
               the PROFESSOR can't stop -- skidding hard, turning the bike 
               sideways, skidding out -- sliding across the ground and 
               BAMMM!!! SMASHING into a GLASS PHONE BOOTH which shatters.

               And he's up -- lifting up his bike and --

               BOURNE AND MARIE

               SIX POLICE CARS on their tail -- more joining. Every street 
               they look down has POLICE CARS racing in parallel. Running 
               out of options and in the background --

               THE PROFESSOR is back in the game -- passing the police cars 
               and up ahead --

               THE ROAD IS BLOCKED. POLICE ROAD BLOCK -- cops with guns. 
               Gotta act quick and -- BOURNE turns hard left -- there's a 
               metro staircase -- only way out and --

               THEY BOUNCE down the stairs. CRASH through the doors down 
               below.

               THE FIRST POLICE CAR -- no way he's following. SLAMMING on 
               his brakes. SKIDDING to a halt -- SKIDDING sideways -- gonna 
               stop in time -- just at the edge of the steps and then --

               THE SECOND POLICE CAR isn't braking -- T-BONES the first car -- 
               BAM!!! -- sends it rolling sideways down the steps until it 
               crashes to a halt at the bottom -- upside down.

               THE PROFESSOR -- he's turning -- heading for a different set 
               of stairs. BOURNE AND MARIE -- crashing through the turnstiles -- 
               people diving out of their way and --

               AT THE STAIRCASE -- THE WINDOW of the POLICE CAR is kicked 
               out and -- TWO VERY ANGRY COPS emerge -- pull their guns out -- 
               head into the station. BOURNE and MARIE's world just got a 
               lot more dangerous and --

               THE PROFESSOR is racing down the other staircase -- an up 
               escalator -- people diving out of the way as --

               BOURNE and MARIE slalom through the station -- suddenly -- 
               there's the PROFESSOR -- parallel corridor -- metal barricades 
               keep them separated. PROFESSOR FIRING.

               UP AHEAD -- a horizon line -- BOURNE guns it -- a steep 
               staircase and -- THEY FLY down the steps -- landing on --

               THE METRO PLATFORM

               The PROFESSOR lands on the other side -- both racing down 
               the platform -- PROFESSOR tearing up the wall behind them 
               and -- HERE COMES A TRAIN -- on BOURNE and MARIE's side -- 
               travelling the opposite way -- temporary refuge. Not for 
               long -- there's no way out on this end of the platform. They 
               skid to a halt -- just as --THE TRAIN DOORS OPEN -- STARTLED 
               STRAPHANGERS stare at BOURNE and MARIE as they stop onto the 
               platform -- take off running.

               THE PROFESSOR has to turn his bike around. He's quick -- but 
               it gives BOURNE and MARIE a two second head start.

               BOURNE AND MARIE almost at the other end of the platform -- 
               gunfire ripping up the windows behind them. Gonna go for the 
               steps -- but here come --

               THE ANGRY COPS -- remember them? -- the ones who took the 
               ride down the steps -- they're firing now and --

               BOURNE AND MARIE turn back -- the PROFESSOR is firing and 
               there is only one option --

               INT. METRO CAR -- DAY

               BOURNE and MARIE into the conductor booth. People diving off 
               the train as BOURNE hits the YELLOW BUTTON and -- the TRAIN 
               STARTS ROLLING -- doors still open -- they disappear into 
               the protection of the tunnel walls -- then BOURNE hits the 
               button to close the doors and -- THE PROFESSOR -- watching 
               the trains accelerate out of the station -- and now he's 
               racing his bike down the platform -- opposite the motion of 
               the train and -- here comes the end of the train and --THE 
               PROFESSOR throws his bike into a skidding 180 and skids off 
               the platform all in one move -- landing hard on the tracks 
               but facing the right direction and now he's accelerating 
               towards the train -- just as an oncoming train is racing 
               into the station and -- HE LEAPS onto the back of the train 
               in the nick of time. His GUN CLATTERS to the tracks.

               IN THE LAST METRO CAR

               The window is shattered and the PROFESSOR lets himself in -- 
               wind whipping through his hair from the shattered windows.  
               And --

               IN THE FIRST METRO CAR

               BOURNE and MARIE finally getting a breather. BOURNE keeps 
               looking back -- nothing -- the train is deserted. Finally --

                                     MARIE
                         xxxxxx

                                     BOURNE
                         xxxxxx

                                     MARIE
                         xxxxxx

                                     BOURNE
                         xxxxxx

               And ahead -- daylight -- the train tracks go above ground 
               and as the train hits daylight -- we see the PROFESSOR 
               directly behind BOURNE on the other side of the glass and --

               CRASH! The PROFESSOR grabs BOURNE through the glass, ramming 
               his head into the metal as --

               BOURNE grabs the knob, swings the door open and CRUSHES the 
               PROFESSOR -- CRUSHES him again and now he is free and --

               BOURNE turns, pulls up the shotgun and -- the PROFESSOR kicks 
               it out of his hands -- it clatters to the ground and now we 
               have a beat -- THE TRAIN CAR races across the Bir Hakeim 
               bridge -- all of Paris laid out behind them. BOURNE and the 
               PROFESSOR squaring off -- both looking at the gun -- realizing 
               there's no chance for either one of them to get it and --

               A BRUTAL RUTHLESS FIGHT breaks out. BOURNE's motivated -- 
               the PROFESSOR's crazy -- makes it a pretty even match. Looks 
               like it could go on for a little while when suddenly --

               BAM!!! The PROFESSOR drops to the ground -- behind him -- 
               MARIE wields the shot gun.

                                     MARIE
                         xxxxxx

                                     BOURNE
                         xxxxxx

               And BOURNE takes the gun from her -- standing there -- 
               reloading -- both barrels -- raising the gun -- aiming it --

                   ...................................................

               INT. MOVING METRO CAR -- DAY

               THE PROFESSOR sitting there. Like a dummy. Like a puppet 
               that's been propped up. He's fucked -- his whole side ravaged 
               with shot -- his arm shredded -- hand barely there -- blood 
               flowing fast --

                                     BOURNE
                         Who else is coming?

               THE PROFESSOR staring up at the gun. Stunned. Doomed. Mouth 
               dry. Eyes struggling to make sense of the chaos.

                                     BOURNE
                         I won't ask again.

                                     PROFESSOR
                         I work alone. Like you...
                              (confused beat)
                         ...we always work alone.

                                     BOURNE
                         What do you mean?

                                     PROFESSOR
                         Who are you? Rome? Paris?
                              (Bourne is just staring --)
                         Treadstone... both of us... I was 
                         warned but...

                                     BOURNE
                         Treadstone?

                                     PROFESSOR
                         ...which one are you?...

               BOURNE lowering the weapon -- head swimming --

                                     BOURNE
                         Paris. I live in Paris...

                                     PROFESSOR
                         ...headaches... you have that... I 
                         get such bad headaches...

                                     BOURNE
                         Yes.

                                     PROFESSOR
                         ...it's a problem...

               He's losing blood fast -- things inside him seizing up --

                                     BOURNE
                         Treadstone.

                                     PROFESSOR
                         ...or in a car... when it's dark... 
                         something with the headlights...
                              (circuits exploding)
                         ...pills, right? Treadstone had those 
                         pills...

                                     BOURNE
                         What is Treadstone?

                                     PROFESSOR
                         ...what did you do?... you must've 
                         really fucked up...

                                     BOURNE
                         I think so.

                                     PROFESSOR
                         ...someone said caffeine -- for a 
                         headache... doesn't seem...

                                     BOURNE
                         What do they want me to do?

                                     PROFESSOR
                         ...they won't let you go...

                                     BOURNE
                         Why?

               THE PROFESSOR -- coughing -- a spasm -- helpless --

                                     PROFESSOR
                         Look at this...
                              (all the blood --)
                         ...least you have a woman....

               And he's gone. Like that. Sitting there. And BOURNE looks 
               paralyzed too. Kneeling there. Stalled out.

                                     MARIE
                         Jason...

               BOURNE doesn't answer -- can't, because there's this sound -- 
               this pulsing hum -- BOURNE reaching into THE PROFESSOR'S 
               POCKET and --

               INSERT -- THE E-PHONE PAGER -- covered in blood -- hum -- 
               hum -- hum -- BOURNE'S HAND wiping at the blood that covers 
               the display --

               BOURNE staring at it. Very familiar to him.

                                     MARIE
                         We've got to go.

               INT. METRO CAR -- DAY

               BOURNE and MARIE racing back through the cars -- away from 
               the scene of the crime and --

               EXT. ABOVE-GROUND METRO PLATFORM -- DAY

               THE SHATTERED TRAIN pulling into the station -- doors opening -- 
               SCREAMS ECHOING through the station from up the platform and --

               BOURNE and MARIE getting off the last car and --

               EXT. STREET/ALLEY NEAR THE PLATFORM -- DAY

               Two minutes later. BOURNE and MARIE -- exhausted -- beat -- 
               Everything all at once --

                                     BOURNE
                         Take this.

               She turns. He's holding the locker key.

                                     BOURNE
                         Take it.

               But she doesn't move.

                                     MARIE
                         And that's it?

                                     BOURNE
                         If you're lucky.
                              (it's hanging there)
                         Take it.
                              (beat)
                         There's enough in there to make a 
                         life. Any life. Just get out now. 
                         Get low. Stay low.
                              (beat)
                         Take it.

               She takes it. Staring at him. Simply refusing to cry.

                                     MARIE
                         What was I thinking, right?

                                     BOURNE
                         I can't protect you anymore.

                                     MARIE
                         What about you?

                                     BOURNE
                         I'm gonna find the end of this.
                              (beat)
                         I can't protect you.

               MARIE takes one last look. And she's running --

               BOURNE hangs there a moment -- listening to her go -- and 
               then he pulls out THE E-PHONE PAGER. And it's pulsing like 
               crazy.

               BOURNE flips open the shell. There's a keypad in there.

               Holding it. Like a missing organ.

               INT. THE ZURICH AIRPORT MOTEL ROOM -- DAY

               Remember MANHEIM? He's still there waiting. And his pager 
               goes off, and --

               INT. TREADSTONE PARIS -- NIGHT

               A safehouse -- CONKLIN filling a burn bag -- racing -- 
               everything's going --

               EXT. TREADSTONE PARIS -- NIGHT

               CONKLIN done with the dirty work -- out into the street --

               As he's about to leave -- he hears a sound -- a familiar 
               sound -- hum -- hum -- hum --

               He cross the street -- looks down to the Quai below --

               Holy shit -- there's one of his E-PHONE PAGERS --

               He goes down -- picks it up --

               And now --

                                     BOURNE
                         What did you do to me?

               CONKLIN wheels around. There he is. Right behind him.

                                     CONKLIN
                         What did I do? What've you done? Do 
                         you have any idea? Any conception? 
                         What you've destroyed? Do you have 
                         any idea how much time and work -- 
                         how many people have their lives 
                         wrapped up in this?

               So now you know.

                                     BOURNE
                         Are you Treadstone?

                                     CONKLIN
                         Am I Treadstone? Me?
                              (peering at him closely 
                              now --)
                         What the hell're you talking about?

               BOURNE showing nothing -- or is he trying too hard not to?

                                     BOURNE
                         What did you do to me?

                                     CONKLIN
                         What did I do? I spent thirty million 
                         dollars on you. I spent three years 
                         finding you -- four years training 
                         you --
                              (incredulous)
                         What did I do?
                              (staring now)
                         What in the name of God have you 
                         been doing, Jason?

                                     BOURNE
                         I don't know.

                                     CONKLIN
                         They're right about you, aren't they? 
                         You're fried.
                              (on it now)
                         You really don't know what's going 
                         on, do you?

                                     BOURNE
                         I know you've been trying to kill 
                         me.

                                     CONKLIN
                         Of course. We had to try. We didn't 
                         know what was wrong.
                              (warming to this --)
                         We didn't know you were in trouble.

                                     BOURNE
                         So now you know.

                                     CONKLIN
                         So it's time to go home.

                                     BOURNE
                         That's all I get?

                                     CONKLIN
                         We'll make you better. We can put 
                         the pieces back. We can do that.

                                     BOURNE
                         I don't think so.

                                     CONKLIN
                         We have to go home, Jason.

                                     BOURNE
                         Jason Bourne is dead.

                                     CONKLIN
                         There never was a Jason Bourne.
                              (that gets him)
                         You have to come with me. It's the 
                         only way. We can give it back to 
                         you...

                                     BOURNE
                         Keep it.
                              (and he's walking --)

                                     CONKLIN
                         Jason...
                              (trying to follow --)
                         They can't let you go...

                                     BOURNE
                         That'll be their second worst mistake.

               And with that, BOURNE scrambles up a wall -- like it's nothing -- 
               CONKLIN just left there -- on the Quai -- in the dark --

               EXT. BANKS OF THE SEINE -- NIGHT

               BOURNE walking away -- faster and faster --

               EXT. BANKS OF THE SEINE NEARBY -- NIGHT

               MANHEIM -- A CAR PARKED IN THE DARKNESS -- sitting alone 
               with his briefcase. Opening it. There's his gun.

               BOURNE -- walking -- deeper into the darkness and --

               MANHEIM -- in the dark car -- loading the weapon -- calm -- 
               steady -- methodical and --

               BOURNE -- walking and --

               MANHEIM -- stepping out of the car -- closing the door quietly -- 
               deep in the shadows and --

               BOURNE -- still coming -- the darkest part of the path just 
               ahead and --

               MANHEIM -- raising the gun and --

               THE CAMERA SPINS TO HIS TARGET AND --

               IT'S CONKLIN! -- just climbing back up from the Quai --

               MANHEIM -- the gun -- phftt -- phftt -- phftt --

               CONKLIN -- three holes -- head -- heart -- gut -- his body 
               dropping like a stone beside his car.

               MANHEIM walks over. Looks down. Point blank -- phftt -- that 
               makes it four and --

               INT. TREADSTONE COMMUNICATIONS DESK -- NIGHT

               ABBOTT and ZORN alone in the dark. As a red light begins 
               pulsing on the console.

               That red light means Conklin's dead.

               After a moment, ZORN moves to the console and shuts the light 
               off.

               EXT. BANKS OF THE SEINE -- NIGHT

               BOURNE still walking. And he's just gonna keep on going, as 
               we --

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               INT. CIA OPERATIONS CONFERENCE ROOM -- DAY

               MARSHALL at the head of the table. A cadre of INTEL HONCHOS.

                         The Treadstone project has actually 
                         already been terminated. It was 
                         designed primarily as a sort of 
                         advanced game program...

               ABBOTT in the hot seat. ZORN right there beside him.

                                     ABBOTT
                         ...We'd hoped it might build into a 
                         good training platform, but quite 
                         honestly, for a strictly theoretical 
                         exercise, we thought it was far too 
                         expensive. The cost-benefit ratio 
                         was just too high. It's been all but 
                         decommissioned at this point.

                                     MARSHALL
                         All right, what's next?

               ZORN handing ABBOTT the next hundred pages.

                                     ABBOTT
                         Okay, this is Blackbriar. Blackbriar 
                         is a joint, DOD, communications 
                         program that we really feel has good 
                         traction to it.

               ABBOTT is just gonna go on and on and on.

               EXT. MARTHA'S VINEYARD -- DAY

               Gorgeous Summer day. A SCOOTER RENTAL SHACK near the beach.

               SIX MONTHS LATER

               MARIE coming out of the shack with two helmets. Handing them 
               to A HAPPY COUPLE waiting there on their scooters.

               THE HAPPY COUPLE rides off.

               MARIE turns back and --

               There's BOURNE. A new look. A smile.

                                     MARIE
                         Can I help you?

                                     BOURNE
                         This your store?

                                     MARIE
                         Yes.

                                     BOURNE
                         Think I could rent a scooter?

                                     MARIE
                         You have ID?

                                     BOURNE
                         Not really.

               Beat. He smiles.

                                     MARIE
                         It's not a problem.

               Her turn to smile. And we...

                                                                  FADE OUT:

1   EXT.   NIGHT.   HOUSING PROJECTS -- MOSCOW                    1

    SMASH CUT

    MOTION -- flat out -- it's us -- we're running -- stumbling
    -- breathing rushed -- blood in the snow...

    We are JASON BOURNE and we're running down an alley...

    Supered below:   MOSCOW

    BLUE LIGHTS -- from the distance -- strobing through the
    night -- rushing toward us -- POLICE CARS -- three of them -
    - SIRENS HOWLING as they bear down -- closer -- faster --
    until they whip past the alley...

    Up against the wall -- BOURNE is hidden in the shadows.

    BOURNE is badly wounded -- shot through the shoulder --
    bruises and broken bones from the final car chase in
    SUPREMACY...

    With a GROAN, he lifts himself up, staggers across a park
    toward a PHARMACY...


4   INT. NIGHT. PHARMACY -- MOSCOW                                4

    ROWS of MEDICINE and FIRST AID supplies, and in the
    background, a DOOR being jimmied...It's BOURNE...The ALARM
    goes off...

    MACRO ON -- MEDICINE BOTTLE

    VICODIN, as BOURNE grabs it...Then PENICILLIN...

    Then SURGICAL SUPPLIES:

    Scalpel...Forceps...Sutures...Cotton gauze...Betadine...

    BOURNE finds a large sink...Rests his gun there...Lays out
    SURGICAL SUPPLIES...Checks out his back in the
    mirror...Opens the capsules of penicillin and pours the
    powder directly into the wound...Begins treating himself...


5   EXT. NIGHT. PHARMACY -- MOSCOW                                5

    A POLICE CAR pulls up to the curb, lights flashing. One
    POLICEMAN goes to the jimmied DOOR. SECOND POLICEMAN sees
    blood and footprints. He motions to his partner to
    follow...


6   INT. NIGHT. PHARMACY BATHROOM -- MOSCOW                       6

    BOURNE finishing up -- splashes water on his face -- he
    seems a man on a mission. He looks up --

                                                                 2


       A MIRROR.

       His face...

                   Welcome to the program...

       POV Bourne walks down a corridor (corridor #1).


6AA    INT. NIGHT PHARMACY -- MOSCOW                                  6AA

       The cops approaching.

       Daniels leading Bourne down the corridor.

                   You'll be saving American lives.

       A black sack is thrown over Bourne's head, then:

       (STOCK) A torrent of quick shots of Bourne's kills: the
       Professor, Jarda, the blonde guy in Paris, Mr. And Mrs.
       Neski...

       And finally. BANG -- Marie hit in the head.      The car off
       the bridge. She sinks away dead...


6A     INT.   NIGHT   PHARMACY -- MOSCOW                              6A

       The POLICE enter the back room, guns drawn.

                             POLICEMAN #1
                   Put your hands on your head and
                   turn around slowly!

       BOURNE snaps out of it, doesn't move. POLICEMAN #1 (older)
       approaches him. When BOURNE doesn't respond to his
       questions, the POLICEMAN starts forward. BOURNE turns and
       in one motion grabs his gun from the sink and disables the
       POLICEMAN.

       BOURNE freezes POLICEMAN #2 with his gun and a look.

                             BOURNE
                        (in Russian)
                   Give me your gun and radio.

       POLICEMAN #2's gun and radio skittle across the floor.

                                                              3


                           BOURNE
                     (in Russian)
                 My argument is not with you.

     BOURNE smashes the radio and takes the gun.

     BOURNE exits...

8C   INT. CIA -- DAY                                              8C

     A workman installs a nameplate that reads:    Ezra Kramer,
     Director, CIA.


8C   INT. KRAMER'S OFFICE -- DAY                                  8C

     Kramer listens to a recording with Landy and Cronin. There
     are unhung pictures and a few other items that indicate he
     has just moved into this job.

                                                          4


Two other senior CIA officials sit in on the meeting.
Kramer looks at a file on Bourne and Abbott.

                    BOURNE (V.O.)
          So we got in the way?   Is that
          why Neski died? Is that why you
          killed Marie?

Kramer glances at a photo of Marie in the file.

                    ABBOTT (V.O.)
          You killed Marie the minute you
          climbed into her car.   The
          minute you entered her life she
          was dead!

Kramer looks at Abbott's official photo.

                    BOURNE (V.O.)
          I told you people to leave me
          alone! I fell off the grid. I
          was half way around the world.

                    ABBOTT (V.O.)
          There's no place it won't catch
          up to you. It's how every story
          ends. It's what you are, Jason.
          A killer! You always will be.

THUMP!

                    CRONIN
          We think that's Bourne hitting
          him on the head and then--

He makes a gun with his hand, i.e. Bourne putting his gun
to Abbott's head.

                       ABBOTT (V.O.)
          Go ahead!     Go on! Do it!

                    BOURNE (V.O.)
          She wouldn't want me to. That's
          the only reason your alive.

The tape clicks off.

                    KRAMER
          Who's "she?"

CRONIN puts a picture of MARIE in front of KRAMER.

                    LANDY
          His girlfriend, Marie. She was
          killed in India three weeks ago.

Kramer looks down at another image.     Abbott dead after his
suicide.

                                                        5


                    KRAMER
          A dirty section chief in league
          with a corrupt Russian
          Billionaire commits suicide when
          confronted by Jason Bourne. You
          couldn't make this stuff up.
              (holds up the photo of
               Abbot dead)
          You watched this happen?

Landy nods.   Kramer shakes his head in disgust at the whole
situation.

                    KRAMER
          Bourne's last confirmed location
          is Moscow, three days ago?

                       LANDY
          Right.

                    KRAMER
          So what does he do now?

                    LANDY
          I think he's looking for
          something he hasn't found.

                       KRAMER
          Like what?     What's he after?

                     LANDY
          I'm not sure. Maybe he hasn't
          gotten his memory back yet.  Not
          all of it.

A look from Kramer...

                    KRAMER
          Pam, what I need to know is, what
          kind of a threat is he to us?

                    LANDY
          If he just wanted to hurt us he
          could have sent this tape to CNN.

                    KRAMER
          Maybe he still will. Maybe he
          gave it to you because he wants
          to throw you in the opposite
          direction of his real plan. I
          don't know. I just know my
          number one rule is "the only way
          to stay safe is to assume the
          worst."   As far as I'm concerned
          Bourne is a serious threat until
          proven otherwise.

       ROSS interviews DANIELS, a TAPE RECORDER on the table
       between them. ROSS shows DANIELS some of the evidence he's
       assembled...WANTED POSTERS of JASON BOURNE.

24     INT. DAY. MARTIN'S APARTMENT -- PARIS                       24

       The charm of old Paris captured in the workings of an
       elevator operating in a wrought-iron shaft...

                                                          7


A WORK TABLE, covered with sheet music, music paper,
pencils. And, sitting on the upright piano against the
wall, a framed PHOTO of MARIE...

A KNOCK on a door beautifully, heavily lacquered with
centuries of paint...

MARTIN KREUTZ, late 20s, opens the door and finds BOURNE. A
long look between them -- like two lost brothers who
recognize each other -- each has been waiting for this
moment for a long time.


INT. CONTINUOUS. MARTIN'S APARTMENT

Martin looks out the window.

                    MARTIN
          Where is my sister?

                    BOURNE
          She's dead. She was killed.

                    MARTIN
          I knew it was going to end this
          way. It was always going to end
          this way...

                    BOURNE
          I didn't believe that.

                    MARTIN
          Why did she die?

                    BOURNE
          She was shot. A man came for me.

                    MARTIN
          And then you killed him.

Bourne nods.

                      MARTIN
          Now what?

                    BOURNE
          Someone started all this...and
          I'm going to find them.

Bourne looks at him for a beat and leaves.


EXT. SUBWAY -- DAY

Bourne climbs the stairs.

Bourne rounds a corner and stops, sees a bodyguard at a
door up the street hail a car then go back inside.

                                                            8


     Bourne walks up to the door, the bodyguard comes out again.
     Bourne knocks him aside. Grabs the man behind him,
     ELLATRACHE.

                          BOURNE
                    (in French)
                Who started Treadstone?

     The bodyguard comes back, gun out--

                           ELLATRACHE
                    (in French, to
                      bodyguard)
                It's OK!
                    (in French, to Bourne)
                They're still looking for you.
                You are taking a big risk coming
                here.

     Bourne shoves him against the wall, hard.

                          BOURNE
                    (in French)
                Just tell me what I want to know!

                          ELLATRACHE
                    (in French)
                I just provided them weapons.    I
                don't know who started--

                          BOURNE
                    (in French)
                You know something.   Tell me
                where to start looking.

                          ELLATRACHE
                    (in French)
                There's a journalist in London.
                Simon Ross. He seems to know a
                lot about you.   He has a source
                inside the program. Someone
                there from the beginning. What
                should I tell them if they
                contact me?

                          BOURNE
                    (in English)
                They give me the name I want, or
                I burn their entire house down to
                get it.

      As VOSEN steps out of the elevator and into his office, he
      is met by his #2, WILLS.

                               WILLS
                    We tracked the phone. Registered
                    to a London reporter named Simon
                    Ross. He works at the Guardian
                    newspaper.

                                                            10


      They enter a hallway through double doors towards the HUB.

                          VOSEN
                You tracking him?

      As they pass through, colleague hands WILLS a file.

                          WILLS
                Yeah, thanks Mike. We have a
                survey team covering him at
                work...and a sneak and peek's on
                their way to his apartment.

                          VOSEN
                Well, who talked to him? How did
                he find out about Blackbriar?

                          WILLS
                We don't know, we pulled his
                background and ran a cross check
                on any known anomalies, but we've
                come up with nothing. But, I
                think if we follow Ross, we are
                going to be able...

                         VOSEN
                Right. Ross is easy. I want the
                source.

                            VOSEN
                  I want rendition protocols and I
                  want the asset put on standby,
                  just in case.

                  Simon Ross, a reporter. I want

                  accounts, credit cards, travel
                  patterns...I want to know what
                  he's going to think before he
                  does. Every dirty little secret
                  he has. And most of all, we want
                  the name and real time location
                  of his source.


                  This is NSA priority level 4, any

                           WILLS
                 That's a hard line, Jimmy, why
                 don't we have it?

      down on Ross.

      BOURNE buys a cell phone. Activates the SIM card on the new
      phone. Dumps the pay-as-you-go package in a bin. Rounds a
      corner. Out of sight.

                          TECHNICIAN #1
                Sir, subject just arrived at the
                south entrance to Waterloo
                Station.


63    INT. DAY. WATERLOO -- ENTRANCE                                63

      ROSS moves to the entrance.

      Behind him, inside the tube station portico, BOURNE
      arrives.

      Sees ROSS. Sees the two survey teams. MOBILE ONE up the
      stair well and MOBILE TWO at street level.

      Commuters coming up the escalators. BOURNE joins them -
      moving towards Ross.

      Closer.

      Right on him.   ROSS oblivious.   Looking out onto the
      street.

      BOURNE brushes past him and PUTS THE PHONE IN HIS POCKET..

      ROSS feels the contact. Checking himself -- he's okay.
      But now a phone is ringing -- looks around, must be someone
      else.

      But the vibration's coming from his jacket pocket.

      ROSS takes out the phone -- not his -- puzzled.

      ROSS hits "answer."

                                                            17

                Walking towards the bus stop

      ROSS has clocked him.

      The HOODY walks to the bus stop. One hands-free EARBUD
      swaying down by his side as he moves to a seat.

      Sitting down. Checking his watch.

      ROSS shifting nervously from one foot to another.

                          BOURNE (o.s.) (CONT'D)
                Go to the bus stop, sit next to

      A BUS pulling up to the bus stop, blocking both SURVEYS'

      The other two AGENTS racing to the bus as it pulls away
      from the lights. Kicking the doors open, leaping on.

      GUNS drawn.     So quick.   Passengers screaming.

                              AGENT ONE
                        (to Hoody)
                    You. On the floor. Down.

      BOURNE coming down. Three quick moves and he's down-
      slumped against a wall- just another drunk to step over in
      the rush hour.

      Pulls the feed. Takes the earbud. Then back up and falls
      into step behind ROSS.

      Listening in to the chaos he has caused -- an ocean away.

                          BOURNE
                Why do you know so much about me?

                           ROSS
                What?

                          BOURNE
                The article. You talked to
                someone from Treadstone. Someone
                there at the beginning.  What's
                his name?

                          ROSS
                I can't tell you that.... Who's
                following me?

                          BOURNE
                Whoever they are it's trouble.

                          ROSS
                Are they Blackbriar?

                          BOURNE
                Blackbriar, what's Blackbriar?

                          ROSS
                I don't know. I heard the name
                this morning for the first time.
                Whatever it is, my source said it
                started with you.

                                                                22


                          BOURNE
                 What? What are you talking
                 about?

                           ROSS
                 Look, just help me get away from
                 these people...and we can talk
                 more...we can--

                      operatives)
                 We have to move.

       Bourne moves Ross toward the concourse.

       ROSS moving fast. Fighting through the crowds of faces.
       Each one a killer in ROSS' tormented mind.

       BOURNE on the periphery looking out across the throng,
       picking out the inconsistencies.

                                                              23


      One AGENT, then another approaching.

      He dials.

                             BOURNE (O.C.)
                  Three o'clock. Female. Blonde
                  black top.

                            ROSS
                  Has she seen me?

                            BOURNE
                  Not yet. Dip left past the photo
                  kiosk.

      ROSS spinning round. Dipping left.   BLACK TOP passing in
      the background missing him.

      BOURNE crossing close behind - marshalling the pieces at
      breakneck speed.

                            BOURNE (CONT'D)
                  Straight ahead. News kiosk.

      ROSS turning.   Weaving through the commuters.

      BOURNE seeing cameras turn.    ROSS heading into their path.

                            BOURNE (CONT'D)
                  Change of plan. Stop. Tie your
                  shoelace.

      BOURNE seeing ROSS dip out of view as a group of TOURISTS
      block the CCTV's line of sight.

      That same scene -- scores of TOURISTS -- from VOSEN's point
      of view. The TECHS try to get another angle...


94    EXT. DAY. CONCOURSE -- WATERLOO                                94

      ROSS looking through the sea of legs as he finishes tying
      his laces. Cameras sweeping past.

                            ROSS
                  Are we clear?

                            BOURNE
                  Clear. News kiosk. Straight
                  ahead.

      ROSS on the move. Sweating. Paranoid.

      Seeing a BIN MAN coming toward him -- reaching into his
      trolley.

                                                              24


                          ROSS
                Straight toward me.     Bin man?

                            BOURNE
                Negative.

                          ROSS
                He's got a gun.

                            BOURNE
                Negative.    Keep straight ahead.

      But ROSS swerves out of his path as the BIN MAN pulls out --
      a bunch of keys.

      CCTV CAMERAS turn -- ZOOMING IN ON ROSS.

                We're losing him! We cannot
                afford to lose him!

      Frenzied teching as they capture and transmit an image of
      Ross to...


96    EXT. DAY. TAXI RANK -- WATERLOO                              96

      PAZ flipping open his phone. A voice crackling in his
      earpiece.

                          VOICE
                Waterloo concourse. Subject
                heading east.

      Paz jamming the wheel hard right. Doing a high speed U-
      turn.

      Heading towards the east side of the station.


94    EXT. DAY. CONCOURSE                                          94

      BOURNE realizes ROSS has been seen. Sees the AGENTS
      starting to form the box...

                          BOURNE
                Get into cover. Now!

                                                               25


      ROSS moving faster.

                In place in one minute.

                          VOSEN
                Alright, I want to take him now.
                Get him out of there and have the
                asset cover it.

      WILLS gives orders...


96    INT. CAR TRAVELLING-- MEPHAM STREET -- DAY.                   96

      PAZ pulling into a side street. Out towards a series of
      arches that lead underneath the terminal. In his ear...

                          VOICE
                Target moving towards the stores.

                          ANOTHER VOICE
                Asset in play. ETA thirty
                seconds. All exits covered.

      PAZ through the archway. Grabbing a station plan. Studying
      it.

98    Through a subterranean maze of corridors. Up steps.           98
      Through doors.

      On his way to the kill zone.


99    EXT. CONCOURSE-- CONTINUOUS -- DAY                            99

      ROSS moving through crowds around the departures board.

      BOURNE hearing that last exchange in his earpiece too.
      Asset in play?

                          BOURNE
                Keep moving...

      BOURNE's POV: AGENTS closing the box. The departures board.
      Platform 7. A train waiting.

                             BOURNE (CONT'D)
                Faster....

      Commuters waiting for the platform

                          BOURNE (CONT'D)
                The front...

                                                               26


       Suddenly -- CLICK -- PLATFORM 7 displays.

       A wave of commuters flooding away -- sweeping the AGENTS
       back with them towards platform 7.

                           BOURNE (CONT'D)
                 GET IN THE STORE.

       BOURNE'S bought them thirty seconds.


100    INT. TUNNELS ABOVE THE CONCOURSE -- DAY                      100

       PAZ on the move. Earpiece crackling. Through a door. Taking
       a left down another tunnel.

       Opens another security door and moves up some steps.
       Towards a ladder.


100A   EXT. CONCOURSE WATERLOO -- SIMULTANEOUSLY -- DAY           100A

       The AGENTS regrouping. Speaking into their radios.

                           Voice
                 He's in the store -- still moving
                 east.

       ROSS out into the open again. In front of him another STORE
       COMPLEX.

                           BOURNE
                 INSIDE!

       BOURNE searching the concourse. Something bothering him.
       The threat level clicking another notch.


102A/B INT. MAINTENANCE AREA-- SIMULTANEOUSLY -- DAY           102A/B

       PAZ heads up some stairs to a service platform.

       Climbs a ladder.


101    EXT. CONCOURSE -- CONTINUOUS -- DAY                          101

       ROSS into the store complex. To one side is a service
       doorway.

       BOURNE sees the AGENTS approaching. Looks the other way --
       up at the hoardings above.

       Something's not right. Treadstone instinct.

                           BOURNE
                 Service doorway -- Now!

                                                                27


64H    INT. NEW YORK HUB -- SIMULTANEOUS -- DAY                      64H

       An image of Ross as he enters the store complex appears on
       the screen.

                            TECHY 2
                 Store.   Three means of egress.

                           VOSEN
                 Close him down...


105    INT. STORE COMPLEX -- SIMULTANEOUSLY -- DAY                   105

       ROSS through narrow store corridors. Sheer panic now.
       Two of the AGENTS move in after him.

       BOURNE behind them.

       BANG - takes the first out silently.

                           BOURNE
                 Keep moving.

       ROSS moving out to the light as another AGENT follows.

                           BOURNE (CONT'D)
                 Through the store room.

       ROSS travelling through.   The second AGENT right behind as-

       BOURNE steps out from behind the store room door. The dull
       snap of bones as second AGENT falls to the floor.


64H    INT. DAY -- CRI HUB                                           64H

       On a screen VOSEN watches, transfixed, as BOURNE takes out
       all his agents and then grabs ROBB...

                           VOSEN
                 Jesus Christ, that's Jason
                 Bourne.

                           WILLS
                 Maybe he's the source?

                           VOSEN
                 It doesn't matter, the asset now
                 has 2 targets. Take them both
                 out.

       WILLS taps in the order...


102B   INT. MAINTENANCE AREA-- DAY                               102B

       PAZ moves cross a narrow walkway.

                                                                28


       Now he's behind a mechanical 'tri-panel' hoarding. The kind
       that displays a different advert every 15 seconds. He waits
       for the change and then---

       -- A huge field of vision across the concourse stretching
       out down below him- a sniper's heaven.

       PAZ pulling open the motor-casing from the side panel, goes
       to work on it.

       Slowing the rotation. Rearranging the large triangular
       prisms to give him just the right time-gap to pull the
       trigger- and just enough cover to disappear.

       He takes out rifle parts from his rucksack. Starts to
       assemble them.


102C   INT. BEHIND THRESHERS (BEHIND THE SILVER METAL DOOR)        102C

                              BOURNE
                    I'm going to get you to safety
                    but you have to stay calm do
                    exactly what I say.

                              ROSS
                        (fear-induced autopilot)
                    Sure, okay.

                              BOURNE
                    No, listen to me: Exactly what I
                    say this time. Understand?

       Ross snaps to focus.     Looks Bourne in the eye.

                              ROSS
                    Yes.

                              BOURNE
                    Stay here while I look for an
                    escape.

       Ross nods.


102B   INT. MAINTENANCE AREA                                       102B

       PAZ puts together the rifle.


103    INT. WATERLOO STATION                                         103

       BOURNE exits from the silver door behind Threshers.    He
       stays on the phone with Ross.

       Hidden from the view of the CCTV cameras by the thick
       crowd, Bourne sees the approaching agents abruptly pulling
       back.

                                                                     29


                            ROSS (PHONE V.O.) (CONT'D)
                  I can see the entrance from here
                  I can make it out--

                            BOURNE
                  No, stay behind that door.


64H   INT. HUB                                                            64H

      CCTV view of the silver door behind Threshers that ROSS is
      behind (not Bourne). Wills is on phone.

                            WILLS
                  There. That silver door.
                  Bourne's behind that door?

                               TECH
                  Confirmed.

                            WILLS
                  Okay, pull the agents back and
                  give Bourne's location to the
                  asset.


107   INT. MAINTENANCE AREA                                               107

      On his cell phone Paz receives a text indicating Bourne's
      location. Paz finds the silver door and aims his rifle at
      it.

      SCOPE POV

      A shape barely visible moving behind the window.           (It's
      Ross but Paz and the Hub think it's Bourne.


111   INT. BEHIND THRESHERS /         WATERLOO CONCOURSE-- DAY            111

      INTERCUTTING BETWEEN ROSS AND BOURNE:

      Bourne spots the agents pulling back per Wills' orders.

                            ROSS (INTO PHONE)
                  If I run now I can make it--

                             BOURNE (INTO PHONE
                  No.   Something's not right.


107   INT. MAINTENANCE AREA                                               107

      Paz awaiting his shot--

                                                               30


       SCOPE POV

       The door comes open slightly, but from this angle Paz
       doesn't have a clean shot at his target (who he thinks is
       Bourne).


111    INT. CONCOURSE -- WATERLOO                                   111

       Bourne searches the rafters, looking for any threats from
       above.

                             ROSS (TEL. V.O.)
                   I'm going to go for it, okay?

                             BOURNE
                   Don't move until I tell you.

       Bourne is distracted by the last of the agents
       disappearing. Something is definitely wrong--

                             ROSS
                   I'm going to go for it.

                             BOURNE
                   No, No not now.

       Ross suddenly sprints out from behind the door--

       Paz sees the shape emerge--


110A   INT. MAINTENANCE AREA -- DAY                             110A

       PAZ fires--


111    INT. WATERLOO -- SERIES OF ANGLES                            111

       But it's Ross, not Bourne. Ross is hit by Paz's shot.    He
       falls, inches from the silver door, dead. Blood has
       splattered on the door.


110A   INT. PAZ'S NEST                                          110A

       Paz snaps his head back to the scope, realizing he's shot
       the wrong person. Then he catches a glimpse of Bourne--

       Bourne ducks behind the gathering crowd, out of Paz's line
       of sight, and goes to the body.

                                                              31

       Vosen and Wills stare at the screen. At the image of Ross,
       dead on the concourse.   The room -- normally full of
       chatter has gone dead silent...

       Vosen puts his head in his hands. This is a monumental
       screw up and everyone here knows it.  He just had the
       wrong man killed....

                            VOSEN
                  Oh...shit...

       Then suddenly Vosen snaps back to focus:

                            VOSEN (CONT'D)
                  Get the asset out of there ...

                            WILLS
                  What about Bourne?

       On the HUB MONITORS we see Police moving in... Vosen
       doesn't need to see anymore.

                            VOSEN
                  Get him out of there - NOW!


111    INT. WATERLOO -- DAY                                        111

       Bourne feels Ross' body for something.

       Paz is frustrated by the order. He's itching to get another
       shot off at Bourne, but after a beat, packs up quickly, as
       ordered.


111    INT. WATERLOO -- DAY                                        111

       On the screens and in real life, the aftermath of the hit.
       PARAMEDICS try helplessly to deal with ROSS -- killed
       instantly by the head shot meant for BOURNE...POLICE arrive
       and seal off the crime scene...

113    EXT. CONCOURSE WATERLOO -- SIMULTANEOUSLY -- DAY              113

       BOURNE on the move. Fast --

       Past platforms. On his way up to the Tri Panel.

       Up stairs. On to a walkway.   To his right he sees a figure
       disappearing...

       PAZ.

       BOURNE hammers down the walk - way in pursuit.


114    EXT. PLATFORM AREA -- DAY                                     114

       BOURNE tailing PAZ down on to a parallel platform. PAZ
       dipping down into the underground entrance.


115/116 INT. TUBE STATION -- WATERLOO -- DAY                 115/116

       PAZ moving deliberately through the evening rush hour--
       blending in...

       BOURNE in pursuit. Chasing on instinct.

       There...A glimpse of PAZ at the bottom of an escalator.

       BOURNE fights past people.

       PAZ disappears into the crowd.

       BOURNE rushes to catch him. Rounding a corner...

       A long walkway -- at the end, two staircases lead to
       different tube lines. BOURNE hesitates-- measures the
       choice.

       The sound of a train fills the station--

       BOURNE -- Fast downstairs.

       Watches-- just as PAZ gets onto the car at another door.

       BOURNE lunges to get on the train...But the doors close...

       BOURNE'S POV

       Watching PAZ from the platform as he SAGS down onto a seat,
       nauseated, his skin clammy, his head pounding...He takes
       out the PILLS and dry-swallows them...Looks up...

       CLOSE ON -- BOURNE

       Watching PAZ...As if he's looking in the MIRROR at his old
       self...The self before THE BOURNE IDENTITY...

                                                                33


       CLOSE ON -- PAZ

       He looks straight ahead, just another commuter...

       BACK ON -- BOURNE

       Watching PAZ, as the train pulls away...Then BOURNE is
       immediately in motion...

       DANIELS watches news of ROSS murder on TV. DANIELS panics,
       opens his safe, packs up papers, takes Blackbriar FILE.
       Sets alarm. Leaves.


120C   EXT. NIGHT. INTERNET CAFE -- LONDON.                      120C

       BOURNE sits at a computer, the ROSS notebook open in front
       of him. He pages through it, finding names, places, "HOW
       DID THIS ALL START?" -- and Blackbriar.   He Googles
       "Sewell and Marbury"-- finds Paris, Berlin, Madrid. BOURNE
       continues to search and finds receipt from Madrid.

       BOURNE leaves.

123    EXT. DAY.   POSH HOTEL -- NEW YORK CITY                       123

       LANDY steps out of a TAXI...


123A   INT. DAY.   POSH HOTEL -- NEW YORK CITY                   123A

       Vosen's sitting.

                             VOSEN
                       (to waiter)
                   Sparkling. And a "Heart-Healthy"
                   omelet with goat cheese and
                   peppers.

       Landy arrives.

                                                     34


                    VOSEN
          You're late. Traffic?

                    WAITER
              (handing her the menu)
          Ma'am?

                    LANDY
          Nothing for me.

Vosen looks at her, surprised.

                    VOSEN
          I'm buying.

She shakes her head, no. She sits, without taking her coat
off. She's not staying long.

                    VOSEN
          When the Director called, it was
          suggested we bring you on--

                     LANDY
          Suggested?
              (beat)
          Are you sure it was just a
          suggestion?

                    VOSEN
          Funny how different things look
          depending on where you sit. I
          look at this as doing a favor for
          you. Giving you an opportunity
          to complete some unfinished
          business.

                     LANDY
          Meaning?

                    VOSEN
          Jason Bourne.

                    LANDY
          Bourne's finished.

                     VOSEN
          Really?

                    LANDY
          It was finished the moment I
          realized I was chasing him for
          something he didn't do.   The
          case is closed.

                                              35


                     VOSEN
          So what do you make of this?
              (handing her
               surveillance photos of
               Bourne in Paris)
          French intel picked up Bourne
          meeting Pierre Elattrache on
          Tuesday. He threatened to burn
          our house down if you didn't tell
          him who started Treadstone.
          That's a big problem, wouldn't
          you agree?

                    LANDY
          This doesn't feel like Bourne to
          me.

                    VOSEN
          Why's it so hard for you to
          believe?

                     LANDY
          Probably because it's coming from
          you, Noah.

                    VOSEN
          Lets try and be adults okay? We
          all thought he was done, off the
          grid. But Bourne's back. Maybe
          he's a threat. We both want the
          same thing here.

                    LANDY
          So what happened at Waterloo?

                    VOSEN
          We have a leak. Bourne showed up
          in our surveillance. We had very
          little time to react.

                    LANDY
          And the reporter ended up dead?

                    VOSEN
          Bourne saw us coming.

Landy looks at him, suspicious.

                    LANDY
          So what was he doing?

                    VOSEN?
          We don't know. But just the fact
          that he was there means he's up
          to something, don't you think?
          Maybe he's the source?

                                                                  36


                               LANDY
                     The real question is how you
                     managed to get in a fire fight in
                     the middle of a public train
                     station.

                               VOSEN
                     Don't second guess an operation
                     from an armchair, Pam. It's not
                     fair.

                               LANDY
                     I'm going to the office now.
                     I'll make my own introductions.

       Off VOSEN...


125    EXT.   DAY.    ATOCHA TRAIN STATION -- MADRID                    125

       AN AVE train pulling into the vast station. BOURNE stepping
       out, walking up the platform.

       Moving out through the station...


125A   INT. DAY -- CRI HUB                                          125A

       TWO NEW TECHS plus the three we met before.       All watching
       VOSEN lead LANDY and CRONIN into the room.

                               WILLS
                     This is Pamela Landy. She's
                     gonna be quarterbacking our
                     search effort. I think what we
                     oughta do, just to get started,
                     let's go around the room, say who
                     you are and what your spec is.

       LANDY stepping in before this gets going --

                               LANDY
                     Let's do names later.
                     (she's got the floor)
                     What's Bourne's last fixed
                     position?
                     (impatient)
                     Anybody.

                                TECH#3
                     London.   Twelve hundred Zulu.

                                LANDY
                     Status?   Wounded?   Armed?

                                 TECH#2
                     Alive.    Mobile. Unknown.

                                                              37


                             LANDY
                   Where are your grids coming from?

                             TECH#1
                   NSA Tactical.

                             LANDY
                   You have an Echelon package?

                                TECH#1
                   Yes.

                             LANDY
                   Why isn't it on?

                             TECH#1
                   We were waiting.

                              LANDY
                   For what?
                       (no takers)
                   You're nine hours behind the
                   toughest target you've ever
                   tracked. I want everyone to sit
                   down, strap in, and turn on all
                   you've got.
                       (beat)
                   That would mean now.

       That lights it.    They're moving.

                                LANDY (CONT'D)
                   Thank you.

       VOSEN watches...

                             LANDY (CONT'D)
                   I want everything you've got on
                   Ross on screen one.

       LANDY watches as the screen lights up with ROSS
       information...


125B   EXT. DAY.   SEWELL AND MARBURY -- MADRID                125B

       Bourne arrives, begins to recon the area.

       He goes to the front door finds "Sewell and Marbury" and
       rings the bell. No answer. Two cops come around a corner.

       Bourne sees them, notes the side of the building and
       leaves.

                                                       38


125E   INT. DAY.   CRI HUB -- NEW YORK CITY             125E

                              TECH#1
                   Sir, we just hacked Ross's email
                   account at the Guardian and found
                   a round trip ticket to Turin,
                   yesterday. 0800 arrival, 12:05
                   departure.

                             LANDY
                   I think we can be pretty certain
                   that Bourne's not your source
                   then?

                             VOSEN
                   How?

                             LANDY
                   Ross's call to his editor, where
                   he said he just met the source on
                   Blackbriar, took place just after
                   his flight landed. His met his
                   source in Turin.

                             VOSEN
                   So?

                             LANDY
                   So, what, Bourne met Ross for
                   breakfast and then, at noon the
                   same day Bourne calls Ross to
                   demand a meet at Waterloo?

                             CRONIN
                       (Needling Wills)
                   Maybe they were even on the same
                   flight?

                             VOSEN
                   Cross check the secure cell phone
                   usage of everyone with Blackbriar
                   SCI clearance against all calls
                   in and out of Turin during the
                   morning Ross was there

       TECHNICIANS start pounding keyboards.

                             LANDY
                   The guy you're after is a CIA
                   operative with clearance above
                   Top Secret.   He was committing
                   treason by talking to Ross.   Do
                   you really think, while doing
                   that, he used a cell phone he
                   knows we can track?

                             TECH 3 (JIMMY)
                   Zero results on the cross check.

                                                       39


VOSEN stares daggers at her.

                    WILLS
          Do you have a better idea?

                    LANDY
          Yeah, I'd look at all the people
          whose cell phones were switched
          off the entire period Ross was in
          Turin.

                    WILLS
          Do it Jimmy.

TECHNICIANS start tapping.

                    LANDY
              (looks at Cronin)
          I mean if your people use their
          cell phones as much as mine do,
          the list should be pretty small

                    TECHNICIAN 3 JIMMY
          Three names: Tom Brewster, Jack
          Boulin, Neal Daniels.

The names display on the screen:   Tom Brewster, Jack Boulin
Neal Daniels.

The HUB employees can't help but be impressed by LANDY.
WILLS and VOSEN notice their response.

                    LANDY
          Now check everything in Ross's
          apartment against those names.
          Look for common patterns, look
          for -

                    CRONIN
          Initials .....Bring that up on
          main.

LANDY turns.   CRONIN is leaning down in front of a
computer screen.   Point to something for the tech --- who
puts it on the big screen, blown up.

In a set of handwritten notes by ROSS it says "per
N.D."next to several scrawls.

                    LANDY
          Neal Daniels.   He's Station
          Chief in Madrid now, isn't he?

                    WILLS
          Jesus Christ.

                                                                40


                            VOSEN
                  Call the RSO at the Embassy and
                  have them take Daniels into
                  custody if he's there.   If he's
                  not, get a grab team to the
                  Calle Norte safe house. Send
                  them in heavy and tell them we'll
                  assist with entry.

                            LANDY
                  "Heavy?" Daniels isn't--

                            VOSEN
                  I'm worried about Bourne. If he's
                  not Ross's source, then he must
                  be after Ross's source -- just
                  like us.

       Off LANDY...


125F   EXT.   MADRID STREETS -- NIGHT                             125F

       BOURNE in a TAXI turning a corner into a narrow street.
       The rain has slowed, but the streets are still quiet.

       BOURNE gets out and walks past the SEWELL and MARBURY front
       door, picks the lock and gains entry.


126B   INT.   SEWELL AND MARBURY. -- NIGHT                        126B

       BOURNE up the stairs.   Finds the office.    Jimmies the door.
       Disables the alarm.

       All the signs of a hurried exit. A half filled cup of
       coffee -- cigarette burned down in an ashtray but not
       snubbed out -- a light left on -- files and documents, some
       shredded, some not.


127H   INT. HUB                                                   127H

       Vosen paces back and forth. The hub is MUCH quieter than
       it was in the Waterloo scenes.

                            TECH 1. (LUCY)
                  Parque Vasquez is clean. No sign
                  of subject.

127A   EXT.   MADRID STREETS -- NIGHT                           127A

       A BLACK CAR moving briskly through traffic and --


127A   INT.   MOVING BLACK CAR -- NIGHT                         127A

       HAMMOND at the wheel.   KILEY with the map. Shutting off his
       phone.


127B   INT.   SEWELL AND MARBURY -- NIGHT                       127B

       BOURNE checks the office.   Soon he finds a photo of
       Daniels with Albert Hirsch.


FB3    EXT. HOSPITAL ANNEX -- OVERCAST DAY -- FLASHBACK            FB3

       Bourne arrives at a nondescript steel door with two CCTV
       cameras covering it. He sees 415 written above the door.

       Bourne struggles wildly at first. Tries to get out of his

       edge of the tank. Perhaps also on monitors.
       Expressionless.


FB3F   UNDERWATER SHOT - FLASHBACK                                 FB3F

                 You're going to drown. There is

                 this. Stop struggling and accept
                 it.


       Finally Bourne can't hold his breath for an instant longer.
       His mouth opens. Water rushes in. He convulses, begins to
       drown...

       KILEY gestures to a light moving under a door.

       Kiley crouching...leaning in...hand on the knob, and --

       Pulls the closet DOOR OPEN --

       Nothing. Sink, dishes. a small kitchen.         And... on the
       stove...a tea kettle and a spoon...

       Which is the last thing they'll remember, because...

       BOURNE -- coming around the corner fast -- full stop and --

       BOURNE lays out HAMMOND... KILEY turns to find BOURNE --
       who takes him out too.

       Then it stops.

       BOURNE yanks the headsets.       Closes the PHONE.

       The hub scrambles to answer that...       Landy paces in the
       background. Suspicious of Vosen...

                                                             45

       ON A SECURITY MONITOR -- BOURNE sees another figure moving
       up the stairs...Checking his watch, reloading his gun.
       Twisting into the path to shoot as the door opens,
       hesitating because-

       It's NICKY.

       A beat -- long unbroken.

                              BOURNE
                    What are you doing here?

                              NICKY
                    I was posted here after Berlin.

                              BOURNE
                    Where's Daniels?

       The office PHONE goes. Bourne waving her to it.   She picks
       it up. He hits the speaker phone.


127H   INT. HUB                                                127H

                              NICKY (V.O.)
                    Hello.

                              VOSEN
                    Who is this?

                              NICKY (V.O.)
                    This is Nicky Parsons. Who's
                    this?

       Landy reacts to her voice...

       Both Vosen and Landy strongly suspect Bourne is there and
       listening...

       Vosen reads her "Duress Challenge" identity check off the
       screen. It reads:

       Challenge:    "Sparrow"

       Response if Under Duress:       "Ruby"

       Response if Normal:    "Everest"

                                                      46


                     VOSEN
          Nicky, I need to do an ID
          challenge first. Code in:
          "Sparrow."

Vosen looks at the screen to check her response...

                    NICKY
          Response: "Everest".

                    VOSEN
          Nicky, this is Noah Vosen. How
          long have you been on site?

                    NICKY (V.O.)
          I just walked in.

                    VOSEN
          We have two officers on site.
          Are you in contact with them?

                    NICKY (V.O.)
          They're down. Unconscious, but
          alive.

                    VOSEN
          Is there any sign of Daniels?

                    NICKY (V.O.)
          No.

                    LANDY
          Nicky, this is Pam Landy. We
          have reason to believe there is a
          connection between Neal Daniels
          and Jason Bourne.

                    NICKY (V.O.)
          Bourne, are you still looking for
          Bourne? I thought the case was
          closed.

                    LANDY
          No, some people are convinced
          he's still a threat. I disagree
          but to find out I need to talk to
          him.

VOSEN seething because LANDY has interrupted him...

                    VOSEN
          Hold on Nicky.

Vosen hits the mute button.

                    VOSEN
          What are you doing? You know
          Bourne's probably listening.

                                                              47


        Landy doesn't answer.    Vosen to Wills:

                             VOSEN
                   How long till back up arrives.

        Wills holds up three fingers.      Vosen unmutes.

                             VOSEN (CONT'D)
                       (into microphone again)
                   Listen, Nicky. I want you to
                   stay put and secure the premises.
                   It could be an hour until another
                   team arrives.

        LANDY piercing VOSEN with a look...


138     INT. SAFEHOUSE - NIGHT                                     138

        BOURNE continues to hold the gun in her face -- NICKY is
        very calm considering the predicament she is in.

                               NICKY
                   Okay.

        DIAL TONE as the line gets closed at the other end.

                             NICKY
                   They know you're here.

                             BOURNE
                   How long do I have?

                             NICKY
                   Three minutes...

                   My car's outside.    I know where
                   Daniels is.

        BOURNE lowers his gun, grabs the phone and dials "1-1-2"

                                                             48

       BOURNE answers her in perfect Spanish with a perfect Madrid
       accent, but worked up, like a civilian would be...

                            BOURNE (SUBTITLE)
                  334 Calle Norte. I hear gunfire.
                  And men shouting. I think
                  they're Americans --

       BOURNE pushes the phone off the desk -- fires four shots
       into the ceiling -- calmly moves Nicky towards the back
       door...

                  You "disagree" he's a threat? He
                  just took out two more of my men.
                  Not to mention his ultimatum to
                  Ellatrache?

                            LANDY
                  The only way this has a happy
                  ending, Noah, is if we find a way
                  to bring Bourne in voluntarily.

                            VOSEN
                  He wants revenge, Pam. The only
                  realistic way to deal with this
                  is to eliminate the threat.


139    INT. NIGHT.   BACKSTAIRS                                   139

       BOURNE and NICKY rapidly descend.

                            BOURNE
                  Okay, where is Daniels headed?

                            NICKY
                  8 o'clock this morning, he wired
                  $100,000. to a numbered bank
                  account in Tangier.

                            BOURNE
                  Okay, Tangier is about 300 miles
                  away, we can make the morning
                  ferry.

                            NICKY
                  And then what?

                                                                   49

        tires squealing nearby.

                             NICKY
                   They're coming.

        They continue to walk down the street towards Nicky's car.

        Vosen and Landy are watching this live.


        As they cross the street two MADRID POLICE CARS come around
        the corner the wrong way and screech to a stop.

        Vosen reacts...

        More sirens closing in.      A third police car appears.
        Then a fourth...

        The agents drop their guns and surrender.

        BOURNE and NICKY continue around a corner -- they get in
        her VW GOLF and drive away...

       VOSEN on the phone.

                           VOSEN
                 We lost Bourne.

                           KRAMER
                 You still think he's after
                 Daniels?

                           VOSEN
                 Yeah. Nicky's just the means.
                 But if we find Daniels, we'll
                 find Bourne.

                           KRAMER
                 Daniels knows way too much.
                 Daniels knows everything. We
                 can't let them meet.

                           VOSEN
                 I'll take care of it.

                            KRAMER
                 Good.
                     (beat)
                 And fill Hirsch in.     Just in
                 case.


R145   INT. NIGHT. TRUCK STOP -- SPAIN                            R145

       BOURNE and NICKY sit over coffee.    A long silence...then:

                           NICKY
                 What are you after, Jason?   Why
                 are you looking for Daniels?

                           BOURNE
                 Do you know who this is?

       Bourne puts the photo of Daniels and Hirsch on the table
       between them.    She looks at the photo, points.

                           NICKY
                 That's Daniels.
                     (points at Hirsch)
                 I don't know who that is.

                           BOURNE
                 I have to get back to the
                 beginning...or I'll never be free
                 of this.

                              NICKY
                 Who is he?

                                                                 51


                              BOURNE
                   I think he started Treadstone.    I
                   remember meeting him.   I
                   remember the first day...
                       (beat)
                   Daniels brought me to him.

       Nicky looks back at him....not sure what to say.

                             NICKY
                   What happened?

                             BOURNE
                   An initiation...I guess...


FB3B   FLASHBACK                                                     FB3B

       QUICK FLASH: Bourne, head in sack, is held underwater,
       struggling desperately for breath--


R145   INT. NIGHT. TRUCK STOP -- SPAIN                               R145

       Bourne comes out of the flashback.      Nicky is looking at
       him....

                             NICKY
                   Jason...that wasn't some one-off
                   initiation. Daniels said they
                   did that to you over and over
                   again.   That's how they...

       She doesn't finish.    And Bourne doesn't ask her to.     Just
       a long pause.

                             BOURNE
                   Why are you helping me?

                             NICKY
                   It was difficult for me...with
                   you.

       BOURNE looks up.    Another long pause...

                             NICKY (CONT'D)
                   You really don't remember
                   anything?

                             BOURNE
                   No.

       NICKY'S face.

       Two SPANISH COPS enter the cafe.

                             BOURNE (CONT'D)
                   We should move.

                                                            52


       They get up and leave...

                    Noah Vosen.

       Then he puts his thumb into a print reader. The safe door
       pops open. He pulls out a file marked "Top Secret."


145B   INT. DAY.    LANDY'S OFFICE -- CRI                     145B

       CRONIN makes his way down the hallway.

       LANDY works at her desk.       CRONIN enters...

                              CRONIN
                    They tracked Daniels' passport to
                    a hotel in Tangier. They're
                    holding up a bank transfer he
                    made to keep him in place while
                    they move an asset in from
                    Casablanca.

       Off LANDY.    This just keeps getting worse...


145C   INT. VOSEN'S OFFICE                                    145C

       Landy enters without knocking.

                              LANDY
                    Since when do you have
                    authorization for lethal action
                    against Daniels?

                              VOSEN
                    Since he cleaned out a Blackbriar
                    safe and fled to Morocco!

                              LANDY
                    So grab him--

                              VOSEN
                    I don't have the people on the
                    ground to do that and I'm not
                    going to risk that file falling
                    into the wrong hands.

                              LANDY
                    What's going on?    What's Daniels
                    got?

                                                            53


                          VOSEN
                What's he got? He ran all of
                Blackbriar's operations in
                Southern Europe and North Africa.

                          LANDY
                I think the world's well aware we
                have a rendition and lethal
                action capability at this point,
                Noah.

                          VOSEN
                For Christ's sake, Pam, he's got
                our entire playbook. Names,
                dates, ghost sites, how we train
                our assets.....

                          LANDY
                You still don't have the
                authority to kill him.

                          VOSEN
                Oh, yes I do, Pam.

      Vosen holds up the file we saw him pull out of his safe.
      It is labeled "Blackbriar: Lethal Action Protocol."

                           VOSEN
                That's what makes us special. No
                red tape. No more getting
                badguys in our sights and then
                watching them escape while we
                wait for some bureaucrat to issue
                the order.

      Landy opens up the file. Sees the words "instantaneous
      lethal action is authorized when..."

                          LANDY
                You just decide? No oversight.
                No checks and balances.

                           VOSEN
                Come on, Pam, you've seen the raw
                intel. You know how real the
                threat is.    We can't afford to
                have our hands tied like that
                anymore.

                  If you stop Desh they'll just get
                  someone else.

                  We're not going to stop him.
                  We're going to follow him. He'll

                  Sir, we have an unauthorized
                  breach. Someone with active

                  It comes from a computer
                  belonging to Nicky Parsons.

       VOSEN looks over at Landy....his wheels turning.   A series
       of cuts between them.

          I'm asking on what basis you're
          continuing this operation.

                    VOSEN
          On the basis that Nicky Parsons
          has compromised a covert
          operation. She is up to her neck
          in it.

          This is about Daniels, not Nicky!

          She has betrayed us!

          She's in league with Jason Bourne
          for Chrissake!

          You don't have the authority to
          kill her or Bourne!

          Yes, I do Pam, it's right here

       DESH parks the motorbike and walks around the corner,
       BOURNE follows.

       DANIELS' car coming down the street.     BOURNE stops and sees
       the car -- realizes the danger.

       BOURNE turns back to see DESH with the detonator in his
       hand.

       BOURNE locks eyes with DESH.      Before BOURNE can react --
       DESH detonates.

       BOOM! DANIELS is DEAD.

                                                         61


BOURNE is thrown across the street by the blast.     He lays
MOTIONLESS.

DESH POV. He looks back to see BOURNE not moving, lying in
the street.

DESH gets on his motorbike and heads off to kill NICKY.

crowds. In Desh's sights.                                        *

BOURNE knows he has to gain more ground.                         *

CABLE CAM shot - Two trained assassins leaping across the        *
narrow streets - silently effortlessly -- the cops down          *
below searching the alleyways, oblivious to the chase            *
unfolding above them.                                            *

BOURNE nearly on terms with him - then --                        *

DESH dipping down again into the street below.       Avoiding    *
the police -- he melts into the crowds.                          *

STEADYCAM SHOT - following BOURNE as he heads downstairs.        *
More stairs. Through a corridor then a courtyard -               *
bursting out of a door into the street -                         *

A police checkpoint. Right in his path.     Bourne forced to     *
dog leg and take another route.                                  *

BOURNE'S lost him- for the moment.                               *


EXT.   RUE DE CHRETIENS -- CONTINUOUS                            *

NICKY - walking fast up the Rue des Chretiens.       Wondering   *
why there are so many police around.                             *

Suddenly stopping - seeing DESH - knows instantly that he        *
is coming for her.                                               *

Now we see NICKY'S skills.    Has to think on her fee t-         *
TREADSTONE MINDSET --                                            *

Checking the alleyways.     Slipping out of sight.               *

NICKY looking to the rooftops -- taking the advantage.      Up   *
some steps -- into a riad.                                       *

Desh tracking her.                                               *


EXT.   RUE DE CHRETIENS -- CONTINUOUS                            *

BOURNE seeing Desh again - further up the street.      Heading   *
in that direction.                                               *


INT.   RIAD -- CONTINUOUS                                        *

NICKY through one hallway - then another.    Moving up all       *
the time.                                                        *

                                                         65


EXT.   RIAD -- CONTINUOUS                                        *

DESH arriving at the steps. Looks up to where Nicky is           *
going. Takes the entrance to the next building.                  *
Anticipates her next move. Aiming to cut her off.                *


EXT.   RIAD ROOFTOP                                              *

NICKY up steps.    Out onto the rooftops.   Looking for a path   *
across them.                                                     *

Scrabbling across the roof of this crumbling riad.    Knows      *
she can't go back down.                                          *

She makes it across to the next building.                        *

Where Desh is...                                                 *


EXT.   ANOTHER ROOFTOP -- CONTINUOUS                             *

BOURNE up high.    Seeing NICKY on that other roof.              *

He can't get across to her.    Moving fast now.                  *

Down steps.   Into the riad courtyard.                           *


INT. RIAD                                                        *

BOURNE entering the hallway.                                     *

Moving up the stairs.   Towards Nicky.                           *

And towards Desh.                                                *

Meanwhile NICKY moving down. Looking out into the                *
courtyard below. The sound of POLICE getting nearer.             *

BOURNE hearing the POLICE too as he moves up onto a              *
landing.                                                         *

                                                                 *

BOURNE into a main room - something stirring on a couch - a      *
girl and her little sister having a siesta.                      *

In another room two small boys fast asleep.    TV playing.       *
One wakes.                                                       *

A noise on the stairs above. Quickly arranging a mirror -        *
getting line of sight - Bourne dipping into a corner.            *

It's NICKY.                                                      *

She gives him a look -- DESH is in here somewhere.               *

                                                         66


The door goes below them.   The noise of Police entering the   *
Riad.                                                          *

NICKY signalling to BOURNE - this way.                         *

They climb narrow stairs to the next floor.                    *

Down below Police begin searching rooms. Waking the            *
sleeping family. Shouting, crying. Commotion.                  *


INT./EXT. -- NARROW STAIRWELL                                  *

BOURNE and NICKY creeping up the steps.                        *

Then - suddenly NICKY spinning round as two silenced           *
bullets speed past her - And DESH bursting out of a landing    *
toilet.                                                        *

On to Bourne.                                                  *

Full on Treadstone fighting in the narrow stairwell.           *

Crashing into a tiny disused lift cage- silent constrained-    *
vicious.                                                       *

Downstairs a young POLICEMAN hears the noise- heading for      *
the lift.                                                      *

NICKY seeing the handle turn. Thinking quickly.   She sends    *
the lift up to the next floor.                                 *

The POLICEMAN stepping back from the door -- directing the     *
other cops out to the courtyard.                               *

People are spilling out into the atrium.   It's pandemonium.   *


EXT.   ROOFTOP -- CONTINUOUS                                   *

Bourne and Desh spill out of the elevator and onto the         *
roof.                                                          *

BOURNE kicking the gun - spinning across the floor - he and    *
DESH facing each other.                                        *

DESH with BOURNE - straight over the edge.                     *

DESH still on top - just.                                      *

A brutal exchange. Matching each other's moves like            *
shadows.                                                       *

Relentless. Rolling - falling onto another roof level.         *

And another.                                                   *

                                                                 67


       The two men tiring now. DESH grabbing for the bag.     The            *
       pills. BOURNE kicking them away.                                      *

       BOURNE has the upper hand now.      DESH'S reaction's slowing.        *
       No longer the match he was.                                           *

       BOURNE drags him to the ground.     He's finished.   Bourne's         *
       won.                                                                  *

       DESH- shivering -- convulsing.                                        *

       In the struggle, BOURNE strangles Desh.

194    BOURNE and NICKY hide DESH's body.                              194

                             BOURNE
                   Alright, we need to be dead.    You
                   need to code that in.

       NICKY CODES into DESH'S PDA -- BOTH OBJECTIVES
       ACHIEVED...In the CRI HUB the message comes up...VOSEN and
       LANDY believe NICKY and BOURNE are both DEAD...


196A   INT. DAY. HUB -- CRI -- NEW YORK                             196A

       The code from DESH remains on screen -- BOTH OBJECTIVES
       ACHIEVED -- like an EPITAPH for BOURNE and NICKY...VOSEN
       packs his briefcase. Turns to WILLS.

                             VOSEN
                   I want to be sure. Have the
                   station chief in Rabat confirm
                   the deaths and do a sub-rosa
                   check...And keep and eye on
                   Landy.

       Off WILLS...


197A   INT. DAY.   LANDY'S OFFICE -- DAY                            197A

       Cronin enters.

                             CRONIN
                   The hub just got word Bourne and
                   Nicky are dead.

       Landy looks at him.

                                LANDY
                   Confirmed?

                                CRONIN
                   Not yet.

       Landy looks away...thinking.      Wheels turning.

                                                                  68


                             LANDY
                   Get me a copy of Bourne's
                   personnel file.


195A    EXT. DUSK. PENSIONE                                        195A

        Bourne and Nicky enter.


198A    INT. DUSK PENSIONE -- WASHROOM -- TANGIER                  198A

        BOURNE scrubs the blood from his hands.    REVEAL Nicky
        watching him from the bedroom.


197     INT. DUSK. LANDY'S OFFICE (LONELY LANDY)                       197

        Landy sits at her desk reviewing files on Treadstone. Open
        on her desk we see the file she will be looking at in the
        Supremacy phone call.

        The way she examines the papers we get the sense she thinks
        something is missing, some piece, some file.


198A    INT. DUSK. PENSIONE -- WASHROOM                            198A

        Bourne scrubbing the blood from his hands. Nicky comes in,
        touches his shoulder. There's a tenderness to it, a re-
        assurance. For a moment it looks like Bourne might
        react...but the moment passes....


197     INT. DUSK. LANDY'S OFFICE (LONELY LANDY)                       197

        Landy opens a new file.   Bourne's operations.


198A    INT. DUSK. PENSIONE -- WASHROOM                            198A

        Bourne is toweling off.

                             BOURNE
                   I can see all their faces. But I
                   can't remember any names....


197     INT. DUSK. LANDY'S OFFICE (LONELY LANDY)                       197

        Landy looks at Bourne's kills. The faces Bourne remembers.
        But there names are here, and who they were, why they were
        killed.


198AC   INT.   NIGHT.   PENSIONE -- BEDROOM/SITTING ROOM          198AC

        Bourne and Nicky sitting together.

                                                                  69


                            BOURNE
                  I was starting to remember who
                  they were...in India...with
                  Marie.

       A beat.

                             NICKY
                  It's just going to lead to more
                  killing, Jason. Are you sure you
                  want that?

       Bourne takes her words in.    But who he is is eating him
       alive from the inside...

                            BOURNE
                  I've killed people and I've tried
                  to apologize for what I've done,
                  for what I am. None of it makes
                  it better...

       Another moment passes between them...then:

                            BOURNE
                  They're going to come for you
                  again. You are going to have to
                  run now.

       She gets up.


198    INT. BATHROOM                                                   198

       Nicky dies her hair BLACK.    Starts cutting it shorter.


199    EXT.   NIGHT.   TANGIER BUS STATION                             199

       Bourne walks with a now dark-haired Nicky. They exchange
       looks for a long beat. She turns towards the bus.

                            BOURNE
                  It gets easier.


197    INT. LANDY'S OFFICE. NIGHT                                      197

       Landy finds a denotation in Bourne's file that he was
       "recruited to Treadstone by Neal Daniels."   Further down
       the   page it says "Bourne was inducted into Treadstone at
       the Special Research Department facility at 415 E 71st,
       New York, NY."    Then "Facility closed by order of
       Director, June 2002."

198C   INT. TANGIER MORGUE                                         198C

       Bourne looks at the tattered remains of Daniels' body and
       belongings.

                                                              70


        He goes through his briefcase and finds a nearly destroyed
        piece of paper with "Noah Vosen - Director of Operations -
        CRI" written on it. Bourne slips the morgue attendant a
        bribe.


198DA   INT. VOSEN'S OFFICE -- DAY                                198DA

        Vosen is shaving.

                            WILLS
                  Station chief in Rabat just
                  called, they found a body.
                  Bourne?

                               VOSEN
                  Desh.


198DB   INT. AIRPLANE -- DAY                                      198DB

        On final approach to JFK. Bourne looks out the window to
        see the Verizano Narrows bridge.   And beyond it,
        Manhattan.   Bourne is coming home.


A202    EXT. NEW YORK                                             A202

200     INT. LANDY'S OFFICE. DAY                                   200

                            CRONIN
                  Pam, You need to see this.

        Landy follows CRONIN into--


201     INT. CRONIN'S OFFICE -- DAY                                201

        BOURNE'S PASSPORT is displayed on the computer monitor.

                            CRONIN (CONT'D)
                  This passport just cleared
                  Immigration at JFK ten minutes
                  ago. It's an early Treadstone
                  identity registered to Jason
                  Bourne but he never used it and
                  it never went to the grid.
                  Bourne's alive.

                            LANDY
                  They don't know.

                            CRONIN
                  No, if they knew Vosen wouldn't
                  be in his office right now.

       Bourne moves through the airport.

                           LANDY (O.S.)
                 It's a hell of a risk.

                           CRONIN (O.S.)
                 Yeah. Maybe Bourne wants us to
                 know, just like Naples, maybe
                 he's communicating.


201    INT. CRONIN'S OFFICE                                       201

                           CRONIN
                 Maybe he's trying to communicate
                 with you.

                           LANDY
                 Maybe we should communicate back.
                 Because I think I know what
                 Bourne's looking for.


202    SERIES OF SHOTS                                            202

       Bourne over the 59th Street Bridge -- arrives at CRI --
       goes into the adjacent building --


202A   INT. OFFICE BUILDING ACROSS FROM CRI -- DAY               202A

       Bourne uses his monocular to zoom in on a file Vosen is
       looking at -- he sees the word "Blackbriar." Vosen puts
       the file back in the safe.


203    INT. DAY. LANDY'S OFFICE -- CRI -- NEW YORK                203

                Get in here! Bourne called
                Landy!

      Vosen jumps up, sprints toward the hub--

                          BOURNE (V.O.)
                Is that official?

                          VOSEN (OVERLAPPING)
                Are we triangulating?!

                           LANDY (V.O.)
                No. Off the record. You know
                how it is.

       Wills walks over to Vosen. The look in his eye indicates
       that he thinks there's something odd about this:

                            WILLS
                  Landy just left the building.

       Vosen looks at Wills.... A beat, Vosen's suspicion
       building, though he can't quite put his finger on what he
       suspects...

                            VOSEN

       of clear plastic. Again we can't tell what's going on.

                           VOSEN
                 Noah Vosen.

                           BOURNE (V.O.)
                 This is Jason Bourne.

       VOSEN reels for a beat. Then quickly scans the streets,
       trying to see if he can spot BOURNE.

                           VOSEN
                 How did you get this number?

                           BOURNE (V.O.)
                 You didn't actually think I was
                 coming to Tudor City, did you?

                           VOSEN
                 No, I guess not. But if it's me
                 you want to talk to maybe we can
                 arrange a meet.

                           BOURNE (V.O.)
                 Where are you right now?

                           VOSEN
                 In my office.

                                                                   79


                               BOURNE (V.O.)
                     I doubt that. If you were in
                     your office--


233    INT. VOSEN'S OFFICE -- DAY                                       233

       REVEAL that BOURNE is inside VOSEN'S office.

                               BOURNE
                     We'd be having this conversation
                     face-to-face.

       BOURNE hangs up. Puts a portable dictaphone up to VOSEN'S
       SAFE and his play:

                     Noah Vosen.

       As he places the plastic slide we saw in the ECUs into the
       fingerprint reader. The safe pops open--


234    INT.   DAY.    VOSEN SUV                                         234

       VOSEN stunned....     Is it possible?   Is it a trick?


233    INT. DAY.     VOSEN'S OFFICE                                     233

       From the safe, BOURNE scoops out the "TREADSTONE:
       Blackbriar" folder Bourne saw Vosen putting into his safe."

       He flips it open. He scans down the page.         His eye
       stopping at the words "US Citizen."

       He flips to another page -- another photo, and again "US
       Citizen."

       BOURNE shoves the folders in his backpack and leaves.

       CAMERA BEGINS TO CRANE UP...

       BOURNE walks around a corner near CRI. He hears a siren
       turn on a few blocks away. Then another.   He starts to
       run.


240    INT. CRONIN'S CAR -- DAY                                   240

       A SEDAN pulls to a stop as a door comes open. CRONIN'S
       inside.   REVEAL Landy on the sidewalk. She jumps in.

                           LANDY

240B    INT. CRI CAR -- DAY                                          240B

        The passenger side agent sees BOURNE, points--

        BOURNE cuts to the south side of the road so the passenger-
        side agent doesn't have a shot, while controlling the car
        makes it almost impossible for the driver to fire
        accurately.


240C    EXT. 41 STREET -- DAY                                        240C

        The westbound car cuts sharply and drives up on the
        sidewalk. But Bourne is too fast. He's already past them.
        The passenger side agent jumps out. But he's still got to
        get around the door and then move a few steps to get a bead
        over the hood of his car on Bourne.

        The other CRI car races the wrong way on the street but
        gets immobilized and trapped by the onrushing tunnel
        traffic.

242C    EXT. MIDTOWN WEST -- DAY                                     242C

        Bourne races through the tunnel traffic and onto 40th
        street.   He rushes east toward the spaghetti of concrete
        ramps leading into and out of Port Authority.

                                                             82


       He runs across 10th Avenue as a third CRI car screams up
       the street at him.

       Bourne runs up a one lane outgoing ramp.

       The driver pilots his car up the ramp behind Bourne. He
       jams the accelerator down.   He'll be on top of Bourne --
       running him over -- in seconds--


260    EXT. PORT AUTHORITY -- DAY                                  260

       A New Jersey-bound bus exits the complex and heads around
       the corner of the ramp -- it skids to a stop when it sees
       Bourne and the CRI car giving chase heading right at the
       bus.


260A   INT. CRI CAR -- DAY                                        260A

       The driver has to skid to a stop to avoid hitting the bus.
       Bourne slides between the side of the bus and concrete
       guard rail.   The driver calls it in--


261    SERIES OF SHOTS                                             261

       Cops and CRI cars close in on Port Authority.   One agent
       jumps out of his car on 8th Avenue and rushes for the
       stairs.

                                                               83

                perimeter on Port Authority--


262   EXT. ROOFTOP PARKING LOT -- PORT AUTHORITY                    262

      Bourne races up a set of stairs the rooftop parking lot.
      He surveys every aspect of his environment on the fly
      (which includes his taking a quick peak over the concrete
      railing at the east end of the roof.

      Next Bourne rushes toward the parked cars. Smashes the
      window of one to set off its alarm.   Then a second and a
      third, setting off their alarms.

      The fourth window Bourne smashes in doesn't set off an
      alarm. Bourne pulls the door open and climbs in.

      Inside the car Bourne reaches under the dash and yanks
      handful of wires off the steering column and starts to
      expertly hotwire the car.

264   SERIES OF SHOTS                                               264

      Agents race up stairwells.   Two CRI cars careen up the
      ramp to the passenger parking (a separate ramp to the bus
      ramp we saw Bourne on earlier.) A third CRI car races
      through the parking level just below the roof and up the
      circular ramp to the roof.

                He's on the roof.   He's trapped.


      EXT. ROOFTOP PARKING LOT -- PORT AUTHORITY

      Bourne works to hotwire the car.

      A CRI car gets to the roof.   Two agents come from the
      elevator lobby.   The three car alarms distract them. They
      search for Bourne, but can't find him at first...

      Bourne gets the car engine on - but, given the wonders of
      modern anti-theft technology his steering wheel is still
      locked.

                                                                84


      A second CRI car arrives.

      Bourne slams the car into low gear and backs up at high
      speed.

      He smashes into the car across the aisle from him. With a
      sharp metallic snap the wheel in Bourne's car is suddenly
      free, he jams the car into drive pulls out into lane and
      stops.

      Three CRI cars here now. Two head straight for him.   A
      third blocks the exit ramp.

      Bourne checks the rearview and sees two more agents pour
      from the elevator lobby, one carrying the serious firepower
      of an M-4 (an M-16 variant whose bullets can penetrate
      metal and concrete). They move into position to get a bead
      on him.

      Bourne assesses. But he doesn't move. The agents swarm
      toward him. What the hell is he doing? Why is he waiting?


267   INT. VOSEN'S SUV -- DAY                                        267

                          TACTICAL TEAM LEADER
                We've got him! He's got nowhere
                to run!

                          VOSEN
                Take him out!


268   EXT. ROOFTOP PARKING LOT -- PORT AUTHORITY                     268

      The agents clear their obstructions and drop their barrels
      toward Bourne--

      But before they can get a bead--

      Bourne slams the car into reverse again.   Petal to the
      metal in reverse--

      The agents open fire.

      Bourne ducks the lead slugs ripping through the windshield.
      But there's no dodging the shower of broken glass.

      As Bourne disappears below the dashboard, the CRI agent
      adjusts his fire into the car's grill.

      Virtually blind, Bourne races the hard-pressed vehicle
      backwards as the agent's fire decimates the car's
      driveline.

      Bourne slips the car into neutral and takes a quick peek
      behind him.

                                                            85


      Steers still speeding but quickly dying car towards a small
      gap between two parked cars at the edge of the parking
      structure.

      Bourne's car splits the gap between the parked cars, hits
      the base of a low angled wall that slams the back of his
      car up and over the wall.

      Bourne is pounded as his car jounces onto the wall, a
      second later the front end seesaws over the top, the sudden
      angle change exposes for an instant the bottom of Bourne's
      car, to the shooters.

      Several rounds rip through the floorboard and tear past
      Bourne's head just before his car drops upside down for 25
      feet and slams onto a row of parked cars.

      The impact rips Bourne from the seat and slams him hard
      against the roof.

      Bourne struggles out of the car, knowing he has only a
      moment before the armed agents will fire down into his over-
      turned car.

                           CRI AGENT
                 Ho-ly shit!

270   EXT. ROOFTOP PARKING LOT -- PORT AUTHORITY                  270

      The CRI agents race to the spot where Bourne's car
      disappeared over the railing and reflexively fire into
      Bourne's car but they're too late! Bourne's already out.
      He disappears from sight under the covered parking
      structure.

        Clearly there is no one down there. Bourne's car jump from
        the roof has completely flat-footed them.

274A    INT/EXT. CIRCULAR RAMP                                    274A

        Two CRI cars race down from the roof to try to get to the
        level Bourne's on.


275     INT./EXT. PARKING GARAGE -- TWO LEVELS BELOW ROOFTOP        275

        Bourne cuts off a guy cruising for a parking space and
        pulls him from his car and races away as the agent from the
        roof lands hard behind him.

        Bourne's race to the exit is cut off as a 3rd CRI sedan
        slides into view and it's occupants open fire on Bourne in
        a head on charge.

        The just stolen vehicle takes heavy fire as Bourne reacts
        instantaneously; thumbing on the cruise control,
        shouldering his door open, and slamming the gas pedal to
        the floor as he dives out of the car.

        The agents react as Bourne's sedan torpedoes them head on.
        Hit hard they're taken out of the fight as metal collapses,
        glass shatters, and airbags explode.

        Bourne tumbles to a stop at the rear of a parked car as his
        car implodes against the oncoming agents.

                                                       87


Instantly Bourne is on his feet, moving between the parked
cars to engage another CRI sedan traveling parallel to the
course of the wrecked one.

The agents in this sedan are distracted by the still
echoing crash and are caught off-guard as Bourne steps out
and points his gun at the driver.

The driver ducks and floors his gas pedal in a desperate
effort to save his own life. As the sedan suddenly
accelerates, Bourne deliberately shifts his aim to the
sedan's front tire and fires.

The tire explodes and the car suddenly veers left and slams
into a parked car, pitching the driver violently against
the unyielding interior of the sedan.

An instant later Bourne rips the radio off the dazed
drivers belt just before he cold cocks him with it.

With the wreck still echoing through the garage Bourne has
to deal with the arrival of the first NYPD sedan.

Bourne takes on the persona of an alarmed witness as the on
edge cop climbs out of his car but Bourne's performance is
cut short as the agent running from his drop from the roof,
arrives and opens fire.

The police officer goes down in the hail of gunfire as
Bourne turns and expertly drops the gunman with a single
shot.

The increasing volume of squealing tires alerts Bourne to a
new threat, he pulls the officer into some cover and grabs
the officer's radio.

                   BOURNE
          10-13. Shots fired. Officer
          down. Port Authority parking
          lot. Level four.

Bourne rips a piece of his sweater off and ties a makeshift
tourniquet for the officer.   Then he hands the cop his
radio back.

                    BOURNE (CONT'D)
          Stay out of sight until one of
          your own arrive.

Bourne disappears.

We pick him up as he jumps into the cops car and guns the
engine and heads for the exits.

CRI agents are confused for a second -- until they pick up
the NYPD car exiting Port Authority on one of the ramps.
But that's all the time Bourne needs--

                                                               88

277    EXT. CROSSTOWN STREET -- DAY                                 277

       Bourne turns on his lights and siren and speeds east,
       followed closely by a CRI sedan.

       As cars yield to Bourne's siren a taxi tries to jump into
       Bourne's wake but a CRI sedan punches the taxi back to the
       right. It ricochets off several parked cars before
       regaining control.

281    EXT. CROSSTOWN STREET -- DAY                                 281

       Bourne struggles to keep his over-matched vehicle ahead of
       the more powerful CRI Sedan which tries to spin Bourne out
       by hitting his bumper.

       Bourne tacks right quickly and barely avoids a stopped car.
       The CRI sedan flanking Bourne's slams into the rear of that
       car, spinning it 180 degrees into the path of the trailing
       CRI sedan which destroys itself in the resulting collision
       and blocks the path of the other CRI sedan.


282    INT. BOURNE'S CAR -- DAY                                     282

       Bourne is home free. He looks around and spots a sign that
       indicates a right turn and says "To Holland Tunnel / US
       95." Bourne turns right--

       Suddenly the window next to his head explodes as two more
       shots rip through his door to tear a jagged wound into the
       top of Bourne's leg.

       REVEAL Paz, his SUV racing along the curb lane. As
       Bourne's car crosses in front of a small car stopped at the
       intersection Paz swerves his car into that car and punches
       it into the side of Bourne's car.

       Bourne's car is knocked spinning, Paz keeps charging
       forward and slams into the back of Bourne's car. With his
       front tires spinning wildly Bourne fights to straighten his
       car as another CRI sedan appears and tries to box Bourne's
       car by sliding into his path.

284    EXT. MANHATTAN STREET -- DAY                                  284

       Bourne just manages to punch his car into the right rear of
       the CRI Sedan and race down the Avenue with Paz and the
       slightly damaged sedan in pursuit.

       Paz gains on him and Bourne is forced to swerve violently
       to deny Paz the kill shot he is all too capable of.

       Just ahead of Bourne, two government SUVs slide into the
       intersection completely blocking his path.

       Bourne instantly spins his car 180 degrees and continues
       on, barreling into the roadblock backwards.

       As Bourne's car plows through the SUV's he whips the wheel
       and his car spins through a reverse 180 as Paz and the
       other sedan race through the wreckage in Bourne's wake.

       Paz and the CRI sedan are all over Bourne as he slides a
       right hand turn onto South St. as Paz and the CRI sedan
       overwhelm Bourne's battered vehicle.


284A   OMITTED                                                    284A


287    INT. BOURNE'S CAR -- DAY                                      287

       On his police radio, Bourne singles out an NYPD officer
       (call sign Alpha-2503) racing toward the intersection just
       ahead.

       Bourne slows, then speeds up quickly to time it right:

       The CRI car almost hits his bumper, then has to accelerate
       through the upcoming intersection. As he does, the cop car
       Bourne was listening to on the radio slams broadside into
       the CRI sedan drafting the bumper of the mangled cop car.

       Swerving wildly Paz avoids the pileup and slams his heavy
       SUV into the back of Bourne's car, pushing him into the
       oncoming traffic.

       Several cars swerve left and right as Paz pushes Bourne
       sideways onto the ramped end of a K-Rail dividing the
       street ahead.

       The nearly upended car grinds down the K-Rail until the
       rear of Bourne's car strikes an obstruction which punches
       it back into the lane as it slams against the front of
       Paz's SUV, knocking the SUV sideways, into a row of parked
       cars.

       Bourne's car hits parked cars on the other side of the
       road.

                   This isn't us, David. What they
                   turned you into, what they're
                   doing with Blackbriar... This
                   has to stop.

                             BOURNE
                   Then stop it. Everything you
                   need is in there.

       Bourne hands her the black bag and enters the hospital.

                             LANDY
                   David... Come in with me. It's
                   better if we do this together.

                             BOURNE
                       (shakes head)
                   This is where it started for me,
                   this is where it ends.

       She watches the doors close behind him....     Landy lets him
       go.


323    EXT. NYC STREETS -- LATE AFTERNOON                            323

       QUICK SHOTS of six different CRI sedans and SUVs rushing
       toward the hospital.


309R   EXT. HOSPITAL -- LATE AFTERNOON                            309R

       Landy looks in the backpack.

       JUMPCUTS:

       --She unzips the backpack and looks in at the the
       Blackbriar Operations File.

       --A cover page inside: "utmost secrecy"... "potentially
       explosive public reaction would jeopardize the program"...

       --Another page: "Terminated" stamped across the photos of
       victims. Next to the victim from the inciting incident,
       the words: "US citizen"...

                                                                95


                           LANDY
                 Oh, my God...

       --A third page, more photos, no "terminated" on these.
       Future victims. "US citizen" stamped next to each one...


310    INT. HOSPITAL -- LATE AFERNOON                                310

       Bourne uses the card reader he took from Vosen's safe to
       enter a "restricted access elevator."   A guard comes.
       Bourne aims his pistol at him as the elevator door closes.


309R   EXT. FIRST AVENUE -- OUTSIDE HOSPITAL --    LATE AFTERNOON 309R

       Landy walks down the street. She looks up to spot two
       black sedans speeding east on 71st, turns south -- two SUVs
       coming up York.   Shit--


323    INT. VOSEN'S SUV -- LATE AFTERNOON                            323

       A block south of the hospital, stuck in traffic, Vosen
       points.

                           VOSEN
                 Landy! Right there!    She's got
                 Bourne's backpack!


310R   INT. 8TH FLOOR ELEVATOR LOBBY -- LATE AFTERNOON            310R

       Bourne flips up the elevator stop button and uses the
       access card to enter a secure corridor--


323    INT. LOBBY -- LATE AFTERNOON                                  323

       Landy runs across the lobby.


323    EXT. FIRST AVENUE -- LATE AFTERNOON                           323

       Vosen's SUV careens to a stop behind a bunch of traffic.
       Still a half block from the entry door but it's close
       enough--


322    INT. CORRRIDOR                                                322

       Bourne rushes down a nondescript corridor--


325    INT. HOSPITAL LOBBY -- LATE AFTERNOON                         325

       Vosen and CRI agents rush into the lobby.

                                                                   96


                             VOSEN
                       (to a group of six
                        agents)
                   I'll find Landy. You get to the
                   training wing and get Bourne!

       A security guard comes over.

                             VOSEN
                   Do you know who I am?
                       (the guard nods)
                   Where's your security room?


324    INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR                                           324

       Landy looks around. Finds an open office. She pushes open
       the door and runs to the fax machine. She starts faxing
       the Blackbriar documents Bourne took from Vosen's safe.


324A   INT. SECURITY ROOM -- LATE AFTERNOON                         324A

       Vosen enters.

                             VOSEN
                   I want to see all your footage
                   for the last three minutes.


322    INT. SRD TRAINING WING (OLD BUILDING OF HOSPITAL) -- LATE 322
       AFTERNOON

       Bourne stares down the corridor from his dreams, the
       corridor Daniels lead him down in his flashback.

       We see Bourne go into--


FBA3   FLASHBACK                                                    FBA3

       That first day, Bourne's POV being led down this corridor
       by Daniels.


322    BACK TO SCENE                                                    322

       Bourne moves down the corridor.


322    INT. SRD TRAINING WING (OLD BUILDING OF HOSPITAL) -- LATE 322
       AFTERNOON

       Bourne reaches the end of the hall.       He looks around
       "flashback style" --

                                                                97


FBB3   FLASHBACK                                                 FBB3

       Bourne was standing at this door....


331    INT. OFFICE -- LATE AFTERNOON                                 331

       Vosen enters the room.    The last pages have been faxed...

                             LANDY
                   You better get a good lawyer.

       She exits...


322    BACK TO SCENE                                                 322

       Then spins, gun up--

       Hirsch is there, halfway down the corridor behind him.

                             HIRSCH
                   Put the gun down. I wouldn't be
                   here if I didn't want to talk.

                              BOURNE
                   I've spent three years running.
                   Three years trying to find out
                   who I was.

       Hirsch moves toward Bourne, completely unfazed by the gun.

                             HIRSCH
                   You still don't have it all back,
                   do you? You haven't filled in
                   all the pieces?

                             BOURNE
                   Let's start with the moment you
                   found out I wouldn't execute
                   Wombosi. The amnesia wasn't the
                   issue, it was the fact that I
                   didn't pull the trigger....

                             HIRSCH
                   One lapse meant your conditioning
                   had failed.

       Bourne grabs Hirsch and slams him against the wall

                             BOURNE
                   It was always you, behind
                   Conklin, behind Abbott.... They
                   were just following orders.

       Bourne grabs Hirsch and pushes him to the wall.   Searches
       him for weapons.

                                                             98


                             HIRSCH
                       (completely calm)
                   I'm unarmed, Jason.

                             BOURNE
                       (shoving Hirsch hard
                        against the wall)
                   "David." I'm David Webb.

       CLOSE ON Bourne's face--

                             HIRSCH
                   You were David Webb, but not
                   anymore.


322    INT. SRD TRAINING WING CORRIDOR -- LATE AFERNOON           322

       Bourne stands with Hirsch.

                              BOURNE
                   Why me?   Why did you pick me?

       A beat...

                               HIRSCH
                   You really don't remember, do
                   you?
                        (beat)
                   You picked us, Jason.

                             BOURNE
                   What does that mean?

                             HIRSCH
                   You volunteered.

       Hirsch uses his free hand to hit the keypad on the wall.
       The "room in use" sign lights up.

       Bourne looks up "flashback style"--


FBA1   FLASHBACK                                                  FBA1

       Bourne remembers that keypad, that "room in use" sign from
       the first day...


322    INT. ROOM WHERE BOURNE FIRST MET HIRSCH                    322

       Bourne and Hirsch enter...

                             HIRSCH
                   You volunteered right here....
                   You didn't even blink, Jason.
                   You just handed me these...

                                                             99


       Hirsch removes a pair of dog tags from his jacket pocket.
       Holds them out to Bourne.

       Bourne takes the dog tags.        Stares at them.

       INSERT of the dog tags:

       Webb, David

FB9    FLASHBACK                                                   FB9

       Bourne hands over his dog tags....


                              HIRSCH (CONT'D)
                    Has everything been explained to
                    you.

                                BOURNE
                    Yes, sir.

322    PRESENT DAY                                                 322

                              HIRSCH
                    You were a soldier ready to serve
                    his country. Just like thousands
                    of others, except you were a
                    prodigy with languages...and a
                    perfect shot.

FBB3   FLASHBACK                                               FBB3

                              HIRSCH (CONT'D)
                    Your missions will save American
                    lives.


322    PRESENT DAY                                                 322

                              BOURNE
                    You said I'd be saving American
                    lives. Instead you just turned me
                    into a killer.

       Bourne raises the gun to Hirsch.

                              HIRSCH
                    You could have left at any time.
                    And you knew exactly what it
                    meant for you if you chose to
                    stay.

                                                               100


FB9    FLASHBACK                                                     FB9

                              HIRSCH
                    When we're finished with you,
                    you'll no longer be David Webb.

                              BOURNE
                    I'll be whoever you need me to
                    be, sir.


322    PRESENT DAY                                                   322

                              HIRSCH
                    Stop running from the truth,
                    Jason. You chose to come here!
                    You chose to stay! And no matter
                    how much you want to forget
                    it...eventually you're going to
                    have to face how you chose, right
                    there, to become Jason Bourne!



FB10   FLASHBACK:                                                 FB10

       Bourne sitting in a chair, looking terrible.     Hirsch looks
       at him from behind the desk...

                              HIRSCH (CONT'D)
                    You haven't slept for a long time
                    have you David? Have you made a
                    decision? This can't go on, you
                    know. You have to decide.

                                 BOURNE
                    Who is he?

                              HIRSCH
                    We've been through that.

                              BOURNE
                    What did he do?

                               HIRSCH
                    It doesn't matter.
                        (beat)
                    You came to us. You volunteered.
                    You said you'd do anything it
                    takes to save American lives.
                    You're not a liar are you? Or too
                    weak to see this through? This is
                    it. Let go of David Webb. Will
                    you give yourself to this
                    program?

                                                             101


      Bourne looks down, a gun in his hand. He gets to his feet
      swiftly and fires the pistol several times into a hooded
      figure. The man slumps over.

      Bourne stares at what he's done.

                          HIRSCH (CONT'D)
                You're no longer David Webb.
                From now on you'll be known as
                Jason Bourne. Welcome to the
                program.

      Daniels pulls the hood off the figure to show that he is
      dead.

      Just then Kramer walks through the door.

                          KRAMER
                He's ready. Send him to
                Operations.


322   PRESENT                                                      322

      And now, in real time, Bourne comes out of the flashback.
      He stares back at Hirsch....

                          HIRSCH
                Do you remember now?

      Bourne lowers the gun.

                          BOURNE
                I remember. I remember
                everything.

                          HIRSCH
                You can't outrun what you did,
                Jason. You made yourself into
                who you are.

                          BOURNE
                I'm done running.  That's why
                I'm here. To end you, to shut
                this down. I'm no longer Jason
                Bourne.

                          HIRSCH
                So now you're going to kill me?

                          BOURNE
                No. You don't deserve the star
                they give you on the wall at
                Langley.

      Just then Bourne spins -- agents arrive at the door.    It's
      locked.

                                                            102


322   INT. HALLWAY                                                322

      The agents fire at the door handle to get it open.


322   INT. ROOM WHERE BOURNE FIRST MET HIRSCH                     322

      Bourne looks out a window.   Sees the layout of a roof
      several stories below. Then he turns and shoots out the
      room's mirrored observation window. Bourne dives through
      it just as agents rush in and open fire at him.


      SERIES OF SHOTS

      Bourne races through corridors, loosing the CRI agents.


352   EXT. ROOF -- NIGHT                                          352

      Bourne runs out onto the roof. Rushes across it to look
      over the edge.   It's a straight drop to the FDR -- 12
      stories down.

      He races to another ledge -- the East River below him. But
      he has to clear a 10 foot supporting wall at the base of
      the building to hit the water.   He backs up to get a
      running leap.

      As he does, he turns and sees Paz, who is holding a gun on
      him.

                             PAZ
                   Why didn't you take the shot?

      Bourne looks at him.

                             BOURNE
                   Do you even know why you're
                   trying to kill me? Look at what
                   they make you give.

      Bourne turns and runs off the roof.

      Paz fires into the air...

      FOLLOW Bourne as he drops fourteen stories into the
      freezing river--

      MULTIPLE ANGLES -- Bourne goes into the river...


352   UNDERWATER                                                  352

      Bourne in a dead man's float...as his clothes soak through
      he begins to sink....

      several other customers.   She stands there, eyes fixed on

                                                         March 7, 1995

          

          

          FADE IN:

          A FIST HITS A FACE
          The fist is in a boxing glove. It belongs to VIC DEAKINS, 38.
          The face belongs to RAWLEY HALE, 28. They are in...

          INT. GYMNASIUM, WHITEMAN AFB - DAY

          Hale and Deakins are sparring in a ring. Other people are
          lifting weights, shooting baskets.

          IN THE RING
          Hale and Deakins circle each other. Hale is shaking cobwebs out
          of his head.

          DEAKINS
          You know what happened there?

          HALE
          Hell, I barely know what day it is.

          DEAKINS
          I set you up. I fake right, go
          left three times in a row. You
          expect it again, I take the right
          in hard. That's what boxing's all
          about. Make your opponent think
          you're gonna do one thing, then do
          another. Like Ali in Zaire, using
          the rope-a-dope on Foreman.
          (mimes rope-a-dope)
          Everyone thought Ali's arms were
          getting destroyed, when he was
          really just letting Foreman tire
          himself out. Eighth round, Ali
          starts hitting, George's got
          nothing left -- fight's over.

          HALE
          The fact that I can't feel the
          left side of my face -- that's
          okay, right?
          Deakins laughs. Hale seizes the relaxed moment and suddenly
          launches into Deakins with a flurry of punches.

          THE OTHER PEOPLE IN THE GYM
          Take notice -- the fight is getting real. They move to the ring.

          DEAKINS
          Several of Hale's punches land. Deakins staggers back, caught
          off guard. It looks like he might even go down.

          

          

          

          

           2.

          HALE
          He cocks his arm back. He could finish Deakins off. But he
          doesn't. He drops his fist.

          DEAKINS
          Seizes the opportunity and slugs back.

          THE CROWD
          Loves it.

          HALE AND DEAKINS
          Now Deakins has the upperhand. He backs Hale around the ring.

          DEAKINS
          Don't watch my hands -- watch my
          shoulders. That's where the punch
          starts. Ready?
          Deakins hits Hale hard in the face, sending him back.

          THE SPECTATORS
          Are circling the ring, following the fighters, cheering.

          HALE AND DEAKINS

          DEAKINS
          You were looking at my hands.
          Let's try it again. Ready?
          Deakins hits Hale hard. He's got Hale on the run.

          DEAKINS
          Come on. Focus. Ready?

          (PUNCH)
          My shoulders. Ready?
          Deakins fakes left, puts everything into one big uppercut. It
          connects.

          HALE
          Lands, dazed, blood trickling out of the corner of his mouth.

          DEAKINS
          He's in silhouette, the lights above him.

          HALE
          Looks up at Deakins, catches his breath.

          

          

          

          

           3.

          HALE AND DEAKINS
          Deakins offers his hand. Hale pushes it aside. Deakins ignores
          Hale, grabs him and helps him to his feet. Deakins climbs out
          of the ring between the ropes.
          Hale grabs the top rope and flips himself over, landing on his
          feet. Deakins gives Hale a look, laughs, shakes his head.

          INT. SHOWERS

          Hale lets the water rinse the blood off his face.

          INT. LOCKER ROOM - DAY

          Hale and Deakins are sitting on the bench between their lockers,
          getting into their flightsuits, pulling on boots. Deakins is
          smoking a cigarette. The smoke curls up into the light slanting
          down across the room from high windows.

          HALE'S LOCKER
          Is in sunlight. On the inside of his locker door are pictures
          of exotic planes -- the SR-71, a swept-wing fighter, an artist's
          rendition of the Aurora, etc.

          DEAKINS' LOCKER
          On the shady side of the room. Nothing on the inside of his
          locker door. The locker is spare, Zen-like in its neatness.

          HALE
          Here.

          HALE'S HAND
          Slams a twenty dollar bill down on the bench.

          DEAKINS
          I can't take that.

          HALE
          Oh, shut up.

          DEAKINS
          Really. I feel bad. How many times
          have we fought and how many times
          have you won?

          HALE
          Jerk.

          DEAKINS
          Well, if you insist.
          Deakins grins, folds the bill and jams it into his flightsuit.

          

          

          

          

           4.

          DEAKINS
          You know why I beat you?

          HALE
          Because you've been boxing for
          twenty years and you're much
          better at it than I am?

          DEAKINS
          You don't want it enough. You had
          me today. I was back on my heels.
          But you didn't close the door.

          HALE
          We were just sparring.

          DEAKINS
          Life isn't sparring, Hale.

          HALE
          I think I saw that on a T-shirt.
          Deakins pulls out the twenty dollar bill; hands it back to Hale.

          DEAKINS
          Here.

          HALE
          No, that's yours.

          DEAKINS
          If you weren't giving it
          everything you've got, then I
          don't want it.

          HALE
          No, I mean -- that's yours,
          literally. I took it out of your
          wallet when you were in the shower.
          Deakins laughs, puts the money away.

          EXT. WHITEMAN AIR FORCE BASE - DUSK

          Planes taxiing, vehicles moving.

          INT. WHITEMAN MISSION BRIEFING ROOM

          Deakins and Hale enter to find GENERAL BOONE, 50s.

          DEAKINS/HALE
          General.

          

          

          

          

           5.

          BOONE
          Gentlemen.
          (nods at NO SMOKING

          SIGN)
          Deak?

          DEAKINS
          Sorry.
          (puts out cigarette)
          What's the mission, General?

          BOONE
          Simulate a border penetration. Hug
          the ground. Scare some cows. See
          if anyone can spot you.

          HALE
          The usual ...?

          BOONE
          No, actually, it's a little
          unusual. You're carrying a couple
          of nukes tonight, fellas.
          (off their looks)
          Palmdale's afraid low-level gamma
          and x-ray diffusion might screw up
          the peripherals. They asked us to
          send a couple on a run, see if
          anything glows.

          HALE
          '61s?

          BOONE
          (shakes head)
          Big ones. '83s.

          HALE
          Ooh. Crowpleasers.

          INT. HANGAR

          A BOMB TRUCK carrying two B-83 nuclear weapons drives under the
          wing of a big, black plane, toward the open bomb bays. GROUND
          CREWMEN are hurrying about.

          HALE AND DEAKINS
          Enter and walk under the plane, nodding to the ground crew. Hale
          and Deakins are royalty. Deakins and Hale climb up the
          airplane's Crew Entry steps and disappear.

          INT. COCKPIT

          Hale and Deakins climb into a very strange cockpit. There are
          two pilots' seats in this plane, with duplicate controls.

          

          

          

          

           6.
          But instead of the usual dials and gauges on the control panels,
          there are FOUR COMPUTER SCREENS in front of each pilot. Hale
          gets into the left seat; Deakins the right. They review
          information on their screens, flip switches.

          INTERCUT WITH BOMBS
          Being loaded into the bomb bays. When they've been clamped into
          place in the rotary bomb racks...

          DEAKINS
          (into helmet mike)
          Ready for rollout.

          INT./EXT. HANGAR

          Alarm horns sound, wheels roll on track and the huge hangar
          doors open revealing...

          THE GHOST
          An enormous black flying wing.

          INT. COCKPIT

          Deakins looks at maps on his computer screens. Hale looks over,
          sees the map of Utah.

          HALE
          You know, these exercises are
          fantastic. I mean, when that day
          comes and we finally go to war
          against Utah, we are really going
          to kick ass.

          CUT TO:

          EXT. CANYONLANDS NATIONAL PARK, UTAH - NIGHT

          Bright moonlight shows a campfire burning at the edge of an
          escarpment, the Colorado River a thousand feet below. Near the
          campfire is an Army surplus tent. Next to it, an easel holds a
          painting in progress.

          A PARK RANGER TRUCK
          Drives up, stops. The driver's door open, and out gets...

          A RANGER
          We don't see his face in the dark. He switches on a flashlight,
          walks over and taps on the tent.

          RANGER
          Park Ranger. I'd like to talk to
          somebody about this fire.

          

          

          

          

           7.
          We hear a man and a woman -- JIM and WANDA, 60s -- wake up.

          JIM (O.S.)
          Wha--? Oh, hell.

          WANDA (O.S.)
          I'll talk to him, Jim.

          JIM (O.S.)
          Wanda, you stay put.
          Jim comes out of the tent, the ranger's light in his face.

          JIM
          I know -- no wood fires in the
          Park. It's just -- Wanda's got a
          cold and I wanted her to stay warm.

          RANGER
          Sir, you see any other hikers,
          campers anywhere around here?

          JIM
          Not this time of year. What's the
          fine for something like this?

          RANGER
          Your life.
          Jim grins. But the ranger pulls out a pistol and shoots Jim,
          who falls into the fire. He then puts three shots through the
          wall of the tent. Nothing moves. The Ranger -- call him
          BAKER -- pulls out a walkie-talkie, clicks on.

          BAKER
          Done.

          HEADLIGHTS
          Come on and two Humvees roll in and four men get out. Three of
          them -- JOHNSON, a tech-whiz; LETT, gangly, grim, and NOVACEK,
          a wiry guy in a baseball cap -- start setting up what looks to
          be a high-tech missile launcher. The fourth man is...

          MR. PRITCHETT
          A neatly groomed man, 40s, with a perpetually sour attitude. He
          looks like -- and is -- a lawyer.

          PRITCHETT
          (to Baker, re: Jim in

          FIRE)
          Jesus. Do you think maybe you
          could get him out of the fire?
          Unless you like that smell.

          

          

          

          

           8.

          EXT. THE NIGHT SKY

          The Ghost flies overhead, roaring.

          INT. COCKPIT

          Deakins and Hale check their screens.

          DEAKINS
          (thinks of something)
          Weren't you going to call Taylor
          today about the Aurora Project?

          HALE
          Yeah. Turns out he wants people
          with more fighter hours.

          DEAKINS
          What'd you say?

          HALE
          What could I say?

          DEAKINS
          Jesus. You are such a pussy. You
          never fight for anything.
          Hale is stung. Pissed, he goes on the offensive.

          HALE
          Yeah, well you know what your
          problem is?

          DEAKINS
          Because I said what your problem
          is, you're gonna--?

          HALE
          You fight too much.
          (Deakins look at him)
          Right? You said it yourself --
          you should be at least Wing
          Commander by now. Maybe you would
          be if you didn't insist on telling
          people what they're doing wrong
          all the time.

          DEAKINS
          I'm usually right though, aren't I?
          Hale shakes his head, grins. Deakins clicks on his mike.

          DEAKINS
          Ghost 7 to McMurran. Hey,
          Wilkins, you old bag of dirt, your
          boys in Utah still awake?

          Jammed with MEN looking at radar screens and computer monitors.
          COLONEL WILKINS, 50s, seen it all, talks over a headset.

          WILKINS
          Ready and waiting, Mr. Deakins.
          And tell our favorite hotshot,
          he's not gonna lose us tonight.

          INT. COCKPIT

          Deakins covers his mike, turns to Hale.

          DEAKINS
          Wilkins says you won't lose them
          tonight.

          HALE
          Tell Colonel Wilkins I could fly
          this puppy up his ass without him
          knowing.

          DEAKINS
          (grins, shakes his
          head; into helmet

          MIKE)
          Hale says ... if anyone can catch
          him it'd be you.

          INT. MCMURRAN CONTROL CENTER


          CU RADAR SCREEN
          The Ghost makes a prominent blip on the screen.

          WILKINS
          Everyone get a fix! They're about
          to turn out the lights!

          INT. COCKPIT

          Deakins turns to Hale.

          DEAKINS
          Ready, Major?

          HALE
          On your word.

          DEAKINS
          Go to war.

          CLOSE ON CONTROL PANEL - THREE BUTTONS
          The left, labeled TAKE OFF, is lighted. The other two buttons
          are MISSION and LANDING. Hale pushes MISSION.

          THE COCKPIT
          everything goes quiet.

          EXT. NIGHT SKY

          The plane's running lights go out. The roar of the engines
          quickly drops to a low rushing sound. The plane in in full
          stealth mode.

          INT. MCMURRAN CONTROL CENTER


          CU RADAR SCREEN
          The Ghost's blip disappears.

          WILKINS
          Lost 'em on active! Who's still
          got 'em?

          IR CREWMAN
          Got their heat signature, sir.
          (points to computer

          SCREEN)
          Their engines may be cold, but the
          air is colder.

          CU COMPUTER SCREEN
          Half of the screen shows a waveform, like a voiceprint. The
          other half shows a triangle moving across a map of Colorado.

          INT. COCKPIT

          Deakins studies the maps on the computer screens.

          DEAKINS
          Descend to 400 feet AGL. River
          valley approach.

          HALE
          Airspeed lock at point-seven Mach.
          Blue line descent on throttle to
          400 feet AGL.
          Hale pulls back on the throttle. The plane descends.

          HALE
          Time to limbo down. How low can
          we go.

          

          

          

          

           11.

          EXT. NIGHT SKY

          The Ghost drops away from us, a stark black cut-out against the
          moonlit Colorado landscape. The Colorado River is a winding
          silver ribbon five miles below.

          EXT. CANYONLANDS NATIONAL PARK, UTAH - NIGHT


          A PARK RANGER TRUCK
          Driving along the blacktop. The driver is not Baker. It's...

          TERRY CARMICHAEL
          Pretty, late 20s. Her radio squawks.

          CLYDE (V.0.)
          Terry? You been through the
          Needles entrance tonight?

          TERRY
          (grabs mike, answers)
          No. Why?

          CLYDE (V.0.)
          Mrs. Parker called --

          TERRY
          Oh, God. What is it this time?
          UFO abduction? Ritual human
          sacrifice?

          CLYDE (V.0.)
          She said she saw a bunch of trucks
          going through the Needles entrance
          an hour ago and thought they
          looked suspicious.

          TERRY
          Yes, well, this is a woman who
          chopped off one of her own fingers
          because it'd "turned on her."

          CLYDE (V.0.)
          Thing is, she said one of the
          trucks was ours, and you're the
          only one out.

          TERRY
          (arches eyebrow)
          She was probably hallucinating,
          but I'll check it out.

          EXT. COLORADO RIVER VALLEY - THIRTY MILES UP RIVER

          We feel the Ghost before we hear it. It rushes over, close to
          the river, below the ridgelines on either side of the valley.

          INT. MCMURRAN CONTROL CENTER

          The triangle representing the Ghost disappears from a computer
          screen.

          IR CREWMAN
          Lost 'em.

          WILKINS
          Stay on it. They're gonna have to
          come up for air sooner or later.

          INT. COCKPIT

          Deakins reads his computer screens.

          DEAKINS
          We're under the radar. Proceed to
          primary target.
          Hale hits a button, lets go of the stick -- they're on
          autopilot. It's a moment of peace. Hale looks out.

          HALE
          I tell people I became a pilot
          because I wanted to fly cool
          planes. It's also for this. When
          we're up here, I feel... closer
          ... I don't know.

          DEAKINS
          To God? Is that what you're going
          to say? That you feel closer to
          God up here?

          (SNORTS)
          Hell, Hale, with the payload we're
          carrying, we are God.
          Deakins notices something odd on his screen. He checks between
          the screen and what he can see through the windshield.

          DEAKINS
          Hale, take a look out your side.
          I think our terrain following is
          off. It's got us two klicks from
          the left flank ridge.
          Hale turns to look out the window on his side.

          HALE'S POV
          Looking out the window. There's some movement in the reflection
          in the glass. QUICK PULL FOCUS to see, distorted in the curve
          of the window, Deakins reaching inside his flight suit.

          

          

          

          

           13.

          HALE
          Turns his head back toward Deakins.

          HALE
          Deak, you can't smoke in here --
          But then Hale sees it's not a cigarette that Deakins is pulling
          out of his flight suit. It's shiny, metal. It's...

          A GUN
          And Deakins levels it right at Hale's head and his finger starts
          to squeeze the trigger.

          HALE
          Grabs Deakins' hand, pushing up as...

          DEAKINS
          Pulls the trigger and the gun FIRES.

          HALE
          The bullet cuts a line through the top of his helmet, punching
          a hole in the window by his head.

          DEAKINS AND HALE
          Deakins goes for another shot, but Hale grabs the gun and pushes
          up, sending bullets through the ceiling of the plane, into the
          walls. Deakins forces the gun down, fires.

          THE BULLET
          Tears through Hale's harness, blowing apart a shoulder strap.

          HALE AND DEAKINS
          Hale brings Deakins' gun hand hard against Hale's own helmet.
          Deakins yowls and the gun goes flying. Then Hale sees something.

          THE PLANE
          Is banking towards a ridge-line cliff wall.

          HALE
          Sees it, yanks on the stick.

          THE PLANE
          Banks hard away from the cliff, just missing.

          EXT. CANYONLANDS

          Baker gives a sign. Johnson, standing beside the missile
          launcher-like device, hits a button. Instead of a missile, a
          brilliant light shoots out.

          INT. COCKPIT


          ARMAMENTS CONTROL BUTTONS
          Buttons include ONE, TWO, LOCK, LEFT, RIGHT, OPEN, CLOSE, ARM
          and RELEASE. Deakins presses ONE and TWO, then RIGHT.

          HALE
          No!
          He pulls at Deakins' arms.

          CU COMPUTER SCREENS
          Graphics of bomb racks rotate, the B-83 nukes -- labeled and
          glowing red -- move into the bottom spot. The word RELEASE
          appears on the screen. Next to it, the word UNARMED flashes.

          HALE AND DEAKINS
          Deakins hits Hale with the back of his hand, knocking him back.
          Hale grabs Deakins' helmet, yanks it off his head and smashes
          Deakins back with it. Hale keys the armament buttons.

          CU COMPUTER SCREENS
          The nukes rotate out of the release position. RELEASE and
          UNARMED disappear.

          HALE AND DEAKINS
          Deakins grabs a fire extinguisher, swings it, getting Hale in
          the face. Hale is almost knocked out, blood running from his
          nose.

          EXT. PARK - NEEDLES AREA

          Terry is standing by her truck, talking on the radio.

          TERRY
          Clyde, tell Mrs. Parker that
          there's nothing weird going on. No
          truck, no UFOs, and, except for
          the odd human head on a stick, no
          sign of Satan.
          She feels it before she hears it or sees it.

          

          

          

          

           15.

          THE GHOST
          Rushes over Terry, no more than fifty feet above the ground. The
          jet-wash rocks the truck, almost knocks Terry down.

          TERRY
          Holy shit.

          INT. COCKPIT

          Hale groggy, hears a loud click. He looks down to see...

          DEAKINS' HAND
          AUTO to MANUAL. Deakins grabs Hale's EJECTION HANDLE.

          HALE AND DEAKINS
          Hale tries to push the handle down as Deakins pulls it up as...

          EXT. THE GHOST

          Heads into the beacon light.

          INT. COCKPIT

          Hale and Deakins look at each other as the plane enters the
          light and the light, in SLOW MOTION, washes across their faces.

          DEAKINS
          Suddenly lets go of Hale's hand, then hits Hale hard under the
          chin with the fire extinguisher.

          HALE
          His head snaps back as Deakins pulls.

          HALE'S EJECTION SEAT HANDLE
          Pop, hiss like a huge vacuum-sealed can is being opened.

          EXT. ABOVE GHOST

          The ejection hatch blows and is ripped away by the wind.

          HALE'S POV
          As he rockets up out of the cockpit.

          HALE
          When the chute opens, he almost spills out because of the
          severed shoulder harness. He grabs the straps, holds on.

          INT. COCKPIT

          Debris -- coffee cups, flight bags, anything not nailed down --
          is whipping around the inside of the cabin. Deakins reaches
          through the maelstrom, then reaches to the ARMAMENT BUTTONS and
          punches them.

          INT. BOMB BAYS

          The the clamps snap back and the two B-83s drop toward the earth.

          INT. COCKPIT

          Deakins looks around, then gets an idea. He hits the LANDING
          mission mode button and the cockpit lights up.

          INT. MCMURRAN CONTROL CENTER

          The Ghost starts popping up on everyone's screens. There's a
          chorus of "I got em!" and "They're ba-a-a-ck!" Wilkins looks at
          a screen, puzzled.

          WILKINS
          They're not due for another
          halfhour.

          INT. GHOST COCKPIT

          Deakins yells into his helmet mike as he gets ready to eject.

          DEAKINS
          (into helmet mike)
          This is Deakins! Hale lost it!
          I have to punch out!
          Deakins pulls his second handle. BLAM! WHOOSH! He's gone. He
          hear and feel the plane dropping, screaming toward the earth.

          INT. MCMURRAN CONTROL CENTER


          CU RADAR SCREEN
          The Ghost's blip suddenly disappears from the screen. A chorus

          Alarm horns blare. FIVE MEN are running to a waiting Blackhawk

          LIEUTENANT COLONEL SAM RHODES
          40s, short grey hair: he could snap your neck with a look.
          Wilkins pats Rhodes on the shoulder and Rhodes jumps into...

          THE HELICOPTER
          And it lifts up and flies off.

          Hale lies, unconscious, his parachute whipping in the wind.

          Rhodes sits with MCKELLAR, the pilot. Lieutenants KELLY, REED
          and THOMAS are in the back.

          IN THE SAND
          Something glints in the searchlights but the helicopter moves on.

          Hold it. Come back.

          We're going out with this. Rick's

          get this job?
          A few chuckles in the room. Baird looks at the Chairman --
          well? The Chairman thinks for a second, nods. Baird turns to
          Rick.

          BAIRD
          Rewrite it. What Giles just said.
          Rick grits his teeth and hurries out. Baird looks at Giles.

          BAIRD
          I want you in Utah. Now.
          Giles nods, heads out. Baird grabs his arm.

          BAIRD
          You scare me sometimes.

          GILES
          Hell, sir. Sometimes I scare
          myself.
          And out Giles goes.

          EXT. GHOST CRASH SITE

          Rhodes and his men are on the ground. Wind is whipping the
          sand. Rhodes is walking under part of the wing that is exposed.
          He's yelling into a headset microphone.

          RHODES
          (into mike)
          Cockpit's empty! We're checking
          the payload!

          INT. MCMURRAN CONTROL CENTER

          Wilkins talks to Rhodes over the radio.

          WILKINS
          Watch your needles!

          

          

          

          

           20.

          EXT. GHOST CRASH SITE

          Rhodes walks up to his men who are in the process of opening the
          bomb bay doors manually. The doors are open a foot. Rhodes
          signals his men to stop. Rhodes steps up, shines a light into
          the bomb bays.

          INSIDE BOMB BAYS
          Rhodes' light plays over the bomb racks -- empty.

          RHODES
          (into headset mike)
          Colonel?
          (takes breath)
          We've got ourselves a Broken Arrow.

          INT.PENTAGON - SITUATION ROOM

          Stunned silence. They've just gotten the news. Baird doesn't
          know what it means.

          BAIRD
          Broken Arrow?

          CHAIRMAN
          That's what we call it when we
          lose a nuclear weapon.

          BAIRD
          Oh, Jesus.
          (thinks, shakes head)
          I don't know what's scarier --
          losing nuclear weapons or the fact
          that it happens so often that you
          people have a term for it.

          INT. MCMURRAN CONTROL CENTER

          Wilkins is on the radio with Rhodes.

          WILKINS
          Find the nukes, Sam. But be
          careful. I know they say those
          eggs can't be cracked, but if your
          geigers pick up more rads than
          you'd get off a toaster, I want
          you out of there.
          Wilkins to the CORPORAL.

          WILKINS
          Get the teams in. I want Colonel
          Rhodes and his men backed up.

          

          

          

          

           21.

          INT. PENTAGON SITUATION ROOM


          CU COMPUTER SCREEN
          Various views of a B-83 nuclear weapon. Creeley is briefing
          Baird on the nukes.

          BAIRD
          They dropped from a plane but they
          didn't go off...?

          CREELEY
          They have to be armed to detonate.

          BAIRD
          Then they're destroyed?

          CREELEY
          (shakes head)
          They're designed to survive
          crashes intact. They can lie in
          a pool of burning jet fuel for
          five hours without any problem.

          BAIRD
          How did this happen?

          CREELEY
          In his last transmission, Colonel
          Deakins said Major Hale lost
          control. He probably hit weapons
          release by accident. Believe me,
          when a plane's auguring in, you
          start pushing every button you can.
          Baird stands, looks at a picture of a Ghost shakes his head.

          BAIRD
          Hell, we should take the cost of
          the plane out of major Hale's
          salary. Although I guess at two
          billion dollars a pop, that could
          take a while.

          EXT. CANYONLANDS - DAWN

          Hale is still unconscious, lying beside his parachute. There's
          the crunch of footsteps and a FIGURE looms over Hale. The figure
          reaches down to touch Hale's shoulder and...

          HALE
          Spins, grabs the shirt of the figure and cocks his arm about to
          punch. He hesitates when he sees it's...

          

          

          

          

           22.

          TERRY
          She seizes Hale's hesitation and punches him hard.

          HALE AND TERRY
          Hale is stunned. Terry starts to get up, reaching for her gun.
          Hale strikes out with a leg, getting Terry in the gut, sending
          her back. She hits the ground, still struggling for her gun.
          Hale gets up, runs, sprinting off over the rocky terrain.

          HIS POV
          Jarring, racing over rock and then...

          HALE
          Pulls up fast, almost not fast enough.

          HALE'S POV
          He's stopped right at the edge of a fifty foot drop.

          TERRY (O.S.)
          That would be the wrong way.

          TERRY
          Is walking slowly, calmy, up behind Hale, pistol out.

          TERRY
          Turn around.

          HALE

          (TURNING)
          Look, I --

          TERRY
          (not interested)
          Gimme your hands.
          Hale sticks his hands behind him. Terry handcuffs them.

          HALE
          I'm going to tell you something I
          can't tell you.
          Terry puts away her gun, spins Hale around and starts marching
          him off.

          HALE
          There were nuclear weapons on that
          plane. The guy I was flying with
          is trying to steal them.
          Terry reacts to that, but keeps Hale moving.

          

          

          

          

           23.

          HALE
          I have to stop him, and I need
          your help.

          TERRY

          (STOPS)
          Look, pal, all I know is, I saw
          you come down, I come in to help
          you and you grab me, kick me and
          run away.

          HALE
          I only ran because you punched me.

          TERRY
          What, we're ten years old now?
          "You started it. No you started
          it."

          HALE
          He has men on the ground. I --

          TERRY
          Save it. My dog's waiting for his
          breakfast.
          Terry starts to push Hale along again and...

          HALE
          Jumps up and through the handcuffs.

          TERRY
          Reaches for her revolver, but...

          HALE
          Grabs it from her, puts it to-her head, but not before...

          TERRY
          Whips a knife from her belt and puts it under Hale's chin.

          HALE AND TERRY
          Don't move. A beat while they catch their breath.

          HALE
          This isn't a stand-off, okay? I've
          got a gun.

          TERRY
          Yeah, well, I never keep my gun
          loaded.
          Terry taps her belt.

          

          

          

          

           24.

          CLOSE ON HER BELT
          A line of bullets.

          HALE AND TERRY
          Terry holds out her hand. Hale lets the revolver swing down on
          his finger. Just as Terry takes it...

          HALE
          Moves fast, grabs Terry's knife hand, then kicks her legs out
          from under her. Hale lands on top of her, still holding her
          knife hand, putting the knife to her throat.

          HALE
          I'm telling you the truth.

          TERRY
          This is a good way to convince me.

          HALE
          I could kill you now. Right?
          Terry nods, bewildered and more than a little scared.
          Hale lets go of Terry's hand holding the knife.

          HALE
          I need your help.
          Terry looks at Hale for a long moment. She's still holding the
          knife. She exhales, then sticks the knife in the dirt.

          INT./EXT. HELICOPTER

          The helicopter flies low. Rhodes looks at a device on his lap.

          ON THE DEVICE'S SCREEN
          Green, like a radar screen. It's blank, and then two dots
          appear on the outer edge of the screen.

          RHODES
          Got 'em!

          EXT. CANYONLANDS

          Terry unlocks Hale's handcuffs.

          TERRY
          I've got a radio in the truck. We
          can call McMurran and get the
          Marines in here.

          

          

          

          

           25.

          HALE
          (shakes head)
          Deakins'll be monitoring any radio
          transmissions out of here.
          (off her look)
          That's what I'd do.

          TERRY
          Who is this guy?

          HALE
          (a flash of the
          horrible betrayal he

          FEELS)
          Someone I would've trusted with my
          life.

          (BEAT)
          You've gotta get to a phone.

          TERRY
          Me? What are you going to do?
          (no answer, she

          REALIZES)
          Wait. You're gonna go after this
          guy? Isn't he going to have a lot
          guns and shit? I don't want to
          sound insulting or anything, but
          ... you're just a pilot.

          HALE
          I don't have any choice. The
          nukes are my responsibility.
          Besides...
          (pulls something from

          POCKET)
          I do have one thing going for me.

          TERRY
          What's that?
          Hale sticks...

          A TWENTY DOLLAR BILL
          Under a rock.

          HALE
          The last thing in the world he
          expects is for me to come after
          him.
          Hale walks off into the light of the rising sun. Terry looks at
          the $20 bill.

          EXT. CREVICE SITE

          The helicopter is parked at the edge of a deep crevice.

          

          

          

          

           26.

          DOWN IN THE CREVICE
          Rhodes comes down the last few feet of rope to the bottom of the
          crevice. Kelly, Thomas and Reed are waiting, shining lights on
          a B-83 lying in the dirt, all in one piece.

          RHODES
          (into mike)
          We've got one intact.
          (to his men)
          Let's go find the other one.
          Rhodes starts off along the bottom of the crevice.

          EXT. TOP OF THE CREVICE - BY THE HELICOPTER

          McKellar is sitting in the pilot's seat, eating a candy bar. He
          turns at the unexpected sound of a truck-driving up.

          A HUMVEE
          climbs up the slope toward the helicopter.

          MCKELLAR
          Grabs his rifle, hops out of the helicopter.

          NOVACEK AND LETT
          Are in the Humvee. Novacek sticks his head out.

          NOVACEK
          Hey, you guys need any help?

          MCKELLAR
          It's an Air Force training
          exercise, sir. I'm going to have
          to ask you to leave.

          NOVACEK
          Hey, no problem. We just --

          LETT
          Whips out a silenced rifle and shoots.

          MCKELLAR
          Barely has time to raise his rifle before he's hit. He drops.

          ANOTHER HUMVEE
          Drives up fast.

          BAKER, JOHNSON AND PRITCHETT
          Get out. Johnson wears radio headgear. Pritchett is furious.

          

          

          

          

           27.

          NOVACEK
          Picks up McKellar's half-eaten candy bar, takes a bite.

          BAKER
          (to Novacek)
          Any sign of Deakins?
          Novacek, mouth full, shakes his head.

          PRITCHETT
          He better be dead.

          DEAKINS (O.S.)
          Sorry to disappoint you, Mr.
          Pritchett.
          They all look over to see...

          DEAKINS
          Walk out of the shadows, smoking a cigarette. While soldierly
          with his men, Deakins is courteous and polite with Pritchett.

          PRITCHETT
          You said nothing would go wrong!

          DEAKINS
          Well, point of fact, nothing has.

          PRITCHETT
          You didn't drop the nukes where
          you were supposed to!

          DEAKINS
          Ah, but we always planned on the
          search and rescue team finding the
          weapons for us, and they have. Mr.
          Pritchett, I really have thought
          of everything.
          Johnson walks up, pointing to his radio headgear.

          JOHNSON
          Newsflash. Two gunships just left
          from McMurran and they're headed
          this way.

          PRITCHETT
          You thought of that?

          DEAKINS
          That'll take care of itself.

          PRITCHETT
          What about the other pilot? We
          saw him eject.

          

          

          

          

           28.

          DEAKINS
          You don't have to worry about
          Major Hale. He's probably hiding
          behind a rock somewhere, praying
          I don't find him.

          JOHNSON
          Someone else might find him.
          (off Deakins' look)
          A Ranger called her base, said she
          saw a pilot come down and was
          gonna go look for him.
          Deakins thinks it over, turns to Novacek.

          DEAKINS
          Get ready. You'll go when the
          clean-up's done.
          Novacek nods, goes to the helicopter.
          Ext. Canyonlands - 4wd trail
          Hale and Terry are hurrying along a 4WD trail toward Terry's
          truck. Terry taken a look at Hale's ripped and torn flightsuit.

          TERRY
          Is that the new uniform?

          HALE
          Yeah. Less constricting.

          TERRY
          The dayshift guy left some work
          clothes in the truck. You can
          have them if you want.
          Hale nods. His feet crunch on something.

          TERRY
          Don't walk there.

          HALE
          Don't walk where?

          TERRY
          On that black stuff. That's
          cryptogamic soil. It's very
          fragile. One footprint takes
          centuries to repair.

          HALE
          That's a new one. Endangered dirt.
          Terry gives Hale a look.

          

          

          

          

           29.

          EXT. BOTTOM OF THE CREVICE

          Rhodes, Reed, Thomas and Kelly move along the shadowy crevice.

          INT. HELICOPTER

          Novacek flips switches in the helicopter, getting ready to start
          up. Deakins reaches in, flips off a switch marked COM LINK.

          EXT. BOTTOM OF CREVICE

          Rhodes hears the connection go dead. He taps his headset.

          RHODES
          Hello? McMurran? Come in.
          Suddenly, there's a soft popping sound and Reed drops.

          RHODES
          Reed? What the --?
          Rhodes looks down, sees blood on Reed. Before he can say
          another word, there's a fusillade of soft popping sounds as
          silenced bullets ricochet off the rock around them. Thomas goes
          down.

          INT. MCMURRAN CONTROL CENTER

          Silence from the speakers.

          WILKINS
          Sam? Sam, are you there? Sam?

          EXT. TOP OF CREVICE

          Lett aims a sniper's rifle down into the crevice. He flips a
          switch and a red laser beam stabs out from the scope.

          EXT. BOTTOM OF CREVICE

          Rhodes and Kelly are pressed against the crevice wall.

          THE RED LASER BEAN
          Dances along the wall, heading for them.

          RHODES
          Raises his pistol and shoots at the source of the laser.

          EXT. ATOP THE CREVICE

          Lett pitches back, dead.

          

          

          

          

           30.

          PRITCHETT AND DEAKINS
          Pritchett looks at Deakins -- another part of the plan? Deakins
          is unperturbed. He's holding an overnight bag. He unzips it.

          EXT. BOTTOM OF THE CREVICE

          Rhodes whispers to Kelly.

          RHODES
          We'll open up the access panels,
          put in a couple grenades. The
          nukes won't go nuclear, but they
          will go dirty. I won't lie and
          say we'll be all right. We won't.
          But if we're gonna go, might as
          well take those bastards with us.
          Rhodes scrambles off.

          KELLY
          Just one thing, sir.

          RHODES

          (TURNS)
          What?

          KELLY
          This.
          Kelly opens fire with his rifle. Rhodes is thrown back, dead.
          Kelly yells up top.

          KELLY
          Done!
          Kelly grabs the rope, climbs fast.

          EXT. ATOP THE CREVICE

          Mr. Pritchett looks at Deakins, surprised. Deakins -- putting
          on new clothes -- just grins. Deakins takes...

          THE TWENTY DOLLAR BILL
          From his flightsuit and puts it into his shirt pocket.

          KELLY
          Climbs into view.

          INT. MCMURRAN CONTROL CENTER

          Kelly's voice comes in over the speaker.

          

          

          

          

           31.

          KELLY (V.0.)

          (TERRIFIED)
          Colonel Wilkins? You there?

          WILKINS
          Who is this?

          KELLY (V.0.)
          It's Lieutenant Kelly, sir.

          WILKINS
          What happened, Kelly?

          EXT. ATOP CREVICE

          Kelly talks over the helicopter's radio mike. Deakins is behind
          him, shaving with an electric shaver.

          KELLY
          Colonel Rhodes is dead, sir!
          They're all dead!

          WILKINS (V. 0.)
          What happened?
          Deakins puts the shaver to the radio mike. There's a wash of 40
          static. Deakins pulls the shaver away, nods to Kelly.

          KELLY
          It's the nuke, sir! It's open!
          Wide open! Oh, God, what am I
          going to do?!
          Deakins puts the shaver to the mike again -- more static. He
          reaches into the helicopter and flips off the COM LINK switch,
          then backs away, shaving. He nods to Novacek, who fires up the
          helicopter.

          INT. MCMURRAN CONTROL CENTER

          Wilkins slumps in his chair.

          WILKINS
          Call back the teams and get me the
          Room. We're gonna need NEST in
          here.

          EXT. CREVICE SITE

          Novacek lifts off in the helicopter and flies away.
          Deakins turns to Kelly and applauds his performance.

          DEAKINS
          Brought a tear to my eye.

          

          

          

          

           32.

          KELLY
          I'd just like to thank the members
          of the Academy.

          PRITCHETT
          (to Deakins)
          I hope you've got another surprise
          up your sleeve. If I'm not
          mistaken, there are two attack
          helicopters headed this way.

          JOHNSON
          Not any longer.
          They look at him; he taps his radio headgear.

          JOHNSON
          They've just been recalled.

          DEAKINS
          You see, Mr. Pritchett, they think
          they've got an exposed core.
          They'll want to get a satellite to
          take a look, but it'll take ninety
          minutes minimum to shift the
          orbit. Until then? Well, people
          get a little weird when it comes
          to radiation. No one'll have the
          balls to come near here unless
          it's NEST -- the Nuclear Emergency
          Search Teams --and it'll take the
          nearest team at least two hours to
          get out here, and we only need an
          hour to reach our connection with
          the transport squad.

          (GRINS)
          Not that I'm not delighted with
          your presence, but you really
          don't need to be here.

          INT./EXT. TERRY'S TRUCK - 4WD TRAIL

          Hale and Terry are riding in Terry's truck. Terry drives. Hale
          is wearing work clothes. After some silence...

          HALE
          What's your dog's name?

          TERRY
          Bear. I was going to call him
          Death, so I could say things like,
          "I walk with Death," and "Death
          chewed my boots," but I chickened
          out. You?

          HALE
          No dog.

          

          

          

          

           33.

          TERRY
          Do you have a name, or is that
          classified?
          Before Hale can answer...

          THE SEARCH AND RESCUE HELICOPTER
          Rises up in front of them, Novacek piloting. Novacek thumbs a
          button and machine guns on the sides open up.

          TERRY AND HALE
          Terry jumps on the brakes. She and Hale bail out as...

          THE TRUCK
          is riddled with bullets and explodes.

          TERRY AND HALE
          Sprint up the trail.

          HALE
          We've gotta hide!

          TERRY
          Follow me!
          Terry leads Hale up a short slope. Hale scrambles over the top
          and is stunned. Terry runs out onto an open expanse -- no cover.

          HALE
          Hide where?

          IN THE HELICOPTER
          Novacek grins, shoots.

          HALE
          Looks at the helicopter as the bullets whistle in. When he
          turns back, Terry's gone.

          HALE
          What the --?

          TERRY (O.S)
          Come on!
          Hale runs in the direction of her voice.

          NOVACEK'S POV
          Aiming at Hale's back. But then Hale suddenly drops from view.

          

          

          

          

           34.

          HALE
          Arms flailing, drops fifteen feet, to deep sand.

          TERRY
          This way.
          Terry runs. Hale follows.

          HALE
          How do you --?

          TERRY
          (looks back, still

          RUNNING)
          I'm a Ranger. I've been over
          these trails a million times.
          Not looking, Terry runs straight into a wall, smacks her head
          and drops like a rock.

          IN THE HELICOPTER
          Novacek can't see his prey. He gets an idea and reaches back.

          TERRY AND HALE
          Terry is trying to get her eyes to focus.

          TERRY
          Please don't tell anyone I did
          that.

          IN THE HELICOPTER
          Novacek has a box of grenades beside him. He pulls the pin on
          a grenade and drops it.

          TERRY AND HALE
          Hale is helping Terry to her feet as BOOM -- the first grenade
          goes off. They run.

          THE HELICOPTER
          Chases them, strafing them. BOOM! -- a grenade goes off in
          front of them. They run back. They're cornered. Hale looks
          around, looks up.

          HALE
          Can you climb up?

          TERRY
          Yeah ...?

          HALE
          Give me your gun.

          

          

          

          

           35.

          TOP OF CLIFF
          Terry climbs up into view of...

          NOVACEK
          Who sees her.

          TERRY
          Pull herself up, stands, hands up.

          THE HELICOPTER
          Novacek swivels the helicopter around.

          TERRY
          This has nothing to do with me.

          NOVACEK
          Tell me where he is!

          HALE
          Is down in the fissure, pointing the revolver straight up at the
          helicopter hovering right overhead, figuring out where to shoot.

          HALE
          Blackhawk ... Moved pilot seat
          back a foot ... Puts him right
          about ... here.
          Hale hesitates -- he's never shot at someone before -- then
          takes a breath and starts shooting.

          IN THE HELICOPTER
          The bullets fly up from below. One hits Novacek. He slumps,
          pushing the joystick to one side.

          THE HELICOPTER
          Starts to lean over sideways.

          HALE
          Is surprised -- it worked!'

          TERRY
          Watches in horror as...

          THE HELICOPTER'S MAIN ROTOR BLADES
          Angle toward her, slicing the air as the helicopter tips over.

          

          

          

          

           36.

          TERRY
          Dives and rolls over the edge of the cliff as...

          THE ROTOR BLADES
          Hit the rock, sparking, grinding, right over Terry's head. The
          blades stop dead. But the torque of the motor brings...

          THE TAIL OF THE HELICOPTER
          Up and over, in a high arc.

          TERRY
          Looks up.

          THE TAIL --SECTION
          Is swinging over fast and the tail rotor is coming right for her.

          HALE AND TERRY
          Hale runs up, grabs Terry, pulls her to her feet as...

          THE TAIL SECTION
          Swings down, rotor spinning. It digs into the dirt and sand a
          split-second after...

          HALE AND TERRY
          Run clear.

          EXT. ATOP CREVICE

          Deakins and Pritchett watch a fireball from the exploding
          helicopter rise up in the distance.

          PRITCHETT
          We don't have to worry about the
          other pilot?
          Deakins shakes his head.

          PRITCHETT
          Then how come the helicopter
          crashed?

          DEAKINS
          (a flicker of worry)
          Pilot error.
          Deakins turns and walks away, over to...

          

          

          

          

           37.

          BAKER AND KELLY
          Who have taken the three-foot, pointed, front section off each
          nuke. They are loading them into the back of one Humvee.
          Pritchett walks up behind Deakins, still nagging.

          PRITCHETT
          Tell me again how I don't need to
          be here.

          DEAKINS
          Mr. Pritchett, I understand your
          concerns. You and your associates
          gave me a lot of money to mount
          this operation. But they're
          getting ten times that back if we
          succeed.

          PRITCHETT
          If we succeed?

          DEAKINS
          All I can do is my part. We've
          got the weapons, we're ...
          (checks watch)
          ... seventeen minutes ahead of
          schedule and everything will be in
          place within two hours. But I
          can't guarantee that the assholes
          in Washington won't do something
          stupid like not pay.

          PRITCHETT
          What if they don't?

          DEAKINS
          Then the next census for this
          region is going to show a very
          sudden drop in population.

          INT. MCMURRAN CONTROL ROOM

          Giles enters and is brought over to Wilkins.

          GILES
          Colonel Wilkins? I'm Giles
          Prentice.
          (they shake hands)
          My word from your search and
          rescue team?

          WILKINS
          No.

          

          

          

          

           38.

          GILES
          I'm sorry. Picked up any
          radiation?
          Wilkins shakes his head.

          GILES
          That's kind of strange -- if
          there's an exposed core out there.

          WILKINS
          Point?

          GILES
          Probably nothing. I asked for a
          transcript of the last cockpit
          transmission...?
          Wilkins nods to a CORPORAL who hands some papers to Giles. Giles
          reads them quickly.

          WILKINS
          I don't know what you expect to
          find.

          CU TRANSCRIPTS
          We see COLONEL DEAKINS: "This is Deakins! Hale lost it! Oh,
          God! I have to punch out!"

          GILES
          You know these guys? The pilots?

          WILKINS
          Just on the radio. Never met 'em.
          Why?

          GILES
          (looks up)
          What if this wasn't pilot error?

          INT. PENTAGON SITUATION ROOM

          Baird has put Giles on speaker phone. The people in the
          Situation Room exchange looks.

          BAIRD
          No rhetorical questions, Giles.
          Spit it out.

          

          

          

          

           39.

          CROSSCUT WITH GILES IN MCMURRAN CONTROL ROOM

          GILES
          In the last transmission from the
          plane, Colonel Deakins said Major
          Hale lost it and made the plane
          crash. We all assumed that meant
          pilot error. But what if Deakins
          meant Hale made the plane crash.
          Murmurs of "That's insane" "No way" fill the room.

          BAIRD
          Why would he do that?

          GILES
          Two nuclear weapons would be worth
          a hell of a lot of money.

          CHAIRMAN
          To whom? Son, there are easier
          ways for someone to buy nuclear
          weapons. You go to one of the old
          Soviet republics, you can get one
          for the price of a BMW.

          GILES
          I meant they'd be worth a lot of
          money to us. How much would we
          pay to get them back? To make
          sure they weren't used in this
          country?
          A flurry of looks around the room.

          BAIRD
          Hold on, hold on.
          (to Creeley)
          These nukes have codes or
          something that prevent people from
          using them.

          CREELEY
          Of course.

          BAIRD
          No one has these codes -- outside
          of the President and you guys.

          CREELEY
          Access to the codes requires the
          highest security --

          BAIRD
          I mean, not even the pilots have
          these codes, right?

          

          

          

          

           40.
          Creeley starts to stammer. Baird slumps. The chairman turns.

          CHAIRMAN
          (to an assistant)
          Where's that NEST team now?

          ASSISTANT
          They just took off.

          EXT. NEST HELICOPTER - IN FLIGHT

          A sleek, very serious-looking helicopter.

          INT. NEST HELICOPTER

          SIX very serious-looking SOLDIERS are in black radiation suits,
          listening to COLONEL HUNT, 45, over headsets.

          HUNT
          Listen up, sportsfans. Word is,
          this particular broken arrow has
          broken open. Our ETA Utah is
          ninety-six minutes. I want
          everyone to take that time to
          triple-check the seams and seals
          on their E-suits. Let's go!

          INT. MCMURRAN CONTROL ROOM

          Giles looks at Wilkins.

          GILES
          You think I'm nuts. You don't
          think NEST or the satellite will
          find anything weird.

          WILKINS
          That's right.

          (BEAT)
          But it wouldn't hurt to get some
          gunships fueled just in case.
          Wilkins reaches for a phone. Giles smiles.

          EXT. HELICOPTER EXPLOSION SITE

          The helicopter wreck burns. Hale looks over the terrain.

          HALE
          How do they get out of here?

          TERRY
          Get out? I don't think that
          helicopter's going anywhere.

          

          

          

          

           41.

          HALE
          Deak'd have a back-up. He'd be
          prepared.

          TERRY
          If they've got trucks they could
          take the four-wheel-drive trail we
          were on.

          HALE
          He wouldn't want to go towards
          town.

          TERRY
          He could go to the river.
          Hale looks at Terry -- that's exactly what Deakins would do.

          EXT. 4WD TRAIL

          The two Humvees roll along the narrow, twisting trail.

          IN THE SECOND HUMVEE
          Kelly drives, Deakins beside him, Johnson and Pritchett in back.

          DEAKINS
          You a fan of boxing, Mr. Pritchett?

          PRITCHETT
          I think it's barbaric.

          DEAKINS
          Me, too! I love it! Two men
          trying to do as much damage to the
          other as he can. As basic as you
          can get, don't you think?

          PRITCHETT
          I think it should be banned.

          DEAKINS
          So do I! God, wouldn't that make
          it more exciting? Having to go
          into dark alleys and basements to
          see a fight? I bet we see eye-to-
          eye on a lot of things, Mr.
          Pritchett.
          Deakins grins; Mr. Pritchett steams.

          EXT. CANYONLANDS

          Hale and Terry stand on an outcropping overlooking the 4WD trail.

          

          

          

          

           42.

          THEIR POV
          The two Humvees make their way along the trail.

          HALE
          See the one in front? It just has
          a driver? They wanted to keep the
          weight down. It has the nukes.
          Hale takes Terry's gun from her.

          TERRY
          You gonna shoot out the tires?

          HALE
          Humvees can reseal and inflate
          with the flick of a switch. That's
          why Deak chose 'em.
          Terry looks at Hale -- then what is he going to do?

          HALE
          I'm gonna steal it.
          (checks gun)
          You get to a phone and call
          McMurran.

          TERRY
          The nearest phone is a two-hour
          walk.

          HALE
          Then you better start walking.

          TERRY
          Look, I know my way around here.
          You're gonna need me.

          HALE
          (very serious)
          I appreciate what you've done so
          far. But now it gets hairy. Go
          to the phone.
          He scrambles off over the rock.

          THE HUMVEES
          Come around a corner. The trail hugs the face of a ten-foot-
          high cliff. Suddenly, from off the cliff...

          HALE AND TERRY
          Jump down onto the roof of the lead Humvee. Hale looks at
          Terry, angry. But before he can say anything...

          

          

          

          

           43.

          IN THE HUMVEE
          Baker swerves, trying to throw them off. He pulls out a pistol,
          shoots up through the ceiling.

          HALE AND TERRY
          Bullets punch up. Hale pulls out the gun. It falls from his
          hand. Terry grabs it as a sharp swerve sends...

          HALE
          Flying. He lands hard behind the Humvee.

          IN THE SECOND HUMVEE
          Deakins points at Hale, getting to his feet.

          DEAKINS
          Run him down.

          HALE
          Sprints after the leading Humvee. Deakins' Humvee closes fast.

          TERRY
          Looks back, sees Hale's predicament.

          TERRY
          Here!
          She slides the pistol along the truck roof.

          HALE
          Grabs the gun out of the air as...

          BAKER
          Slams on the brakes.

          TERRY
          Comes flying off the top, landing on the hood, barely holding on.

          HALE
          Is going to be crushed between the Humvees. He jumps up,
          turning, as the bumpers come together. He lands on the tailgate
          facing backwards and fires into Deakins' windshield.

          DEAKINS AND KELLY
          Kelly ducks below the dash and slams on the brakes but Deakins
          doesn't flinch. The bullets bounce off the glass --bulletproof.

          

          

          

          

           44.

          IN THE LEAD HUMVEE
          Baker sticks his gun out the window and aims at Terry and starts
          to pull the trigger when he stops, feeling a gun against the
          back of his head.

          HALE
          Is behind him. Hale gets into the passenger seat.

          HALE
          Gimme the gun and get out.

          BAKER

          (SMIRKING)
          I don't know. I think we got
          ourselves a little stand-off.

          HALE
          No, we don't.
          Hale shoots Baker in the thigh. Baker howls.

          TERRY
          Reaches forward and grabs Baker's gun as...

          HALE
          Kicks Baker out of the Humvee.

          BAKER
          Bad timing for him. He tumbles out, right in front of...

          DEAKINS' HUMVEE
          And is run over.

          HALE
          Holds the steering wheel, yells to Terry.

          HALE
          You drive!

          TERRY
          Climbs into the Humvee, takes the wheel from Hale. She jams
          Baker's gun into her belt.

          HALE
          I'd yell at you for coming after
          me, but you did just save my life.

          

          

          

          

           45.
          There's a look between them, then Hale climbs into the back. He
          finds what he is looking for -- a jerry can of gasoline and an
          emergency tool box.

          IN THE SECOND HUMVEE

          DEAKINS
          What're you doing, Hale?

          IN HALE AND TERRY'S HUMVEE
          Hale keeps his back to the other Humves. He pulls gaffer's tape
          off a roll, tears it with his teeth, grabs...

          A FLARE
          Out of the tool kit.

          IN THE SECOND HUMVEE

          KELLY
          Maybe he'll set off a nuke. That'd
          show us.

          BETWEEN THE HUMVEES
          Hale tosses the jerry can of gasoline out the back of the Humvee.

          THE JERRY CAN OF GASOLINE
          Flies through the air. There's a burning flare taped to the
          side of the plastic can.

          ECU TIP OF FLARE
          As the plastic of the can bubbles and melts and...

          IN THE SECOND HUMVEE

          DEAKINS
          Stop!
          But it's too late and...

          THE JERRY CAN
          Explodes.

          THE SECOND HUMVEE
          Skids to a stop, showered with burning gasoline. Deakins and
          his men bail out. Kelly, Johnson and Pritchett run for cover.

          DEAKINS
          Coolly grabs a fire extinguisher and starts spraying.

          

          

          

          

           46.

          IN HALE AND TERRYS HUMVEE
          Hale climbs up into the front seat. Terry looks at him,
          genuinely impressed.

          HALE
          We need somewhere to hide.

          TERRY

          (THINKS)
          I know a place.

          EXT. 4WD TRAIL

          Deakins keeps spraying the burning Humvee with foam.

          EXT. MINE ENTRANCE

          Terry and Hale have taken the Humvee to the parking area in
          front of an abandoned mine. The winch on the Humvee strains.
          The cable is attached to the handles on the padlocked metal
          doors. The doors are slowly pulling out, groaning.

          TERRY
          It was a copper mine, barely
          squeaking along for years. They
          shut it-down a few months ago when
          they hit an underground river.
          The hinges on the metal doors buckle and snap and the doors rip
          loose. Hale shuts down the winch, unhooks it from the doors.
          He motions for Terry to drive it in.

          INT. MINESHAFT ENTRANCE

          Terry drives the Humvee into the mineshaft entrance. Hale uses
          a flashlight to look around. He finds a switch a flips it. A
          gas generator comes to life. Another click and lights come on.
          Now they can see the rest of the entry area, including a wire-
          mesh-enclosed elevator. As Terry looks around, Hale grabs the
          Humvee radio, tries to tune in other frequencies, gives up.

          HALE
          They hardwired in their frequency.
          We can't call out.

          TERRY
          What are we gonna do?
          Hale goes to the back of the Humvee, pulls down the tailgate.

          HALE
          I'm gonna take away Deakins'
          reason for being here.
          Hale grabs a screwdriver from the tool kit and pries open a
          panel on the side of one of the B-83s.

          

          

          

          

           47.

          INSIDE PANEL
          There's an LCD DISPLAY, a NUMERIC KEYPAD and a CLOCK showing the
          current time. The keys are oversized and brightly colored.

          TERRY
          Fisher-Price makes nuclear weapons?

          HALE
          They're designed to be used by
          guys wearing gloves in Alaska.
          He reaches in, hits a key and the LCD display lights up.

          HALE
          These nukes have security codes.
          If you enter the wrong code three
          times, the nuke goes dead -- all
          the circuitry shorts out and shuts
          down. Kind of like the security
          systems with car radios.

          TERRY
          And people say the public doesn't
          benefit from defense spending.

          HALE

          (GRINS)
          Hand me the radio.
          Terry goes for the radio mike. Hale sees something.

          A PLASTIC NAME TAG
          Sticking out from under one of the nukes.

          HALE
          Pulls it out, looks at it.

          ECU NAMETAG
          It's from "St. Judes Hospital, Radiology Department."

          HALE AND TERRY
          Hale turns to Terry as she pulls over the radio mike.

          HALE
          Where's St. Judes Hospital?

          INT. 4WD TRAIL -- DEAKINS' HUMVEE

          The fire is out. The radio crackles.

          HALE (V.0.)
          Deak -- you there?

          

          

          

          

           48.
          Deakins and Kelly look at each other.

          HALE (V.O.)
          Ding, ding, ding, Deak. We're
          starting a new round. You took
          the first couple, but I've got you
          on the ropes now, you son of bitch.
          Deakins gets in the passenger side, grabs the radio mike.

          DEAKINS
          Hey, there. What was that last
          part? There was some static.
          (clicks off mike; to

          JOHNSON)
          Find them.
          (to Pritchett and

          KELLY)
          Let's go!
          Johnson pulls out a radiation detector scanner like the one
          Rhodes used. Kelly and Pritchett get back in the vehicle.

          CROSSCUT BETWEEN HALE AND DEAKINS
          Kelly drives Deakins' Humvee along the trail as they talk.

          HALE
          I know you're stalling while you
          try to find the nukes with your
          scanner, but you're gonna be too
          late. Hear that?
          Hale holds the radio mike up to the keypad as he enters numbers.

          HALE
          I'm entering the wrong code, you
          bastard. A couple more times and
          these are gonna be useless to you.

          DEAKINS
          You really got me there. I sure
          didn't think of that.
          Hale slows down -- something's wrong -- Deakins doesn't cars.

          DEAKINS
          All that time we spent in the
          cockpit together and you think I'm
          stupid? I got some new boards and
          circuits from a friend at Pantex.
          But nice try.
          Hale curses to himself. Terry looks at him. He shakes his head
          they're in trouble.

          

          

          

          

           49.

          DEAKINS
          You know, Hale, I thought of
          asking you to join me on this. You
          wanna know why I didn't?

          HALE
          Because I would've said no?

          DEAKINS
          I would've just killed you if you
          said no. I was more afraid you'd
          say yes. Because I knew I
          couldn't count on you. You can
          pretend you've got guts, but when
          and if it comes down to it, you're
          gonna run off crying like a little
          girl.

          HALE
          You better hope that's true, Doak.
          Because I've got the nukes, and
          there's nothing to stop me from
          entering the right code, if you
          know what I mean.

          DEAKINS
          (flash of worry)
          You wouldn't do that.

          HALE
          Nah. You're right. I wouldn't
          have the guts.
          END SPLIT-SCREEN. Hale drops the mike; looks at the elevator.

          HALE
          How deep is this mine?

          TERRY
          I don't know. A couple thousand
          feet.

          HALE
          That's deep enough.
          Hale opens the elevator gate.

          TERRY
          For what?

          HALE
          A nuclear explosion.
          Terry's jaw drops.

          

          

          

          

           50.

          EXT. 4WD TRAIL/ INT. DEAKINS' HUMVEE

          Kelly drives the blackened Humvee as fast as he can. Johnson
          looks at his scanner, grins.

          JOHNSON
          Got it! They're --

          DEAKINS
          In the mine.
          (off their looks)
          I could tell he was inside
          something. There was an echo.

          INT. MINE ENTRANCE

          Hale hurries to the back of the Humvee.

          TERRY
          We can still hide them!

          HALE
          He's got a scanner. He'd find
          them.

          TERRY
          You're talking about setting off
          a nuclear weapon!

          HALE
          They set them off underground in
          Nevada all through the fifties and
          sixties. There's no risk.

          TERRY
          Tell it to the two-headed cows.
          Hale grabs the straps around one of the nukes, pulls. He can
          barely move the thing. He turns to Terry.

          TERRY
          No! I am not helping you set off
          a nuclear weapon.

          HALE
          We won't be down there when it
          goes off. This isn't a suicide
          mission.

          TERRY
          No!

          

          

          

          

           51.

          HALE

          (IMPATIENT)
          All right. Fine. Though I think
          you should know, before I ejected,
          I heard Deakins say the nukes were
          going to be used to wipe out the
          last few remaining handicapped gay
          whales.
          Terry looks at him -- you asshole. Hale looks at her, very
          serious.

          HALE
          I need your help.
          Terry thinks, shakes her head, steps up and grabs the nuke.

          EXT. 4WD TRAIL

          The Humvee takes the turn-off to the mine entrance.

          INT. MINESHAFT ELEVATOR - DESCENDING

          Hale and Terry are going down with the nukes.

          HALE
          When we get to the bottom we'll
          have to get away from this shaft.
          It'll limit the amount of
          radiation released into-the
          atmosphere.

          EXT. MINE ENTRANCE

          Deakins's Humvee comes into the clearing. The Humvee stops and
          Deakins and Kelly jump out, followed by Pritchett and Johnson.

          EXT. MINE - BOTTOM OF ELEVATOR SHAFT

          The elevator comes down. Hale slides open the gate. He and
          Terry drag the nukes out.

          TERRY
          We'll each drag one down a tunnel?

          HALE
          No. I'm only going to set off one.
          We'll leave the other one here.
          It'll be buried under a billion
          tons of rock.
          They are startled when the elevator starts going up behind them

          HALE
          We better hurry.
          (nods down tunnel)
          Let's try down there.

          

          

          

          

           52.
          They start hauling the nuke down the tunnel.

          INT. MINE ENTRANCE

          Deakins, Pritchett, Kelly and Johnson wait by the elevator.

          PRITCHETT
          I can't wait to see how this fits
          into your plan.
          Deakins' charm peels away for an instant and he fixes Pritchett
          with a stare. Pritchett shrinks back.

          INT. PENTAGON SITUATION ROOM

          Baird, the Chairman and the others are watching large TV
          monitors. Creeley walks them through what they're looking at.

          ON THE MONITORS
          A wide-view, bird's-eye, thermal image of rocky terrain.

          CREELEY
          This is the KH-12 satellite's
          infrared view of the area. An
          exposed nuclear core would be
          relatively hot -- it'd show as a
          circle of bright white. As you
          can see, there's nothing. The
          only heat signatures we found were
          these.
          The image changes. There are four blotches, glowing a dull red.

          What's --?

          CREELEY
          We think it's Colonel Rhodes and
          his men. Their bodies.
          A look between Baird and the Chairman. The Chairman reaches for
          a phone.

          Wilkins is on the phone. Giles looks at him.

          WILKINS
          I understand, sir.

          GILES

          (WHISPERS)
          Was I right?
          Wilkins nods. Giles grins smugly for about half a second, then
          realizes what it really means.

          Oh, shit.

          Flying over Canyonlands.

          INT. MINESHAFT ELEVATOR - DESCENDING

          Deakins, Kelly and Johnson are in the elevator. Kelly holds a
          small metal briefcase.

          INT. END OF MINE TUNNEL

          Hale and Terry have stopped at the end of a tunnel. Hale has
          opened the guts of the nuke. He's pulling out a chip.

          TERRY
          How do you know how to do this?

          HALE
          Pilots who fly with nuclear
          weapons have standing orders to ...
          (quoting from the

          MANUAL)
          ... "retrieve if possible, disable
          if necessary and destroy if we
          must," and destroy I must.
          He stands, looks around. He sees...

          EYEBOLTS
          Screwed into the cross beaus on the ceiling.

          HALE
          I'm gonna need your belt and one
          of your socks.

          INT. BOTTOM OF ELEVATOR SHAFT

          The elevator descends into view. Deakins, Kelly and Johnson get
          out. They see the other nuke lying there.

          KELLY
          Send it up?

          DEAKINS
          (shakes head)
          Let's take care of Hale first.
          Spread out.

          

          

          

          

           54.

          INT. END OF MINE TUNNEL

          In one hand Hale holds Terry's sock, filled with sand. His
          other hand grips the eyebolt. Terry is giving Hale a log up,
          straining under the weight.

          TERRY
          Take your time. Really.
          Hale has pushed the open end of the sock through the eyebolt. He
          tightens a belt around the open end of the sock.

          HALE
          Okay.
          Terry lets Hale down. Hale picks up a big rock and loops the
          free end of the belt around it. Then he picks up a smaller rock.

          CLOSE ON NUCLEAR WEAPON
          One chip has been pulled out of a circuit board. Hale very
          gingerly lays the small rock on top of the chip.

          HALE
          We make a small hole in the sock,
          and when enough sand drains out --
          and we're hopefully in New
          Mexico -- the sock is pulled
          through the eyebolt, the rock
          drops...
          (re: smaller rock)
          ... hitting the rock on this chip,
          closing the firing circuit and
          that's it.
          Hale finishes putting the small rock in position. He stands.

          TERRY
          How much time are we going to have?

          HALE
          I don't know precisely. This
          isn't a Swiss sock. Ten minutes,
          maybe --
          Hale is cut off by...

          BULLETS
          Flying in, ricocheting off the rock walls, fired by...

          JOHNSON
          Thirty yards down the tunnel.

          

          

          

          

           55.

          HALE AND TERRY
          Dive to the ground. They pull pistols, start shooting.

          THE SOCK
          One of Johnson's bullets cuts through it.

          HALE
          Feels sand hitting his face, looks up.

          HIS POV
          Sand is draining out of the sock very fast.

          HALE AND TERRY
          Reaches up to grab the big rock, but Johnson sends a spray of
          bullets in. Terry grabs Hale.

          TERRY
          Come on!

          HALE
          The sock --
          More bullets. Terry pulls Hale. They run down a side passage.
          Hale and Terry fire back at Johnson as they run out of sight.

          JOHNSON
          Shoots after them, then runs up to the weapon. He reaches for
          the rock, stops -- maybe that'll set it off.

          THE SOCK
          The last sand pours out; the sock is sucked through the eye-bolt.

          THE ROCK
          Drops fast toward the nuke.

          A HAND
          Grabs it, stopping it just in time. The hand belongs to...

          DEAKINS
          He looks at Johnson in disgust, exhales, and tosses the rock. He
          pulls out a walkie-talkie, clicks on, talks into it.

          

          

          

          

           56.

          DEAKINS
          We're at the end of tunnel three.
          (clicks off; to

          JOHNSON)
          You two get this one set. I'll
          take the other one up.

          HALE AND TERRY
          Running along a tunnel.

          TERRY
          What do we do?

          HALE
          Beat 'em back to the elevator.
          Stop 'em from getting out.
          Terry nods. They hurry off around a corner and are met by...

          A FLURRY OF BULLETS
          Fired by...

          DEAKINS
          With his Uzi.

          HALE AND TERRY
          Run back down the side tunnel, bullets winging off the rock all
          around them, shooting back. Hale starts shooting out the
          lights, plunging the tunnel into darkness.

          DEAKINS
          Slows down.

          DEAKINS
          The bit with the sock was good.
          I like it. Still, I'm gonna use
          the the Field Expedient Tactical
          Timer. It's a little more precise.

          (BEAT)
          See, Hale -- you aren't the only
          one who's thought of setting off
          a nuke in this mine.

          BY THE NUKE
          Kelly is there with Johnson. Kelly flips on a lamp on a
          headstrap, giving him better light as he opens up the metal
          briefcase he's been carrying.

          INSIDE THE BRIEFCASE
          An elaborate electronic timer.

          

          

          

          

           57.

          IN THE TUNNELS
          Deakins pulls out a fresh clip.

          DEAKINS
          I need a demonstration. Otherwise,
          some swinging dick in Washington
          is going to say I don't have the
          balls or the ability to set off a
          nuclear weapon. I'm gonna show
          these puppies I'm ready, willing
          and able. Hell, I'm eager.
          Deakins jams in his clip, walks into the dark part of the tunnel.

          HALE AND TERRY
          In the dark, waiting to ambush Deakins and then...

          DEAKINS
          Opens fire -- but not at Hale and Terry -- at the cable along
          the ceiling connecting the lights. The cable snaps and
          electrical sparks shoot out, flooding the tunnel with light,
          showing...

          HALE AND TERRY
          Suddenly exposed to Deakins' fire. The bullets whiz in.

          DEAKINS
          The muzzle flashes from his Uzi give away his position and Hale
          and Terry's bullets scream in at him. He backs around a corner.

          HALE AND TERRY
          Take cover. It's a stand-off.

          DEAKINS
          Well, Hale, I better be going.
          Look at it this way, partner. If
          you wanted to get closer to God,
          you are about to get your wish.
          Hale hears Deakins' footsteps start off.

          HALE
          You're gonna ransom Salt Lake
          City, aren't you?
          The footsteps stop.

          DEAKINS
          What makes you think that?

          

          

          

          

           58.

          HALE
          That's where St. Judes Hospital
          is. You're gonna hide the nukes
          near the radiology department so
          they won't show up an any
          satellite radiation scans.

          DEAKINS
          I'm impressed.

          HALE
          How much are you gonna ask for?

          DEAKINS
          Enough. I've got a broker in
          Stockholm. Monday morning he's
          going to buy me five percent of
          Volvo. For the rest of my days
          I'm going to live off the
          dividends, happy in the knowledge
          I'm helping to build the safest
          car in the world.

          HALE
          So that's it? You're just doing
          'this for the money? I'm kind of
          disappointed.

          DEAKINS
          Why would you do it, Hale?

          HALE
          That's the thing -- I wouldn't.

          DEAKINS
          If you were me.

          HALE
          If I were you...?
          (thinks, starts in)
          Because ... because I got passed
          over for promotion and goddamnit
          I'm going to show the bastards
          that I'm smarter than them all.
          (getting angry)
          Because ... everyone's selling out
          and cashing in, so why not me?

          (ANGRIER)
          Because ... because my ex-wife was
          sleeping around. Because my
          parents abused me. Because I ate
          some sugar.

          HALE (cont'd)

          (FURIOUS)
          Because I don't like Mondays.
          (takes a breath,

          GRINS)
          It's all bullshit, Deak. There
          are no reasons. Not really.
          There's no difference between you
          and the guy who shoots up the
          schoolyard with an M-16. You both
          think you have reasons. You both
          think you were wronged. The
          truth? You're both just fucked in
          the head.

          DEAKINS' FACE
          Grim, evil -- fades into darkness as he turns and walks off.

          HALE AND TERRY
          They hear footsteps, receding. Hale bolts out of their hiding
          spot. Terry follows.

          INT. BOTTOM OF ELEVATOR SHAFT

          Deakins gets to the elevator, drags the other nuke in, shuts the
          gate and starts up.

          INT. END OF TUNNEL

          Kelly finishes keying in numbers into the nuke timer. An amber
          light comes on and...

          THE TIMER
          Starts ticking down from ton minutes.

          KELLY AND JOHNSON
          Grab their guns and run.

          INT. MINESHAFT ENTRANCE

          The elevator comes up. Deakins drags out the nuke, hits the
          DOWN button, shuts the gate. The elevator descends.

          DEAKINS
          Mr. Pritchett!

          INT. BOTTOM OF ELEVATOR SHAFT

          Hale and Terry are waiting for the elevator to come down when...

          Run in. A half-second of surprise is broken when...

          THE ELEVATOR
          Comes down.

          Unload with their Uzis.

          HALE AND TERRY
          Back around a corner, side by side, shooting their pistols.

          JOHNSON
          Is shot, drops.

          KELLY
          Grabs Johnson's Uzi and, firing both guns, backs to the
          elevator, kicks open the gate with his foot and gets inside. He
          hits the UP button with the butt of one of the guns and the
          elevator starts to rise.

          HALE AND TERRY
          Step out of the tunnel and fire on the climbing elevator.

          TERRY
          We can go back, try to shut it
          down.

          HALE
          We don't know the code, and Deak'd
          have it wired to blow if we so
          much as look at it funny.

          TERRY
          Then we're...
          Hale looks at her.

          

          

          

          

           61.

          HALE
          I'm sorry. I shouldn't've let you
          come.

          TERRY
          Oh, God.
          Hale takes Terry in his arms, holds her.

          TERRY
          I ... I just hope someone
          remembers to feed my dog.
          Hale nods, hugs Terry. Terry starts to say something else, but
          Hale puts a finger to his lips -- he's heard something -- a
          distant rushing.

          HALE
          Come on.
          Hale pulls Terry, running, down the far tunnel.

          TERRY
          What're you --?

          HALE
          You said they shut down the mine
          when they hit an underground river.

          INT. MINESHAFT ENTRANCE

          Deakins slams the tailgate on the Humvee shut. From the
          distance, he and Pritchett hear the whump-whump-whump of a
          helicopter. Deakins motions Pritchett to stay.

          Deakins comes out, looks up, sees...

          INT. MINE TUNNEL

          Hale and Terry run up. The tunnel comes to an end at a big
          hole. The rushing sound comes from the hole. They step up
          to the edge and look down.

          THEIR POV
          Dark water rushes by ten feet below them.

          HALE
          Any idea where it goes?

          TERRY
          No.
          They look at each other. They don't have any choice. They
          flick on their flashlights and jump. They-hit the water and are
          swept from view.

          INT. MINESHAFT ENTRANCE

          Deakins enters, motions for Pritchett to get into the Humvee.

          DEAKINS
          Get in. We're leaving.

          PRITCHETT
          (re: Kelly and

          JOHNSON)
          Aren't you going to wait for them?

          DEAKINS
          No time. And if they get out,
          they might talk. Fortunately,
          there's something wrong with the
          elevator.
          Deakins opens fire with his Uzi on the generator. Sparks fly
          and the thing shuts down.

          Kelly is jarred when the elevator stops and the lights dim.

          Deakins and Pritchett drive out of the mine in the Humvee.
          Deakins punches the trip odometer, setting it to zeroes.

          Kelly switches on his headlamp.

          Jutting down like knives, ready-to rip then open.

          HALE AND TERRY
          Dodge them, push off, duck under. And then they notice that...

          THE CEILING
          Is getting lower, getting closer to the surface of the water.
          They're running out of breathing room. Three feet, two feet,
          one foot. They take big breaths, maybe their last, and
          they're...

          UNDERWATER
          Tumbling along, pulled at by the eddies, flashlights showing
          their faces -- they are running out of air. And then, there's
          light above them in the water.

          Lungs bursting, they start kicking up.

          sideview mirror at...

          

          

          

          

           64.

          THE NEST HELICOPTER
          Closing in on him.

          PRITCHETT
          Is holding on tight as Deakins drives wildly.

          PRITCHETT
          I think I've finally figured out
          your plan. Those guys in the
          helicopter are going to kill us,
          but we're going to rise from the
          dead and

          DEAKINS
          Very suddenly and very violently lashes out. The side of his
          hand hits Pritchett in the throat.

          PRITCHETT
          Gags silently, suddenly unable to get any air. He pulls at his
          throat, even pounds himself in the back of the neck. No go. He
          slowly slumps, dying, skin turning blue.

          DEAKINS
          Maybe now you'll shut up.

          EXT. 4WD TRAIL

          Deakins barrels along in the Humvee, the NEST helicopter getting
          closer behind him.

          IN THE HUMVEE
          Deakins has a thought and looks over at Pritchett, dead, held up
          by the seatbelt.

          DEAKINS
          I just realized I've never killed
          anyone before. I mean, I dropped
          bombs on Baghdad, but never face
          to face.

          Runs up, starts entering numbers into the timer keypad.

          INT./EXT. NEST HELICOPTER

          The NEST helicopter closes fast on Deakins. They are a couple
          hundred feet above him, a quarter mile back.

          HUNT
          Let him know we're here!

          EXT. 4WD TRAIL

          A line of bullets kicks up dust in front of Deakins' Humvee.

          Deakins looks at...

          THE TRIP ODOMETER
          It clicks over from 2.9 to 3.0 miles.

          DEAKINS
          Grins, steps on the brakes.

          EXT. 4WD TRAIL

          The Humvee stops and Deakins gets out, arms above his head.

          THE NEST HELICOPTER
          A hundred feet in the air, slowly coming in toward Deakins.

          Sits back on the floor, takes a breath.

          Deakins is watching the helicopter. Strangely, he is grinning.
          Then the camera CLOSES IN fast on...

          DEAKINS' HAND
          He's holding a small black box. He presses a button and...

          Kelly hears a click. He looks over at...

          THE TIMER
          The red light goes out. The amber light comes on. A splitsecond
          later, the green light comes on.

          The screen goes white.

          Watching the helicopter, listening to Hunt over the loudspeaker.

          Rises up beneath Deakins.

          HIGH ANGLE - WIDE SHOT
          The ripples of the shockwave shoot out from the mine, shaking
          dust and dirt into the air with an incredible, deafening roar.

          INT. NEST HELICOPTER

          There's a roar of static over everyone's headphones and then
          every light, every piece of electronic equipment shuts down.

          HUNT
          No...!
          They plummet.

          EXT. COLORADO RIVER RIVER BANK

          Terry and Hale are pulling themselves out of the water when the
          shockwave hits, knocking them off their feet.

          INT. MCMURRAN CONTROL ROOM

          Wilkins and Giles hear the sudden rumble and then the shockwave
          hits, knocking stuff off desks, swinging lamps.

          Deakins and the Humvee land. In the b.g...

          THE NEST HELICOPTER
          Drops out of sight behind a rock formation. There's an
          explosion and a ball of fire shoots up.

          EXT. COLORADO RIVER - RIVER BANK

          Terry looks over at Hale -- holy shit.

          INT. MCMURRAN CONTROL ROOM

          The lamps are still swinging.

          GILES
          That's all we need. A goddamn
          earthquake.

          WILKINS
          Son, I was at the Nevada Test site
          in the fifties. That wasn't an
          earthquake.

          EXT. 4WD TRAIL

          Deakins picks himself up.

          DEAKINS
          (to himself)
          At least I know they work.

          INT. MCMURRAN CONTROL ROOM

          Wilkins grabs a phone. Giles is pacing, freaked.

          WILKINS
          (into phone)
          Get me the Room.

          GILES
          I have to get out of here.

          WILKINS
          You're going to be fine. It was
          underground.
          (into phone)
          Colonel Wilkins for General
          Creeley.

          GILES
          How do you know?

          WILKINS
          For one thing, if it was above
          ground, it wouldn't have caused
          the same kind of ground tremor.
          For another, if it was above
          ground, we'd all be blind and
          dying.
          (into phone)
          Sir, we've just had a detonation.

          INT. PENTAGON -- SITUATION ROOM

          Bedlam. People yelling. The Chairman is huddling with Baird.

          BAIRD
          How'd that happen?

          CHAIRMAN
          I don't know, but thank God it
          happened underground.

          BAIRD
          What do we do now?

          CHAIRMAN
          First thing we do is put a huge
          goddamn lid on this thing. With
          all due respect to your boy Giles
          and his belief in honesty as the
          best policy, from now on and until
          the end of time, what happened in
          Utah tonight was an earthquake.
          All right?
          Baird nods.

          EXT. 4WD TRAIL

          The Humvee races along the trail.

          

          

          

          

           69.

          IN THE HUMVEE
          Deakins and the dead Pritchett motor along. Deakins turns to
          Pritchett as if Pritchett had just asked him a question.

          DEAKINS
          The helicopter? It was hit by
          EMP. Electromagnetic pulse. It's
          released in a nuclear detonation.
          It wipes out anything electronic
          for miles. That"s another reason
          I wanted to set off a nuke. I
          knew it'd bring down any
          helicopters coming for us. It'll
          also shut down all radio
          communications for a few hours,
          which will severely screw up their
          response.

          (GRINS)
          You see, Mr. Pritchett? There
          really is nothing for you to worry
          about.
          Pritchett's body seems to nod from the motion of the Humvee.

          EXT. COLORADO RIVER - RIVER BANK


          BUTTERFLIES
          Hover and dance over the water in the early morning light.

          HALE
          Hale has his shirt off and is wringing it out.

          TERRY (O.S.)
          Goddamn it!
          He turns to see Terry trying to undo her buttons but unable to
          her fingers are too numb.

          TERRY
          Stupid buttons. I hate these
          shirts. They're ugly and stupid
          and --
          Terry suddenly starts crying. It's not the shirt she's upset
          about. Hale holds her.

          HALE
          It's okay.

          TERRY
          We just ... I mean, we almost...

          HALE
          I know.

          

          

          

          

           70.

          TERRY
          A nuclear bomb went off.

          HALE
          That it did.

          TERRY
          Are we...?

          HALE
          Look.
          (points at

          BUTTERFLIES)
          If the butterflies are okay, then
          we'll be okay.

          TERRY
          Really?

          HALE
          Absolutely. It says so in the
          manual. "If you see butterflies
          after a detonation, you are fine."
          Terry looks at Hale. She knows he's bullshitting her, but she
          appreciates it. They look at each other. They could kiss ...
          but they both shy away from it. Terry gets her shirt off.

          HALE
          We better get moving. We might be
          able to reach Deakins when he gets
          to the river.
          They start off along a trail by the river.

          HALE
          Something I've been meaning to ask.
          (Terry looks at him)
          How did someone like you end up
          with a gun?

          TERRY
          I hit a bankrobber with a frozen
          chicken.

          HALE
          Excuse me?

          TERRY
          I came out here one summer during
          college. It was the campaign to
          stop the dam in the Grand Canyon.
          I loved it here. I came back,
          worked as a river guide and
          eventually stayed year-round. When
          a Park Ranger job came open, I
          applied.

          

          

          

          

           71.

          HALE
          I'm still waiting for the chicken.

          TERRY
          The local Parks Department wasn't
          sure how I'd do with the law
          enforcement part of the job. Well,
          one night I was coming home from
          the store and Tommy Drewson part
          of the local brain trust was
          robbing old Bob Kearney in front
          of the ATM. I bear old Bob
          yelling and I see Tommy heading
          for his car, so I tossed a bag of
          groceries at him at thirty miles
          an hour. A frozen chicken in the
          bag hit him in the forehead and he
          dropped like a rock. Next thing
          I know, I'm a Ranger.
          Hale looks at Terry with a new appreciation.

          EXT. 4WD TRAIL

          Deakins pilots the Humvee along the trail.

          EXT. COLORADO RIVER - RIVERBANK TRAIL

          Hale and Terry are crouching behind a rock, looking down.

          THEIR POV
          A zodiac raft has been pulled up on the river bank. A man with
          an Uzi -- SHEPPARD -- waits, duffel bag by his feet.

          TERRY
          Get me a frozen Zacky's fryer and
          he's a dead man.
          There's the sound of an approaching engine. Sheppard stands,
          gun ready. The engine stops. A few seconds later...

          DEAKINS
          Appears, walking down a footpath toward Sheppard.

          SHEPPARD
          Where is everyone?

          DEAKINS
          I am everyone. Let's go.
          Sheppard hurries to Deakins. They disappear up the footpath.

          

          

          

          

           72.

          HALE AND TERRY

          HALE
          Shit.

          TERRY
          What?

          HALE
          We're the only ones who know
          what's going on, and I don't have
          the faintest idea how we're gonna
          stop them.

          TERRY
          You'll think of something.

          HALE
          Why do you say that?

          TERRY
          You have so far.
          Hale looks at Terry -- she's right. But it almost pisses him
          off more than it gives him confidence. He grumbles to himself
          and starts off down toward the raft.

          TERRY
          Sink it?

          HALE
          Steal it.
          They get down to the raft. They climb in. Hale grabs the
          engine throttle, slumps.

          HALE
          Keys.
          Hale looks around, spots Sheppard's duffel bag lying on the
          riverbank. He hops out and starts rummaging through it when
          they hear grunting and feet approaching.
          Hale looks around for a place to hide. There isn't any. Terry
          tries to get out of the raft, but she trips on a tarpaulin
          bunched on the bottom of the raft. she drops.

          WITH DEAKINS AND SHEPPARD
          Coming down a path, lugging the last remaining nuke.

          THEIR POV
          Of the raft. Hale and Terry are nowhere to be seen.

          

          

          

          

           73.

          HALE
          Is alone, in the water, on the far side of the raft, very
          silent. He hears Deakins and Sheppard load the nuke into the
          raft.

          SHEPPARD (O.S.)
          Why were you driving around with
          a dead guy?

          DEAKINS (O.S.)
          Because I like him. He doesn't
          ask a lot of annoying questions.
          All right?
          A few seconds later the engine starts up. Hale ducks down under
          water as the raft takes off over him. He surfaces to watch the
          raft zooming off into the distance. He is very worried.

          ON THE RAFT - MOVING
          The nuke is on a pallet in the middle of the raft. Sheppard
          pilots the raft. Deakins looks around, sees what he wants.

          A TARP
          Is lying on the deck of the raft along one side, all bunched up.
          It'd be the kind of thing you'd hide under.

          DEAKINS
          Grabs the tarp and pulls.

          UNDER THE TARP
          There's no one there.

          DEAKINS
          Throws the tarp over the nuke. As he does, we PAN OVER to...

          A LONG CRATE MARKED "LIFE JACKETS"
          Strapped to one of the side pontoons. A small triangle of cloth
          is sticking out from inside the crate -- like the corner of a
          shirt. It's quickly pulled out of sight from within.

          BACK ON THE RIVERBANK
          Hale climbs out of the water and looks around, not knowing quite
          what to do.

          EXT. LAKE POWELL - TRANSFER POINT

          The zodiac boat is on the shore. Sheppard and four man -- call
          them the GUNMEN -- are hauling the nuke to the truck. Deakins
          walks with another man -- MAX, 50s. Max checks his watch.

          

          

          

          

           74.

          MAX
          Your friends in Washington should
          be getting the package about now.

          DEAKINS
          I wish I could see their faces.

          INT. PENTAGON - SITUATION ROOM

          Baird, the Chairman, Creeley and the others are all staring
          slack-jawed at a TV screen.

          ON THE TV
          Camcorder shot of Deakins against a black backdrop.

          DEAKINS
          ... two-hundred-and-fifty million
          dollars, by nine a.m. Utah time.
          The depositing instructions are in
          the envelope that came with this
          tape. This deadline is not
          negotiable, and there is no grace
          period. The device is on a timer.
          Shortly after you receive this,
          the timer will be activated. At
          nine a.m., I will make a call. If
          I find out you've done as you've
          been told, I will stop the timer.
          If you have not complied --
          The screen suddenly cuts to a flurry of images of nuclear
          destruction -- buildings being knocked sideways, mushroom
          clouds, shockwaves, fires.

          CHAIRMAN
          Turn that off!

          EXT. LAKE POWELL

          Hale runs along the shoreline, headed for...

          A MARINA
          Where houseboats are rented out. Hale's eyes focus on a sign
          with a picture of a phone on it.

          EXT. LAKE POWELL - TRANSFER POINT

          The back gate of the truck is shut from the inside. The truck
          starts up and rumbles off, slowly at first.

          Jumps up from the raft and runs after the truck, staying right
          behind. She grabs a handhold and pulls herself up. She holds
          on tight as the truck bounces off down the dirt road.

          INT. PENTAGON SITUATION ROOM

          Loud voices and crosstalk. Baird is on the phone, nodding.

          BAIRD
          Yes, sir.
          Creeley's phone rings. He answers it.

          CREELEY
          Creeley.

          BAIRD
          (covers phone; to

          CHAIRMAN)
          The President wants to know if we
          know where the device is headed.

          CHAIRMAN
          If Deakins had a plane waiting, it
          could be anywhere. We just don't
          know.

          CREELEY
          I do.
          (all eyes on him)
          Major Hale is alive. According to
          him, Colonel Deakins is headed for
          Salt Lake City.

          EXT. LAKE POWELL - MARINA

          Army helicopters are landing near the marina. Two are already
          down. One has TROOPS standing outside of it.

          HALE, WILKINS AND GILES
          Are walking toward the second helicopter.

          WILKINS
          We found the raft on the other
          side of the lake. Tracks from a
          heavy truck ran out when they hit
          the paved road.

          HALE
          If we get a rad scanner we can
          track them.
          A brief look between Wilkins and Giles.

          WILKINS
          Actually, Major, we're going back
          to McMurran.

          HALE
          What?

          

          

          

          

           76.

          GILES
          We'd just like to ask you a few
          questions.

          HALE
          I'm not wasting time answering
          questions. We've got --

          WILKINS
          No debate, Major. I was given
          orders. Now, you can come with us,
          or you can go with them.
          Wilkins nods over at the other helicopter. The troops standing
          in front of it are MPs. Hale looks at Wilkins, astounded.

          EXT./INT. WILKINS' HELICOPTER - IN FLIGHT

          Wilkins is up front with the pilot. Hale and Giles are in back.
          All wear headsets. Hale is yelling at Wilkins.

          HALE
          Deakins thinks I'm dead. He
          thinks it's over. You've got to
          let me go after him. I can help.
          I know how his mind works.

          WILKINS
          Major, I know this is personal for
          you, but I think we can handle it.
          We're putting a wall of men and
          machines around Salt Lake City as
          we speak. That truck is not
          getting through.

          INT. TRUCK


          CLOSE ON THE NUCLEAR WEAPON
          Dusty slices of light come through the truck's slatted walls.
          The nuclear weapon is lashed to a hammock, straps running off to
          D-rings on the sides. Max is hooking up an electronic timer.

          INT. WILKINS' HELICOPTER


          HALE
          What about the Ranger?

          GILES
          What about her?

          HALE
          When you find that truck, you'll
          hit it hard. Chances are she'll
          be killed in the crossfire.
          "Regrettable but unavoidable."

          

          

          

          

           77.
          Giles and Wilkins share a look -- Hale is right.

          HALE
          Look, she's not supposed to be
          there. She should be checking
          camping permits, finding lost
          kids. She...

          (BEAT)
          She saved my life.
          Giles wants to help. So does Wilkins, but...

          WILKINS
          We were ordered to take you back
          to McMurran. You understand what
          orders are, don't you, Major?
          Wilkins turns away. Hale sits back, mind racing, not knowing
          what to do. He quickly grabs a pistol from the helicopter's
          weapons rack and puts it to Wilkin's neck.

          WILKINS
          Major, put that away or say
          goodbye to your career and hello
          to twenty years in Leavenworth.

          HALE
          If that's what it takes.

          WILKINS
          You'll have to shoot me.
          Hale thinks, but there's no way he can do that. He lowers the
          gun, sits back.
          Giles gets Hale's attention, then points to his own head. Hale
          doesn't understand, so Giles grabs Hale's gunhand and puts the
          gun up to his head.

          GILES
          Colonel! How about this?
          Wilkins looks back, sees Hale holding the gun to Giles' head.

          HALE
          (bad acting)
          I swear to God I'll shoot.
          Wilkins grins.

          INT. TRUCK

          Max finishes hooking up the timer. He looks at Deakins.

          MAX
          Ready when you are.

          

          

          

          

           78.

          DEAKINS
          Wait until I get back. I'm going
          to check on Sheppard.
          Deakins goes to a ladder that leads up to the ceiling.

          INT. WILKIN'S HELICOPTER

          Hale is looking back and forth between what he sees out the
          window and the map on his lap.

          WILKINS
          I don't know what you're looking
          for, Major. Every road between
          here and salt Lake has already
          been sealed.

          HALE
          Deak would know that. Maybe he's
          not on the road.
          Wilkins doesn't understand.

          HALE
          They were using maps like these to
          set up the roadblocks?

          WILKINS
          Yes...?

          HALE
          Then that's the answer.
          Wilkins doesn't understand. Hale points outside, down at...

          TRAIN TRACKS
          On the ground. Old ones, half-covered by weeds.

          HALE
          It's an old spur. Probably hasn't
          been used in twenty years. Nobody
          bothered to put it on the new maps.

          WILKINS
          What are you --?

          HALE
          The nuke isn't in a truck,
          Colonel. It's on a train.

          EXT. TRAIN

          A freight train -- engine, a car carrier (carrying a load of
          Toyotas), several boxcars and a caboose. A hatch opens up an
          the roof of one of the boxcars near the tail of the train and...

          

          

          

          

           79.

          DEAKINS
          Climbs out and we discover that indeed they are not in a truck,
          they're in a train. The "nuke boxcar" has a small satellite
          dish mounted on the roof.

          THE FOUR GUNMEN
          Are in position at points along the train, ready with Uzis.

          INT. WILKINS' HELICOPTER

          Wilkins hangs up the radio mike.

          WILKINS
          Radio's still down. We'll head
          north, look for a phone, then look
          for a train.
          Giles nods. Hale is thinking. Wilkins starts to tell the pilot.

          HALE
          No. Go south.

          GILES
          Salt Lake is north.

          HALE
          He's not going to Salt Lake.

          GILES
          But you said it would be Salt
          Lake. You found that hospital tag.

          HALE
          He planted that. He wanted
          whoever found it to think that's
          where he was going.
          (Shakes head)
          He's been doing a rope-a-dope.
          Giles and Wilkins look at him like he's nuts.

          HALE
          It's a boxing term. When Ali --
          Look, I know this guy. If
          everything has been saying he's
          heading north, then he's heading
          south.
          They look at him, then Wilkins grabs the map.

          WILKINS
          What's south of here?

          

          

          

          

           80.

          ECU MAP
          Wilkins' finger follows the train line on the map. It goes
          right into Las Vegas.

          HALE
          No. Not Vegas. What the hell is
          there to blow up in Vegas?
          Wilkins' finger keeps moving on the map.

          GILES
          The President.
          Wilkins' finger stops.

          EXT. TRAIN

          Deakins jumps the gap between two boxcars and walks on. We
          ANGLE DOWN to reveal...

          TERRY
          Crouching down between the two cars.

          INT. TRAIN ENGINE - DRIVER'S COMPARTMENT

          Sheppard is working with a torch, welding the brake and
          accelerator controls. Deakins enters. Sheppard turns the torch
          down. Deakins lights a cigarette off it.

          DEAKINS
          How much longer?

          SHEPPARD
          Almost done.

          INT. TRAIN ENGINE ENGINE AREA

          Behind the driver's compartment is the engine itself, with
          walkways along either side.

          TERRY
          Creeps-up to one of the doors that lead into the driver's
          compartment. She hears...

          SHEPPARD (O.S.)
          How long until the helicopter gets
          here?

          INT. DRIVER'S COMPARTMENT


          DEAKINS
          Five minutes. We'll leave from
          the boxcar roof.

          

          

          

          

           81.
          Deakins turns to go.

          INT. TRAIN ENGINE - ENGINE AREA

          Deakins opens the door and strides along beside the engine.

          TERRY
          Is hiding on the other side of the engine, very quiet and still.
          As Deakins goes out the back door of the engine, Terry follows.

          EXT. TRAIN - BETWEEN ENGINE AND BOXCAR

          Terry comes out the door and is about to step across to the
          ladder on the boxcar when we PULL BACK to reveal...

          DEAKINS
          As he puts a gun to the back of Terry's head.

          EXT. GAS STATION AND MINI-MART

          A RANCHER comes out of the mini-mart with a cup of coffee and
          heads for his old pickup truck. He starts to open his door when
          he hears, incongruously, whump-whump-whump. He looks up as...

          WILKINS' HELICOPTER
          Comes in, gets about three feet off the ground and Giles jumps
          out. As Giles runs to a payphone, the helicopter pulls up and
          flies away, leaving the Rancher agog.

          INT. NUKE BOXCAR

          Terry comes down the ladder from the hatch, followed by Deakins
          with a gun.

          DEAKINS
          Terry, Max. Max, Terry.

          MAX
          (to Terry)
          A pleasure.
          (to Deakins)
          What the hell is a "Terry" and why
          is it still live?

          DEAKINS
          She asked me how I thought I was
          going to get away with this and I
          thought I'd tell her.
          (to Terry)
          We're going to a cabin in the
          mountains, not far from here. When
          we get there I'm gonna make two
          phone calls.

          DEAKINS (cont'd)
          The first is to the Pentagon. I'm
          gonna tell them where the train
          is.

          (GRINS)
          See, all their forces are up at
          Salt Lake by now. By the time
          they could get a F-15 down here
          the train will be on the outskirts
          of Vegas. And I'll remind them
          about the impact trigger -- if
          they hit this train hard, the
          nuke'll blow.
          (shakes head)
          They won't have any choice.
          They'll have to let the train get
          into the city and because of that,
          they'll have to pay.

          TERRY
          You said two phone calls.

          DEAKINS
          The second will be to my bank in
          Geneva. If the money's in my
          account, I use this...
          (pulls out what looks
          like a modified cell-

          PHONE)
          ... and shut down the timer. If
          not, we sit back, put on some
          shades and get a quick tan.

          TERRY
          But -- radio isn't working.

          DEAKINS
          You saw the dish on the roof?
          Microwave. It's not affected by
          EMP. See? I really have thought
          of everything.

          MAX
          You kept her alive just so you can
          impress her with how smart you are?

          DEAKINS
          (to Max)
          No, I kept her alive because I
          want her to do me a favor. See,
          if something goes wrong and this
          thing goes off, a half a million
          people are going to be vaporized.
          I don't want that on my
          conscience. So I'm not going to
          arm the nuke.

          The room is silent. Everyone is looking at video monitors

          DEAKINS
          Nine ... Then pound ... Good. Now

          ECU TERRY'S EYES
          Filled with tears. She blinks and...

          QUICK CUTS
          Terry has visions of RETIREES in Vegas, watering potted plants
          outside their motor home, of TEENAGERS ragging on each other as
          they walk to school, of CHILDREN in a playground.

          DEAKINS

          And Terry shakingly pushing each button and then...
          The images of the retirees, the teenagers and the children each
          bleach out to white, fast, as if hit by a nuclear blast.

          DEAKINS
          Then ENTER and it's done.

          TERRY
          Her finger hovers over the ENTER button, almost pushes it, then
          shifts to CANCEL and pushes that.

          The display goes blank.

          Stunned. He shakes his head.

          DEAKINS
          Ooh. You really shouldn't have
          done that. I said I would kill
          you, and I will.

          TERRY
          I'm gonna be dead either way. I
          don't want any part of this.
          Deakins shrugs -- he sees her logic. He puts his gun to Terry's
          head. Terry shuts her eyes.

          DEAKINS
          Night-night.
          Deakins is about to pull the trigger when Max stops him. Max
          gestures -- listen. They hear a helicopter approaching. Max
          checks his watch.

          DEAKINS
          They're early.
          Just then, they hear gunfire. Max gives Deakins a look.

          DEAKINS
          It's not a problem. Set the
          timer, then kill her. Have fun
          with it.
          Deakins starts climbing up the ladder to the hatch.

          Presses ENTER and finishes setting the timer.

          MAX
          There.

          TERRY AND MAX
          Terry swings hard and fast with the wrench, knocking the gun out
          of Max's hand. Max spins, and when Terry swings at him again.
          Max kicks the wrench out of her hand, then steps up fast and
          hits Terry under the chin with the heel of his hand. She drops
          straight back.

          MAX
          Thought I was just friendly old
          Max, huh? Lady, I was a Navy SEAL.
          You should see what I can do with
          just my thumb.
          Max goes for his gun.

          TERRY'S HAND
          Grabs onto something. It's the wrench.

          TERRY AND MAX
          As Max turns back with the gun, Terry heaves the wrench. It
          hits Max square in the forehead. He drops like a rock.

          TERRY
          Yeah? Well, you should see what
          I can do with just a chicken.

          EXT. TRAIN - CABOOSE

          Deakins joins his man on top of the caboose, firing on Wilkins,
          helicopter.

          INT. HELICOPTER

          Wilkins and Hale are returning fire. Hale points at Deakins.

          HALE
          That's him!

          

          

          

          

           86.

          WILKINS
          (to pilot)
          Get him!

          PILOT
          They've got guns!

          WILKINS
          You've got a helicopter. Use it!

          EXT. TRAIN

          Deakins and the gunman keep firing on the helicopter as...

          THE HELICOPTER
          Comes swooping in.

          DEAKINS
          Sees what's going to happen and turns and runs as...

          THE HELICOPTER
          Drops down beside the train. The rotor blades whip about three
          feet over the train roof and the pilot starts forward.

          DEAKINS AND THE GUNMAN
          Run from the blades as fast as they can.

          THE HELICOPTER
          Closes fast.

          DEAKINS AND THE GUNMAN
          Jump from car to car. The gunman passes Deakins. Just when the
          helicopter blades are about to catch up to Deakins...

          DEAKINS
          Jumps down between two boxcars and the rotor blades go right
          over his head. Deakins hears an awful sound and a scream cut
          short.

          HELICOPTER POV
          Swooping fast over the train when suddenly...

          TERRY
          Pops up out of the hatch, her back to the helicopter.

          HALE (O.S.)
          Pull up!

          

          

          

          

           87.

          THE HELICOPTER
          Pulls up fast.

          TERRY
          Watches the helicopter bank away. Bullets-start whizzing by her.

          DEAKINS
          Has climbed up and is shooting at her.

          TERRY
          Runs away from Deakins, shooting Max's pistol behind her blindly.

          TWO GUNMEN
          Appear two cars ahead of Terry and start toward her, shooting.

          TERRY
          Is caught between Deakins and the gunmen with no way out when...

          THE HELICOPTER
          Comes along the length of the train, flying low. It rises up
          and there's...

          HALE
          Hanging from the helicopter on a cable hooked to a harness and
          he's firing a pistol, shooting right over Terry at...

          THE FIRST GUNMAN
          He's hit, falls off the train.

          THE SECOND GUNMAN
          Aims at Terry and starts firing.

          TERRY
          The bullets rip up the boxcar roof around her. She jumps up and
          grabs onto...

          HALE
          As he swings in on the cable, shooting his pistol.

          HALE AND TERRY
          Are lifted up and over...

          

          

          

          

           88.

          THE SECOND GUNMAN
          Who turns, firing a shotgun. Hale's bullets find him. He falls.

          SHEPPARD
          Appears, firing an Uzi at Hale, Terry and the helicopter.

          IN THE HELICOPTER
          Bullets rip through. Wilkins is hit, knocked back.

          THE CABLE HOLDING HALE AND TERRY
          Is severed by one of Sheppard's bullets.

          HALE AND TERRY
          Drop ten feet to the roof of a boxcar. Hale shoots as they fall.

          SHEPPARD
          Is hit and drops.

          THE HELICOPTER
          Banks away fast, making ugly sounds, smoke billowing out. The
          engine cuts out and the helicopter drops to a hard landing
          beside the tracks.

          HALE AND TERRY
          Watch the helicopter land as the train rolls on. They look at
          each other.

          TERRY
          You stop the nuke. I'll stop the
          train.
          Hale nods. Terry starts forward, then turns.

          TERRY
          I'd yell at you for coming after
          me, but you did just save my life.
          Hale grins. They hear a helicopter in the distance. They look
          over to see...

          A RED CROSS HELICOPTER
          Coming in fast.

          HALE AND TERRY
          Any excitement turns to confusion when they see...

          

          

          

          

           89.

          A MAN
          Standing in the doorway of the Red Cross helicopter, holding a
          gun.

          TERRY
          That's Deakins' escape route.

          HALE
          Not any more.
          Terry nods. They share a last look, then Terry heads off. Male
          coils up the winch cable, slings it over his shoulder and heads
          for the nuke boxcar and his old friend Deakins. He picks up...

          THE SHOTGUN
          Left by deceased Gunman #2.

          EXT. CAR CARRIER

          Makes her way past the Toyotas.

          EXT. WILKINS' HELICOPTER - BESIDE TRAIN TRACKS

          Wilkins and the pilot stand outside their disabled helicopter.
          The train is way off in the distance. They hear honking and
          turn to see...

          A PICKUP TRUCK
          Tearing toward then along a dirt road, horn honking.

          CLOSE ON PICKUP
          The RANCHER from the mini-mart is driving; Giles beside him.

          INT. TRAIN ENGINE - DRIVER'S COMPARTMENT

          Terry comes into the driver's compartment. She tugs at the
          brake and accelerator levers. It's useless. She looks around,
          spots a cigarette lighter.

          INT. BOXCAR

          Deakins and the one remaining GUNMAN hear the helicopter. They
          start toward the ladder to the roof hatch when they hear
          footsteps on the roof of the car. Deakins gestures to the
          gunman. He raises his gun, trying to figure out where to shoot.
          Then they hear someone tugging at the hatch handle. The gunman
          opens fire on the hatch.

          EXT. ON TOP OF BOXCAR

          Bullets stream up through the hatch cover, but Hale is nowhere
          in sight. One end of Hale's helicopter winch cable is tied to
          the hatch cover.

          

          

          

          

           90.
          We follow the cable fast, over to the side of the boxcar to
          find...

          HALE
          Standing, tugging on the cable, still attached to the harness.
          Hale racks a load in the shotgun and jumps back off the side of
          the train.

          INT. BOXCAR

          The gunman hears a sound, starts to turn, just as...

          HALE
          Swings into the boxcar on the cable, firing the shotgun.

          THE GUNMAN
          Is picked up by the blast and smashed back through the wood slat
          wall of the boxcar and out of the train.

          DEAKINS
          Climbs up fast through the hatch to the roof.

          HALE
          Shoots at Deakins, misses. The shotgun clicks empty. Hale
          tosses the gun then unhooks the cable from the harness. He
          drops to the floor-of the boxcar and runs to the ladder.

          EXT. CAR CARRIER

          Terry has a three-foot length of gasoline-soaked cloth stuffed
          into the gas tank opening of a Toyota on the lower level of the
          car carrier. She lights it and hurries off.

          EXT. ROOF OF TRAIN

          Deakins steadies himself as...

          THE RED CROSS HELICOPTER
          Hovers in sideways toward the train. The MAN in the doorway
          holds out a hand to Deakins.

          DEAKINS
          Is reaching for the man's hand and grabs it when...

          HALE
          Reaches out of the hatch and grabs onto Deakins' foot.

          

          

          

          

           91.

          HALE AND DEAKINS
          Deakins kicks free of Hale, holds onto the man in the helicopter
          and is pulled onboard.

          THE HELICOPTER
          Moves sideways over the train.

          IN THE HELICOPTER
          Deakins turns, pulling his gun and shoots down at the train as...

          THE HELICOPTER
          Moves back sideways over the train.

          DEAKINS' POV
          No sign of Hale on the train roof.

          DEAKINS
          Get us out of here!

          THE PILOT
          Nods and starts to lift and bank. Then he gets an odd
          expression. The helicopter isn't doing what he wants.

          THE HELICOPTER
          Is hovering over the train, but it can't fly away because...

          HALE
          Is hanging onto the skids and he's hooked the cable to the skid.
          The other end of the cable is still attached to the hatch.

          THE HELICOPTER
          Strains against the cable, but it doesn't snap.

          IN THE HELICOPTER

          DEAKINS
          Hurry!

          POWER LINES
          Cross the track, a quarter-mile ahead.

          DEAKINS
          Leans out of the helicopter with his Uzi, shooting down at...

          

          

          

          

           92.

          HALE
          Who grabs onto the cable and slides down it to the roof of the
          train, bullets plugging in all around his. He jumps down
          through the hatch as...

          DEAKINS
          Sees what's coming and jumps.

          THE HELICOPTER
          Hits...

          THE POWER LIKES
          Which snap, shoot sparks and wrap around the helicopter's rotor.

          THE HELICOPTER
          Breaks up and flies apart as the train rolls on.

          EXT. CAR CARRIER

          The flame burning up the gas-soaked cloth goes into the Toyota
          gas tank and...

          THE TOYOTA
          Explodes.

          INT. NUKE BOXCAR

          Hale gets to his feet, goes to look at the nuke.

          ECU NUKE TIMER
          Five minutes and counting.

          HALE
          Looks at it, trying to figure out how to disarm it. He hears
          the whoosh-thump of someone jumping down into the boxcar. He
          turns.

          DEAKINS
          Stands there, trying to smile, trying to be cool, but...

          DEAKINS
          They would've paid and I would've
          stopped it. You've made a very,
          very big mistake.

          HALE
          It's over, Deak. I beat you.
          Disarm it.

          

          

          

          

           93.

          DEAKINS
          If it's over and you beat me, you
          disarm it.

          HALE
          Deak...

          DEAKINS
          Course you are going to need this.
          (holds cell-phone

          REMOTE)
          All you have to do is get it.
          (puts remote in

          POCKET)
          And if you do, as a special added
          bonus, you get this.
          Deakins pulls out...

          THE TWENTY DOLLAR BILL
          Then pockets it.

          HALE AND DEAKINS
          Share a look. Deakins puts up his fists.

          DEAKINS
          Ready?
          Hale puts up his fists.

          EXT. CAR CARRIER

          It's a chain reaction, with one flaming Toyota setting off the
          one above it or next to it.

          BETWEEN BOXCAR AND CAR CARRIER
          Terry is looking under the car carrier.

          TERRY'S POV
          The train car axle is smoking, grinding, glowing red in the heat
          from the flaming Toyotas.

          INT. BOXCAR

          Hale and Deakins circle each other.

          DEAKINS
          Modern boxing is a pussy sport.
          They want to make it about scoring
          points. It's not about scoring
          points! It's about this!

          

          

          

          

           94.
          Deakins fakes a right, jabs with his left, catching Hale on the
          chin. Hale is jarred. Blood runs from his mouth.

          DEAKINS
          Okay. You're bleeding. Good. In
          the old fights, there'd be so much
          blood, guys would slip and fall.
          Let's see if we can't get a little
          more of that red goo out of you.
          Ready?
          Again Deakins fakes right, jabs left. Hale half blocks it, but
          is sent back.

          EXT. TRAIN


          CU TRAIN AXLE
          The axle is bending, grinding, groaning.

          TERRY
          Is between the car carrier and a boxcar, looking down at the
          axle, not knowing what the hell she's going to do when she hears
          a horn honking. She turns.

          INT. BOXCAR


          DEAKINS
          Used to be, every fight was to a
          knockout. You know what happens
          when you get knocked out? It's
          your brain slapping against the
          inside of your skull. Here. I'll
          let you see what it's like. Ready?
          Deakins steps toward Hale, about to finish him off. Deakins
          swings. Hale ducks, comes up hard with all he's got, gets
          Deakins under the chin and Deakins sails up and back, landing
          prone, seeing stars.

          HALE
          Stands over Deakins, in silhouette, the light of the hatch above
          him. And then...

          EXT. THE TRAIN AXLE

          Snaps and...

          THE TRAIN
          Jumps the tracks.

          INT. BOXCAR

          Hale is thrown off his feet.

          

          

          

          

           95.

          THE NUCLEAR WEAPON
          Swings wildly in the hammock webbing.

          THE STRAPS
          Securing the webbing to the walls of the car start to snap.

          EXT. TRAIN

          The front cars accordion sideways off the tracks, down a short,
          steep, embankment. It's all grinding, twisting, groaning metal.

          FLAMING TOYOTAS
          Fly, tumble, explode.

          INT. BOXCAR

          Hale tries to get to his feet, but then the floor starts
          dropping below him as...

          EXT. THE TRAIN


          THE NUKE BOXCAR
          Goes down the steep slope of the embankment and stops.

          THE TRAIN
          The sounds of the crash cease. Dust and smoke. Burning Toyotas.

          INT. BOXCAR

          Flickering light from a burning Toyota comes in through the
          slatted walls. In this weird light, Hale sees...

          THE NUCLEAR WEAPON
          It's above him, at the end (top) of the car. It's hanging in
          mid-air, tangled up in the webbing. Two straps are the only
          things keeping the nuclear weapon from dropping twenty feet to
          the bottom of the car.

          DEAKINS
          Is lying at the bottom (end) of the car, directly under the
          nuke, not moving.

          HALE
          Looks around for something. He sees it --

          DEAKINS' REMOTE CONTROL DEVICE
          On the floor.

          

          

          

          

           96.

          DEAKINS' EYES
          Flicker open. He sees...

          A PISTOL
          Lying a few feet away.

          HALE

          DEAKINS (O.S.)
          You have to push amber, then red.
          You might have time to push amber.
          You won't get to red.
          Hale turns to see...

          DEAKINS
          Pointing a gun at him.

          HALE
          The nuke is armed, Deak. If it
          falls, the impact trigger will set
          it off.

          DEAKINS
          I know.

          HALE
          Half a million people will die.

          DEAKINS
          (thinks, shrugs)
          Fuck 'em if they can't take a joke.

          ONE OF THE STRAPS
          Holding the nuke tears through. One strap left.

          HALE
          His finger hovers over the amber button.

          DEAKINS
          Do it and I shoot.
          Hale looks at Deakins.

          HALE
          I guess you really don't know me
          that well after all.
          Hale presses the amber button.

          

          

          

          

           97.

          DEAKINS
          Shoots.

          HALE
          Spins back, blood spraying from his shoulder.

          THE REMOTE
          Falls from his hand.

          DEAKINS
          Is about to shoot again, then hears a tearing and looks up as...

          THE LAST STRAP
          Rips through and...

          THE NUKE
          Drops toward him, point first.

          HALE'S BLOODY HAND
          Grabs the remote and his finger presses the RED button.

          ECU NUKE TIMER
          Mid-air, dropping, the clock and display go blank as...

          DEAKINS
          His eyes fill with true terror as...

          THE NUCLEAR WEAPON
          Punches into Deakins, point first, crushing him.

          HALE
          Gets to his feet and stands over Deakins. He reaches down,
          opens Deakins' pocket and pulls out the twenty-dollar bill.

          HALE
          Ready.
          He heads out of the boxcar.

          EXT. TRAIN TRACKS

          Hale climbs out of the boxcar and starts running through the
          train wreckage and burning cars, looking for Terry.

          

          

          

          

           98.

          A TV NEWSVAN
          Pulls up and a REPORTER and CAMERAMAN jump out.

          HALE
          Keeps running through the wreckage. He stops, unable to breathe
          when he sees...

          A FOOT
          In a boot, sticking out from under a burning Toyota.

          HALE
          Runs to the car, pulls at the foot, tries to push the car off
          the body underneath. O.S. another vehicle drives up.

          HALE
          Come on! Oh, God. Oh, no.
          Hale is pulling hard on the foot when...

          TERRY (O.S.)
          The Air Force pays you so little
          you have to steal shoes off dead
          people?
          Hale turns to see...

          TERRY
          Walkins over from the Rancher's pickup truck.

          WILKINS AND GILES
          Are behind her, grinning.

          HALE AND TERRY
          Run to each other. They embrace, start smoothing each other's
          hair, start wiping blood off each other's faces, start kissing,
          only to be interrupted by...

          THE TV REPORTER AND CAMERMAN

          REPORTER
          What happened here?
          Hale and Wilkins and Giles share a look.

          HALE
          Uh...
          (looks at flaming

          TOYOTAS)
          ... somebody was trying to steal
          some Toyotas.
          

          

           99.
          The reporter asks more questions. Hale and Terry walk off, arms
          around each other. As they go, Hale sticks out his hand to
          Terry.

          HALE
          Rawley Hale.

          TERRY
          Terry Carmichael.
          They shake hands and walk on as we...

          THE END
THE BROTHERS BLOOM

1   EXT. DIRT ROAD - SUNRISE                                      1

    Dawn with her rose-red fingers rises over a dusty country
    road. A car chugs over the horizon.

                        NARRATOR
              As far as con man stories go,
              I think I've heard them all.
              Of grifters, ropers, faro fixers,
              tales drawn long and tall.
              But if one bears a bookmark in
              the confidence man's tome,
              twould be that of Penelope,
              and of the brothers Bloom.


2   EXT. COUNTRY HOUSE - MORNING                                  2

    The car deposits two shabby boys (10 & 13) in front of a
    country house.

    Both in black.   Each with a suitcase.

                        NARRATOR
              At ten and thirteen Bloom and
              Stephen (the younger and the old)


3   INT. KITCHEN (FLASHBACK)                                      3

    The two brothers and an oafish FOSTER FATHER sit eating
    breakfast.

                        NARRATOR
              had been through several foster
              families.

    The FOSTER FATHER slaps Bloom upside the head. Stephen
    LAUNCHES across the table, tackling the dad and beating the
    crap out of him.

                        NARRATOR (cont'd)
              Thirty eight, all told.


4   INT. CHILD WELFARE OFFICE - DAY                               4

    CLOSE ON - A CHILD WELFARE FILE COVER

    "Bloom" stamped on it. It opens, and dozens of reports flip
    by. Under the "REASON FOR RETURN OF MINORS" field we catch
    different entries: "BEHAVIOR INAPPROPRIATE", "UNMANAGEABLE",
    "MOLESTED CAT", "SOLD OUR FURNITURE", "CAUSED FLOODING".



                                                               2

4   CONTINUED:                                                  4


                           NARRATOR
                 Mischief moved them on in life, and
                 moving kept them close.


5   EXT. COUNTRY HOUSE PORCH                                     5

    The brothers on the porch, suitcases in hand.

                           NARRATOR
                 For Bloom had Stephen, Stephen
                 Bloom, and both had more than most.

    The front door opens, and a pair of FOSTER PARENTS eye the
    brothers suspiciously.


6   EXT. SMALL TOWN SQUARE - LATER THAT DAY                      6

    A wide dusty Main Street, which the two brothers survey.

                           NARRATOR
                 Another home, another main street.
                 Stephen looked around,
                 then summed the burgh up thusly:

                           STEPHEN
                 Bloom, we've hit a one hat town.

                           NARRATOR
                 One theater. One car wash. One
                 cafe. One park. One cat. Which,
                 through some mishap, had one leg.

    The cat sits on a roller skate, rowing itself down the street
    with its one leg.

                           STEPHEN
                 Sweet Jesus. Look at that.


7   EXT. SCHOOL - DAY                                            7

    A group of children flee the school joyfully.

                           NARRATOR
                 One school, which meant one tight-
                 knit group of local well-off kids.

                                                                 3
  




8    EXT. CANDY SHOP                                                 8

     The children run out of the candy store, all slurping Rocket
     Pops.

                           NARRATOR
                 Their pocket-change bought rocket
                 pops,


9    INT. CANDY SHOP                                                 9

     The brothers at the counter. Bloom watches the children go,
     while Stephen counts out pennies.

                           NARRATOR
                 The brothers,

     Stephen slaps the change down angrily and points with a
     scowl.

                           STEPHEN
                 Pixie Stix.


10   EXT. PARK                                                   10

     The children play, resplendent with their Rocket Pops.

                           NARRATOR
                 They were the `they'. All well
                 loved, rooted, happy as you please.

     Bloom and Stephen sit off to the side of the park, none too
     happy nursing their Pixie Stix.

                           NARRATOR (cont'd)
                 Always there. In every town.

     Stephen glares, flicks the Stix away like a cigarette.

                           STEPHEN
                 The playground bourgeoisies.

     He storms off.    Bloom lingers, staring silently at the
     children.

                                                                  4
   




11   EXT. FOREST                                                  11

     The brothers amble down a wooded path.     Bloom stops, staring
     into the trees.

     Through the dense thicket of foliage... the children playing.
     And one gleaming eye framed perfectly through a small open
     patch in the leaves.

     Bloom pushes the leaves aside. A girl. Golden curls.
     Summer dress. Standing in the distance on a wide lawn.

     Bloom gazes.    Stephen places his hand on Bloom's back.


12   EXT. PARK - CONTINUOUS                                       12

     Bloom stumbles from the trees (very much as if he's been
     shoved) and regains his footing and freezes, not shielded at
     all now from the playing kids and the girl.

                         NARRATOR
               Could he simply

                         STEPHEN (O.S.)
               Talk to her!

                         NARRATOR
               Just drop his fears and go? Leave
               his brother in the woods, and join
               the children?

     The girl makes eye contact, twisting a daisy chain between
     her tiny fingers. Bloom's adam apple convulses.

     He turns tail and runs back into the woods.

                            NARRATOR (cont'd)
               No.


13   INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT                                         13

     Brothers in bed. Bloom gazes window-ward. Stephen gazes Bloom-
     wise, shuffling a pack of cards.

                         BLOOM
               What's doing?

                            STEPHEN
               What?



                                                                   5
    
13   CONTINUED:                                                    13


                            BLOOM
                  You shuffle when you're thinking
                  something through. So whatcha
                  thinking?

                            STEPHEN
                  Not a thing.

                            NARRATOR
                  This wasn't really true.
                  Cause in the root of Stephen's
                  psyche, something now began.
                  A seed of grand epiphany. A hook.
                  A tale.


14   EXT. WOODS - DAY                                                14

                            STEPHEN
                  A plan.

     Stephen spreads out a hand-drawn flowchart on a stump, and
     talks Bloom through it.

                            NARRATOR
                  A fiction made for profit, in which
                  both boys played a part.
                  A simple con in fifteen steps.

                            STEPHEN
                  And this is where we start.

     Stephen runs his finger backwards down the connected boxes,
     each neatly numbered, stopping at #1.... "Bloom Talks To
     Girl"


15   EXT. PARK - DAY                                                 15

     Children and the gold haired Girl playing.      The wall of
     foliage where the forest begins shimmers.

                            NARRATOR
                  And then, as if a curtain had been
                  pulled back from the sky...
                  Some barrier within the younger
                  Bloom was broken.

     Bloom bursts through the trees and strides across the wide
     lawn, confident, glowing, stopping face to golden face with
     the girl.


   

                                                                  6
   
15   CONTINUED:                                                   15


                            BLOOM
                  Hi.

     They talk.    They run.   They laugh.   They play.

                            NARRATOR
                  So Bloom performed his role in
                  Stephen's story to a T.

     BOX #2 on the flowchart - "Bloom wins the kids' trust"


16   EXT. TOWN SQUARE                                             16

     Bloom does indeed, sitting and laughing with a circle of
     kids, suddenly a natural born charmer.

                            NARRATOR
                  And being who he wasn't, could be
                  as he wished to be.

     The Golden Girl smiles at him.

     From the shadows of an adjacent alley, Stephen watches,
     pleased. He slinks away.

     SERIES OF SHOTS-


17   EXT. CAVE - DAY                                              17

     BOX #3 - "Stephen finds a cave" dissolves to Stephen scouting
     out a cave deep in the woods.


18   EXT. PARK - DAY                                              18

     In the park, Bloom runs with the kids, laughing.


19   INT. HARDWARE STORE - DAY                                    19

     BOX #5 - "Stephen buys supplies" dissolves to: Stephen in a
     hardware store, pointing. A flashlight, snow boots and
     several large coolers are purchased.


20   EXT. PARK - DAY                                              20

     Back in the park, Bloom says goodnight to the kids and walks
     homeward in the warm twilight.

                                                               7





21   INT. CHURCH - DAY                                            21

     BOX #8 - "Stephen scouts church" dissolves to: Stephen's
     eyes poke up from behind a pew in a church. He manages to
     look devious as he snags a SUNDAY SCHOOL SCHEDULE.


22   INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT                                         22

     Bloom enters, hears running water from the bathroom. He
     glimpses down at the flowchart on the bed, scanning down to:

     Box #10 - "Bloom comes home to find Stephen filling the
     coolers"

     Stephen backs out of the bathroom trolling a heavy cooler.

                         STEPHEN
               Oh - kay. How's it going on the
               playground front?

                         BLOOM
               It's great.

                         STEPHEN
               So, on to step eleven, then.   The
               Tale. You tell them -

                            BLOOM
               Wait...

     Bloom's lip quivers, obviously conflicted.

                         NARRATOR
               Must the numbers rattle on?    Must
               the fiction end?

                         BLOOM
               I think I need more time to win
               their-

                          STEPHEN
               Bloom. They're not your friends.
               They're part of this, and this aint
               real. Remember, it's a con.
               And when it's done, we've just got
               us. And we'll be moving on.
                   (beat)
               So, the tale. You tell them
               there's a

                                                               8





23   EXT. PARK - DAY                                           23

     Bloom holds court with the kids.

                            BLOOM
                  hermit in the woods. A one eyed,
                  steel toothed vagabond...


24   INT. ATTIC                                                24

     Back to Bloom and Stephen in the attic

                            BLOOM
                  ...with blood red eyes?

                             STEPHEN
                      (nods)
                  That's good. He stopped you coming
                  home from school...


25   EXT. PARK - DAY                                           25

                            BLOOM
                  ...and told me of a cave.

                            GIRL
                  What kind of cave?

                            BLOOM
                  A cave of wonders.

                              BOY
                  Pffft ha.

                            GIRL
                  Shut up, Dave.

                            BLOOM
                  At noon on every Sunday, there
                  appears a ball of light, which
                  flutters like a butterfly...

                            GIRL
                  A will-o-whisp?

                            BLOOM
                  That's right. It guides you

                                                               9





26   INT. ATTIC                                                26

                            STEPHEN
                  ...if you can keep up...


27   EXT. PARK                                                 27

                            BLOOM
                  ...to where the treasures lay.

                            BOY
                  So where's this cave?

                            GIRL
                  Yeah, where?


28   INT. ATTIC                                                28

                            STEPHEN
                  Ah-hah. The hermit didn't say.
                  He got this greedy glinting look,
                  the filthy red-eyed leech... and
                  said he'd tell for thirty bucks.

     Something in Bloom's face falls.


29   EXT. PARK                                                 29

     The girl's bright, trusting face looking at him. A moment of
     silence. Then, triumphant, an excited boy leaps to his feet.

                            EXCITED BOY
                  Well that's just two bucks each!

     The kids all rejoice, and fist-fulls of dollars are thrust at
     Bloom. He looks almost crestfallen as his eye catches the
     girl's joyful gaze.

                            NARRATOR
                  So Sunday came...


30   EXT. WOODS                                                30

     Children in their bright Sunday clothes run through the dark
     woods, led by Bloom.





                                                                10

                            NARRATOR
                  ...and straight from church, into
                  the woods Bloom led.


31   INT. CAVE                                                    31

     In the dim light of a cave, Stephen overturns the coolers of
     water and retreats into shadow. A flood soaks into the dirt
     floor, as outside the mouth of the cave the group of panting
     children come into sight.

                            NARRATOR
                  They stopped. Their hearts leapt.
                  There it was.


32   EXT. CAVE                                                    32

     The children look at the craggy mouth of a forboding cave.

                            GIRL
                  Just like the hermit said!

     Deep in the cave's dark maw, a spark of light.

     The children gasp collectively.    The Girl grabs Bloom's arm.

     Bloom stares, transfixed as any of them.

     The spark becomes a glowing, fluttering point of light, which
     hangs in the mouth of the cave for a tantalizing moment, then
     recedes deeper into the gloom.

     With a cry the children, Bloom included, dash into the cave.


33   INT. CAVE                                                    33

     The light glows just around the next corner... the children
     run after it, slipping in the mud, laughing, turning the
     corner...

     And the light glows just around the next corner. They
     scramble, they slip and slide, they can't catch the light,
     but they're all having the time of their lives.

     Bloom included.    Holding the girl's hand, laughing, eyes full
     of wonder.






                                                                11
  
33   CONTINUED:                                                  33


                            NARRATOR
                  For just one moment, Bloom forgot
                  himself and ran too fast.

     He puts on a burst of speed, gets ahead of the crowd.

                            NARRATOR (cont'd)
                  He'd catch the light and find the
                  treasure...

     Turning a corner, he (alone) sees the rather tawdry image of
     Stephen, flashlight in hand, shooing him back as he turns the
     next corner.

     Bloom stops running.

                            NARRATOR (cont'd)
                  But the moment passed.

     The other kids and the girl pass him, but Bloom stands dead
     still, a strange expression on his face.

     The girl turns back towards him, still running, and holds out
     her hand for him to follow.

     But he doesn't.    He stays behind, and is soon left alone.


34   EXT. PLAYGROUND                                               34

                            NARRATOR
                  They didn't catch the will-o-wisp,
                  but didn't really care.

     The muddied children walk home, laughing, while Bloom leans
     against a lamppost. Stephen appears behind him, counting
     their money.

                            STEPHEN
                  It seems to me that in the end, the
                  perfect con is where
                  each one involved gets just the
                  thing they wanted.

                            BLOOM
                  Yeah I guess so.

                             NARRATOR
                  Our fledgling thieves were
                  satisfied.

                                                                12
  




35   EXT. FOSTER HOUSE - DAY                                      35

     A front door opens, revealing a porch-full of 30 angry
     parents holding 15 muddied kids by their ears.

                          NARRATOR
                The children's parents, less so.

     The Foster Parents exchange a glance.

     QUICK SHOTS -

     Stephen is smacked.

     The wad of money is snatched from a grubby small hand by an
     angry big one.

     A telephone slams down.

     On a form, the field "Reason for return:" is filled with
     "Larceny."


36   INT. BEDROOM - DAY                                           36

     Two suitcases on a bed are snapped closed and pulled away.
     The bed sits solid and vacant in the dusty afternoon
     sunlight.

                          NARRATOR
                A bitter ending? Maybe. But
                there's sweetness in the mix.

     Beneath the bed, forgotten, a piece of paper.    On it, the con
     flow-chart. Numbered boxes.

                          NARRATOR (cont'd)
                The brothers Bloom had found their
                calling.

     One of the boxes... number six...

                          NARRATOR (cont'd)
                As shown in number six.

     BOX #6:   "Cut % O'Henry's"

                          NARRATOR (cont'd)
                `Cut' meant to negotiate, `percent'
                percentage deal.

                                                              13





37   EXT. SMALL TOWN SQUARE - DAY                                 37

     Through a storefront window - rows of the children's muddy
     Sunday clothes hang, each tagged.

                         NARRATOR
               `O'Henry's' was the town's one dry
               clean shop.

     And striding out of the store beneath the `O'Henry's
     Cleaners' sign is Stephen, fifty dollars in hand, sucking a
     Rocket Pop. The OWNER leans out of the door, looking a
     little nervous. Stephen throws him back a salute.


38   EXT. BACK ALLEY - DAY                                        38

     Bloom sits against a wall, suitcases beside him. Boxes of
     Rocket Pops, and one in each fist. Stephen plops down beside
     him.

                         STEPHEN
               So how's it feel?

     Bloom's eye catches the children, and the girl, playing in
     the distance.

                         NARRATOR
               In truth, young Bloom won't know
               for twenty years just how he felt.

     HONK! A `Child Welfare' car waiting out on the street.    The
     brothers pick themselves up.

                         NARRATOR (cont'd)
               And so, we'll skip ahead now in our
               story.

     Stephen tosses his Rocket Pop.

                         STEPHEN
               Let `em melt.

     The con man team of the brothers Bloom, suitcases in hand,
     strides down the alleyway.

     Stephen in front.






                                                               14

     Bloom a few steps behind, stealing one last glance back at
     the children playing in the sun.

                                                        CUT TO:

40   INT. LIBRARY - NIGHT                                         40

     Flames spread over a wall of bookshelves.

     TITLE CARD:    BERLIN, 25 YEARS LATER

     A YOUNG MAN in a nice suit and bowler hat steps in front of
     the flaming books.

                            YOUNG MAN
                  He gets the scarab, you get the
                  money, I get the girl... so in the
                  end, everyone gets everything he
                  wants.

     Three gunshots, two bloody holes in the nice suit and the
     young man folds to the ground.

     A sweaty man named CHARLESTON (40s) lowers his gun, while
     behind him the rest of the library roars in flames.

                            VOICE (O.S.)
                  Wha - Charleston, what - oh my god
                  are you... oh god he's dead,
                  Victor's dead... you've killed us!
                  We had it he was right it was all
                  in the bag and now we're dead, why?
                  Why, you stupid son of a bitch?

     The owner of the voice, a MAN a bit younger than Charleston
     in a derby cap, snatches the gun away and slaps Charleston
     hard.






                                                               15
 
40   CONTINUED:                                                 40


                             CHARLESTON
                  Cause the Turk was right. After
                  seeing her, after that night on the
                  airstrip, after Cairo everything
                  changed, and he couldn't see the
                  play through that one milky eye,
                  but the Turk was right about one
                  thing, that there's nothing
                  beautiful about money. She's
                  beautiful.

                            MCGUIRE
                  This isn't happening...

                            CHARLESTON
                  He'll never have her now. She's
                  free. And I'll never see her in
                  scarlet again, her chestnut hair,
                  but it's worth the money and my job
                  and his life and the rest of my
                  life that she's free.

                            MCGUIRE
                  Charleston. I can't be here...

                            CHARLESTON
                  You're not here. Neither of us
                  are. It's Mowcher's gun.

                            MCGUIRE
                  Mowcher is at the bottom of the
                  Spree with a cowl in his neck!

     Charleston gets to his feet.

                            CHARLESTON
                  They won't find him for a week, and
                  the Albino will chalk it up to
                  Davey, he won't talk. We're clean.

                            MCGUIRE
                  Listen to you - four months ago you
                  were an investment banker! Now
                  you're nothing. The Scarab's lost.
                  The money's gone. It'll rot in the
                  Peruvian earth. It's gone.

     Charleston limps to the flaming doorway.






                                                              16

40   CONTINUED: (2)                                            40


                         CHARLESTON
               The man named Charleston you met
               nine months and a thousand years
               ago at the hotel bar in Jodhpur is
               dead. If we see each other again
               it'll be as strangers. As for the
               money... let it rot.

     He exits, leaving McGuire stooped beside the crumpled form of
     Victor. A long beat. The distant roar of an engine, tires
     squealing.

     Then through the smoky doorway steps a beautiful ASIAN WOMAN,
     early 20s. She gives a nearly imperceptible nod.

                         MCGUIRE
               Wow.

     He pats Victor, who sits up, spitting blood. McGuire looks
     to Victor and the woman for a reaction. Gets none.

                         MCGUIRE (cont'd)
               Wow is the word you're both looking
               for. Wow.

     The Asian woman nods slightly.

                         VICTOR
                   (un-wowishly)
               You're a genius, Stephen.

     For McGuire is, of course, Stephen.

                         STEPHEN
               We're a genius, Bloom.

     Just as Victor is, indeed, Bloom.   He spits.

                         BLOOM
               Tastes like tin foil.

                         STEPHEN
               So does real blood. Buy you a
               drink.

     Stephen escorts the Asian woman out, while Bloom wipes his

41   EXT. HOUSE - PRE-DAWN                                       41

     A stately house in the middle of nowhere, on fire. Stephen
     holds the door of a car open, while Bloom steps from the
     flaming house.

                         STEPHEN
               "Four months and a thousand years
               ago." That's Kipling, isn't it?
               He stole that from Kipling.

                           BLOOM
               No.


42   EXT. BERLIN - PRE-DAWN                                      42

     Hazy light over the sprawling city.


43   INT. DEUTCH MARK                                            43

     A low, cozy basement level bar. A dozen people crowd it, all
     expectant in a surprise-party type way.

     A TURKISH GENTLEMAN in a white linen suit and eye patch
     raises his drink when Bloom, Stephen and the woman enter.

                         THE TURK
               Make way, make room for the
               brothers Bloom!

     The bar bursts into cheers.


44   INT. DEUTCH MARK - LATER                                    44

     A DWARF dances on the bar. Stephen plays cards with the
     Turk, an ALBINO and a small crowd of character types.

                         THE TURK
               Nine months, six countries, three
               faked deaths, for one mark. You're
               a beautiful antique, my friend.

     They clink glasses.

                           ALL
               Proust.





                                                                    18

                            THE TURK
                  One thing baffles me. The entire
                  con would have fallen apart if
                  Charleston had walked away. How did
                  you know he'd pull the trigger?

     Stephen riffle shuffles a pack of cards.

                            STEPHEN
                  Just think of any card.    Got one?

     Stephen cuts the deck randomly - 2 of spades.

                               THE TURK
                  No.

     Stephen shrugs.

                            STEPHEN
                  But if I do it enough, eventually
                  it'll work on someone. And then
                  it'll be the best card trick in the
                  world.

     Wink. The dwarf slips, plummets from the bar. Stephen kicks
     a chair across the room, into which he lands with a crunch.

                               STEPHEN (cont'd)
                  Ante up.

                            THE TURK
                  It's true you never work with the
                  same crew twice?

                            STEPHEN
                  That's true.

                               THE TURK
                  Well shit.     Except for the uh, for
                  her?

                            STEPHEN
                  La Chinoise?

                               THE TURK
                  Yeah.

     Back at the bar - the Asian woman.       The CHINK.   Being hit on
     by a weasly ROMANIAN.

                            ROMANIAN
                  Yeah, I'm pretty big into anime.

  

                                                               19

     She almost imperceptibly rolls her eyes.

                         STEPHEN
               Our fifth Beatle. She knows the
               ins and the outs, and so far as I
               can tell, speaks three words of
               English.

     She taps on the bar.

                            THE CHINK
               Jameson.

                            BARTENDER
               Ice?

     She says `no' with a look.

                         THE ALBINO
               So she's with you and Bloom till
               the end.

                         STEPHEN
               Just till the wind changes.

     Stephen makes a gun with his finger and shoots at the Chink.

     She flicks a champaign flute to make a `DING!' and mimes the
     bullet bouncing off her.

                         THE TURK
               Where is Bloom?

     In the corner of the bar, in a private booth with drawn
     velvet curtains, Bloom sits alone playing solitaire. Stuck
     with a queen of hearts he can't play.

     A beautiful woman in scarlet with auburn hair pokes her face
     through the curtains.

                         ROSE
               There you are. Hiding?

                            BLOOM
               Yeah.

                         ROSE
               I've been learning.      Stephen likes
               to talk about you.

                         BLOOM
               Did he tell you the cave story?



                                                              20

44   CONTINUED: (3)                                            44


                         ROSE
               Is it true?

                         BLOOM
               What else did he tell you?

                         ROSE
               I'm not going to tell it as good as
               Stephen. You two kicked around
               till your early teens, then stowed
               away on a merchant marine freighter
               and ended up in St. Petersburg,
               where you spent five years under
               the tutelage of a shadowy old
               swindler named the Diamond Dog.
               And he was your Fagin and Stephen
               was his Artful Dodger, but it ended
               suddenly and badly.

                         BLOOM
               Stephen took his eye out with an
               antique rapier.

                         ROSE
               Why did he do that?

                         BLOOM
               And then the Brothers Bloom lit out
               on their own to make their fortune
               as gentleman thieves. Sounds
               romantic.

                          ROSE
               It does.

     She pushes the cards aside and slides clumsily onto the
     table, her face inches from Bloom's, eyes closed, expecting a
     kiss.

     Bloom's eyes stay open.

                         BLOOM
               You want to know how Stephen did
               it? With Charleston?

                         ROSE
               It's not the first thing on my
               mind.

                                                              21





45   INT. LIBRARY - NIGHT (FLASHBACK)                          45

     A replay of Bloom in front of the flaming bookshelf.

                         BLOOM (O.S.)
               He positioned me in the same spot
               where, seven years ago,
               Charleston's wife stood and told
               him she was leaving.

     The room transforms, becomes daylit, not on fire, seven years
     ago, a WIFE standing in Bloom's place.

                         BLOOM (O.S.) (cont'd)
               He chose my outfit to mirror her
               suit.

     Sure enough, the colors and shape of Bloom's suit matches the
     Wife's outfit.

                         BLOOM (O.S.) (cont'd)
               He even phonetically matched my
               final words to hers.

                         WIFE
               This is the end. Charelston, you've
               always been a dunce.

     Everything snaps back to Bloom in the flaming room.

                         BLOOM (IN FLASHBACK)
               So in the end, everyone gets
               everything he wants.

     BANG.


46   INT. DEUTCH MARK                                          46

                         BLOOM
               That's what he does, he writes his
               cons the way dead Russians write
               novels, with thematic arcs and
               imbedded symbolism and shit. And
               he wrote me as a vulnerable anti-
               hero. And that's why you think you
               want to kiss me. It's a con.

     He leaves Rose lying on the table and sweeps through the bar
     towards the exit, passing Stephen.




                                                                   22

                  I need air.

                            STEPHEN
                  Who doesn't?
                      (plays a card)
                  That's the big 2.


47   EXT. BERLIN STREET - EARLY MORNING                               47

     Bloom stumbles up stone steps to street level.      A THOUSAND
     YEAR OLD MAN sweeps up across the square.

     Bloom sits wearily on the curb, bowler hat in hand, shirt
     bright red with fake blood, face long as hell.

     Putting the broom aside a moment, the old man walks painfully
     across the street to Bloom. Standing nearly toe to toe with
     him, the man pulls a huge joyful smile across his grizzled
     face.

     He then smears his hand over his mug, pulling the smile off
     his face and rubbing it on Bloom's mouth. When he takes his
     hand away, Bloom plays along and has the same big joyful
     smile. The old man winks at him and walks back to his broom.

     As soon as the old man is away, Bloom drops the smile.

     Stephen paces out into the street.

                            STEPHEN
                  We missed the sunrise.    That
                  would've been nice.

     They walk across the street to the Tiergarten.


48   EXT. TIERGARTEN - EARLY MORNING                                  48

     Berlin's Central Park and zoo, dead and brown. The brothers
     stroll through the woods, Stephen a few steps ahead, Bloom
     trailing behind, lost in thought.

     Camel heads poke over a wall with `Kamelhaus' painted on it.
     Stephen throws open the wall's gate.

                            STEPHEN
                      (to camels)
                  Back to the swamps!

     The camels are unimpressed.       Bloom slouches into a bench.

 

                                                               23

     Stephen shows the deck of cards to Bloom, who nods. Stephen
     cuts the deck, shows him a card. Bloom shakes his head, no.

                            STEPHEN (cont'd)
                  At least you're honest.

     Bloom stares into space.

                            STEPHEN (cont'd)
                  Alright, let's do this. Let's just
                  get it done. So first you say `I'm
                  quitting, Stephen. I'm out.' Then
                  I say...

                            BLOOM
                  `Do we have to go through this
                  again.'

                            STEPHEN
                  Then you make a show of putting on
                  your jacket and say `no I mean it
                  this time Stephen, this time I'm
                  really out.'

                            BLOOM
                  Then you say `let's have a drink,
                  and in the morning Bloom you'll
                  have come to your senses'

     Stephen pulls a flask, unscrews it.

                            STEPHEN
                      (re: Bloom's bright red
                       blood stain)
                  That's a major design flaw in fake
                  blood, by the way.

                            BLOOM
                  `and we'll be moving on.'

                            STEPHEN
                  Real blood turns brown after a half
                  hour.

                            BLOOM
                  Listen to me, Stephen.

                            STEPHEN
                  This scotch costs more than your
                  suit.

               Listen to me.

                         STEPHEN
               And the flask stopped a bullet from
               a black powder rifle at Appomattox.

                         BLOOM
               Listen.

     Bloom bats the flask away. A camel catches it, tips its
     camel neck back and gulps it down.

                         STEPHEN
               That's my new favorite camel.

                         BLOOM
               I hate you. I hate this life, I
               hate it, I hate that you won't
               fucking listen to me for one
               goddamn second. Just listen.

     Stephen listens.

                         BLOOM (cont'd)
               I can't wake up next to another
               stranger, who thinks they know me,
               or even wants to know me, cause I
               don't know - who - I'm thirty five
               years old, and I, I'm useless, I'm
               crippled, I don't, I've only ever
               lived life through these roles that
               aren't me, that are written for me
               by you.

                         STEPHEN
               Tell me what you want.

                         BLOOM
               Why? So you can write me a role in
               a story where I get it? You're not
               listening to me. I want a real...
               thing, I wanna do things how I
               don't know are gonna work out, a,

                            BLOOM
                  I want an unwritten life!
                      (realizes Stephen just
                       wrote that line for him)
                  Aauuugghh god!

     The camel belches.    Bloom makes a show of putting on his
     jacket.

                            BLOOM (cont'd)
                  I'm going away. Somewhere you or
                  even the Chink won't be able to
                  track me down, so don't try. No
                  more stories.

     Bloom tosses Stephen the bowler, and storms off.    He gets
     about ten feet, then hesitates.

                            BLOOM (cont'd)
                  I love you. Bye.

     Then goes.

     The camel nudges Stephen's jacket, looking for more scotch.
     Stephen puts the bowler on its camel head.

                               STEPHEN
                  Sorry bud.     I'm dry.

     Stephen watches his brother walk off into the rising morning
     mist, lost in thought.

     His hands mechanically begin shuffling the pack of cards.

     FADE OUT

     FADE IN:


49   EXT. ITALIAN COUNTRYSIDE - DAY                                49

     Beautiful green hills surround the walled medieval city of
     Ferentino.

     TITLE CARD:    Ferentino, Italy - 3 months later.

     A tiny red car inches its way across the countryside. It
     winds its way up and deeper into the city on the hill.

                                                                26
  




50   EXT. FERENTINO APARTMENT - DAY                                50

     The tiny stone porch outside a private apartment.   The red
     car's bumper pulls up, parks.

     On a small wood table, empty booze bottles and a loose pack
     of cards. Fingertips spread the cards, then the fingertips'
     owner heads for the apartment door.


51   INT. FERENTINO APARTMENT - DAY                                51

     Stephen steps in cautiously, surveys the apartment.

     A goddamn mess. Empty bottles and glasses, very little
     light. Stephen opens the curtains, light streams in the
     window. A groan of displeasure comes from the gloom.

     Bloom stirs, passed out in a hammock. Unkept beard, a few
     extra pounds. Crushed cigar hanging on his lip.

     A rotund GRANDMOTHER waddles in, cleaning up bottles and
     berating Bloom in a constant stream of angry Italian.

                         STEPHEN
               She's right, you know.

                         BLOOM
               Why are you here, Stephen?

                         STEPHEN
               Put on your face, let's eat.


52   EXT. FERENTINO APARTMENT - LATER                              52

     Stephen guides a dressed Bloom out the door. The grandmother
     follows them, still barking angry Italian at Bloom. At the
     last moment she says a few kind words, kisses him on the
     cheek and sends them off.


53   EXT. FERENTINO CAFE - DAY                                     53

     A few tables on a stone walkway overlooking the countryside.
     The red car parked nearby. Stephen eats, Bloom stares.

                         BLOOM
               How'd you find me?





                                                                    27

                               STEPHEN
                  The Chink.

                            BLOOM
                  How'd the Chink find me?

     Stephen's eyes:       "Are you joking?"

                            STEPHEN
                  How've you been?

                               BLOOM
                  Great.

                            STEPHEN
                  I've done a lot of thinking the
                  past three months. You don't want
                  out. You think you do but you
                  don't. Here, c'mere. I want to
                  show you something.

                            BLOOM
                  I'm quits, Stephen.

     Stephen stands, strolls off.        Bloom wearily follows.

                            BLOOM (cont'd)
                  Where are we going?

                            STEPHEN
                  New Jersey.

                            BLOOM
                      (sighs)
                  Well lemme get my jacket.

                                                             CUT TO:

55   EXT. LUDICROUS MANSION - AFTERNOON                                55

     A long private road through a tunnel of trees leads to a
     ludicrous mansion. Our trio watch it from the road.

                            BLOOM
                  Looks like an etching from a Bronte
                  novel.

  

                                                               28

     Stephen flips open a first edition Jane Eyre. The
     illustration inside is in fact an exact match, right down to
     a plaster deer in the front yard.

                            BLOOM (cont'd)
                  Huh. Look at that. Well thanks.
                  I'm gonna head back to Italy.

                            STEPHEN
                  Big money. Inheritance. Dad died
                  early, Mom died two years ago after
                  ten years fighting an illness that
                  I can't pronounce.

                              BLOOM
                  How much?

     The Chink writes a number in the snow with a stick. Just
     when we think she's done, she adds several more zeros.

                              BLOOM (cont'd)
                  Jesus.

                              STEPHEN
                  Look out.

     Stephen pulls Bloom into the trees as a cherry red
     Lamborghini roars down the private road, does an unruly donut
     and crunches painfully into a tree, kicking up a cloud of
     dust and smoke.

     Thumping bass from the audio system turns off, and from the
     dust cloud emerges PENELOPE, early 30s, beautiful but in a
     non-Lamborghini way.

     Bloom watches her through the trees, none too happy.


56   EXT. THICKET - LATER                                        56

     Off to the side of the house. They lean on the hood of their
     rental car, an old school Cadillac.

     In the background, a tow truck arrives with a brand new
     Lamborghini, and leaves towing the old one.

                            BLOOM
                  What am I doing here, Stephen? I
                  have one rule, and you've never
                  even tested it.



 

                                                                   29

                            STEPHEN
                  Stick with me.

                            BLOOM
                  No women. One rule. You know we
                  don't do women, I don't, and it's
                  not a morality thing or- a thing-
                  it's, whatever it is it doesn't
                  matter what it is, that's just our
                  rule. So what are we,
                      (RE: the rental car)
                  Did you rent a `78 Caddy?

     Stephen nods to the Chink.       Bloom nods appreciatively.

                            BLOOM (cont'd)
                  Controversial choice. So no, is
                  what I'm saying. I'm quits anyway.
                  I'll be in Italy. Drinking.

     The front door of the mansion slams, and they watch Penelope
     drag a harp around into the back yard.

                            STEPHEN
                  Penelope Stamp. Thirty three.
                  Lived at home her whole life.

     Bloom's eyes never leave Penelope.

                            BLOOM
                  An eccentric shut-in rich bitch.
                  You're not helping your case.

     The Chink silently hands Bloom a retractable spyglass, he
     watches Penelope drift atop a hill and sit on a stump.

                            STEPHEN
                  She's bored, a seed in the snow.
                  We're going to put her through a
                  grand adventure, bring her to life.

                            BLOOM
                  So this is the big plan. Lure me
                  back into things with some
                  beautiful intriguing elusive girl,
                  stir up old memories with the
                  prospect of redemption and rebirth.
                  Seriously Stephen. Amateur night.

     Bloom watches her play Clash songs on the harp.



   

                                                              30

                         BLOOM (cont'd)
               I'm not saying yes. But what's the
               con?

     Stephen spreads a folded piece of paper on a tree stump, with
     a flowchart on it. Numbered boxes.

     Bloom doesn't take his spyglass off Penelope.

                         STEPHEN
               It's actually pretty simple. We're
               brothers, antique dealers, perusing
               the Americas for antiquities en
               route to someplace exciting via
               luxury steamer, say Greece. You
               tie into her and work your magic...

     Penelope plays on.


57   INT. HOTEL BAR - NIGHT                                    57

     Very late. Bloom and Stephen in armchairs, collars loosened,
     drinks drunk. The Chink's Chuck Taylors stick up over the
     back of a chair.

     Bloom holds the con flowchart.

                         STEPHEN
               ...and so that's how it ends, in
               Mexico, a burst of violence then a
               moment of truth on the beach. What
               do you think?

     Bloom idly looks over the chart.

                         BLOOM
               You've got something up your
               sleeve. This is about me, right?
               Somehow.

                         STEPHEN
               This might not be something you
               know, but they've all been about
               you. Maybe that's why they've none
               of them been perfect, I've never
               been able to give you what you
               really want.






                                                                31

                            BLOOM
                  I want to be outta all this. So by
                  definition, this is not going to
                  give me what I want.

     Stephen answers by letting an ace fall from his sleeve.

                             BLOOM (cont'd)
                  This will be the last one.    You'll
                  let me go.

     The Chink's inert sneakers come to life and she's on her
     feet, silently going to Stephen's side.

                            STEPHEN
                  I will never approach you to do
                  another con again.
                      (to the Chink)
                  Let's make it a red Schwinn.

     Bloom stares at #1 on the flowchart - "BLOOM MEETS PENELOPE."


58   EXT. HILLTOP - MORNING                                      58

     A grumpy Bloom perched on the red Schwinn, an ill fitting
     Styrofoam helmet on his head.

     Stephen sits in a lawn chair watching the highway below.

     The Chink sets up a lawn umbrella, a chair for herself, and a
     cooler with Coronas.

                            BLOOM
                  There are less painful ways to cut
                  into a mark.

                            STEPHEN
                  Wahk wahk wahk wahk wahk wahk wahk.
                  Score to beat is 7.9. Keep your
                  head in the game, the Chinese judge
                  is tough.

                            BLOOM
                  This is a banana seat, man!

     He directs this to the Chink, who blinks with innocent
     incomprehension and opens two Coronas.

                            BLOOM (cont'd)
                  Don't give me that blank look, you
                  know what a fuckin banana seat is.

 

                                                                   32

     Stephen spots something and blows a whistle.       With a grunt,
     Bloom launches the Schwinn forward.

     Gaining speed, bumping over weeds and gopher holes, down the
     steep steep hill.

     At the bottom of the hill, a two lane highway.      Cruising down
     the highway, a cherry red Lamborghini.

     Whose front right fender Bloom expertly smashes into.

                                                            CUT TO:


59   EXT. HIGHWAY / SKY - DAY                                         59

     Silent and blue. Time slows to a crawl as Bloom sails
     through the air, arcing over the Italian luxury car's hood
     and past a horrified Penelope, face frozen mid scream behind
     the wheel.

                            BLOOM (V.O.)
                  There's actually a knack to this.
                  You want to avoid dying or breaking
                  anything that won't grow back, but
                  you don't want to roll out of it
                  and come up roses. If you're
                  trying to fast track into a mark's
                  sympathies, there's nothing quite
                  as efficient as having your first
                  conversation be from a hospital bed
                  they put you in. I usually like to
                  try for a dislocated shoulder.

     Several things happen at once.

     Bloom hits the pavement shoulder-first, hard.      The bent bike
     follows suit.

     Up on the hill, Stephen and the Chink raise score cards.         8.9
     and 5.6.

     The Lamborghini screeches to a stop.

     Everything is still.

     Then the car jolts forward. Then stops. Then again, jolts
     and stops. Rolls forward a few feet, lazily drifting, then
     jolts and stops.

     Bloom painfully stands, as confused by the car's behavior as
     us.

 

                                                                33

     Stephen and the Chink lower their cards, equally confused.

     One last long beat of silence, then the car jolts forward,
     veers drunkenly to the left, tips into a ditch and chunks to
     a stop. The horn blares.

     Bloom looks up to the hilltop for guidance.

     Stephen stares blankly.    The Chink raises a new score card -
     7.8.


60   INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT                                   60

     Penelope sleeps, bruised and battered. Bloom sits bedside
     uncomfortably, arm in a wimpy sling. She stirs. Bloom leans
     forward.

     Slurred with sleep and drugs, she painfully barely breathes

                            PENELOPE
                  Are you alright?


61   INT. HOSPITAL HALLWAY - NIGHT                                61

     Bloom consults with Stephen and the Chink, both in scrubs.

                            STEPHEN
                  The Chink had it - I'm telling him,
                  I know, thank you - in her report,
                  I missed it. This is actually kind
                  of great, I'll tell you why.

     The Chink lights a cigarette.

                            BLOOM
                  You missed it?

                            STEPHEN
                  Dostoevsky was an epileptic.

                            BLOOM
                  I know.

                            STEPHEN
                  His seizures were preceded by an
                  enlightened euphoria, a sort of
                  opening of his spiritual eye.

                  I think the fact that she saw your
                  face the instant before a seizure
                  is a pretty goddamn good foot to
                  start things out on, right?

     Bloom stares blankly.        The Chink burps into her stethoscope.


62   INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT                                      62

     Bloom slumps in a chair, watching Penelope sleep.

                            BLOOM (V.O.)
                  The next step is to figure out a
                  way to insinuate yourself into
                  their personal life.

     Bloom drifts off, then wakes with a start.

     It is MORNING.     Penelope is shaking him.

                            PENELOPE
                  I think they took my car.     Could
                  you drive me home?

                                BLOOM
                  Uh.   Yeah.

     She walks away, the back of her gown wide open, then turns.

                            PENELOPE
                  I'm Penelope Stamp.

63   INT. CADILLAC - MORNING                                         63

     Bloom drives, Penelope gazes stiffly out the window.

                            BLOOM (V.O.)
                  Engagement. Find a connection with
                  your mark through conversation.

                            BLOOM (cont'd)

                  S' ok.

     Silence. He notices her playing with the side mirror knob,
     angling it to stare at him while looking out the window.

  

                                                                      35

                  This car is like riding in a huge
                  marshmallow.

     And still more silence.

                            BLOOM (V.O.)
                  Having now deftly set your hook in
                  the mark's psyche, this would be
                  the perfect time to tug the line,


64   EXT. LUDICROUS MANSION - MORNING                                  64

     They pull up in the car.          A tow truck is dropping off a new
     Lamborghini.

                            BLOOM (V.O.)
                  Get invited in for coffee, and tell
                  them the full tale.

     Bloom looks about to launch into something, when Penelope
     drops a stack of cash bound in a green rubber band on his
     dashboard.

                            PENELOPE
                  For the bike, and the whole, thing.
                  This was a big shit sandwich. Ok.
                  Bye.

     The car door slams and she's gone.         Bloom sits a moment.

                            BLOOM (V.O.)
                  However, there are advantages to
                  playing it cool. Letting it lie
                  for a day or two, then casually re-
                  establish contact.

     Bloom starts driving off, and adjusts the passenger side
     mirror so it points back to the road. As he does he sees
     Penelope in it, sprinting after his car.

     He stops.    A moment later she appears at his window, heaving.

65   INT. PENELOPE'S KITCHEN - DAY                                65

     Bloom and Penelope sit in a luxurious stone-based kitchen,
     neither touching their coffee. Bloom talks.

     This is how Penelope listens: she starts with her eyes on
     Bloom, then very quickly drifts away into her own thoughts,
     then recognizes she's doing it and makes eye contact again
     and gives an overbaked "oh yes go on" smile/nod, then does it
     all again. Three or four times.

                            BLOOM
                  ...didn't really have anyone except
                  each other growing up, and our
                  father was in the antique business,
                  he had a shop in Charleston. So we
                  stuck together, my brother Stephen
                  and me, we and just took over the
                  shop when dad died. Then we
                  realized one day, we saw the
                  dealers who were finding and
                  selling us the antiques coming from
                  exotic countries all over the
                  world, and there was a, almost a
                  scent they had, when they'd come in
                  the dusty shop we worked nine to
                  five in since we were nineteen, the
                  air would, like before a rain, the
                  ions would line up, and you could
                  just smell midnight trains to Paris
                  and steamer ships and Calcutta
                  bazaars, and we made the decision,
                  we just did it, that we want to
                  have that sort of life. So we did,
                  and we've been travelling and
                  treasure hunting the world ever
                  since, and could you, I'm sorry,
                  stop doing - that, you're, I'm, ok.
                  Alright, look.

                            PENELOPE
                  I'm really bad at talking to
                  people.

     Victorian, expensive. Penelope leans against the window,
     looking out. Sulking. Bloom enters.

                            BLOOM
                  So what kind of stuff do you do?

                  Alright. I'm just gonna finish my
                  coffee first.

     Very slowly, he sips it.     Each sip becomes a noisier and
     noisier slurp.

                            PENELOPE
                  I collect hobbies. I see someone

     Putting the finishing touches on a ship in a bottle.

     Juggling various items.       Riding a unicycle.   Juggling while
     riding a unicycle.

     Playing ping-pong against a wall with ungodly speed.

     Karate chopping through too much wood.

     Breakdancing.

     Playing the accordion.

     Rapping to a drum machine.

     Creating a perfect origami dragon.

                            BLOOM
                  No. So you just thought, `so I
                  want to learn this and this,' and
                  you just did it? How do you plan
                  to use all these skills?

               No, yeah it does. That's what -
               the Taj Majal taken by a fat
               tourist with diarrhea and a point-
               and-shoot camera can be the

               stick our thumbs up our asses"

               depending on how your pinhole
               camera eats the light, it's warped
               and peculiar and imperfect. It's
               not reproduction, it's

                         PENELOPE
               I dunno about truth. A photograph
               is a secret about a secret. The
               more it tells you, the less you
               know.

               What's changed between now and
               twenty minutes ago? Cause this is
               kinda like a conversation.

67   EXT. BACKYARD - DAY                                       67

     Bloom and Penelope walk and talk, finally rounding the house
     and ending up at the driveway.

                         BLOOM
               Well, I should, uh, it's late. So.
               I meet a lot of people in my job I

                  off the docks, to the continent for
                  a few months.

     During this, Bloom very naturally moves his hand to the small
     of Penelope's back. The edge of his thumb comes to rest on a
     small slit of exposed skin.

     Penelope's expression does not change, but a noticeable blush
     crosses her still face.

     When Bloom removes his hand, the blush falls.

                            BLOOM (cont'd)
                  Paris and Greece, I think. I've

                  You'll have two weeks on the boat.

                            BLOOM
                  I need another day to get her on
                  the boat, she isn't hooked. That
                  bit I skipped where we were talking
                  in the backyard, it was ten minutes
                  on the optics of lensless
                  photography, we didn't really talk.






                                                                    41

                            STEPHEN
                  It isn't the talking that hooked
                  her.

     Bloom turns from the road.

                            BLOOM
                  I think you're wrong.

     A screech of distant tires and a crash.        Bloom doesn't look.

                            BLOOM (CONT'D) (cont'd)
                  Though every time I say that, you
                  end up being comically right.
                  That's her, isn't it? Yeah.

     Penelope pulls a clumsy steamer trunk that never could have
     fit in her Lamborghini, which is bent around a pylon.

     Bloom meets her.

                              PENELOPE
                  Hey.

                              BLOOM
                  Hi.    What are you doing here?

     She holds out the stack of bills in the green rubber band.

                            PENELOPE
                  You left this money in my kitchen.

     He doesn't take it.

                            BLOOM
                  Yeah, I didn't want it, but thanks.

                              PENELOPE
                  Oh.
                      (beat)
                  Hey, where's this boat going?


69   EXT. THE ATLANTIC OCEAN - DAY                                   69

     The good ship Fidele breaks the waves Greece-ward.

     Bloom and Penelope stroll the deck.


  

                                                                 42

                            BLOOM
                  Why did you decide to come?

                            PENELOPE
                  Well I'd never been to Greece. Or
                  Europe. Or outside New Jersey.

                            BLOOM
                  It just seems like a big leap.
                  From where you were at yesterday to
                  being a world traveler.

                            PENELOPE
                  It looked like fun.   I wanted to do
                  it.

                            BLOOM
                  A new hobby.

     Up ahead, Bloom spots a large man in a fur collared cape
     gazing out to sea. He quickly turns Penelope away.

                            BLOOM (cont'd)
                  Here, this way.


71   EXT. SHUFFLEBOARD DECK - DAY                                 71

     The Chink and Stephen play shuffleboard.     Bloom leads
     Penelope to them.

                            BLOOM
                  Penelope, this is my brother
                  Stephen.

                            STEPHEN
                  Pleased to make your acquaintance.
                  Bloom's told me about you, you're
                  the epileptic photographer?

                             PENELOPE
                  Sort of.

                            STEPHEN
                  This is my personal secretary and
                  masseuse, Mrs. Yuengling.

     A nearly imperceptible glare from the Chink.

                            PENELOPE
                  Yuengling like the beer?




                                                              43

                             STEPHEN
                  Heh. No. So what are your plans
                  in Greece?

                            PENELOPE
                  I don't plan.

                            STEPHEN
                  Good for you.

     The Chink hits a damn near impossible shuffleboard shot, then
     gives Stephen a pointed deferential giggle-bow.


72   INT. STATE ROOM - NIGHT                                    72

     The brothers dress for dinner.

                            BLOOM
                  You named the Chink `Yuengling?'

                            STEPHEN
                  I was writing in a bar. And she
                  doesn't drink, how does she know a
                  Philly beer?

                             BLOOM
                  She knows a lot of stuff.
                      (beat)
                  Was that who I thought it was on
                  the East deck this morning?

                            STEPHEN
                  Yes it was. Did he spot you?

     An ominous glance.

                             BLOOM
                  Not yet.


73   EXT. DECK - NIGHT                                          73

     Several small tables scattered about the moonlit deck, Bloom
     and Penelope sit with flutes of champagne. Penelope, in an
     elegant but understated dress, shuffles a pack of cards.

                            BLOOM
                  You look very nice.

     She laughs as if at a joke she doesn't think is funny.




                                                                 44

                            BLOOM (cont'd)
                  What was your childhood like?

                            PENELOPE
                  I make cameras out of watermelons.

                            BLOOM
                  Lonely.

                            PENELOPE
                  Lucky guess.

     Penelope's hands move faster.     She knows how to shuffle
     cards.

                            BLOOM
                  How was it lonely?

                            PENELOPE
                  Fishing for an entertaining
                  childhood anecdote that
                  encapsulates my adult issues?

                            BLOOM
                  Well it's funny how everyone's
                  usually got one.

     As Penelope tells her story she gets fancier with her
     shuffles.

                            PENELOPE
                  When I turned six I started getting
                  allergies, hayfever, rashes, really
                  bad. So my mom took me into the
                  doctor, and he did that test where
                  they use needles to prick a grid on
                  your back with all the different
                  toxins, to see which ones you're
                  allergic to. The next day I came
                  in, the doctor lifted up my shirt,
                  and my back looked like a patch of
                  oily, moldy, blackish green double-
                  puff marshmallows. I was allergic
                  to everything. So they sealed the
                  house with plastic and a special
                  ventilation system, and I spent my
                  entire childhood and adolescence
                  indoors. Mostly alone. Lonely.

     She pulls the Queens out of the deck and lays them face up on
     the table.


  

                                                              45

                         BLOOM
               Wow.

                         PENELOPE
               It wasn't `til I was nineteen they
               discovered what I was actually
               allergic to was the aluminum alloy
               the hypodermic needle was made out
               of. Then I was going to leave, but
               my mom got sick. So I stayed. And
               she stayed sick, a long time.

                         BLOOM
               Do you feel cheated?

     Penelope does an amazing card trick using the four queens.

                         PENELOPE
               The trick to not feeling cheated is
               to learn how to cheat. So I
               decided this wasn't a story about a
               miserable girl trapped in a house
               that smelled like medical supplies
               wasting her life on a dying person
               she sometimes hated. It was about
               a girl who could find infinite
               beauty in anything, any little
               thing. And do anything she decided
               to do. And love the person she was
               trapped with. So I told myself
               that story until it became true.
               Now did doing that let me escape a
               wasted life, or did it just blind
               me so I wouldn't want to escape it?
               I don't know. But either way, I
               was the one telling my own story.
               So I don't feel cheated.

     She finishes the trick.

     A single pair of hands clapping turns their heads. At the
     far end of the deck, alone at a table, the large man in the
     fur collared cape, who for reasons unlikely to become clear
     at the moment will be called THE CURATOR.

                         THE CURATOR
               And a magician is just an actor
               playing the part of a magician.   My
               compliments.

     Bloom takes Penelope gently by the elbow and guides her up
     and away.

                                                                 46
   




74   EXT. BOW - NIGHT                                             74

     They stroll out onto the moonlit bow of the ship.

                         PENELOPE
               Who is that man? You avoided him
               earlier on the deck.

                         BLOOM
               I don't know, but he's carrying a
               knife up his sleeve and wearing a
               cape. Do me a favor and steer
               clear of him.

     A waltz drifts through the air from a band unseen.

                         BLOOM (CONT'D) (cont'd)
               I don't suppose in all your hobby
               acquiring you ever learned how to
               dance?

                         PENELOPE
               I went through a phase when I was
               mildly obsessed with the Bolero.

                         BLOOM
               Give me a minute.

     He leaves her alone. Clouds obscure the moon, shadows
     deepen. She shivers.

     A match strikes.   She jumps.

     The moon re-emerges, and she is no longer alone on the deck.
     The Curator lights a dapper briar pipe, shakes out the match.

                         THE CURATOR
               Mademoiselle.

                           PENELOPE
               Monsieur.

                         THE CURATOR
                   (in French, subtitled)
               I didn't mean to startle you.

                         PENELOPE
                   (in French, subtitled)
               Yes you did.

                      (in French, subtitled)
                  Apologies, but the deck was dark,
                  and I had to approach.
                      (English)
                  It's been such a time since I've
                  encountered the Brothers Bloom.

                            PENELOPE
                  You're in antiques?

                            THE CURATOR
                      (Cheshire grin)
                  Antiques. I wonder, my dear, if
                  you know the true nature of the men
                  you travel with?

     The band strikes up a Bolero. The Curator flicks his wrist,
     and a long thin blade falls into his hand.

                            THE CURATOR (cont'd)
                  A little fear might suit you, I
                  think.

     He raises the blade... it is in fact a fine mustache brush,
     which he delicately employs.

                            THE CURATOR (cont'd)
                  Bon soir, ma cherie.

     With that the Curator backs into the shadows, and is gone.
     Moments later Bloom trots up to her, oblivious.

                            BLOOM
                  It isn't a Spanish band, but
                  they'll do their best.

     He hands her a single blood red rose. She puts it in her
     teeth, and they dance. If there is a tinge of tension in the
     air, the Bolero suits it.

     The moon ducks behind a cloud once more, and they dance on in
     the dark.


75   INT. STATE ROOM - MORNING                                    75

     Bloom wakes with a start. Morning light pours in through his
     porthole. He opens it, looks out to sea.

     His dinner jacket draped over a chair. The rose in its
     lapel. He fishes it out. Runs his fingers over the teeth
     marks on the stem.

     Then raises an eyebrow at a lump in the breast pocket, and
     pulls out the stack of bills in the green rubber band.




76   EXT. DECK - MORNING                                          76

     The Chink and Penelope lie on their stomachs on the deck, a
     beer can pinhole camera between them.

     Penelope gives a lesson on how it works.

     The Chink appreciates her.


77   EXT. BREAKFAST DECK - LATER                                  77

     Bloom escorts Penelope to breakfast.

                  How'd you find her?

                  The Chi-nese, uh, Yeungling?   She

78   INT. KITCHEN - EARLY MORNING (FLASHBACK)                     78

     Bloom cooks breakfast in his bathrobe.

                            BLOOM (O.S.)
                  A few years back, when we hit the
                  top of our art dealing game, she
                  just appeared.

     A door opens and slams. Bloom turns. The Chink sits at his
     place at the table, suitcase beside her, smoking a cigarette.

                            BLOOM (O.S.) (cont'd)
                  She's stuck with us. We figure
                  when she gets bored she'll vanish
                  with the same lack of noise.

     Like feeding a strange animal, Bloom pours her coffee.   She
     drinks it without looking at him.

                                                              49

                         PENELOPE
               I like her.

                           BLOOM
               Good.

     They smile when they see Stephen and the Chink at a table.

     Their smiles drop when they see the Curator sitting with
     them. Bloom glares at the Curator, but speaks to Stephen.

                         BLOOM (cont'd)
               What's he doing here?

                         STEPHEN
               I invited him, sit down. This
               ship's too small to dance around
               each other for a week, we might as
               well have it out now. Bloom. Sit.
               Penelope, do you know our friend?

                         PENELOPE
               Only as the creepy Frenchman.

                         THE CURATOR
               Book-learned. You know languages
               but not accents, my dear. I am
               Belgian. Maxmillion Melville, at
               your service.

                         BLOOM
               Also known in certain professional
               circles as the Curator.

                         PENELOPE
               Pleased to make your acquaintance.
               What do you do?

                         THE CURATOR
               I'm a curator, presently for the
               National Museum in Prague. And
               yourself?

                         PENELOPE
               I'm an epileptic photographer.

                         THE CURATOR
               Good for you. Boys? What do you
               do?



                                                                 50

                  We have a legitimate antique
                  reselling business.

                            THE CURATOR
                  Baissez le rideau, la farce est

                            STEPHEN
                  We've gone straight, Max.

                             THE CURATOR
                  Pardon, but you do not ascend to
                  the grand heights of the Brothers
                  Bloom only to toss it all and sell
                  terra cotta to blue haired weekend
                  antiquers.

                             STEPHEN
                  We did.   Eat your waffles.

                            THE CURATOR
                  But Mademoiselle appears...
                  confused. Perhaps she is unawares?

                            BLOOM
                  Eat your waffles, fat man.

                            THE CURATOR
                  Unaware that the Brothers Bloom are
                  in fact the two most highly
                  respected art smugglers in the
                  western world?

                            STEPHEN
                  Were. We've been on the straight
                  for three years. So that's that.

                            THE CURATOR
                  Well, if that is that, then that is
                  indeed that. As you say.

     Penelope snaps her fingers.     Everyone looks up.

                            PENELOPE
                  Your name's Melville?

               Sorry, no, cause I noticed but I
               couldn't place it, this ship is the
               Fidele, which was the ship in
               Melville's novel "The Confidence
               Man." So that's weird.

     Everyone glances at Stephen, a little uncomfortable.

                         STEPHEN
               Huh.


80   INT. DECK - NIGHT                                         80

     Bloom paces, Stephen shuffles cards.

                         BLOOM
               I know you like to throw those
               clever little details in, but
               you've gotta watch that shit with
               her Stephen. She had a lot of time
               alone in that house, and she used
               it. She did the best Double Dutch
               Queens I've ever seen up on the
               deck last night.

                         STEPHEN
               Double Dutch Queens uses gaffed
               cards.

                         BLOOM
               She had them in her purse and cut
               them in while I was folding my
               napkin.

                         STEPHEN
               Jesus.

                         BLOOM
               That's what I'm saying. She's
               different, she knows, sometimes it
               feels like she knows everything.
               Doesn't that worry you?

                         STEPHEN
               No. But something about her is
               worrying you plenty.

                         BLOOM
               She feels like one of your
               characters.



                                                                   52

                  The day I con you is the day I die,
                  Bloom.

                             BLOOM
                  I know that.
                      (beat)
                  How did you get the Belgian, on our
                  budget?

                            STEPHEN
                  He's beautiful, right?

                            BLOOM
                  I didn't expect him to actually be
                  Belgian.

                            STEPHEN
                  I'm not sure he is.   I'm to bed.

     Stephen stands to go, then pauses.

                            STEPHEN (CONT'D) (cont'd)
                  I've always protected you, right?
                  The only real danger in this whole
                  play is that you'll actually fall
                  in love with her. Look at me.
                  Don't fall in love with her.


81   EXT. UPPER DECK - CONTINUOUS                                     81

     The Chink sits smoking her whittled pipe, watching Bloom
     alone on the deck. Stephen passes her, and she stops him
     with a look.

                             STEPHEN
                  Shut up.   I know what I'm doing.

     She hands him a thin piece of paper.       He looks it over.

                            STEPHEN (cont'd)
                  This came through just now?

     The paper is a telegram with the Fidele's imprint, received
     from St. Petersburg. Stephen reads it.




    

                                                                   53

     He crumples the paper, looks down at Bloom.

                  Wire him back for me. "Dear Dog

     Bloom and Penelope lie on the deck, watching dolphins.

     She says this word like she's eating chocolate:

                            PENELOPE
                  Smugglers. It's like an adventure
                  story. Whose idea was it to go

                            BLOOM
                  Mine. Stephen always loved the
                  life. Then he was almost killed on
                  a run to Jakarta, two thugs with
                  heads like canned hams worked him
                  beyond all reason.

               And I called it, that was it.

                           PENELOPE
               Scary.

                         BLOOM
               For me. Stephen enjoyed it. He
               loved the idea that we were
               internationally infamous art
               smugglers, but I think deep down,
               same as me, he felt like we were
               putting on a persona, faking it.

                         PENELOPE
               Telling a story.

                         BLOOM
               He'd love to die on a job.
               Cornered at midnight on a run to
               Jakarta. That's his dream, to tell
               his story so well it fulfills
               itself. It somehow would make it
               finally real for him.

                         PENELOPE
               That's kinda the thing we all want,
               right?

     He looks at her in the sun.

                         BLOOM
               Trying to get something real by
               telling yourself stories is a trap.
               Trust me on that one.

     With a wink, he is gone.     A beat.   Penelope stands apart.

                            BLOOM
                  My French is a little rusty, but I
                  believe he just told you `my offer
                  stands.'

     He brings her face close to hers, smoke twisting, and speaks
     unheard words low and fast.

                  Yeah. Medieval art bores the crap
                  out of me so I don't know it that
                  well. So that's what he does, he
                  makes pieces in his collections
                  disappear, then sells them off via
                  a trusted middleman.

                  That's what he does.

                            STEPHEN
                  Wonder who's his fence?

                            BLOOM
                  Probably his Spanish guy, right?
                      (asks Penelope)
                  Did he say who's buying?

                            PENELOPE
                  An Argentinian. Argentine?
                  Argentinian?

                            THE CURATOR
                  A gentleman from Argentina. He's
                  quite sick, cancer in his bones,
                  and desperate for sentimental
                  reasons to own this piece while he
                  may.

                  He'll sell it to a middleman for
                  one million, US. The Argentin...a
                  guy will pay two point five.

                             STEPHEN
                  Not bad.

                            PENELOPE
                  Is he legit?

                  The Curator? That's a relative
                  term. He's telling the truth.

                            BLOOM
                  I'm sorry you had to deal with that
                  guy.

     Behind Penelope, two porters load her steamer trunk into the
     back of a taxi.

                            BLOOM (cont'd)
                  Where's that cab going?

                            PENELOPE
                  The train station.

                            BLOOM

                             PENELOPE

     Bloom breathes.

                            PENELOPE (cont'd)
                  Let's do it. Let's, just, I want
                  to try this. Let's be smugglers.
                  I think it'd be fun. We should do
                  this.

                             BLOOM
                  No.

                  Well first off, we don't have a
                  million dollars.

                            PENELOPE
                  I do, I've got, that's whatever.   I
                  mean a real reason.

                            BLOOM
                  This is real, it's dangerous, it
                  could go very bad.

                            PENELOPE
                  I think a little real danger might
                  suit me. I'm gonna do it.

     She walks off towards the taxi.

                         BLOOM
               This is not an adventure story.

                         PENELOPE

               totally is.


94   EXT. HUNGARIAN COUNTRYSIDE - NIGHT                           94

     A train roars through the night towards Prague.


95   INT. STEPHEN'S SLEEPING CAR - NIGHT                          95

     Stephen reclines, hat on his face.    Bloom paces.

                         STEPHEN
               Take it easy. She's having fun,
               that's the point of this.

                         BLOOM
               She's making a flag for our
               "smugglers gang," man. She made me
               learn a secret smugglers handshake.
               Unhealthy. This afternoon, when
               she was writing, in the observation
               car? A letter? A journal? No.
               She is getting way too into this.

     Bloom fishes a crumpled piece of paper from his pocket and
     thrusts it in front of Stephen's face.

     On it are written dozens of variations in stylized fonts of
     "Penelope the smuggler."

                         BLOOM (cont'd)
               She's been singing the Smuggler
               Song since Athens.

                         STEPHEN
               What Smugglers Song?




 

                                                                59

                  You know, the one from whatsit, the
                  Disney thing, that Smuggler Song,
                  the `We're a band of smugglers hey,
                  la la la la la, we smuggle by night
                  and drink by day, smugglers ho, ho

                  isn't... there isn't a Smuggler
                  Song, is there? Ok. She made up a
                  Smuggler Song. With hand motions.

                            STEPHEN
                  The whole point of this was to
                  sweep her off her feet. Let her
                  enjoy it.

                            BLOOM
                  While it lasts.

                            STEPHEN
                  Nothing lasts.

     Exit Bloom.    Stephen sighs and drops his hat back on his
     face.


96   INT. BLOOM'S SLEEPING CAR                                    96

     Bloom reads. Footsteps pound by outside. Penelope and the
     Chink run past his door. A moment later a uniformed
     ATTENDANT runs past.

     A beat, then the footsteps come back, and the girls duck into
     Bloom's cabin, slamming the door. Sacks in their teeth.

     Off Bloom's quizzical look:

                               PENELOPE
                  Smuggling.     From the snack car.

     They pull bags of chips and tiny liquor bottles from their
     sacks.

     Bloom glares at the Chink, who tries to avoid his gaze.


97   INT. SNACK CAR                                               97

     Bloom pays the SNACK CAR ATTENDANT from a stack of Euros,
     while the Chink gives him counts on her fingers.



 

                                                                 60

                  Jameson.

                            BLOOM
                  I'm not paying for that.

     She holds up two fingers, the Attendant pours two.

                             ATTENDANT
                  Ice?

     She says no with a look, they drink.

                            BLOOM
                  She made up the Smuggler Song.

     The Chink nods.      Bloom pays for the Jameson.

                            BLOOM (cont'd)
                  I thought it was a Disney thing.


98   INT. PENELOPE'S SLEEPING CAR - LATER THAT NIGHT              98

     The lights are off. Penelope reclines on the bed, surrounded
     by empty tiny gin bottles. Drunk.

     Bloom sits on the floor, both framed in a big window looking
     out on a breathtaking moonlit landscape rolling hypnotically
     by.

                            PENELOPE
                  Gin is fuckin fruity. Have you
                  taken this train before?

                             BLOOM
                  Yeah.

                            PENELOPE
                  So this is all like fuckin
                  `whatever' to you.

                            BLOOM
                  I usually drink with the Chink in
                  the snack car, play cards.

                            PENELOPE

                  Mrs. Yeungling. That's her
                  smuggler nickname.

                            PENELOPE
                  That's offensive.

                            BLOOM
                  I think if it were offensive to
                  her, she'd let us know.

                            PENELOPE
                  Do I get a smuggler nickname?

     Bloom quietly slips the stack of cash in the green rubber
     band into Penelope's luggage.

                            BLOOM
                  No.

                  I think you're constipated.   In
                  your fuckin soul.

     Bloom makes several attempts to form a response to this
     before giving up.

                            BLOOM
                  What?

                            PENELOPE
                  You've got a big load of grumpy
                  petrified poop up your ass, I'm
                  just calling you out on it. Yeah
                  I'm pretending I'm a smuggler, so
                  you know what? I'm a fuckin
                  smuggler. If that's your thing,
                  fuckin tell it like you own it.

                  front of your feet, man, fuckin
                  jump into it and dance the shit out
                  of it. Stop fuckin thinking so
                  much. Enjoy the fuckin ride.
                  Fuck.

     A roll of thunder and spectacular flash of lightning ignites
     the landscape, and rain starts to patter. Penelope stiffens.

                            PENELOPE (cont'd)
                  Whoa.

      Another crash. Lying on her stomach, Penelope slowly starts
      feeling something which makes her undulate. Bloom stares,
      confused.

                          PENELOPE (cont'd)
                Whoa ha. Oh ho ho. Ohhhhhh whoooo
                ha ha ha ha.

      Beneath her, the train wheels rhythmically clack and vibrate
      against the tracks. Another flash of lightening, the rain
      falls harder.

      Penelope writhes.   Bloom silently shrinks back in terror.

      The door to her car latches, and Bloom is gone.

      Bloom sits drinking and playing cards with the Chink.    He
      spaces out, she snaps her fingers to wake him up.

      Penelope slumps pale faced in dark glasses.

      A cashier hands over an elaborate check, which Penelope signs
      and puts in an envelope.


106   INT. APARTMENT STAIRCASE - DAY                              106

      A baroque spiral staircase, the spine of a high apartment
      building. Our intrepid four ring the bell beside an
      apartment door.

                             THE CURATOR (FROM INSIDE)
                   Who the hell is that?! Who is it?!

                             STEPHEN
                   Candy-Gram. It's us, Max.

      Stephen pushes open the door, and an instant later a SHOTGUN
      BLAST takes out a chunk of the landing beside his head.

      They all dive onto the floor, piling on top of each other.

                             THE CURATOR (FROM INSIDE)
                   Who the hell are you, what do you
                   want, who the hell!!!!??

                  BLOOM                            STEPHEN
      Max! Max! It's us, Bloom,         Max! Max! It's Stephen and
      Stephen, Jesus, Max, easy,        Bloom, easy, whoa, Christ,
      whoa!                             whoa now!

      The Curator stands in the smoky apartment hallway, sloppily
      draped in a ratty bathrobe, bottle in one hand and shotgun in
      the other. He squints at them.

                             THE CURATOR (cont'd)
                   Ah. Good morning. Come in. I
                   have been drinking.


107   INT. THE CURATOR'S APARTMENT - LATER                        107

      A schematic of the castle laid on the kitchen table. The
      Curator looks even worse in the light, red rimmed eyes, heavy
      skin on his face.

                             THE CURATOR
                   Here, off the Basilica, are offices
                   of administration, and beneath
                   those, an otherwise inaccessible
                   section of catacombs. And the
                   book.




                                                                 65

                   Administrative offices.    So how do
                   you steal the book?

                             THE CURATOR
                   The book is already stolen. The
                   stealing is in the bureaucracy, in
                   the filing, red tape. As far as
                   the museum is concerned, the book
                   does not exist. I am the curator,
                   I walk in, pinch the copy girl's
                   baboosh, put the book in a
                   briefcase and walk out. Tomorrow,
                   say, at two.

                             STEPHEN
                   Today.

                             THE CURATOR
                   Today is not a good day.

                             STEPHEN
                   Tomorrow. Now what about this
                   Argentinian.

                             THE CURATOR
                       (blank, then realizes)
                   Ah, the Argentine? Senor Luise
                   Belguta Rioso. I get his file.


108   INT. CURATORS APARTMENT BEDROOM - LATER                     108

      Penelope and Bloom wander into the bedroom, looking at an
      array of beautiful paintings on the wall.

                             PENELOPE
                   Gin is slow death, man.

      Stephen and the Chink poke their heads in, leaving.   The
      Curator strolls in.

                             STEPHEN
                   We'll see you back at the hotel.
                       (glances at the Curator)
                   Soon.

      They go, leaving Bloom and Penelope, who squints at an
      unframed oil on canvas, of a lonely stone well in a primeval
      forest clearing. It sits at the foot of an unmade bed.



 

                                                                    66

                             THE CURATOR
                   From a private collection on the
                   island of Ikaria. That one.

                             BLOOM
                   Who painted it?

                             THE CURATOR
                   I don't know.

                             PENELOPE
                   Why is it the last thing you see
                   every night, and the first thing
                   you see every morning?

                             THE CURATOR
                   That's a story. You have a minute?

      He closes the blinds and sits on a stool in front of the
      painting. Setting the stage.

                             THE CURATOR (cont'd)
                   My daughter travelled with me when
                   she was very young, and I'd show
                   her the places and the art, all the
                   most joyous and terrifying things
                   in the world.

      Memories of his daughter's hand in his, flashing against the
      sun.

                             THE CURATOR (CONT'D) (cont'd)
                   I wanted that the world was alive
                   in the most fantastic way for her.
                   To built her a pair of wings. Make
                   these things real. But maybe more
                   than any other objet d'art, she
                   loved to hear she'd ask to hear the
                   story of the stone golem. From a
                   painting in a small private
                   collection on the island of Ikaria.

      He motions to the painting, and we move into it. As he tells
      the story the scenes are shown in the painting, just as still
      images, which we move across like a picture book.

                             THE CURATOR (CONT'D) (cont'd)
                   Well Rachel, like most monsters the
                   Golem was once a human. A boy,
                   about your age.

                          THE CURATOR (CONT'D) (cont'd)
                And one day the boy was walking
                home, and he quarrelled, he fought,
                with a good friend of his. They
                got very angry and his friend
                pushed him a certain way and the
                boy fell and struck his head and
                died. The boy's friend was very
                sad but also very frightened. So
                instead of telling the boy's
                parents, he did something awful.
                He pulled the body into a quarry, a
                pit of broken rocks, and hid the
                boy beneath a pile of large stones.
                Well. Years went by, and the boy's
                friend became a young man, and one
                day while drinking in town (which
                in his guilt he did quite a lot of)
                he heard that a well was being
                built near the forest... with the
                stones from the quarry. He ran to
                the quarry to find it nearly
                empty... no stones, no body. He
                ran to the well where the masons
                were finishing their work. `Did
                they find anything strange in the
                quarry?' he asked, expecting, maybe
                hoping they'd arrest him for the
                awful crime on the spot. But no,
                they said, motioning to the well.
                Nothing strange. Just stones.
                They left him alone there at the
                well, and he stood looking into it
                as the sun fell behind the
                mountains and twilight set the
                world in a deep, still silence.

      The last image we land on is the well, alone in the clearing.

      Its dark innards loom ominously in the long pregnant silence
      that follows.

      Then, with a piercing ROAR, a living monster of stone lunges
      out of the well, animated and terrifying, grabs the friend by
      the throat and with a crunching of bones and one last roar
      pulls him back down into the depths of the well.

      Silence again. We pull out of the painting, back to the
      Curator, sitting very still.

                          THE CURATOR (cont'd)
                My daughter died nineteen years ago
                today. She was six. She went out
                to play one afternoon and vanished.

                The next morning we found her, in a
                stone well on a neighboring
                property. I climbed down to her,
                but slipped and broke my leg, and
                while we waited for the rescue team
                to pull us out she died in my arms.
                If you've had a child... my whole
                everything just focused down to one
                thing, to hold her and make her
                feel safe. But no matter what I
                said to her, I couldn't stop her
                shaking, crying. Her last moments
                on this earth were filled with
                terror. Of a stone golem.

      He stands, opens the blinds, pours another drink.

                          THE CURATOR (cont'd)
                It was the first painting I
                `acquired.' I keep it maybe hoping
                some night the golem will come for
                me.

                Mademoiselle.

      Bloom keeps going, anxious to leave, but Penelope lingers on

                Right.   Oh, right.

      She gives him the envelope with the certified check. He
      shakes her hand, then deftly adjusts his grip so that just
      for a moment he holds her hand as you would hold a child's.

      He lets go, and smiles apologetically.

                             THE CURATOR
                Au revoir.

      They walk on, suddenly somehow holding hands.

      As they approach the hotel, Bloom deftly breaks their hand
      holding off. Penelope notices why.

      A smell breaks his concentration.

                Diamond Dog, carrying a cup and a
                cane.

      Standing behind him, a soft old man in an ashy suit and
      eyepatch. The DIAMOND DOG.

                           DIAMOND DOG
                Bloom. How long has it been?
                     (sits, orders)
                Tea.
                     (to Bloom)
                Can you believe that? Tea? Been a
                long while.

                          BLOOM
                If I call Stephen down he'll kill
                you.

                   Well then please don't call Stephen
                   down. Look at you, you're
                   terrified. C'mon now, look. Take
                   a look. I'm an old man with no
                   depth perception. You don't have
                   to be scared of me.

      The Dog plays with a heavy gold lighter, making sparks.

                             DIAMOND DOG (cont'd)
                   It's been a funny thing, watching
                   you boys take what I taught you and
                   eclipse me. I'm so proud to be a
                   footnote in the lives of the
                   Brothers Bloom. And you hate me.
                   The curse of all bad fathers - that
                   my presence on this earth after I
                   die will not live on the lips of
                   admiring men, but will sink into
                   the murky backwaters of my
                   children's psyches.

                             BLOOM
                   Is this profundity?   Cause you can
                   skip it.

                              DIAMOND DOG
                   Ha!   Ha ha. Piss and vinegar.

      The Dog scoots next to Bloom.

                             DIAMOND DOG (cont'd)
                   When I first took you boys in,
                   showed you the ropes, haunting St.
                   Pete's, piss and vinegar. I still
                   crave that youthful joy. Even
                   today.

      The Dog's hand touches Bloom's leg.     There is something
      horrible about this.

      Beneath the bar, Bloom grips the sharp pencil like a knife.

                             BLOOM
                   Don't touch me.

                             DIAMOND DOG
                   You probably won't believe I loved
                   you boys very much.



   

                                                               71

                          BLOOM
                You're going to take your hand away
                or I'm going to break your arm,
                there's nothing between.

      He does, but Bloom's fingers don't loosen on the pencil.

                          DIAMOND DOG
                But love, you know. We know, folks
                like us, you can always blink and
                realize that it's a fiction, and
                like Peter walking on water or
                Wiley Coyote running off a cliff,
                if you look down in doubt you'll
                fall. That's the price of our
                lives, the wax in our wings. One
                day Stephen's going to fall. It
                may be glorious, but he's going to
                fall hard and he won't be there to
                tell you what to do and protect
                you. When he's gone, remember me.

      The Dog has moved in very close to Bloom, his breath hot on
      his face, and his hand comes to rest fully on Bloom's leg.

      Bloom's hand with the pencil quivers, about to strike-

      When Bloom is pulled from the bar stool by a heavy hand.
      Stephen, his eyes burning through the Dog.

                          DIAMOND DOG (cont'd)
                Hello Stephen.

      Stephen smashes a bottle from the bar and slashes it across
      the Dog's hand.

      Waiters and porters tackle him, the Dog howls, holding his
      bleeding hand. Bloom stands numb, and puts the pencil in his
      pocket.


114   EXT. PRAGUE HOTEL - NIGHT                                  114

      Bloom watches the Dog get into a waiting black Mercedes. For
      an instant the car's interior light shows an 11 year old boy
      behind the tinted glass, as the Dog slides in and puts his
      arm around him.

      The Mercedes drives off.

                                                                72
  




115   EXT. PRAGUE STREETS - NIGHT                               115

      Right in front of the hotel, on the water. Bloom sips coffee
      from a china cup, spinning a paper in his hands. Stephen
      joins him, with a matching cup.

                          STEPHEN
                I'm sorry I wasn't there.

                          BLOOM
                You can't always be there.

                          STEPHEN
                No, I guess can't.

      A beat.

                          BLOOM
                That was a real tonal shift.    The
                Curator's tale.

      On one side of the paper is the sketch of Penelope, on the
      other is the con flowchart. "#12 - The Curator's Tale."
      "#14 - Castle Break-In."

                          STEPHEN
                I'm a big fan of tonal shifts. I
                didn't write it for him, though.

                          BLOOM
                He made it up on the spot?

                          STEPHEN
                I don't know.


116   INT. BLOOM'S HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT                           116

      Bloom flops into bed.   He turns and looks at the wall.

      Right on the other side of it...


117   INT. PENELOPE'S HOTEL ROOM - CONTINUOUS                   117

      Penelope lies in bed, looking at the wall also.   She closes
      her eyes.

                                                                  73
    




118   INT. BLOOM'S HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT                             118

      Bloom's breathing slows.   He closes his eyes.

      A beat. Then light snoring breaks the silence, coming
      through the wall. Penelope snoring.

      Bloom smiles slightly.   What a cute snore.

      The snoring deepens slightly.

      The clock on the wall advances from 1:30am to 5:50am, and
      through the window the horizon glows with the approach of
      dawn.

      Bloom lies wide awake on his back, red rimmed eyes wide open,
      the guttural snoring ringing in his ears.


119   INT. APARTMENT STAIRCASE - MORNING                          119

      Our four at the Curator's door. Bloom knocks, and they all
      step judiciously back. No response.

                           STEPHEN
                Max?

                          BLOOM
                We're a little early...


120   INT. THE CURATOR'S APARMENT - MORNING                       120

      Still and silent in the breaking light of morning.

      And totally empty.   Picked clean down to the bare walls.

      The only thing left in the apartment is the painting of the
      well... broken on the floor.

      Our intrepid four stand in various states of thoughtfulness.
      Penelope stares at the painting, Bloom at the window.

                          PENELOPE
                The Golem came for him. In my
                dream. Crawled out of the painting
                and killed him in a horrible way.






                                                                74
  
120   CONTINUED:                                                120


                             BLOOM
                   Well at least he had the decency to
                   just skip out on us, not do
                   something tacky like fake his own
                   death.

      Poking around the room, Bloom opens a closet. The Curator
      stands pressed against the back wall in his pajamas.

                             THE CURATOR
                       (sotto)
                   You're a little early.

      Bloom quickly closes it.

                             STEPHEN
                   I don't get it. If he was
                   hightailing it he could have waited
                   eight hours till we traded the
                   million for the book, and had some
                   traveling money. Well. Back to
                   antiquing. Nothing gained, nothing
                   lost.
                       (to Penelope)
                   And you got to see Prague, which is
                   nice.

      Penelope's eyes widen with realization.

                             PENELOPE
                   Oh.

                             BLOOM
                   You should stay in the city for
                   awhile, they have these amazing
                   puppet show opera things-

      But Stephen raises a hand to shut him up.

                             STEPHEN
                   Oh?


121   EXT. SIDEWALK BAR - DAY                                     121

      Several empty glasses of wine, one full one in Penelope's
      hand. All heads are slumped.

                             PENELOPE
                   Oh.





                                                                    75
      
121   CONTINUED:                                                    121


                             BLOOM
                   It's my fault. I can't believe I
                   left you alone with him.

      The Chink hands Stephen a piece of paper.       He glances at it.

                             STEPHEN
                   The check was cashed yesterday
                   afternoon, he'd have deposited it
                   in a Swiss account. I'm sorry Pen.

                             PENELOPE
                   What a waste.

      Bloom puts his hand on her arm, sympathetic.

                             PENELOPE (cont'd)
                   That poor man. What a waste.

      Bloom's expression turns quizzical.

                             PENELOPE (cont'd)
                   That poor Argentina man. He'll
                   never see the book now, it'll just
                   rot in the catacombs. What a
                   waste.

      When Penelope lifts her suddenly brightened eyes in a moment
      of divine inspiration, Bloom meets her gaze with fear.


122   EXT. CHARLES BRIDGE, PRAGUE - DAY                             122

      Bloom paces, Penelope looks up at the castle with binoculars.
      The Chink and Stephen stand by.

                             BLOOM
                   No. No no. Can't you see what
                   happened here, there is no book,
                   we've been swindled -

                             PENELOPE
                   But maybe there is, maybe it's
                   real, we don't know!

                             BLOOM
                   It's not real, it's a con.

                             PENELOPE
                   It's my money, I'm going to find
                   out for sure. He gave us every
                   piece of information we need.

  

                                                                  76
    
122   CONTINUED:                                                  122


      She spreads the castle floor plan out on a bench.

      Bloom turns to Stephen and the Chink with a "this is crazy
      right?" expression and gesture. They give him nothing back.

                             STEPHEN
                   We'd need to clear the
                   administrative offices.   Some sort
                   of disruption.

      The Chink strokes her chin in mock-thoughtfulness.

                             PENELOPE
                       (to Bloom)
                   C'mon. Help me break into this
                   castle. It'll be fun.


123   EXT. FIELD - DAY                                            123

      A Barbie Doll set up in the middle of the field explodes in a
      theatrical plume of fire.

      Several others follow suit.

      The Chink pops up from behind a mound of dirt in her aviator
      goggles, cigarette dangling from her lip. She leans on a
      detonator plunger.

      Bloom, Stephen and Penelope crouch nearby, watching her work.

                             STEPHEN
                   She's an artist with nitroglycerin.
                   It's kind of her thing.

                              PENELOPE
                   I feel like I want to know more
                   about her.



                    BLOOM                            STEPHEN
      Yeah.                             Yeah.

                             STEPHEN
                   Check the tat.

      On the back of the Chink's neck, a few finely scripted lines
      of Chinese.






                                                                77
  
123   CONTINUED:                                                123


                             STEPHEN (cont'd)
                   An inky wisp of personal
                   information. We transcribed it,
                   brought it into a Chinese
                   restaurant.

                             PENELOPE
                   What's it say?

                             BLOOM
                   The literal translation is
                   something about water cranes, but
                   essentially it means "When you're
                   done with something, blow it up."


124   INT. PENELOPE'S PRAGUE HOTEL ROOM - EVENING               124

      The Chink lies on the floor with Penelope, showing her how to
      build a tiny remotely detonated bomb. She slices a tiny bit
      off a brick of dynamite, sets it in a petri dish with a
      detonator, and puts the whole thing in a handbag.

      Penelope appreciates her.

      Bloom and Stephen hunker over the castle floorplan.

                             STEPHEN
                   There's a smoke detector in these
                   empty rooms in the east tower. So
                   we plant and set off a tiny -
                       (to the Chink)
                   TINY tiny, tiny charge.

      The Chink clicks a seemingly innocent ballpoint pen. With a
      BEEP, a tiny poof of fire plumes from the handbag setting it
      on fire, and the smoke rises to the ceiling.

                             STEPHEN (cont'd)
                   Fire drill ensues, offices empty,
                   and you'll have exactly four and a
                   half minutes to get through the
                   access hatch, into the catacombs,
                   get the book and get out before the
                   fire department arrives.

      Penelope and the Chink do their elaborate handshake, and she
      gives Stephen and Bloom a finger snap thumbs up.

                                                                  78
    




125   INT. PENELOPE'S HOTEL ROOM - LATER                             125

      Bloom and Penelope, up late at the table.     Going over the
      floorplan one more time.

                          BLOOM
                So straight down the corridor,
                again, tell me where.

                          PENELOPE
                Second left, third right, access
                hatch behind the copier, I need to
                sleeeeeeep...

                          BLOOM
                The abort code if we need to abort
                is "corned beef." For some reason.

                          PENELOPE
                Bloom, I need to sleep.

      He folds up the plans, she wraps up the brick of dynamite and
      bomb components and spots a black leather backpack beside an
      open handbag on the table.

                          PENELOPE (cont'd)
                Is this Yeungling's backpack?

                            BLOOM
                Yeah.

      She gently puts the brick of stabilized nitroglycerin inside
      the front zipper compartment, and sets the tiny petri-dish
      bomb beside the handbag.

                          PENELOPE
                You know what I feel?

                            BLOOM
                Horny?

                          PENELOPE
                Scared. All my big talk.       But this
                isn't a story, it's real.      Fuckin
                scary.

      She kisses him.    He kisses her back.

      The pure whole hearted sensuality with which they attack each
      other and the deluge of almost child-like need let loose in
      this one simple act quickly reaches a point where as a viewer
      we no longer feel comfortable intruding with our gaze.

      Fifteen seconds after this point, we FADE OUT.


126   EXT. PRAGUE - DAWN                                         126

      The sun arcs into the sky above the castle.


127   INT. PENELOPE'S PRAGUE HOTEL ROOM - DAWN                   127

      Bloom half wakes.

      Across the landscape of the bed, Penelope sleeps.   Sunlight
      on her body and her sleeping face.

      Distant KNOCKING.     From the next room over.

      Bloom's eyes snap open.    He scampers.


128   EXT. PRAGUE HOTEL WINDOW LEDGE - DAWN CONTINUOUS           128

      In his boxers, holding trousers and shirt in his teeth, Bloom
      swings over the ledge from Penelope's window into his.


129   INT. BLOOM'S PRAGUE HOTEL ROOM - DAWN CONTINUOUS           129

      He opens the door for Stephen, who regards him narrowly.

                             STEPHEN
                   Ready?


130   INT. PENELOPE'S PRAGUE HOTEL ROOM - MORNING                130

      The Chink picks up the backpack, handbag and petri dish bomb.


131   INT. PENELOPE'S PRAGUE HOTEL ROOM - MORNING                131

      Penelope folds a plastic bag and puts it under her jacket.


132   EXT. CASTLE ADJACENT STREETS - DAY                         132

      A little alcove with a good view of the castle.

 

                                                               80

      Stephen trains his gaze on one set of windows high in the
      Eastern tower. Bloom paces.


133   INT. EASTERN TOWER ROOM - CONTINUOUS                        133

      An empty storage room, half under construction. The Chink
      walks in, wearing the backpack and carrying the handbag. She
      goes straight for a spot just under a smoke detector.


134   EXT. CASTLE ADJACENT STREETS - CONTINUOUS                   134

      Stephen, Bloom and Penelope are joined by the Chink.

                              STEPHEN
                   Ok.

      He looks through his binoculars again.

                              BLOOM
                   Alright?

                              PENELOPE
                   Ok.

      They share a brief moment with their eyes, and Penelope trots
      off. The Chink caught it. She looks at Bloom slyly.

                             BLOOM
                   For the record, I'm still against
                   this. Why send her in alone?

      The Chink finds a way to casually smell Bloom's fingers.

                             STEPHEN
                   Because going in alone is a very
                   important thing to do. She's
                   walking into a zero security
                   tourism office during a fire drill
                   and taking a five hundred dollar
                   manuscript replica from a utility
                   crawlspace. Worst case scenario, a
                   file clerk asks if she's lost.
                   Which isn't even going to happen.
                       (to the Chink)
                   She's in position.

      He spots Penelope casually waiting beside an unmarked door.

      Bloom notices the Chink looking at him with a knowing grin.
      She mimes sealing her lips and tossing the key.



                                                                       81

      She then takes the ballpoint pen detonator... out of the
      handbag dangling at her hip.

                             STEPHEN (cont'd)
                   Cause nobody's going to know we
                   were ever here.

      Bloom spots the handbag.         Something's not right.

                               BLOOM
                   Uh-

      The Chink clicks the pen.


135   INT. EASTERN TOWER ROOM - CONTINUOUS                             135

      The black backpack, sitting under the smoke alarm, beeps.


136   EXT. CASTLE ADJACENT STREETS - CONTINUOUS                        136

      A THUNDEROUS EXPLOSION blows a massive ten foot wide chunk
      out of the side of the Eastern tower, spewing a painfully
      dramatic ball of fire and debris.

      Screams.   Shouts.      Panic.

      Our three look up at the tower, agape.

                               THE CHINK
                   Fuck me.

      Bloom grabs the binoculars from Stephen, looks for Penelope.


137   EXT. CASTLE COURTYARD - DAY                                      137

      Panicked tourists stumble away from the descending dust.
      Penelope sees what's happened, but holds her ground.

      The unmarked door opens, and a dozen business people pour
      out.


138   EXT. CASTLE ADJACENT STREETS - DAY                               138

                             BLOOM
                   Don't do it don't do it Penelope
                   don't-



     

                                                                  82

                             STEPHEN
                   They're locking down the castle,
                   she won't get in.


139   EXT. CASTLE COURTYARD - DAY                                 139

      She takes a step towards the door.


140   EXT. CASTLE ADJACENT STREETS - DAY                          140

      Bloom drops the binoculars and sprints.


141   EXT. CASTLE COURTYARD - DAY                                 141

      A burly SECURITY GUARD trots across the courtyard, herding
      tourists and smoking a cigar.

                             SECURITY GUARD
                   To ze back, no panic, to ze back...

      He blocks the office door, and sets his cigar down for a
      moment. Penelope spots it.


142   EXT. CASTLE ADJACENT STREETS - DAY                          142

      Bloom nears the courtyard, sees Penelope up ahead.

                             BLOOM
                   Pen! Don't - abort!   Corned beef!
                   Corned beef!


143   EXT. CASTLE COURTYARD - DAY                                 143

      Penelope deftly spins the cigar 180 degrees.

      The Guard absently picks it up and puts it back in his mouth,
      fire-side first. He howls, doubles over.

      She dashes into the door.

      Bloom bursts out of the crowd and lunges for the door, but a
      SECOND SECURITY GUARD stops him.

      Dozens more security guards swarm in. Overhead, an army
      helicopter buzzes by. Bloom stares into the doorway,
      helpless and scared.

                                                                 83
   




144   INT. TOURISM OFFICE HALLWAYS - DAY                         144

      Water rains down from the ceiling sprinklers.   Penelope
      weaves through the halls.


145   INT. COPY ROOM - DAY                                       145

      Cramped, ill lit, and with its own sprinkler.

      Penelope dashes in, shoulders the massive cold war era copy
      machine and with a Herculean effort pulls it away from the
      wall.

                          PENELOPE
                I'm in Prague. I burned a man's
                lips off to break into a castle in
                Prague.

      Revealing an access hatch.


146   INT. CRAWLSPACE                                            146

      Tiny, earthy.   Penelope shuts the hatch behind her.

      Light from a barred window illuminates a rectangular shape
      lying on a stone slab. Penelope approaches the small BOOK OF
      HOURS reverently.


147   EXT. CHARLES BRIDGE - DAY                                  147

      A full view of the castle reveals just about the worst case
      scenario. The entire area swarms with army helicopters and
      tanks, soldiers with rifles, yellow tape, news crews.

      Stephen, Bloom and the Chink sit behind the police line on
      the bridge with the rest of the crowds. Heads in their
      hands.


148   INT. CRAWLSPACE                                            148

      Penelope is broken out of her stupor by heavy footsteps all
      around her, soldiers searching the castle.

      Voices right outside the hatch.   She slides the wimpy little
      bolt shut. It rattles.

      She looks up - a moldy vent in the muddy ceiling.

                                                               84
 




149   EXT. CHARLES BRIDGE - DAY                                149

      Bloom suddenly stands.

                          BLOOM
                Wait. Wait, we're fine. She's
                fine. If the soldiers find her
                wandering the halls they'll assume
                she's a clerk, they'll just shoo
                her out. So as long as she doesn't
                do anything suspicious, she's fine.


150   INT. VENTILATION DUCT                                    150

      Penelope wriggles on her belly through a tin ventilation duct
      barely big enough for her. The book, encased in the plastic
      bag, hangs from her teeth.

      Sounds of soldiers searching the offices come from below her.

      Up ahead she sees a point of light. With a gleeful grunt she
      shimmies faster - she's nearly made it!


151   INT. TOURISM OFFICE - CONTINUOUS                         151

      A dozen SOLDIERS and the CHIEF OF POLICE have their eyes (and
      guns) trained on the tin ventilation duct above their heads.

      It is very very obvious not only that a person is crawling
      through it, but exactly where that person is.

      The Chief of Police pointedly coughs to get her attention.


152   INT. VENTILATION DUCT                                    152

      Penelope freezes.   A beat of silence.

      The tin gives way, and she plummets...


153   INT. TOURISM OFFICE - DAY                                153

      ...hitting the ground hard, then springing to her feet and
      through some knee-jerk primal instinct kicking a nearby
      soldier in the head.

      Eleven rifles cock and aim at her.




                                                                    85
      
153   CONTINUED:                                                    153


      And that's how she's caught, frozen in a kung fu stance,
      plastic bag in her teeth.

      She locks eyes with the Chief of Police.      Lets the bag drop
      from her teeth.

      And opens her mouth to speak.


154   EXT. CHARLES BRIDGE - AFTERNOON                               154

      The hubbub has died down considerably, soldiers march away
      from the castle in formation. Bloom Stephen and the Chink
      sit watching for some sign.

      Three police cars, sirens blazing, drive down the length of
      the bridge.

                             BLOOM
                   The Chief of Police.

      As the last one passes, Bloom sees the Chief of Police riding
      shotgun, and Penelope sitting with a soldier behind caged
      mesh in the back seat.

      His face falls.

      Then Penelope spots him, points and says something.

      Very suddenly, the police car stops.

      The Chief of Police gets out.       Nods at our intrepid three.

      And opens the door for Penelope. As she climbs out he
      motions for the passing soldiers to stand at attention and
      salute her.

      He kisses her hand.

                             CHIEF OF POLICE
                       (in Czech)
                   It has been a privilege, madame, to
                   behold even briefly such a strong,
                   beautiful flower.

                             PENELOPE
                       (in Czech)
                   Thank you sir, I will not soon
                   forget your kindness.

      She blushes and smiles, then does an unhurried victory strut
      back to Bloom, Stephen and the Chink.

  

                                                                    86

      The police cars drive off.

      Penelope pulls the book out from under her jacket and sets it
      on a bench. A moment of victorious silence.

      Clapping her hands, she does a little shuffle dance of joy.

                              PENELOPE (cont'd)
                       (sings)

155   EXT. SIDEWALK BAR - LATE AFTERNOON                              155

      Bloom and Stephen sit among empty wine glasses.

      The Chink approaches, gives Stephen a hand gesture.

                             STEPHEN
                   Let her sleep. Train doesn't leave
                   till eight.

                             BLOOM
                   That was real.

                             STEPHEN
                   Yeah, I know.

                             BLOOM
                   Fuckin scary.


156   EXT. PARK - LATE AFTERNOON                                      156

      Bloom walks pensively through a green park. Cat Stevens'
      "Miles from Nowhere" plays from a nearby radio.

      His eye catches something.       A shiny red apple on a fruit
      seller's cart.

      He approaches it slowly, face flushed, breath shallow, eyeing
      the elderly vendor with a thin semblance of nonchalance.

      Holy shit.    He is going to steal that apple.

      Deftly he passes, lifting and pocketing it just as the Vendor
      turns away. Bloom has done it. His pale face tightens.


  

                                                                   87

      And turns.

      And sees a five year old boy.      Giving him a stare of infinite
      judgement.

      Bloom turns on his heel and RUNS HELL FOR LEATHER.

      The vendor shouts. The little boy chases him, pointing and
      screaming. Dogs bark. People stare. And Bloom sprints,
      apple in hand, a joyful smile forming on his lips.


157   INT. PRAGUE POLICE STATION - EVENING                         157

      Stephen bails Bloom out.

                               STEPHEN
                   An apple?

                             BLOOM
                   Yeah, but it was part of an
                   epiphany.


158   EXT. HUNGARIAN COUNTRYSIDE - NIGHT                           158

      The train thunders South, towards Greece.


159   INT. TRAIN SLEEPER CAR - NIGHT                               159

      Stephen pokes his head into Penelope's car, says goodnight.

      As soon as he's gone, a foot dangles down outside the window
      and taps it. Penelope pulls it open, Bloom shimmies in with
      two mini bottles of gin.

      He kisses her.


160   INT. SHIP STATE ROOM - MORNING                               160

      Bloom holds a sleeping Penelope, watching the sun stream
      through the window and slipping the green rubber band cash
      into her suitcase.

      A low horn blows, and Bloom's face darkens.


161   EXT. THE ATLANTIC OCEAN - DAY                                161

      The good ship Fidele breaks the waves, blowing its horn.

 

                                                                 88

      Stephen stands on the deck.      Bloom joins him.

                             STEPHEN
                   Mexico.

      He strolls off, leaving Bloom watching the horizon gloomily.


162   EXT. DECK - DAY                                            162

      Our intrepid four sit around a small table (except for the
      Chink, who lies on a deck chair in a bikini and Chuck
      Taylors, sunning herself.)

                             STEPHEN
                   Oh-kay. We're rendezvousing with
                   Senor Rioso's guys here, on an
                   isolated beach just south of the
                   Mexican port town Tampico. A
                   simple handoff. Penelope and
                   Yeungling will stay with the car,
                   Bloom and I will do the handing.

                             PENELOPE
                   You guys seem a little tense.

                             STEPHEN
                   Well I'm not thrilled they set this
                   in Mexico. There could be
                   legitimate reasons, but Mexico's -
                   and I don't want to simplistically
                   vilify an entire country, but
                   Mexico's a horrible place. So
                   we'll be careful.


163   EXT. MEXICO BEACH - LATE AFTERNOON                         163

      The Chink fires an automatic pistol eight times into the dead
      center of a target pinned to a palm tree. She re-loads.


164   EXT. TAMPICO HOTEL GROUNDS - CONTINUOUS                    164

      The beach sprawling below them, Penelope and Bloom meander.

      The hotel itself feels very old, red ruinous stone.

                             PENELOPE
                   Is this going to be more dangerous
                   than I think, tomorrow?


 

                                                               89

                             BLOOM
                   Yeah. You should sleep at the
                   hotel tonight, I'll stay with
                   Stephen at the beach house. You'll
                   need sleep.

      On the distant beach, following the faint rapport of gunfire,
      a palm tree falls over.

                             PENELOPE
                   I'm really happy right now.   Are
                   you?

                             BLOOM
                   Right now I am.

      She kisses him and runs off along the cliff side, singing the
      smuggler song.

                             BLOOM (cont'd)
                   Penelope...

      But she's too far away now, and the ocean is too loud. She
      can't hear him, and he can't hear her, and in another moment
      she has vanishes into the green brush and white flowers.

      Behind Bloom's pained face, the sun dips towards the beach.


165   INT. BEACH HOUSE - NIGHT                                  165

      Stephen packs for tomorrow, Bloom stares out the black
      window, drinking. Flower in his lapel.

      Stephen picks up the con flowchart.

                             STEPHEN
                   The last box in our last con. Let
                   them begin the beguine. How's it
                   feel?

                             BLOOM
                   She's something special, Stephen.

                              STEPHEN
                   Uh huh.

                              BLOOM
                   Can I...

      He stares at his drink.


 

                                                                    90

                             BLOOM (cont'd)
                   Can I just have a little more time?
                   Just a few days. I want to keep
                   her, like this, I don't want this
                   to just end. Don't make me do
                   this.

                             STEPHEN
                   Be angry at me, you son of a bitch.
                   Don't be pathetic. Make you?
                   Jesus. I told you not to fall for
                   her-

                             BLOOM
                   I'm not gonna do this.

      Stephen comes very close to Bloom's face, looks him straight
      in the eye. Finds his answer.

                             STEPHEN
                   I don't believe you.

      He goes back to packing.


166   EXT. TAMPICO HOTEL GROUNDS - NIGHT                            166

      Bloom stands, the beach behind him, the glowing lights of the
      hotel before him. Growing determination.


167   EXT. HOTEL HALLWAY - NIGHT                                    167

      Bloom knocks on a door.       Penelope answers, in her bathrobe.

                                PENELOPE
                   Hey.

                             BLOOM
                   I know what I've gotta do. I've
                   gotta talk to you. Are you wearing
                   shoes?

                                PENELOPE
                   What's up?

      He pulls her out of the room.


168   INT. TAMPICO HOTEL GROUNDS - NIGHT                            168

      Bloom pulls Penelope by the hand, but she stops.

  

                                                                91

                   Bloom.   What?

      Deep breath.

                             BLOOM
                   My brother and I are con men. All
                   things considered, we might be the
                   most respected con man team working
                   today. And everything since you
                   hit me with your Lamborghini, all
                   of this, it's all fake. It's all a
                   con.


169   EXT. BEACH - NIGHT                                          169

      The waves break angrily on the beach. In the distance,
      Stephen finishes his drink on the beach house porch, goes
      inside and turns out the light.


170   EXT. TAMPICO HOTEL GROUNDS - NIGHT                          170

                             BLOOM
                   No, we were going to blow you off
                   tomorrow using the cackle bladder,
                   it's a, term, we have actors
                   playing the Argentina guy's men,
                   when we showed up the deal would go
                   bad, they would open fire on us,
                   Stephen and I would pretend to be
                   shot using blood packets, squibs.
                   That's - cackle bladder, in the old
                   days they put fake blood in chicken
                   bladders, so... So you'd escape
                   with the Chink, she'd send you off
                   with a little travelling money and
                   that would be that.

                              PENELOPE
                   Wow.

                             BLOOM
                   But that's not how this one's going
                   to end. I love you now, and I want
                   to get you out of this. I'm going
                   to do what I have to do to get you
                   out of this, away from all this for
                   good. Are you ready?

171   EXT. BEACH - NIGHT                                           171

      Bloom leads Penelope down the beach by the hand.

                           BLOOM
                 Stephen's gone into town to prep
                 the Argentina actors. Your money's
                 at his place.

                           PENELOPE
                 Money? I don't want the money,
                 let's just leave.

      For a moment he's tempted.      The dark beach house looms ahead.

                              BLOOM
                 C'mon.


172   INT. BEACH HOUSE - NIGHT                                     172

      Dark. Bloom leads Penelope in, stumbles in the dark,
      switches on a lamp. Click, click - it doesn't come on.

                           STEPHEN (O.S.)
                 You have to switch it on at the
                 base.

      A beat.   Bloom does.

      Stephen sits in an easy chair, not looking happy.     But not
      angry. Much more sad than angry.

                           BLOOM
                 So I've told her our whole play.
                 And I'm here. To take her money
                 back. How's that make you feel?

                           STEPHEN
                 Disappointed.

                           BLOOM
                 This isn't the ending you wanted?

                           STEPHEN
                 It doesn't matter now. This is the
                 way it ends. So let's get it over
                 with.

                           BLOOM
                 Where's the money?

 

                                                                    93

                               STEPHEN
                   I ate it.

                             BLOOM
                   Give me the money, Stephen.

                               STEPHEN
                   No.

                             PENELOPE
                   I don't want the money.

                             BLOOM
                   He's not going to keep a single
                   piece of you.

      Stephen stands.

                             STEPHEN
                   I'm sorry you fell in love with
                   her. But she's a mark. And all of
                   this, all of it is a con. Every
                   moment you shared with her, you
                   were just playing the part of a man
                   falling in love. That's what
                   you're afraid of, right? That you
                   don't know the difference? Or
                   maybe that there is no difference.
                   That that's what love is.

                             PENELOPE
                   We're leaving.

                             STEPHEN
                       (to Bloom)
                   No. You're too scared to leave.
                   You're scared to ride off into a
                   sunset that isn't painted
                   tarpaulin, cause real sunsets are
                   beautiful but they turn into dark
                   uncertain nights. If you were
                   ready for that, you wouldn't be
                   here. The money is in my bedroom.
                   Right behind me. But in my story
                   you don't get the money or the
                   sunset or the girl.

      A long beat.       The dark bedroom doorway looms behind Stephen.

                               PENELOPE
                   Bloom.    Let's just go.   Please.

      Bloom LUNGES, cracking Stephen in the jaw.

      Stephen goes down, Bloom leaps past him - but Stephen grabs
      Bloom's leg and brings him down.

      Then they are fighting.    Penelope watches, horrified.

      A frightening, brutal brawl that tears the small beach house
      apart, thirty years worth of a fight.

      Until Stephen throws Bloom to the ground at Penelope's feet.

      Upsetting a small table. The Chink's pistol, lying on the
      holey paper target, falls and strikes the ground.

      And goes off with a deafening rapport.

      Blood spreads just beneath Stephen's collarbone.

      Penelope screams.

      Stephen stays standing for a moment, shocked. A dribble of
      blood out of the corner of his mouth. He half grins.

                          STEPHEN
                Tastes like tin foil.

      And sinks to the ground.

      Bloom's eyes glaze.    He crawls to his brother.   Takes him in
      his arms.

                             BLOOM
                I'm sorry.

      Penelope watches the brothers holding each other. Tears in
      her eyes, but she backs away a step, very conscious of not
      being a part of this moment.

      Bloom looks up at her, almost taking a moment to recognize
      her.

                             PENELOPE
                Bloom...

      He doesn't move from his brother.

                             PENELOPE (cont'd)
                I'm sorry.

      She leaves.




                                                                 95

      For a long moment the Brothers Bloom lie in each other's arms
      in the middle of the broken room.

      Then Bloom stands, goes to the window and watches Penelope
      walking off into the distance down the beach.

      From the darkened bedroom doorway steps the Chink, her face a
      mask.

      Stephen stands.   Lifts his shirt and removes the squib and
      blood packets.

      Bloom steps outside.


173   EXT. BEACH HOUSE - NIGHT                                    173

      A wood patio with steps leading down to the sand.   Bloom
      watches Penelope, now very distant, almost gone.

      Stephen comes out, pulls out a flask.

                             STEPHEN
                Hey.
                    (nothing)
                I think that was the most honest
                conversation we've ever had.
                    (more nothing)
                You actually connected on a few of
                those punches.

                          BLOOM
                Did you expect me to do it? To
                come here tonight, end it the way
                you wrote it? Or were you really
                disappointed I didn't run off with
                her?

                           STEPHEN
                I was disappointed.    But I wasn't
                surprised.

      Bloom turns and SLUGS him in the jaw.   Stephen falls to the
      sand.

                          BLOOM
                I let you do your monologue, but
                you wanna know why I did it? I did
                it so she'd never want to see me
                again. To get her away from all
                this for good.


 

                                                               96

      Without looking back Bloom walks off down the beach, in the
      opposite direction of Penelope, leaving Stephen bleeding in
      the sand, alone in the dark uncertain night.

                                                       FADE OUT.

174   EXT. LUDICROUS MANSION - DAY                               174

      Penelope's home, bucolic on a lazy Spring day.

      At a picnic table at the far edge of the front lawn, Penelope
      sits writing with intense concentration on a piece of paper.

      After awhile she raises her head, regarding what she's
      written thoughtfully. Folds it up, puts it in her pocket.

      Clicks the seemingly innocent ballpoint pen.

      BEEP.

      The mansion EXPLODES, completely.

      She walks away without looking back.

      After a beat, the plaster deer explodes in a ridiculous
      fireball.


175   EXT. ITALIAN COUNTRYSIDE - DAY                             175

      Green hills surround the walled medieval city of Ferentino.
      A tiny white car inches its way across the countryside, and
      up into the city.


176   EXT. FERENTINO APARTMENT - DAY                             176

      Bloom walks up the stone alley to his apartment, a bag of
      groceries in hand. He spots the white car parked out front.

      Loud shouting in Italian grows louder, until Penelope and the
      Grandmother burst out the front door. Berating each other
      with Italian curses and hand gestures.

      Penelope sees Bloom, and freezes.

                            PENELOPE
                   Hello.




                                                                97

                                BLOOM
                   Hey.

      The Grandmother keeps up her barrage as she takes the
      groceries from Bloom, but as soon as she's behind Penelope's
      back she gives Bloom a wink, points to her and gives a thumbs-
      up of approval.


177   EXT. FERENTINO STREETS - DAY                              177

      Bloom and Penelope wander the twisty alleyways of the city.

                             BLOOM
                   How did you find me?

                                PENELOPE
                   The Chink.

                             BLOOM
                   How did you find the Chink?

                             PENELOPE
                   She gave me her cell when we got to
                   Mexico.

                             BLOOM
                   I didn't even know she had one.

                             PENELOPE
                   I think she's kind of selective in
                   who she gives the number to.


178   EXT. FERENTINO CAFE - LATER                               178

      They sit with wine and bread.

                             BLOOM
                   Why are you here, Penelope?

                             PENELOPE
                   Why did you decide to stay with
                   your brother instead of coming with
                   me in Mexico?

                             BLOOM
                   Everything Stephen said that night
                   was true.






                                                                   98

                             PENELOPE
                   I've been doing a lot of thinking
                   the past three months. I want you
                   to consider something.

      She takes a piece of paper from her pocket, unfolds it and
      slides it across the table to him.

      On it, written over and over in a dozen different stylized
      fonts, is "PENELOPE THE CON ARTIST."

      Bloom sets the paper down with a snap.

                             BLOOM
                   Go away. Everything Stephen said
                   was true. I was just playing you
                   as a mark. Everything between us,
                   none of it was real.

      She leans in close to him, her hand on his leg.

                             PENELOPE
                   I don't believe you.

      It's obvious even before she kisses him that she's right.


179   EXT. FERENTINO STREETS - DAY                                  179

      Bloom dials a pay phone.    He's been crying.    It rings.

                             BLOOM
                   Pick up... c'mon...


180   INT. MONTE CARLO CASINO - CONTINUOUS                          180

      Lush, Edwardian. In a private room, a card table is
      overturned. Stephen lies on the ground in a defensive
      posture, a RAVISHING WOMAN in red lunging at him with a
      curved dagger. A BEARDED MAN with an eyepatch holds her back
      by the wrists, while a MONOCLED MAN in an antique wheelchair
      holds his tear stained face in his hands.

      This whole scene is frozen like a tableau, as Stephen's cell
      phone chirps away.

      Annoyed, the Bearded Man gives him a `go ahead' nod.

      Stephen hastily answers it.



   

                                                                99

                   How quickly can you get to
                   Ferentino?

                             STEPHEN (ON PHONE)
                   Uh... Nine-ish?

      Bloom fishes out his pocket watch.

                              BLOOM
                   Alright.

      Click. As he's putting his pocket watch back, he finds the
      stack of green rubber band money in his breast pocket.

      Penelope plays cards with the Grandmother.


183   EXT. FERENTINO APARTMENT - NIGHT                           183

      Stephen and Bloom sit on the little landing outside the
      apartment.

                             STEPHEN
                   So she comes back wanting to work
                   with us. Honestly? I think we'd
                   be lucky to have her. If you
                   called me to hear my opinion on the
                   matter. Which I'm getting the
                   feeling you didn't.

                             BLOOM
                   I did what I did in Mexico to get
                   her out of all this. I would rather
                   die than bring her into the con.

                             STEPHEN
                   So maybe you want to tell me what
                   I'm doing in Ferentino.






                                                                 100

                   You knew she'd come back. What did
                   you figure she was good for,
                   another million?

                             STEPHEN
                   One point seven five.

                             BLOOM
                   We will play her again, one last
                   con, but not for money. I'm gonna
                   tell you how this one's gonna end.
                   You built us into this, you're
                   gonna fly us out, end it so she's
                   done with all of us. End it all so
                   it can't start up again.

                             STEPHEN
                   You want me to plan a con whose
                   sole purpose is to blow her off for
                   good?

                             BLOOM
                   I love her. You owe me this. I
                   don't want to turn her into me.

      Penelope sleeps on a cot against the window.

      Bloom enters wearily.    Sits in a chair.   Watches her.

      In the next room over, Stephen sits in the dark.    Shuffling
      cards.

      A lovely tune sung in Mandarin Chinese plays over this,
      segueing us into...

      TITLE CARD - Shanghai

      A wall of monitors, which the Chink steps in front of,
      singing the climax of the song. Beautiful and sad.

      As the song ends, she sees through the spotlight Penelope,
      Bloom and Stephen at a table. Penelope waves.

      disappointment.

                   So what's the next job?

                             STEPHEN
                   Before we do the next job, we need
                   to liquidate our assets from the
                   last job.

                             PENELOPE
                   But you've got-

                             STEPHEN
                   Your money from the last job, well
                   that's profit, not capital, the
                   three of us have already split it
                   up. So step one: sell the book of
                   hours.

                             PENELOPE
                   I thought it was fake.

                             STEPHEN
                   With all your random expertise we
                   couldn't risk a flat out fake. It
                   isn't worth two point five million,
                   we could maybe catch four hundred
                   grand for it, but it's real. Who'd
                   we buy it from?

                              BLOOM
                   Minskie.

                             STEPHEN
                   Perfect, we'll sell it right back
                   to him.

      The Chink hands him a piece of paper.

                             STEPHEN (cont'd)
                   If he wasn't dead.

                             BLOOM
                   Well there's Demarco or Boyer. Or
                   Roche, if we want to go state-side.



                                                                  102

                   All traceable. With Minskie out
                   we'd have to go deep black market
                   if we wanted to be a hundred
                   percent clear. There's only one
                   place that's deep enough for that.

      Bloom and the Chink know exactly what he's talking about, and
      they don't look happy.

                   Where?

                   Russia. It's like `cancer', I
                   don't even like saying the word.

      Bloom, Stephen and the Chink drink in a cramped little
      concrete room adjacent to the bar's kitchen.

                             STEPHEN
                   We're obviously not going to deal
                   with real Russians. They'll be our
                   guys in a phony set up, they'll
                   take our phony book and give her
                   phony cash, a closed loop. Safe
                   and simple.

      Bloom looks to the Chink for an opinion.      Gets a blank face.

                              STEPHEN (cont'd)
                   So.   We go to St. Petersburg.

      At the mention of St. Petersburg Bloom looks sharply at
      Stephen, but Stephen presses on.

                             STEPHEN (cont'd)
                   She does the hand-off with our fake
                   "Russians." But while we're
                   driving out of town, everything
                   goes bad.

      He lays a simple flowchart, drawn on a napkin - three boxes.
      He points to the first, "Penelope sells book to `Russians'"

                   We discover we were sold a
                   counterfeit book in the first
                   place, which we've now sold to
                   Russian smugglers. We discover
                   this when the Russian mob starts
                   taking us out one by one. Oh shit.

      He points to the second box, "Red Dawn."

                             STEPHEN (cont'd)
                   First they ambush our car,
                   destroying the money. Then they
                   take me out, then the Chink, and
                   finally you Bloom, in a heroic
                   death that allows Penelope to
                   barely escape with her life.
                   Devastated but reborn with the
                   knowledge that you loved her so
                   much you died so she could live,
                   she drives off into a romantic life
                   of adventure and peril, on the run
                   from imaginary Russians.

      He points to the third box, "The End."

                             STEPHEN (cont'd)
                   What do you think?

                                                          CUT TO:


188   EXT. ST. PETERSBURG - SUNSET                                 188

      The blood red sun sets over the city.


189   INT. ST. PETERSBURG HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT                       189

      Penelope snores on the bed, while our intrepid three unpack.

      The phone rings.    Stephen answers it, listens, hangs up.

                             STEPHEN
                   Our "Russians" have arrived.


190   INT. ELEVATOR - NIGHT                                        190

      Stephen, Bloom and the Chink ride down to the lobby with a
      red suitcase.


 

                                                                104

                             BLOOM
                   Who'd you get, anyway?

                              STEPHEN
                   Hm?

                             BLOOM
                   To play the "Russians?"

      DING.

      The elevator doors open, revealing the Diamond Dog.

                              DIAMOND DOG
                   My boys.


191   INT. HOTEL BAR - LATER                                     191

      Empty. The Dog leans against the bar with several LACKEYS,
      waiting patiently, making sparks with his gold lighter.
      Sounds of shouting come from the adjoining dining area.


192   INT. HOTEL DINING ROOM                                     192

                             BLOOM
                   I don't understand. Tell me so I
                   understand. Three months ago you
                   were ready to blind the old bastard-

                             STEPHEN
                   We need someone who can pass for
                   the Russian mob to buy our fake
                   book. The Dog's got his big store
                   right here in St. Petersburg.

                             BLOOM
                   Alright, fuckin stop. You want
                   this to finish in St. Petersburg,
                   you want this to end with the Dog
                   for some what thematic something?
                   Fine but don't tell it like a
                   story, let's say it. Twenty three
                   years ago and I can still smell,
                   that blood red apartment of his,
                   the smell of that place. I hate
                   him Stephen but this isn't that,
                   this is I don't trust him.




 

                                                                  105

                              STEPHEN
                   What's he gonna do? Steal our fake
                   money?
                       (beat)
                   I've thought this one out, believe
                   me. And we can't end it without
                   him. Trust me. It's gonna be ok.


193   INT. HOTEL BAR - LATER                                       193

      The red leather suitcase on the bar.

                             DIAMOND DOG
                   Stephen, still the grand architect
                   with your symbols. Red for
                   temptation, white for salvation.

      The Dog opens it, revealing US hundreds.      Examines it with a
      loupe.

                             DIAMOND DOG (cont'd)
                   Impressive, boys.

                             BLOOM
                   It's trash. There's visible cross
                   hatching in Franklin's eye.

      Sure enough - obvious jagged misprints cut into Ben
      Franklin's eye on the bills.

                             DIAMOND DOG
                   Hm.  I'll be damned.
                       (closes case)
                   Ruskies wouldn't be caught dead
                   handing over a rag bag like this,
                   it should be a steel attache.

                               STEPHEN
                   This'll   do. We'll do the drop off
                   at your   store. Make it scary,
                   think a   movie version of the
                   Russian   mafia, but don't hassle
                   her.

                               DIAMOND DOG
                   Alright.

      The Dog closes the case, and for a moment Bloom's eyes rest
      on his bandaged hand.

      He then takes the case and quickly moves off with his crew.

 

                                                                  106

                   I look forward to meeting the lady.
                   Take care, boys.

      Leaving his gold lighter on the bar.


194   INT. HOTEL CAR PORT - NIGHT                                  194

      The Chink leads Stephen and Bloom around the brown Peugeot.

                             STEPHEN
                   So. Our fake Russian attack. One
                   small charge will simulate a bullet
                   hit, and blow out the back window.

      The Chink points with an extendable pointer to a small nub on
      the rear windshield.

                             STEPHEN (cont'd)
                   So that one bang, then we roll off
                   the road. Once we get clear of the
                   car the Chink sets off the final
                   charge, incinerating the car and
                   the money in the trunk. This'll
                   all happen exactly twenty seconds
                   after we cross the main bridge out
                   of town. After the bridge.

      Stephen makes a note in a manila envelope, tucks it in his
      jacket.

                             BLOOM
                   Ok.


195   INT. HOTEL HALLWAY - LATER                                   195

      Bloom and the Chink walk back to their rooms.      The Chink is
      expressionless.

                             BLOOM
                   You've been awful quiet.

      She doesn't react.

                             BLOOM (cont'd)
                   I'm doing this for her.

      But a door clicks shut, and Bloom is alone in the hall.

                                                                   107
      




196   INT. PENELOPE'S HOTEL ROOM                                    196

      Penelope in bed. Her door cracks open, and she sleepily
      looks up. Bloom stands silhouetted in the doorway.

                          PENELOPE
                Tomorrow it all starts.

      She lifts the sheets. He gets into bed, and as she drifts
      into peaceful slumber Bloom is very conscious of holding her
      for the last time.

      When her snores begin, he has ear plugs ready.


197   EXT. ST. PETERSBURG - SUNRISE                                 197

      The Peugeot drives into the heart of the city.


198   EXT. ST. PETERSBURG ALLEY - DAY                               198

      Bloom, Stephen and the Chink parked in an alley, watching a
      doorway across the street with a pair of binoculars.

      Bloom breathes uneasily, checks his watch.

                          BLOOM
                She gives the Dog the book, he
                gives her the fake money. This is
                taking too long.

      Just then Penelope trots out.    Metal attache case in hand.


199   EXT. RUSSIA HIGHWAY - MORNING                                 199

      On the outskirts of town, parked beside a murky little lake.
      Our heroes gather around the metal attache case on the hood.

                          PENELOPE
                He hassled me. Took forever
                looking the book over, haggled the
                price. Wanted to pay me in Rubles.

      Stephen smirks, then opens it.    The money's there.

                           STEPHEN
                Alright.   Let's get the hell out of
                Russia.


  

                                                                 108
    
199   CONTINUED:                                                  199


      Bloom pulls the Dog's gold lighter from his pocket, takes one
      last glance at St. Petersburg and tosses it down into the
      lake.


200   EXT. ST. PETERSBURG HIGHWAY - MORNING                       200

      The brown Peugeot drives towards the climbing sun.


201   INT. PEUGEOT                                                201

      The Chink drives, Stephen rides shotgun.

      Bloom and Penelope in the back seat.    He looks weary.

      He sees the bridge approaching, maybe a half mile ahead.

      She pulls his head down into her lap, fingers in his hair.
      He breathes, closes his eyes.

      An explosion shatters the front passenger window.

      Bloom's eyes snap open, he bolts upright.

      The bridge is still a quarter mile away.

      In the next moment the car becomes a din of breaking glass,
      screams, tires screeching.


202   EXT. ST. PETERSBURG HIGHWAY                                 202

      A BLACK MERCEDES roars out on to the road, machine gun fire
      blazing from its windows, literally shredding the Peugeot.

      The car spins, tires flapping, and hits a highway embankment
      full speed, launching into the air.


203   INT. PEUGEOT                                                203

      A moment of strange silence as the car flips mid-air.     The
      brothers lock eyes for a split second.


204   EXT. FOREST BESIDE ST. PETERSBURG HIGHWAY                   204

      The car slams into the steep grassy embankment, manages to
      flip upright, and rolls into a thick forest, coming to an
      abrupt stop against a stout tree.




                                                                   109
      
204   CONTINUED:                                                    204


                             STEPHEN
                   OUT!

      They all four dive out of the car, Bloom shoving Penelope,
      tumbling into the thick forest an instant before the car
      becomes a roiling ball of flame.

      Bloom lies shell-shocked, his vision blurry. He vaguely sees
      Penelope passed out beside him, Stephen on the other side of
      the car.

      A DARK FIGURE comes trotting into the woods, shining a
      flashlight on the charred car. Goes to Stephen. Reaches
      down to him...

      Bloom's mind flutters away into darkness.


205   INT. FOREST - DAY                                                205

      Bloom wakes. Rain splattering.       Slumped against a tree.
      Penelope hunches over him.

                             BLOOM
                   What happened?

                             PENELOPE
                   Are you alright?

                             BLOOM
                   What happened?

                             PENELOPE
                   Yeungling went to get another car.

                             BLOOM
                   Where's Stephen?

                             PENELOPE
                   We don't know. He was gone.

      Bloom stands shakily, goes to the charred car.      Runs his
      fingers over the dozens of bullet holes.

      Goes to where Stephen fell.       Lying in the grass, a manila
      envelope.

                             PENELOPE (cont'd)
                   We're going to find him. If he
                   escaped, he'll contact us. If
                   they've got him, it's for ransom.


  

                                                                110

                             BLOOM
                   Who's got him?

                             PENELOPE
                   The Russians.

      The Chink pulls up in the green bug, headlights catching
      Bloom's face against the dark forest depths.


206   EXT. PARKING LOT - DAY                                     206

      A desolate gas station parking lot. Bloom sits in the Bug,
      loading his revolver with shaky fingers. Penelope stands
      outside.

                             BLOOM
                   Stephen, god please what's
                   happening. I don't know what to
                   do. I don't know Stephen please.
                   Please. What's happening. Please.

      A long black sedan screeches to a halt in the parking lot
      outside the window, Bloom bolts out of the car, pistol ready.

      But the Chink climbs out of the black sedan.

                             PENELOPE
                   Where does she get all these cars?

      Bloom motions for Penelope to stay back, then goes to meet
      the Chink in the middle of the parking lot.

                             BLOOM
                   If you know what's happening, now
                   would be a really good time to
                   speak up.

      She sets a suitcase down beside her.    Bloom takes this in.

                             BLOOM (cont'd)
                   No, please. Not now. I need your
                   help here now, I don't know what to
                   do.

      The slightest smile communicates all the compassion in the
      world. But she's leaving.

      She hands him a small slip of paper, their fingers touching
      for an instant.



 

                                                                    111

      She gives Penelope a quick little "call me" gesture, picks up
      her case and walks off.

      A truck blocking our view of her car pulls away, and she gets
      in.

      Bloom looks down at the slip of paper.        A short phrase, in
      Chinese.

                               BLOOM (cont'd)
                   Thanks.

      The engine turns over, and the Chink's car EXPLODES in a
      dramatic fireball.

      The paper flutters out of Blooms's fingers a moment before he
      and Penelope are thrown to the pavement by the shock wave.

      Bloom and Penelope lift their heads, absorbing what just

207   EXT. CHICAGO - DAY                                             207

      A busy street, which a title card identifies as "Chicago,
      Illinois."

      On the corner, an unassuming Chinese restaurant.


208   INT. CHINESE RESTAURANT - DAY                                  208

      A dive.   The chef on the phone.

                             CHEF
                   Ah, ah yes, Mr. Bloom.      Yes, ok.

                               ALL THE COOKS
                   Blooooom!

      He puts the phone down and goes to the fax machine, which is
      spitting out a facsimile of the Chink's slip of paper.


209   INT. ST. PETERSBURG COPY SHOP - EARLY MORNING                  209

      Bloom on a pay phone, scribbling on a piece of paper.




   

                                                               112

                             BLOOM
                   Uh huh. Assholes. Ok. Um, ok.
                   So I've got "We are all assholes in
                   our own theatrical enterprises."
                   You sure?

      This phrase, written on Bloom's paper.

                             CHEF
                   And then it end with "Goodbye shit
                   head."

                                BLOOM
                   Shit head?

                             CHEF
                   But it is different meaning in
                   Mandarin, uh, endearing. "Shit
                   head" if you have affection for
                   shit.


210   EXT. SIDEWALK - MOMENTS LATER                             210

      The Bug parked nearby. Penelope sits on the curb, crying.
      Bloom sits next to her.

                             PENELOPE
                   What did it mean?

                             BLOOM
                   I don't know.

                             PENELOPE
                   What did it say?

                             BLOOM
                   "We're all of us marks in our own
                   cons." And she said goodbye.

                             PENELOPE
                   I still can't believe it.

                             BLOOM
                   That the Chink fell for a car bomb?
                   Neither can I.

                             PENELOPE
                       (hopeful)
                   What? Oh, oh god do you think she
                   faked it? So the Russians would
                   think she was dead?



                                                                   113

      Bloom stands, paces away. He leafs limply through the manila
      folder - addresses, pictures, information...

      A paper with the Dog's photo clipped to it.       An address in
      St. Petersburg.

      The napkin Stephen wrote the con flowchart on.      The third box
      - "The End."

                             PENELOPE (cont'd)
                   What do we do now?

      Scrawled on the inside of the manila envelope - "An unwritten
      life." Bloom's face clears. He wipes his eyes.

                             BLOOM
                   Ok.

      Bloom goes to the Bug.

                             PENELOPE
                   Where are you going?

                             BLOOM
                   This wasn't Russians. This was
                   done by an old mentor of ours who
                   wants us off the map. He has an
                   apartment in St. Petersburg. So
                   this is, yeah. I've gotta go back
                   to that apartment to face the Dog
                   and get my brother back. That's
                   how I'm gonna end this.

      Penelope's eyes gleam. She jumps up to the passenger door,
      and Bloom stops her with a weary look.

                             PENELOPE
                   We can skip the whole you-sending-
                   me-nobly-away-and-me-refusing-to-
                   leave-your-side-thing.

                             BLOOM
                   Thank Christ.


211   EXT. ST. PETERSBURG STREET - LATE MORNING                     211

      A narrow alley between tall apartments.    Bloom parks, pulls
      his gun and checks it.




  

                                                                     114

                   If there are shots you run to the
                   car and drive, with or without me.


212   INT. APARTMENT ENTRYWAY - DAY                                   212

      A badly lit apartment hallway.       Bloom approaches a door,
      Penelope behind him.

      His breathing becomes hard.        His face contorts.   He crumples
      next to the door.

                             PENELOPE
                   What's in there? Tell me who this
                   guy is.

      Bloom's breathing steadies.

                             BLOOM
                   He's just an old man.

      He tries the knob.     It opens.


213   INT. DIAMOND DOG'S APARTMENT - D                                213

      Blood red walls.

      Dark, neglected and to all appearances empty.       Bloom creeps
      down the darkened corridor, gun outstretched.       Breathes
      through his nose, chokes.

                              BLOOM
                   Dog!   I came back.

      He kicks open a door, revealing a large living space.         Empty.

      He lowers his gun, switches on the light.

      Penelope enters.     Sniffs the air.

                             PENELOPE
                   Moth balls.

      Bloom almost laughs.

                             BLOOM
                   Is that what that smell is?

      BAM! A closet door smacks open, revealing the business end
      of a double barrel shotgun.

    

                                                                   115

      Bloom spins, gun drawn.      Penelope screams.

      Then a moment of stillness.       The shotgun barrel quivers.

      It's held by the 11 year old boy Bloom saw in the Dog's
      Mercedes in Prague. Malnourished and scared.

      Penelope approaches him slowly.

                             PENELOPE
                       (in Russian)
                   It's okay. Honey, it's alright.

      The shotgun sinks to the ground.      Penelope strokes his hair
      back from his face.

      Bloom lowers the gun, trembling.

                             BLOOM
                   Ask him if anyone else is here.

      She does.

                             BOY
                   Nyet.

                             BLOOM
                   Ask him where the Diamond Dog is.

                             PENELOPE
                   Diamond Dog?
                       (in Russian)
                   Where is the Diamond Dog?

                             BOY
                       (in English)
                   The Dog of Diamonds is gone.

      Bloom does a quick search of the rest of the room. As he
      does Penelope asks the boy one more question in Russian, and
      gets a quick answer.

                             BLOOM
                   Get the car started.

                             PENELOPE
                   What about him?

                             BLOOM
                   It's alright.



  

                                                               116

      She believes him, and goes.   Bloom kneels in front of the
      boy.

                          BLOOM (cont'd)
                You don't need to be afraid of him
                anymore. Or angry at him. Or ever
                come back here again. He doesn't
                concern you anymore. Understand?
                It's gonna be ok.

      The boy nods. Bloom hands him the stack of bills wrapped in
      the green rubber band. The boy snatches it and runs off.


214   EXT. ST. PETERSBURG STREET - DAY                             214

      Bloom trots out of the apartment building, and sees two
      things: Penelope working the VW's starter, and a black
      Mercedes speeding down the narrow street towards her.

      He sprints towards her, screaming

                           BLOOM
                Get out!   Get out of the car!!

      She sees the approaching Merc, too late, and ducks down.

      A hand hurls something from the darkened window. It smashes
      through the Bug's passenger side window, showering Penelope
      with glass.

      The Mercedes roars off down the street.

      Bloom reaches the Bug and throws the door open.

      Penelope lies covered in safety glass, holding a Russian
      nesting doll.


215   INT. BUG - LATER                                             215

      The seven progressively smaller dolls lie open on the back
      seat, Bloom holds the two halves of the final tiny doll, and
      Penelope holds a note.

                          PENELOPE
                It's a ransom note. It says they
                have Stephen, it says they want the
                money wired to a specific account,
                they give a bank to do it at and a
                manager to ask for.

                   I'll wire the money from my
                   account, and we'll go get Stephen.

                             PENELOPE
                   It's a lot.

                               BLOOM
                   How much?

                   One point seven five million.

      A cold pit opens in Bloom's stomach.

                   Oh.   Oh oh. No no NO.

      He punches the dashboard.

                   This might all be a con. By my

216   EXT. ST. PETERSBURG BANK - DAY                              216

      Bloom sits in the car, alone. He punches the dashboard
      again, helpless enraged and scared.

      Penelope gets in, looks at the address on the note.

217   EXT. BURNED OUT THEATER - DAY                               217

      Penelope and Bloom sit in the car, parked in front of the
      impressive facade of a closed, burned out old theater.

      The clock on the dashboard reads 1:50.

                           BLOOM
                I'm so scared. Anything I can
                imagine finding in there, I'm
                scared of.

                I'm going to be here when you come
                out.

      She kisses him.

      He puts his hand on the door.    Hesitates.   Then goes.

      Walks up the stairs to the inky maw of the theater door.
      Goes in alone.

                                                               119

      No lights. Moldy dust. A genuinely creepy place.      Bloom
      steps lightly, deeper into the theater.

                           BLOOM
                Stephen!

      A few lights flicker on the walls, fitfully illuminating the
      broken dusty seats and bare ruined stage.

      Bloom walks down the aisle, trying to keep his voice steady.

                           BLOOM
                Stephen!

      A spotlight snaps on from the mezzanine, right in Bloom's
      face. He spins, trapped in its glare.

      A guttural command is shouted in what might be Russian.

      When Bloom doesn't respond, the spot silently advances a few
      feet ahead of him towards the stage.

      Bloom gingerly follows it, up onto the splintered stage and
      finally resting on a split in the tarpaulin backdrop.

      With a wary glance back, Bloom steps through it.


220   INT. THEATER BACKSTAGE                                        220

      Giant fossils of antique stage scenery. Utility lights high
      above, cut by scaffolding, patch everything in dim jagged
      forms of light and black.

                          BLOOM
                    (unsteady)
                Stephen. Game's up. Come on out.
                Let's blow this one hat town.

      Silence. Then a harsh utility lamp snaps on, cruelly
      lighting Stephen's face.

      Shockingly bruised and battered, old and new blood.

      Bloom cries and rushes towards him...




                                                                120

                              STEPHEN
                   No!   No Bloom, freeze.

      He obeys. Stephen is tied to a chair. A dark figure behind
      him holds the lamp with a black gloved hand.

                             BLOOM
                   Stephen, who is it?   Is it the Dog?

                             STEPHEN
                   Did Penelope wire the money?

                              BLOOM
                   Yeah.

                             STEPHEN
                   They're calling to check right now.
                   Don't move. I'm alright.

      The dark figure's cell phone rings, he holds it to his ear
      for a moment then flips it closed.

      Something happens in the blackness, and Stephen shakily
      stands, cut loose.

                             STEPHEN (cont'd)
                   Stay where you are, Bloom. I'm
                   coming to you.

      He takes a couple wobbly steps.

      Behind him, Bloom sees the dark figure raising his gun
      towards Stephen's back, pulling the hammer...

      And the utility lamp switches off.

                              BLOOM
                   No!

      Bloom's revolver pops out of his sleeve and he's firing into
      the blackness.

      Stephen drops flat to the ground.

      The fiery rapport of a big pistol flashes from the blackness,
      strobing the scene like stage lightning.

      Bloom reloads behind the cover of a heavy flat, but Stephen
      lies on his stomach out in the open.

                              BLOOM (cont'd)
                   Stephen!



                                                                 121

                              STEPHEN
                 Stay back!

      But Bloom makes a dash for his brother, out into the open,
      unloading three more rounds into the dark.

      The dark figure returns fire on Bloom, who is sprinting full
      on his feet in a large pool of light. A sitting duck.

      Stephen launches himself up, tackling Bloom backwards.

      Just before they fall behind the safety of the flat, a red
      burst of blood flowers from Stephen's left lower back.

      Bloom sets him down gently, and hears heavy footsteps behind
      him.

      He turns, firing, but only sees a blur of dark coat go by,
      through the torn backdrop.

      Bloom runs out on stage, tearing the tarpaulin, and fires
      after the dark figure limping up the aisle and away into the
      lobby.

      Silence.

      Bloom walks back to Stephen, who lies behind the flat,
      breathing heavy. Blood soaking through his shirt.

                           BLOOM
                 Please tell me this is all gonna be
                 ok. Tell me that's a squib, and
                 that's makeup, and that you just
                 gave me what I always wanted and
                 pulled off the perfect con.

      A long, long moment.

      Stephen coughs, spits.     Then a wry grin spreads across his
      face.

                           STEPHEN
                 You said it, not me.

      He stands, the shakiness gone.

                           STEPHEN (cont'd)
                 Can I get a `wow' for this one?

                           BLOOM
                 You son of a bitch.




                                                               122

      Bloom looks like he might hit him, but his face breaks and he
      embraces him, crying. The Brothers Bloom stay like that for
      a long while, holding each other in the spotlight's glow.

      Finally Stephen pulls away, tears in his eyes.   He wipes
      them, wipes blood from his lip.

                          STEPHEN
                Tastes like tin foil. Alright
                here's what I want you to do. The
                Chink split?

                           BLOOM
                Yeah.   Clean exit.

                            STEPHEN
                How?

                            BLOOM
                Car bomb.

      A hint of relief in Stephen's face.

                          STEPHEN
                Good. Here's what. Take Penelope
                back to Helsinki, take that flight
                to Rio. Lay low like we said.
                Play out the on-the-run-from-
                vengeful-Russians thing, that'll be
                fun for her. Play it like I'm
                dead, actually - that'll add some
                gravity to everything, that'll be
                nice. And I'll see you when I see
                you.

                            BLOOM
                Soon?

                          STEPHEN
                I hope not. Last thing you need is
                me hanging around. Anyway, how
                could I top this?

      Bloom hugs him again.

                          BLOOM
                I love you. Bye.

      He turns to go.

                            STEPHEN
                Hey.    Think of any card.



                                                               123

      Stephen pulls out a pack of cards.

                              BLOOM
                 Alright.

      Stephen cuts, to the Queen of hearts.

                           BLOOM (cont'd)
                 Stephen. That's it.
                     (grins)
                 That's the best card trick I've
                 ever seen. I just wish you had a
                 bigger audience.

                           STEPHEN
                 You're the only audience I've ever
                 needed.

      Wink.   Bloom leaves.

      Stephen watches him go.


221   EXT. RUSSIA HIGHWAY - LATE AFTERNOON                      221

      Rumbling towards Finland.

      In the Bug, Bloom sleeps in Penelope's arm while she drives.

      She looks at his hand on hers, his shirt cuff bright red with
      Stephen's "blood." She strokes his shoulder sadly.

      Off Bloom's sleeping face...


222   INT. THEATER STAGE                                        222

      Stephen pulls a chair out onto the stage, sets it right in
      the spotlight's glare.

      Trembling as if it takes all his last strength in the world.

      Sits.   Looks at the Queen of Hearts, moves his fingers over
      it.

      Then slides is up his sleeve.

      Blood trickles down his hand.

                                                                  124
     




223   INT. BUG - SUNSET                                            223

      Bloom wakes with a start.

                            PENELOPE
                  Hey. Hey, it's ok. The bridge is
                  coming up, we're almost at the
                  border. Were you dreaming about
                  Stephen?

      She strokes his hair back from his face.

      He nods, and looks down at his sleeve.

      Stephen's "blood" on his white cuff.

      Now a dark shade of brown.

      Bloom looks at this shirt.      All the blood, it's all brown.

      He looks up at the road, nearly panicked.

      Maybe a quarter mile ahead is the bridge.

                               BLOOM
                  Pull over.     Pull over!!

      She does.

      He bursts out of the car, and run/tumbles down the grassy
      hillside till he finds the car tracks.

      He follows them to the charred remains of the Peugeot.

      Penelope stumbles down after him.

                            PENELOPE
                  What is it? You're scaring me-

                            BLOOM
                  What did you ask the Russian kid,
                  in the Dog's apartment? He said
                  the Dog isn't here, then what did
                  you ask?

      Bloom kicks open the trunk.      Pries open the blistered attache
      case.


 

                                                                125

      Sifts through the charred pile of cinders that was the money
      from the "Russians" till he finds what he was looking for and
      brings it out into the dying light.

                             PENELOPE
                   How long had he been alone.

                             BLOOM
                   And what did he say?

      A scrap of unburned money.    A fragment of Ben Franklin's
      face.

                             PENELOPE
                   Since yesterday morning.

      A single eye gazing up at him, the green grass behind it.

      The eye is perfect.    No cross hatching.

      Bloom sinks to his knees.

                             BLOOM
                   This is real. They hassled you.

                             PENELOPE
                   Bloom-

                             BLOOM
                   The Dog was gone before we got
                   there. They hadn't cleared out of
                   their apartment, they had been
                   cleared out.


225   INT. DIAMOND DOG'S APARTMENT - DAY FLASHBACK                 225

      RUSSIANS in black overcoats burst in, shooting the Dog's men
      with silenced pistols.

      The BOY shuts himself in the closet, terrified.


226   EXT. ROADSIDE - SUNSET                                       226

                   Real Russians. Took his store.
                   They didn't know about his deal
                   with us, but you haggled with them.
                   You really sold the book to real
                   Russians. The Diamond Dog was
                   gone.

      in the attache case.

                          STEPHEN
                Let's get the hell out of Russia.

      Bloom tosses the gold lighter, it splashes into the lake.    We
      follow it, plunging beneath the surface.

      Deep deep down, among weak tendrils of light, the Diamond Dog
      sinks into watery blackness, a long blade in his neck.


228   EXT. ROADSIDE - SUNSET                                      228

                And they came after us.   And
                Stephen...

      Penelope holds him tight.

                             PENELOPE
                I know.

                          BLOOM
                Stephen saved my life.

                             PENELOPE
                I know.

                             BLOOM
                He's gone.

      Bloom folds into Penelope's arms, but she doesn't let him.
      She holds his crying face up.

                          PENELOPE
                And he did it so you could live.
                Your brother loved you. He loved
                you so much. Look at me. Stephen
                said something once, I got the
                feeling he'd rather be telling it
                to you. He said there's no such
                thing as an unwritten life. Just
                badly written ones. I love you.

                   like we're telling the best fucking
                   story in the world. Are you ready?

      She holds his face close to hers for a long beat. Then
      smiles and pushes away, launching up the grassy hill.

      Bloom watches her.

      Time slows as she turns back towards him, still running, and
      holds out her hand for him to follow.

                             BLOOM (V.O.)
                   I was thinking of something Stephen
                   said too. "The perfect con is one
                   where everyone involved gets just
                   the thing they wanted." Well.

      He takes the girl's hand, and runs with her towards the point
      of light breaking over the hill.

          He angles our camera view, reveals a PORTHOLE through which
          we can see flames rising in the distance.

           This is bigger than anything we've
           ever seen. And no one even knows it
           exists. Finn, I need backup. But
           don't call the cavalry - it could
           blow the operation. And be careful.
           It's not safe out here!

          EXT. SOMEWHERE IN THE NORTH PACIFIC - NIGHT
                         
          A TINY CRAB BOAT (CRABBY) crests over massive swells.
                         
                          CRABBY
           Alright buddy, we're here. Right
           where you paid me to bring you.
           Question is, why?
                         
          A metallic blue sports car, circa the `60s, emerges from the
           2.
                         
                         
          shadows. Cagey, smooth, he'd turn heads driving through any

                          FINN
           I'm looking for a car.
                         
                          CRABBY
           A car? Hey pal, you can't get any
           further away from land than out
           here.
                         
                          FINN
           Exactly where I want to be.
                         
                          CRABBY
           Well I got news for you, buddy.
           There's nobody out here but us.
                         
          Suddenly, a HORN -- a COMBAT SHIP, the size of most cruise
          ships. FINN quickly backs into the shadows, out of sight.
                         
                          COMBAT SHIP
           What are you doing out here?
                         
                          CRABBY
           What does it look like, genius? I'm
           crabbing!
                         
                          COMBAT SHIP
           Well turn around and go back where
           you came from.
                         
                          CRABBY
           Yeah? And who's gonna make me?
                         
          A laser sight hits Crabby between the eyes.
                         
                          CRABBY
           Alright, alright! Don't get your
           prop in a twist.
           (as he turns to leave)
           What a jerk. Sorry, buddy. Looks
           like it's the end of the line.
           Buddy?
                         
          ON CRABBY'S DECK: Finn is gone.
                          CUT TO:
                         
          FINN - He HANGS off the side of COMBAT SHIP, clandestine.
                         
          We're with Finn as the ship continues on, cuts through the
          darkness with purpose. Suddenly small flames appear, perhaps
          a knot or so away. Then WHOOSH!!! A flame rises above Finn,
          the ship. It illuminates an OIL DERRICK.
           3.
                         
                         
          THWAP! Finn fires a GRAPPLING HOOK to the derrick and SWINGS
          toward it. He's going to SLAM into the side with brute force
                         WHEN ---
                         
          --- HIS TIRES sprout a magnetic exoskeleton. He STICKS to the
          derrick and now DRIVES VERTICALLY UP UP UP...
                         
          From this vantage point, hundreds of derricks appear.
                         
          EXT. PLATFORM - OIL DERRICK - MOMENTS LATER
                         
          Finn approaches a loading bay from above, hides. He watches
          as GREMLINS, PACERS and assorted other cars scurry about.
                         
           FINN (INTO RADIO)
           Leland Turbo, this is Finn
           McMissile. I'm at the rally point.
           Over.

           Leland, it's Finn. Please respond.
           Over.
                         
          AN ACCESS DOOR OPENS LOUDLY below. A boxy, monacle-wearing
          German car enters. This is PROFESSOR OTTO ZUNDAPP.
                         
                          PROFESSOR ZUNDAPP
           (in German and English)
           Too many cars here. Out of my way!
                         
                          FINN
           Professor Zundapp?
                         
           PACER (O.S.)
           Here it is, Professor.
                         
          Zundapp approaches a NOSY PACER who idles next to a CRATE.
                         
                          NOSY PACER
           You wanted to see this before we
           load it?
                         
                          PROFESSOR ZUNDAPP
           Ah, yes. Very carefully...
                         
          A forklift opens the crate -- inside is a TV CAMERA, packed
          carefully in foam. Finn SNAPS PHOTOS FURIOUSLY.
                         
                          NOSY PACER
           Oh. A TV camera. What does it
           actually do?
           4.
                         
                         
                          PROFESSOR ZUNDAPP
           This camera is extremely dangerous.
                         
                          FINN
                          (TO HIMSELF)
           What are you up to now, Professor?
                         
          Finn, angling for a better view, FIRES SUSPENSION WIRES ---
                         
          --- which sail clear to the other side of the derrick ---
                         
          --- THOK! They hook tightly onto a steel girder.
                         
          Finn slides out ONTO THE WIRE like an acrobat, then expels
          another cross-wire for support.
                         
                          PROFESSOR ZUNDAPP
           This is valuable equipment. Make
           sure it is properly secured for the
           voyage.
                         
                          NOSY PACER
           You got it.
                         
          Finn LOWERS HIMSELF. He snaps more pictures.
                         
           GREM (O.S.)
           Hey, Professor Z!
                         
          Zundapp turns as a CRANE LOWERS A CAR-SIZED CRATE. GREM and
          ACER, an orange Gremlin and a green Pacer, flank it.
                         
                          GREM
           This is one of those British spies
           we told you about.
                         
                          ACER
           Yeah. This one we caught sticking
           his bumper where it didn't belong.
                         
          Finn PRODUCES SEMI-AUTOMATIC GUNS from his side, readies
          himself for a tag-team spy fight with his buddy Leland.
                         
                          PROFESSOR ZUNDAPP
           Agent Leland Turbo.
                         
          The crate is lifted, revealing a CRUSHED, CUBED Leland Turbo.
                         
          Finn's eyes go wide. Suddenly --- WHOOOSHHH! Another derrick
          flame rises behind him, casts a Finn-shaped SHADOW over the
          Professor. He looks up.
           5.
                         
                         
                          PROFESSOR ZUNDAPP
           It's Finn McMissile! He's seen the
           camera! Kill him!!
                         
          Finn UNLOADS with bullets as he starts to retreat --- He
                         STOPS:
                         
          BAD GUY CARS are waiting for him on the catwalk where he just
          came from - BLOWTORCHES ready.
                         
          Finn, stuck in midair, notices an angry CRANE. Finn GRINS,
          having just found his escape.
                         
          THWAPTHWAPTHWAP!!! Finn releases three of his four cables,
          swinging, Indiana Jones-style on the last one TOWARD THE
                         CRANE ---
                         
          --- where he lands on its BOOM, drives UP and LAUNCHES OFF IT
          where he LANDS - MOVING - onto another deck!
                         
          Finn now DRIVES, spraying oil and screeching around corners.
          A GREMLIN in pursuit hits the oil patch, loses control ---
                         
          --- and PLUMMETS OFF the side of the rig!
                         
          The Gremlin FALLS... it's like an eternity...
                         
          He smashes into the water and breaks into a million pieces.
                         
          ON FINN - Now set upon by 20 or 30 MORE pursuing cars. He has
          nowhere to go but UP UP UP a ramp toward the helipad. He
          spies some GASOLINE BARRELS, fires a SINGLE BULLET which cuts
          through its leather straps, sending barrels DOWN the ramp,
          PAST FINN ---
                         
          --- PAST the pursuing CARS ---
                         
          --- to the bottom where they EXPLODE in a CHAIN REACTION back
          UP THE RAMP, taking out at least 15 CARS!
                         
          ON THE HELIPAD - Finn blasts into view, pulls to a stop. No
          more road. Nowhere else to go.
                         
          The 20 BAD GUY CARS that are still in pursuit surround him,
          fire up their blowtorches. About to pounce.
                         
          Finn GRINS. The second time we've seen this grin. It means
          he's got something cooking.
                         
          Finn's REVERSE LIGHTS appear. He DRIVES BACKWARD off the edge
          of the helipad to the SHOCK of the other cars.
                         
          Finn falls. He turns himself so he's grill first, cleanly
          cutting into the water.
           6.
                         
                         
          He EMERGES, now sprouting HYDROFOIL and speeds away.
                         
                          GREM
                          (NONPLUSSED)
           Get to the boats.
                         
          THE BOATS - an army of combat ships quickly DROP into the sea
          and CHURN WATER with unprecedented fury as they quickly make
          up the distance between them and Finn, FIRING BULLETS as they
          do so.
                         
                          ACER
           He's getting away!
                         
                          COMBAT SHIP
           Not for long.
                         
          The LEAD COMBAT SHIP quietly drops a TORPEDO into the water.
          It skips along, connecting with Finn in his rear and
          EXPLODING with such force that water skyrockets into the
          night clouds.
                         
          UNDERWATER - McMissile SINKS. Then, he blinks. He GRINS.
          We're starting to like this grin and what follows it. He now
          CONVERTS into a submarine. From his trunk he releases four
          DECOY tires which float to the surface like body parts.
                         
          ON THE DERRICK - Professor Zundapp watches it all from far
          away.
                         
           GREM (OVER RADIO)
           He's dead, Professor.
                         
                          PROFESSOR ZUNDAPP
           Wunderbar. With Finn McMissile
           gone, who can stop us now?

           your tenth tow this month, so that
           means it's on the house.
                         
                          OTIS
           You're the only one that's nice to
           lemons like me, Mater.
                         
                          MATER
           Don't sweat it. These things happen
           to everybody, Otis.
                         
                          OTIS
           But you never leak oil.
                         
                          MATER
           Yeah, but I ain't perfect. Don't
           tell nobody, but I think my rust is
           starting to show through.
                         
          Mater and Otis drive past THE RADIATOR SPRINGS WELCOME SIGN.
          It has been amended to say: "Home of Lightning McQueen."
                         
                          OTIS
           Hey, is Lightning McQueen back yet?
                         
                          MATER
           Not yet.
                         
                          OTIS
           He must be crazy-excited about
           winning his fourth Piston Cup.
           Four! Wow!
           8.
                         
                         
                          MATER
           Yeah, we're so dadgum proud of him.
           But I sure wish he'd hurry up and
           get back `cause we got a whole
           summer's worth of best friend fun
           to make up for. Just me and --
                         
          Ahead of them, a half-mile off, a RED RACE CAR is visible.
                         
                          MATER
           --- McQueen!
                         
          Mater FLOORS IT, dragging poor Otis behind him.
                         
                          OTIS
           Uh, Mater? I'm in no hurry. You
           don't need to go so fast!
                         
          Boom! They hit a bump. Otis catches air.
                         
          EXT. RADIATOR SPRINGS - DAY
                         
          Lightning McQueen is surrounded by his hometown friends.
                         
                          LUIGI
           Oh, Lightning. Welcome home.
                         
                          FLO
           Good to have you back, honey.
                         
                          FILLMORE
           Congratulations, man.
                         
                          SARGE
           Welcome home, soldier.
                         
                          SHERIFF
           The place wasn't the same without
           you, son.
                         
                          LIZZIE
           What? Did he go somewhere?
                         
                          MCQUEEN
           It's good to be home, everybody.
                         
           MATER (O.S.)
           McQueen!
                         
          They all turn around, see Mater speeding into town, with Otis
          swerving behind him.
                         
                          MCQUEEN
           Mater!
           9.
                         
                         
                          MATER
           McQueen!
                         
          Mater skids into main street and in one swift motion,
          slingshots Otis forward ---
                         
                          OTIS
           Woaahhhhh!
                         
          --- right through Ramone's front door ---
                         
          INT. RAMONE'S - CONTINUOUS
                         
          --- where he lands perfectly on the hydraulic lift. Ramone
          lifts him up, routine.
                         
                          RAMONE
           Hey. How far'd you make it this
           time, Otis?
                         
                          OTIS
           Halfway to the county line.
                         
                          RAMONE
           Not bad, man.
                         
                          OTIS
           I know, I can't believe it either!
                         
          EXT. RADIATOR SPRINGS - CONTINUOUS
                         
                          MATER
           McQueen, welcome back!
                         
                          MCQUEEN
           Mater, it's so good to see you.
                         
                          MATER
           You too, buddy.
                         
          Mater and McQueen do an ELABORATE TIRE BUMP (fist bump
          style).
                         
                          MATER
           Oh, man. You ain't gonna believe
           the things I got planned for us.
                         
          Everyone watches as the tire bump continues.
                         
                          MACK
           (to Lizzie, an aside)
           These best friend greetings get
           longer every year.
           10.
                         
                         
                          MATER
                          (TO MCQUEEN)
           You ready to have some serious fun?
                         
                          MCQUEEN
           Well, actually I've got something
           to show you first.
                         
          INT. RADIATOR SPRINGS MUSEUM - DAY
                         
          CLOSE ON THE PISTON CUP. It has now changed, been adorned
          with a small likeness of Doc. It says "Hudson Hornet Piston
          Cup."
                         
                          MATER
           Wow. I can't believe they renamed
           the Piston Cup after our very own
           Doc Hudson.
                         
          McQueen and Mater are alone, the museum closed to the public.
          McQueen approaches a "Hudson Hornet" wall with Doc's three
          Piston cups, framed articles, other racing ephemera.
                         
                          MCQUEEN
           I know Doc said these things were
           just old cups, but to have someone
           else win it just didn't feel right,
           you know?
                         
                          MATER
           Well, Doc would've been real proud
           of you. That's for sure.
                         
          McQueen takes this in.
                         
          EXT. RADIATOR SPRINGS - LATER
                         
          McQueen and Mater exit the Doc Hudson Museum.
                         
                          MCQUEEN
           Alright, pal. I've been waiting all
           summer for this. What've you got
           planned?
                         
                          MATER
           You sure you can handle it?
                         
                          MCQUEEN
           Come on, you know who you're
           talking to? This is Lightning
           McQueen. I can handle anything.
           11.
                         
                         
          EXT. RADIATOR SPRINGS - DAY
                         
          Mater and McQueen roll on an old train track, their tires
          off. They're on their rims.
                         
                          MCQUEEN
           Uh.... Mater?!
                         
                          MATER
           Just remember, your brakes ain't
           gonna work on these!
                         
          As they head INTO A DARK TUNNEL ---
                         
           MCQUEEN (O.S.)
           Mater!
                         
           MATER (O.S.)
           Relax, these train tracks ain't
           been used in years!
                         
          From inside the tunnel a loud TRAIN HORN. The two friends
          emerge, going as fast as they can on train tracks, uphill,
          with no tires.
                         
                          MCQUEEN
           Come on, come on! Faster, faster!
                         
          Moments later a harmless GALLOPING GOOSE appears, oversized
          horn visible, cackling and laughing at his prank.
                         
          EXT. FIELD - OUTSIDE RADIATOR SPRINGS - LATER
                         
          An ENORMOUS EARTH MOVER sleeps. McQueen and Mater sneak up.
                         
                          MATER
           This is gonna be good!
                         
          They blow their horns and he TIPS OVER, tractor-tipping
          style. They LAUGH at the gag, but soon realize the earth
          mover's GIANT EXHAUST PIPE is directly above them.
                         
                          MATER
           Uh-oh. This ain't gonna be good.
                         
          The exhaust pipe BELCHES. McQueen and Mater are BLASTED out
          of view.
                         
          INT. RADIATOR SPRINGS - DUSK
                         
          The sun sets. McQueen and Mater roll into town. McQueen looks
          exhausted. Mater is still full of energy.
           12.
                         
                         
                          MATER
           Boy, this was the best day ever!
           And my favorite souvenir?
                         
          Mater proudly shows off a dent.
                         
                          MATER
           This new dent!
                         
                          MCQUEEN
           Boy, Mater. Today was, uh...
                         
                          MATER
           Shoot, that was nothing. Wait til
           you see what I got planned for
           tonight.
                         
                          MCQUEEN
           Mater, Mater. Whoa. I was kind of
           thinking of just a quiet dinner.
                         
                          MATER
           That's exactly what I was thinking.
                         
                          MCQUEEN
           No, I... I meant with Sally, Mater.
                         
                          MATER
           Even better! You, me and Miss Sally
           going out for supper.
                         
          McQueen pulls around in front of Mater, stops.
                         
                          MCQUEEN
           Mater, I meant it would be just me
           and Sally.
                         
                          MATER
           Oh.
                         
                          MCQUEEN
           It's just for tonight. We'll do
           whatever you want tomorrow.
                         
                          MATER
                          (DISAPPOINTED)
           Okay.
                         
                          MCQUEEN
           Thanks for understanding.
                         
                          MATER
           Yeah, sure. Y'all go on and have
           fun now.
           13.
                         
                         
                          MCQUEEN
           Alright, then. See ya soon, amigo!
                         
          McQueen drives off. Mater watches him go.
                         
          EXT. THE WHEEL WELL - NIGHT
                         
          It's been converted into a white-tablecloth restaurant, with
          cars dining al fresco and a hopping gastropub inside.
                         
          MCQUEEN AND SALLY have a prime table with a view of Radiator
          Springs and the starry night sky.
                         
                          SALLY
           This is so nice.
                         
                          MCQUEEN
           I can't tell you how good it is to
           be here alone. Just the two of us.
           Finally, you and me ---
                         
           MATER (O.S.)
           Good evening.
                         
          Mater is at their table, dressed as a waiter.
                         
                          MATER
           My name is Mater and I'll be your
           waiter.
                          (TO HIMSELF)
           Mater the waiter. That's funny
           right there.
                         
                          MCQUEEN
           Mater, you work here?
                         
                          MATER
           Well yeah I work here. What'd you
           think, I just snuck in here when
           nobody was looking and pretended to
           be your waiter, just so I could
           hang out with you?
                         
          McQueen and Sally exchange a look.
                         
                          MCQUEEN
           Oh, yeah. How ridiculous would that
           be?
                         
                          MATER
           Now, can I start you two lovebirds
           off with a couple drinks?
           14.
                         
                         
                          MCQUEEN
           Yes. I'll have my usual.
                         
                          SALLY
           You know what? I'm going to have
           that too.
                         
          Mater blinks.
                         
                          MATER
           Uh, right. Your usual.
                          CUT TO:
                         
          INSIDE AT THE BAR - Fillmore and Sarge watch as Guido mixes
          drinks, ala "Cocktail." Mater arrives.
                         
                          MATER
           Guido! What's McQueen's usual?
                         
                          GUIDO
           (in Italian, subtitled)
           How should I know?
                         
                          MATER
           Perfect! Give me two of `em.
                         
                          SARGE
           Quiet! My program's on.
                         
           MEL DORADO (O.S.)
           Tonight on "The Mel Dorado Show"!
                         
          ON THE BAR TV - "THE MEL DORADO SHOW," a cable talk show,
          begins with file footage of MILES AXLEROD, a sleek SUV.
                         
           MEL DORADO (ON TV)
           His story gripped the world! Oil
           billionaire Miles Axlerod, in an
           attempt to become the first car to
           circumnavigate the globe without
           GPS, ironically ran out of gas and
           found himself trapped in the wild!
                         
          We see images of newspaper headlines, search crews.
                         
           MEL DORADO (ON TV)
           Feared dead, he emerged 36 days
           later, running on a fuel he'd
           distilled himself from the natural
           elements! Since then he's sold his
           oil fortune, converted himself from
           a gas-guzzler into an electric car,
           and has devoted his life to finding
           a renewable, clean-burning fuel!
           15.
                         
                         
          Images of oil derricks torn down; Miles Axlerod getting
          converted to electric; lab scientists testing chemicals.
                         
           MEL DORADO (ON TV)
           Now he claims to have done it with
           his Allinol.
                         
          Images of fields, rivers, vegetables, and mountains all
          combining to form the Allinol logo.
                         
           MEL DORADO (ON TV)
           And to show the world what his new
           superfuel can do, he's created a
           racing competition like no other,
           inviting the greatest champions
           from around the globe to battle in
           the first ever World Grand Prix.
           Welcome Sir Miles Axlerod.
                         
          SIR MILES AXLEROD arrives, parks across from Mel's desk.
                         
           MILES AXLEROD (ON TV)
           Thank you, Mel. It is very good to
           be here. Now listen to me: Big Oil.
           It costs a fortune. Pollution is
           getting worse. I mean, come on.
           It's a fossil fuel. Fossil. As in
           dead dinosaurs. And we all know
           what happened to them. Alternative
           energy is the future. Trust me,
           Mel, after seeing Allinol in action
           at the World Grand Prix, nobody
           will ever go back to gasoline
           again.
                         
                          MATER
                          (TO FILLMORE)
           What happened to the dinosaurs,
           now?
                         
           MEL DORADO (ON TV)
           And on satellite, a World Grand
           Prix competitor and one of the
           fastest cars in the world,
           Francesco Bernoulli.
                         
          Across the screen: LIVE FROM ROME, ITALY. We meet Formula
          race car FRANCESCO BERNOULLI.
                         
           FRANCESCO (ON TV)
           It is an honor, Signore Dorado. For
           you.
           16.
                         
                         
           MEL DORADO (ON TV)
           Miles, why not invite Lightning
           McQueen?
                         
          Mater, collecting his drinks, looks up, half-intrigued.
                         
           MILES AXLEROD (ON TV)
           Of course we invited him. But
           apparently after a very long racing
           season he is taking some time off
           to rest.
                         
           FRANCESCO (ON TV)
           Lightning McQueen would not have a
           chance against Francesco!
                         
          Mater doesn't like this.
                         
           FRANCESCO (ON TV)
           I can go over 300 kilometers an
           hour! In miles that is like, uh...
           way faster than McQueen.
                         
           MEL DORADO (ON TV)
           Let's go to the phones. Baltimore,
           Maryland, you're on the air.
                         
           CALLER (ON TV)
           Am I on? Hello?
                         
           MEL DORADO (ON TV)
           You're on. Go ahead.
                         
           CALLER (ON TV)
           Hello?
                         
           MEL DORADO (ON TV)
           Go ahead, caller.
                         
          Dial tone.
                         
           MEL DORADO (ON TV)
           Let's go to Radiator Springs.
           You're on, caller.
                         
           MATER'S VOICE (ON TV)
           Yeah, that Italian feller you got
           on there can't talk that way about
           Lightning McQueen. He's the bestest
           race car in the whole wide world.
                         
          Fillmore and Sarge look around. Mater is visible in the back
          of the bar on an office phone.
           17.
                         
                         
                          SARGE
           Uh-oh...
                         
           FRANCESCO (ON TV)
           If he is, how you say "the bestest
           race car," then why must he rest,
           eh?
                         
           MATER'S VOICE (ON TV)
           Cause he knows what's important.
           Every now and then he prefers just
           to slow down, enjoy life.
                         
           FRANCESCO (ON TV)
           Ah, you heard it! Lightning McQueen
           prefers to be slow! Of course, this
           is not news to Francesco. When I
           want to go to sleep I watch one of
           his races. After two laps I am out
           cold.
                         
          Audible RXNS from the bar. A crowd has been forming ever
          since Mater started talking.
                         
           MATER'S VOICE (ON TV)
           That ain't what I meant.
                          CUT TO:
                         
          MCQUEEN AND SALLY - They hear the commotion inside.
                         
                          MCQUEEN
           Hey, what's going on over there?
           CUT BACK TO:
                         
          THE BAR - Sally and McQueen push through the crowd, see that
          they're watching Francesco on the television.
                         
                          MCQUEEN
                          (TO SALLY)
           Oh, it's that Italian Formula car.
           His name is ---
                         
                          SALLY
           Francesco Bernoulli. No wonder
           there's a crowd.
                         
          When Sally says his name, she enunciates each part, as if
          Italian were her mother's tongue.
                         
                          MCQUEEN
           Wait, why do you know his name? And
           don't say it like that. It's three
           syllables, not ten.
           18.
                         
                         
                          SALLY
           What? He's nice to look at. You
           know, open-wheeled and all.
                         
                          MCQUEEN
           What's wrong with fenders? I
           thought you like my fenders.
                         
           MATER'S VOICE (ON TV)
           Well let me tell you something else
           there, Mr. San Francisco ---
                         
                          MCQUEEN
           Mater?
                         
           MATER'S VOICE (ON TV)
           McQueen could drive circles around
           you.
                         
           FRANCESCO (ON TV)
           Driving in circles is all he can
           do, no?
                         
           MATER'S VOICE (ON TV)
           No! I mean yes. I mean he could
           beat you anywhere, anytime, any
           track.
                         
          On McQueen - he looks at Guido who gives a nod over to ---
                         
          --- Mater, turned away from the crowd, still on the phone.
                         
           FRANCESCO (ON TV)
           Mel, can we move on? Francesco
           needs a caller who can provide a
           little more intellectual
           stimulation. Like a dump truck.
                         
          ON MCQUEEN. He doesn't like this at all.
                         
                          MATER
           Ha ha! That shows what you know.
           Dump trucks is dumb.
                         
          Suddenly, Mater is YANKED from the booth and replaced by
          McQueen.
                         
           MCQUEEN (INTO PHONE)
           Yeah, hi, this is Lightning
           McQueen. Look, I don't appreciate
           my best friend being insulted like
           that.
           19.
                         
                         
           FRANCESCO (ON TV)
           McQueen! That was your best friend?
           This is the difference between you
           and Francesco. Francesco knows how
           good he is. He does not need to
           surround himself with tow trucks to
           prove it.
                         
                          MCQUEEN
           Those are strong words from a car
           that is so fragile.
                         
           FRANCESCO (ON TV)
           Fragilé!? He calls Francesco
           fragilé? Not so fast, McQueen!
                         
                          MCQUEEN
           "Not so fast." What is that, your
           new motto?
                         
          Francesco goes ballistic in Italian. They cut his mic.
                         
           MILES AXLEROD (ON TV)
           Well, this sounds like something
           that needs to be settled on the
           race course. What do you say,
           Lightning McQueen? We've still got
           room for one more racer.
                         
                          MCQUEEN
           Well, I would love to. The only
           thing is my crew's off for the
           season so ---
                         
          A sound O.S. McQueen turns to see Fillmore, Sarge and Luigi
          flank a tablecloth which is hanging off the bar. Ramone backs
          away, having spray painted "TEAM LIGHTNING MCQUEEN" on it.
          Guido quickly uncorks three wine bottles.
                         
                          GUIDO
           Pit stop.
                         
          McQueen turns back to the phone.
                         
                          MCQUEEN
           You know what? They just got back.
           Deal me in, baby. Ka-chow!
                         
          The place ERUPTS IN CHEERS.
                         
          MOMENTS LATER - General excitement as McQueen exits the phone
          booth where Sally waits. Off her look:
           20.
                         
                         
                          MCQUEEN
           I know, I know. I just got back.
           But we won't be long and ---
                         
                          SALLY
           Oh, no, don't worry about me. I've
           got enough to do here. Mater's
           going to have a blast though.
           (off McQueen's silence)
           You're bringing Mater, right? You
           never bring him to any of your
           races.
                         
          McQueen turns to the bar where Mater privately tries their
          drinks, hates it, spits it back in the glass.

           Just let him sit in the pits, give
           him a headset. C'mon, it'll be a
           thrill of a lifetime for him.
                         
          Mater arrives.
                         
                          MATER
           Your drinks, sir.
                         
                          MCQUEEN
           Mater.
                         
                          MATER
           I didn't taste it!
                         
                          MCQUEEN
           How'd you like to come and see the
           world with me?
                         
                          MATER
           You mean it?
                         
                          MCQUEEN
           You got me into this thing. You're
           coming along.
                         
                         BEGIN MONTAGE:
                         
          - McQueen is given a new paint job and headlights by Ramone.
          Mater, now sporting a "Team McQueen" emblem, seems psyched as
          well.
                         
          - An airport DEPARTURES SIGN advertises the next flight:
          Tokyo, Japan.
                         
          - Mater waves goodbye with his hook alongside McQueen, Guido,
          Luigi, Fillmore and Sarge as ---
           21.
                         
                         
          --- the rest of Radiator Springs watches them board a plane.
          Red bawls.
                         
          - IN THE JET, LATER. McQueen and Mater are the only ones
          awake, watch an insane Japanese game show.
                         
          - JAPAN AT NIGHT. A stylish Tokyo cityscape of neon, glamour,
          scrolling billboards, vending machines and high-tech
          skyscrapers.
                         
          - INSIDE A SOUVENIR SHOP loaded with McQueen toys: Mater and
          McQueen enter. A tourist sees McQueen and faints.
                         
          - A KABUKI THEATER. Team McQueen watches a methodical dance.
          Mater, dressed in Kabuki makeup, arrives. He looks insane.
                         
          - A SUMO MATCH - Two SUZUKI SAMURAI CARS wrestle over a
          parking space. Mater, now in his element, cheers.
                         
          The MONTAGE ENDS on this high note as we CUT TO ---
                         
          EXT. MUSEUM - TOKYO - NIGHT
                         
          ---- TEAM MCQUEEN, as they roll up the red carpet. Press is
          held at bay behind ropes. WORLD GRAND PRIX and ALLINOL logos
          are strategically placed for maximum press exposure. RACERS
          are interviewed by press behind the red-carpet ropes.
                         
          INT. TOKYO MUSEUM - NIGHT
                         
          Team McQueen enters via a second floor landing which
          overlooks a massive indoor party in a converted museum. As
          they roll down a ramp to the party, they are awed.
                         
                          LUIGI
           Guido, look! Ferraris and tires!
           Let's go!
                         
                          MCQUEEN
                          (IMPRESSED)
           Hey, look at this. Okay now Mater,
           remember: best behavior.
                         
                          MATER
           You got it, buddy. Hey, what's
           that?
                         
          He sees something, peels away.
                         
                          MCQUEEN
           Mater!
                         
                          LEWIS HAMILTON
           Hey, McQueen, over here!
           22.
                         
                         
          It's fellow racers JEFF GORVETTE and LEWIS HAMILTON. McQueen
          now has no choice but to let Mater go.
                         
                          MCQUEEN
           Hey, Jeff. Lewis!
                          CUT TO:
                         
          MATER as he approaches a GLASS-ENCLOSED ROCK GARDEN where a
          pitty RAKES rocks with precision. He knocks on the glass with
          his hook.
                         
                          MATER
           Hey! You done good! You got all the
           leaves!
                         
          People turn at the noise he's making.
           CUT BACK TO:
                         
          MCQUEEN, JEFF and LEWIS.
                         
                          JEFF GORVETTE
           Check out that tow truck.
                         
                          LEWIS HAMILTON
           I wonder who that guy's with?
                         
                          MCQUEEN
           Will you guys excuse me just for
           one little second?
                         
          He zips over to Mater's side, quickly pulls him out of sight.
                         
                          MCQUEEN
           Mater, listen. This isn't Radiator
           Springs.
                         
                          MATER
           You're just realizing that? Boy,
           that jet-lag really done a number
           on you.
                         
                          MCQUEEN
           Mater, look -- things are different
           over here. Which means maybe you
           should, you know, act a little
           different too.
                         
                          MATER
           Different than what?
                         
                          MCQUEEN
           Well, just... help me out here,
           buddy. I ---
           23.
                         
                         
                          MATER
           You need help? Shoot, why didn't
           you just say so? That's what a tow
           truck does. Hey, looky there, it's
           Mr. San Francisco!
                         
          FRANCESCO is visible across the room, holding court.
                         
                          MATER
           I'll introduce you.
                         
                          MCQUEEN
           Mater, no.
                         
                          MATER
           (already on his way)
           Look at me -- I'm helping you
           already!
                         
          On FRANCESCO - MOMENTS LATER. Mater approaches, giddy.
                         
                          MATER
           Hey Mr. San Francisco, I'd like you
           to meet ---
                         
                          FRANCESCO
           Lightning McQueen! Buona sera.
                         
                          MCQUEEN
           Nice to meet you, Francesco.
                         
                          FRANCESCO
           Yeah, nice to meet you too. You are
           very good-looking. Not as good as I
           thought, but you're good.
                         
                          MATER
                          (TO FRANCESCO)
           Excuse me. Can I get a picture with
           you?
                         
                          FRANCESCO
           Anything for McQueen's friend.
                         
          As Mater poses for a photo with Francesco:
                         
                          MATER
           Miss Sally is gonna flip when she
           sees this. She's Lightning
           McQueen's girlfriend.
                         
                          FRANCESCO
           Oooh.
           24.
                         
                         
                          MATER
           She's a big fan of yours.
                         
                          FRANCESCO
           Hey, she has good taste.
                         
                          MCQUEEN
           Mater's prone to exaggeration. I
           wouldn't say she's a "big" fan.
                         
                          MATER
           You're right. She's a huge fan. She
           goes on and on about your open
           wheels here.
                         
                          MCQUEEN
           Mentioning it once doesn't qualify
           as going "on and on."
                         
                          FRANCESCO
           Francesco is familiar with this
           reaction to Francesco. Women
           respect a car that has nothing to
           hide.
                         
                          MCQUEEN
           Yeah, uh...
                         
                          FRANCESCO
           Let us have a toast.
                         
          McQueen doesn't like where this is going, covers.
                         
                          MCQUEEN
           Let's.
                         
                          FRANCESCO
           (raising a drink)
           I dedicate my win tomorrow... to
           Miss Sally.
                         
                          MCQUEEN
           Oh, sorry. I already dedicated MY
           win tomorrow to her. So if we both
           do it, it's really not so special.
           Besides, I don't have a drink.
                         
                          MATER
           I'll go get you one. You mind if I
           borrow a few bucks for one of them
           drinks?
           25.
                         
                         
                          MCQUEEN
           (could kill him)
           They're free, Mater.
                         
                          MATER
           Free? Well, shoot, what am I doing
           here?
                         
          Mater ZIPS OFF.
                         
                          MCQUEEN
           I should probably go keep an eye on
           him. See you at the race.
                         
          McQueen starts to leave.
                         
                          FRANCESCO
           Yes, you will see Francesco. But
           not like this.
                         
          Francesco does a 180, so his rear end now faces McQueen.
                         
                          FRANCESCO
           You will see him like this, as he
           drives away from you.
                         
          Francesco wears a bumper sticker that says "Ciao, McQueen!"
                         
                          MCQUEEN
           That's cute. So you had one of
           those made up for all the racers?
                         
                          FRANCESCO
           No.
                         
                          MCQUEEN
           Okay.
                         
          He rolls off.
                         
                          MCQUEEN
           He is so getting beat tomorrow.
                         
          INT. PARTY - MOMENTS LATER
                         
          Lights caress the main stage where a crowd has formed.

           Axlerod!
                         
          MILES AXLEROD drives through an infinity fountain, appears.
           26.
                         
                         
                          MILES AXLEROD
           It is my absolute honor to
           introduce to you the competitors in
           the first-ever World Grand Prix.
           From Brazil. Number eight...
                         
          ON FINN MCMISSILE. He appears from the shadows, keeps a
          careful distance from the stage. He ZEROES HIS GAZE ON ---
                         
          --- THE WORLD GRAND PRIX TV CAMERAS which roll, catching
          Miles Axlerod's speech for publicity and posterity.
                         
          Finn's ONBOARD COMPUTER ANALYZES each one, compares to the
          photos we saw him snap on the oil platform. Each one is "NOT
          A MATCH." His view is suddenly disrupted by A BEAUTIFUL
          SPORTS CAR. She approaches Finn. Meet HOLLEY SHIFTWELL.

           That's because it's air-cooled.

          Rod Redline is in bad shape. He backs away, betrays a look of
          concern. He's in trouble here.
                         
          ACER burns rubber, ready to finish him off. Just as he shifts

          This doesn't help him. They DROP HIM onto a TREADMILL, lock
          him down. A container is wheeled forward and Rod is plied
          with Allinol brand gasoline.

          Zundapp hits a button and the TREADMILL starts Rod's wheels
          spinning at a high rate of speed.

           Whatever you say, Professor.
                         
          Acer pushes a TV MONITOR toward Rod. On it, surveillance
          footage from the party. Clearly, they were watching and
          recording him there.

           The Allinol is now heating to a
           boil, dramatically expanding,
           causing the engine block to crack
           under the stress, forcing oil into
           the combustion chamber.
                         
          Rod Redline's engine starts to CRACK and BREAK.

                          ROD REDLINE
           (to Professor Zundapp)
           What do I care? I can replace an
           engine block.
                         
                          PROFESSOR ZUNDAPP
           You may be able to, but after full
           impact of the pulse, unfortunately,
           there will be nothing to replace.
                         
                          ACER
           How about him? Does he have it?
                         
          The monitor reveals MATER, rolling out of the bathroom and
          down the hall.
                         
          Rod Redline, seeing this, does the world's most subtle double
          take. We caught it, but there's no way anyone else in the
          room could have ---
                         
                          PROFESSOR ZUNDAPP
           That's him. He's the one.

           No!
                         
          As Grem turns up the machine even MORE, the Professor makes a
          call.
                         
           PROFESSOR ZUNDAPP (INTO PHONE)
           Yes sir. We believe the infiltrator
           has passed along sensitive
           information.
           (beat, listening)
           I will take care of it before any
           damage can be done.
                         
          The Professor hangs up, turns to the room.
                         
                          PROFESSOR ZUNDAPP
           The project is still on schedule.
           You will find this second agent ---
                         
          Zundapp kicks the camera's power into the RED.

           BRENT MUSTANGBURGER (V.O.)
           Japan. Land of the rising sun.
           Where ancient tradition meets
           modern technology. Welcome to the
           inaugural running of the World
           Grand Prix.
                         
          ON OUR ANNOUNCERS as they introduce themselves:
                         
                          BRENT MUSTANGBURGER
           I'm Brent Mustangburger, here with
           racing legends Darrell Cartrip and
           David Hobbscap. There's never been
           a competition like this before.

           BRENT MUSTANGBURGER (V.O.)
           First, Allinol, making its debut
           tonight as the required fuel for
           all these great champions.

           BRENT MUSTANGBURGER (V.O.) (CONT'D)
           Second, the course itself, and it's
           like nothing we've ever seen.
           David, how exactly does this
           competition work?
                         
           DAVID HOBBSCAP (V.O.)
           Well, Brent, all three of these
           street courses are classic round-
           the-house racetracks.
                         
          OUTLINES OF THREE RACE COURSES are shown. They're labeled
          Japan, Italy and England, and are different in shape and
          size.
                         
           DAVID HOBBSCAP (V.O.)
           This means that the LMP and Formula
           cars should break out of the gate
           in spectacular fashion.

           DAVID HOBBSCAP (V.O.)
           Look for Francesco Bernoulli in
           particular to lead early.
                         
          SHOTS OF Francesco, featured in an inset.

           DAVID HOBBSCAP (V.O.)
           GT and Touring cars like Spain's
           Miguel Camino should make up some
           ground but I doubt it'll be enough
           to stop Francesco from absolutely
           running away with it.
                         
           DARRELL CARTRIP (V.O.)
           Woah, now just hold your
           horsepower. You're forgetting the
           most important factor here. That
           early dirt track section of the
           course! The dirt is supposed to be
           the great equalizer in this race.
                         
          GRAPHICS OF THE COURSES now isolate a stretch after the first
          couple turns, label it "DIRT SECTIONS."

           BRENT MUSTANGBURGER (V.O.)
           French Rally car Raoul ÇaRoule is
           counting on a big boost headed
           through there.
                         
           DARRELL CARTRIP (V.O.)
           And don't forget Lightning McQueen!
           His mentor, the Hudson Hornet, was
           one of the greatest dirt track
           racers of all time. In my opinion,
           McQueen is the best all-around
           racer in this competition.
                         
          BACK IN THE STUDIO
                         
                          DAVID HOBBSCAP
           Really, Darrell, I think you need
           to clean your windshield. You're
           clearly not seeing this for what it
           is: Francesco's race to lose.
                         
          EXT. STARTING LINE - DAY
                         
           BRENT MUSTANGBURGER (V.O.)
           It's time to find out. The racers
           are locking into the grid ---
                         
          Engines rev as everyone gets ready to go. Everyone's bright
          eyed and alert except for McQueen who we find in the back of
          the grid. He CLOSES his eyes.
                         
                          MCQUEEN
                          (TO HIMSELF)
           Speed. I am speed.
                         
          A LAUGH O.S. McQueen opens his eyes. Francesco is next to him
          on the grid.
                         
                          FRANCESCO
           Really? You are "speed"? Then
           Francesco is triple speed.
           (closes his eyes)
           Francesco. Is. Triple speed.
           Francesco likes this, McQueen. It's
           really getting him into the zone!
                         
                          MCQUEEN
           He is so getting beat today.
                         
          The starting lights click down from RED to YELLOW to GREEN.
          The race begins. Francesco quickly grabs the lead. He's
          pulling away within seconds.
           43.
                         
                         
          ON PIT ROW - We TRACK PAST as the various Crew Chiefs on
          their crash carts bark orders to their racers. We end on Team
          McQueen. No Crew Chief, just a solid looking team.
                         
                          SARGE
           His suspension stats look good.
                         
                          LUIGI
           Tire pressure is excellent.
                         
                          FILLMORE
           He's got plenty of fuel.
                         
                          MATER
           And he's awesome!
                          CUT TO:
                         
          The same view of Mater but now THROUGH A TELESCOPIC DISPLAY.

                          HOLLEY
           Why is he in the pits? He's so
           exposed.
                         
                          FINN
           It's his cover. One of the best
           I've seen, too. Look at the detail
           on that rust. It must have cost him
           a fortune.
                         
                          HOLLEY
           But why hasn't he contacted us yet?
                         
                          FINN
           There's probably heat on him. Be
           patient.
                         
                          HOLLEY
           Right, of course. He'll signal us
           when he can.
                         
                          FINN
           And then we find out who's behind
           all this.
                         
          ON THE TRACK - VARIOUS SHOTS OF THE RACE through Tokyo as

          IN MCQUEEN'S PIT - Mater watches the monitors, sees them
          approaching the dirt section.
                         
                          MATER
           McQueen! It's time to make your
           move. Get on the outside and show
           'em what Doc done taught you.
                         
           MCQUEEN (OVER RADIO)
           Ten four, Mater.
                         
          ON THE TRACK - Francesco hits the dirt section and loses all
          control. He SLAMS to a halt, his tires getting no traction.
                         
           DAVID HOBBSCAP (V.O.)
           Francesco is brought to a
           screeching halt!
                         
          MCQUEEN skids into view, turning right to go left, passing
          Francesco, followed by other cars ---
                         
           BRENT MUSTANGBURGER (V.O.)
           Lightning McQueen is the first to
           take advantage. And just like that,
           folks, Francesco's lead is left in
           the dust.
                         
                          MCQUEEN
           Nice call, Mater. Keep it up!
                         
          McQueen now leads the pack, zooming out of the dirt now
          starting to relax.
                         
           DARRELL CARTRIP (V.O.)
           Who-hoo! Man, McQueen looks happier
           than a rollbar at a demolition
           derby!
                         
          ON PAVED ROAD AGAIN - MOMENTS LATER

           BRENT MUSTANGBURGER (V.O.)
           Everyone's jostling for position as
           we hit the asphalt again.
                         
          Francesco crests the hill, in last place. He bites down,
          determined, then CHASES.
                         
           BRENT MUSTANGBURGER (V.O.)
           Francesco lost a lot of momentum in
           the dirt. He's got some serious
           work ahead of him if he wants to
           get back in this race.

          ON THE TRACK - A racer (Miguel Camino) suddenly PLUMES WITH
          SMOKE and skids out.
                         
           DARRELL CARTRIP (V.O.)
           Oh! Miguel Camino has blown an
           engine!
                         
           BRENT MUSTANGBURGER (V.O.)
           Very unusual, Darrell. He's been so
           consistent all year.
                         
          Camino quickly pits, passing McQueen's pit where Mater is
          visible.

           passed the device to.
                         
                          ACER
           What about him?

           What about him? He's in the pits!

          Acer exits, with purpose.
                         
          ON FINN AND HOLLEY, still in their office hideaway. Holley's
          onboard computer flashes an ALERT.
                         
                          HOLLEY
           Hold on. I think I've got
           something.
                         
                          FINN

                          HOLLEY
           The Pacer from the party last
           night.
                         
          She's spotted Acer, moving swiftly forward.
                         
                          HOLLEY
           Cross-referencing with the photos
           from the oil derricks... Yep. His
           VIN numbers match.
                         
                          FINN
           Anyone with him? He won't be alone.
                         
                          HOLLEY
           Conducting analysis on the target.
                         
          The computer finds more and more bad guy Pacers and Gremlins
          are in the crowd.
                         
                          HOLLEY
           He's not the only one here.
           Three... five... they're
           everywhere. And they're all closing
           in on... oh no.
                         
          We PAN OVER to see it's MATER.

           Finn? Finn, where are you?
                         
          She turns. He's GONE, leaving only an open window.

           Get out of the pit now. Do you hear
           me?
                         
          Mater realizes this girl has somehow broken into his radio.
                         
           MATER (INTO RADIO)
           Hey, I know you. You're that girl
           from the party last night. You
           wanna do our date right now?
                         
          ON THE TRACK - McQueen boxes out Francesco, holds his slim
          lead, but barely.
                         
                          MCQUEEN
           Guys, a little too much chatter.
           Let's keep this line clear.
                         
          BOOM! A racer behind McQueen suddenly expels black smoke,
          skids out of control.
                         
          ON GREM - laughing. That was clearly his handiwork.

           Get out now!
                         
          We CUT BACK TO ---
                         
          --- MATER. He gives in, exits the pit.
                         
                          MATER
           Well, all right but I usually like
           to have a proper detailing done
           before I meet a lady friend.
                         
          He moves toward the back PIT DOOR, is about to open it.
                         
          OUTSIDE THE PITS - ACER and another Pacer approach McQueen's
          pit door on the other side. Ready to pounce. The doors OPEN,
                         REVEALING ---

                          FINN
           Then this shouldn't hurt at all.
                         
          He empties the extinguisher in their eyes, speeds past. They
          try and follow, but have been blinded. One of them crashes
          right into a COP.
                         
          ON FINN - Already on the move, along a side street.

           Miss Shiftwell?
                         
          ON HOLLEY - Tracking everything on a grid map. Mater looks
          like Pac Man, weaving through the streets as bad guys close
          in all around him.
                         
                          HOLLEY
           I've got him in the back alleys

           Keep him moving. I'm on my way.

           flowers?
                         
          ON THE TRACK - McQueen, hearing this, is taken aback.
                         
                          MCQUEEN

           No! Don't go 'in' anywhere. Just
           keep moving.
                         
                          MATER

          McQueen drifts outside allowing Francesco to slip past!

           DARRELL CARTRIP (V.O.)
           I cannot believe what I just saw,
           Brent. That was a bonehead move.
           You don't open up the inside like
           that!
                         
          IN THE BACK ALLEYS - As Mater moves on he's followed by
          Pacers and Gremlins. Suddenly ---
                         
          --- CABLES whip in front of them, pulling over flower vending
          machines and sending the shop's owners into a frenzy. They
          direct their attention to the AMCs, who try and explain.
                         
          ON FINN, admiring his handiwork as he appears. Just as he
          turns to leave he's BROADSIDED and pushed INTO A DARK ALLEY.
                         
          IN THE ALLEY - Finn finds himself boxed by two Pacers and
          pushed toward ---
                         
          --- ACER, who now holds a FLAME THROWER.
                         
                          ACER
           This time I'm gonna make sure you
           stay dead.
                         
          He hits the flame. WHOOOSSSH!!
           50.
                         
                         
          ON ANOTHER STREET - Mater clicks along, still looking for
          Holley. Just as he passes the alley entrance where Finn
          stares down death:
                         
           HOLLEY (OVER RADIO)
           You're doing brilliantly. Now just
           stay focused.
                         
                          MATER
           What's that? You want me to head
           toward that ruckus?
                         
          Mater turns INTO the alley.
                         
           HOLLEY (OVER RADIO)
           No! Don't go down that street!
                         
          IN THE ALLEY - Finn, now nearly pushed completely into the
          flame thrower, leaps into the air. He FIGHTS BACK, using his
          wheels, axle, indeed his entire car frame as if he were
          human, kicking and tossing and shooting his enemies.
                         
          Mater witnesses the whole thing.
                         
                          MATER
           Wow! A live karate demonstration!
                         
          ON THE TRACK - McQueen, now playing catch-up again, scowls.
                         
                          MCQUEEN
           Stop it, Mater. Just sign off.
                         
          IN THE BACK ALLEY - Finn polishes off the AMCs by firing a
          bullet into a gas main line, causing an EXPLOSION that tosses
          Acer through the air where he lands in a NOODLE SHOP'S SIGN.
                         
          ON THE TRACK - The end of the race is nigh ---
                         
           BRENT MUSTANGBURGER (V.O.)
           They're bumper to bumper as they

          The Formula car gets there first.
                         
           BRENT MUSTANGBURGER (V.O.)
           Francesco's the winner, McQueen's
           number two!
                         
          IN THE ALLEY - Finn heaves breaths, surveys his damage.
                         
                          MATER
           That was cool! Hey, can I get your
           autograph?
           51.
                         
                         
          Mater approaches when a MASS OF RACE FANS burst out a door,
          momentarily blocking Mater's view of Finn. Once the fans have
          past, Finn has disappeared.
                         
                          MATER
           Hey, where'd he go?

           Our rendezvous has been

          Post race press conference. Francesco is center stage.
                         
                          DARRELL CARTRIP
           Francesco, over here! Hey, what was
           your strategy today?
                         
                          FRANCESCO
           Strategia? Francesco needs no
           strategy, it's very simple. You
           start the race, wait for Lightning
           McQueen to choke, pass him, then
           win. Francesco always wins. It's
           boring.
                         
          McQueen, waiting in the wings, rolls his eyes. He suddenly
          notices something O.S.
                         
          McQueen's P.O.V. - It's MATER, appearing from a side street,
          moving toward the pits, oblivious of the press conference.
                         
                          DARRELL CARTRIP
                          (TO FRANCESCO)
           I gotta tell you, dude. You were in
           trouble for awhile. That dirt track
           section had you crawling!
                         
          As McQueen SNEAKS AWAY ---
                         
                          FRANCESCO
           To truly crush one's dream, you
           must first raise their hopes very
           high.
                         
          IN MCQUEEN'S PIT GARAGE - Mater looks around for everyone as
          McQueen approaches.

          Mater, why were you yelling things
          at me while I was racing?
                         
                          MATER
          Yelling? Oh, you thought... that's
          funny right there. Nah, see that's
          `cause I seen these two fellers
          doing some sort of karate street
          performance. It was nutso. One of
          them even had a flamethrower ---
                         
                          MCQUEEN
          A flamethrower? What are you
          talking about? I don't understand.
          Where were you?
                         
                          MATER
          Going to meet my date.
                         
                          MCQUEEN
          Your date?
                         
                          MATER
          She started talking to me as a
          voice in my head, telling me where
          to go ---
                         
                          MCQUEEN
          What?
                         
                          MATER
          Wait a minute -- I didn't screw you
          up, did I?
                         
                          MCQUEEN
          I lost the race because of you!
                         
                          MATER
          Well, I'm sorry. I didn't mean ---
                         
                          MCQUEEN
          An imaginary girlfriend,
          flamethrowers. This is exactly why
          I don't bring you along to these
          things.

                          MATER
           Maybe if I, I don't know, talked to
           somebody and explained what
           happened I could help.
                         
                          MCQUEEN
           I don't need your help. I don't
           want your help.

          backwards as the questions fly again.
                         
                          PRESS
           - McQueen, you had it in the bag!
           - Yeah, what happened?
                         
                          MCQUEEN
           I made a mistake. But I can assure
           you, it won't happen again.
                         
          On Mater. He takes this badly.
                         
                          MCQUEEN
           Look, guys. We know what the
           problem is and we've taken care of
           it.

           lap to Francesco Bernoulli in the
           first race of the World Grand Prix
           and three, count em, three cars
           flamed out leading some to suggest
           that their fuel, Allinol, might be
           to blame.

           Allinol is safe! Alternative fuel
           is safe! There is no way my fuel
           caused these cars to flame out!

                          DARRELL CARTRIP
           Well the jury may still be out on
           whether Allinol caused these
           accidents, but one thing's for
           sure: Lightning McQueen blew this
           race.

          passing (but not noticing) ---
                         
          --- GREM and ACER.
                         
          AT THE SECURITY CHECK - MOMENTS LATER. Cars take off their
          tires, move through the metal detector. Mater waits in line.
          A SECURITY CAR approaches Mater.
                         
                          SECURITY CAR
           (in Japanese and English)

                          MATER
           But I'm gonna miss my plane.
                         
          IN THE ADMIRAL'S LOUNGE - MOMENTS LATER. The Security Car
          leads Mater inside.
                         
                          SECURITY CAR
           Right this way.
                         
          As they move past us the Security Car covertly drops a BALL
          BEARING which rolls into a corner. The ball bearing then
          sprouts MECHANICAL LEGS, tripods itself and IRISES out,
          revealing itself to be a tiny CAMERA.
                         
          IN THE MAIN ROOM - ADMIRAL'S LOUNGE - CONTINUOUS

                          MATER
           Doggone it. This is about my hook,
           isn't it? I know I should've
           checked it, but I can't really,
           look -- it's attached to me.
                         
          ZWAPPPPPP!! The Security Car suddenly DECLOAKS himself,
          reveals himself to be Finn McMissile!
                         
                          MATER
           Hey, I know you. You're that feller
           from the karate demonstration.
                         
                          FINN
           I never properly introduced myself.
           Finn McMissile. British
           Intelligence.
                         
                          MATER

           Who are you with? FBI, CIA?
                         
                          MATER
           Let's just say I'm triple-A
           affiliated. You know, I know some
           karate. I don't wanna brag or
           nothing, but I've got me a black
           fan belt.
                         
          BEEP! Finn's rearview alarms. His camera has picked up Grem
          and Acer. They've just entered the lounge, are right around
          the corner.
                         
                          MATER
           Hey, you wanna see some moves I
           made up?
                         
                          FINN
           You're being followed.
                         
          Finn quickly turns, fires a tiny GLASS CUTTING BEETLE at the
          window. As Mater talks, oblivious, the beetle cuts out a
          round hole.
                         
                          MATER
           This first one I can reach into a
           car's hood, pull out his battery,
           and show it to him before he
           stalls. I call it, "What I
           accidentally did to my friend Luigi
           once."
           56.
                         
                         
          Mater does his best (worst) karate moves as Acer and Grem
          turn the corner.
                         
                          GREM
           There he is!
                         
          The glass drops away, leaving a car-sized hole.
                         
                          MATER
           (eyes the clock)
           Look, I probably ought to go. I'm
           about to miss my flight.
                         
                          FINN
           Don't worry.
                         
          Finn HOOKS Mater from behind. He YANKS HIM forward ---
                         
                          FINN
           I've taken care of that. Hang on.

          EXT. TARMAC - AIRPORT - JAPAN
                         
          Finn pulls Mater down HARD onto the tarmac, towing him away
          from the terminal.
                         
                          MATER
           This is First Class service. You
           don't even have to go through the
           terminal.
                         
          ACER and GREM appear, chasing them. Mater, who is facing
          backward as he is being pulled along, faces them. They're
          about a hundred yards back.
                         
                          MATER
                          (TO FINN)
           Your karate partners are back here.
           They kinda look like they're trying
           to catch up!
                         
                          FINN
           Drive forward. Whatever you do,
           don't stop.
                         
          Finn SKIDS around, whipping Mater in a 180 so that Mater is
          now towing Finn.
                         
          Grem produces a ROCKET, lines up Finn as his target.

          Finn, without hesitation, fires a MINI ROLLING-JACK. The jack
          DRIVES ITSELF toward Grem, anchors itself under his frame and
          flips him like a turtle but not before Grem gets the rocket
                         OFF ---
                         
          THE ROCKET - it flies toward Mater and Finn.
                         
          FINN aims and launches a MISSILE back.
                         
          THE ROCKET AND MISSILE COLLIDE IN MID-AIR, EXPLODE.

           SIDDELEY (O.S.)
           Finn, it's Sid. I'm on approach.
                         
          A GULFSTREAM JET wings into view overhead. This is SIDDELEY.
                         
                          FINN
           Roger that.
                         
          Mater looks up: ACER screeches into view up ahead, dragging a
          long row of luggage carts in Mater's path, attempting to
          create an accident.
                         
                          MATER
                          (TO FINN)

           me not stopping no matter what?
                         
          Just as it looks dire --- RATATATATATATAT!!! SIDDELEY
          descends, hawklike, fires bullets and blows the luggage carts
          sky-high. Mater and Finn burst through them, luggage now
          raining down from above.
                         
                          MATER
           I knew I should've done carry-on!

          Siddeley LANDS HARD on the tarmac ahead of them. No time to
          stop, he DROPS his back open, revealing HOLLEY.
                         
                          MATER

          Mater SPEEDS UP toward Siddeley's ramp, Holley.
                         
                          MATER
                          (TO HOLLEY)
           Boy I tell you what, you really do
           want this first date, don't ya?
           That's a no-quit attitude right
           there.
                         
          Just as Mater's wheels touch the ramp, BULLETS PING around
          him in a spray. Siddeley is HIT, a tire BLOWN. He yells in
          pain.
                         
                          FINN
           Hold on, Sid!
                         
          Siddeley peels off the runway onto the grass.
                         
          A gunfight ensues between Finn and Acer. Finn SHOOTS ACER'S
          TIRE, blowing it and throwing him off-course.
                         
          Acer CAREENS out of control, drives up and THROUGH A JET ---
                         
          --- OUT THE OTHER SIDE where he lands in an oil tanker.
                         
          ON SIDDELEY - He's headed toward the edge of the tarmac,

           35,000 cars were made with this

           this feller is. See how he's had
           most of his parts replaced? And see

          Mater turns the corner and enters a massive Les Halles-
          inspired Parisian market filled with car parts. A tow truck's
          dream.
                         
                          MATER
           Dadgum.

           - Parts for sale, Monsieur!
           - Monsieur! Parts for sale!

          IN THE MARKET - MOMENTS LATER
                         
          Mater rolls along, impressed by the goods for sale.
                         
                          MATER
           You gotta be kidding me - they've
           got everything here. Look at them
           hoods! I could use a hood.
                         
          Mater continues on though, heeding Finn's advice.
                         
                          MATER
           Sorry fellers, I gotta go.
                         
          INT. ENCLOSED MARKETPLACE - DAY
                         
          Mater, now out of sight of Finn and Holley, passes a darkened
          stall. He STOPS, peers in. There's someone in there.
                         
                          MATER
           Excuse me. What are you selling?
                         
          It suddenly OPENS its headlights revealing... EYES!! In
          French, the mutant car pitches his wares to Mater. Mater
          FREAKS OUT, speeds off, TERRIFIED.
                         
          AROUND THE CORNER - FINN AND HOLLEY
                         
          A few car lengths ahead of Mater. They roll along, looking
          for... Aha! Finn and Holley recede into the shadows.
                         
          In FINN'S SIDE MIRROR: TOMBER, a three-wheeled parts dealer,
          argues with a French customer.
                         
                          FINN
           There you are.
                         
          Mater suddenly turns the corner, sees Finn and Holley.
                         
                          MATER
           Man, there are some great ---
                         
                          FINN
           Mater, get back!
                         
          Too late. Tomber sees Mater, then notices FINN, reflected in
          a hubcap. He BOLTS. Finn and Holley give chase.
                         
                          MATER
           Hey, wait for me!
                         
          Tomber, skidding away, kicks a tent in Finn's way. Holley
          quickly pivots RIGHT and disappears. Where did she go?
           66.
                         
                         
          Finn, hot in pursuit, leaps another obstacle and loses ground
                         TO ---
                         
          --- Tomber who turns a corner and finds himself grill to
          grill with HOLLEY. He whips to the left but TURNS OVER,
          rolling sideways and CRASHING to a stop.
                         
          Holley ZAPS him with ELECTROSHOCKERS. Finn suddenly arrives,
          stops her.
                         
                          FINN
                          (TO HOLLEY)
           Have you lost your mind?!
                         
                          HOLLEY
           But I thought ---
                         
                          FINN
           Mater! This chap needs a tow. Hook
           him up.
                         
                          MATER
           Sure thing.
                          CUT TO:
                         
          MOMENTS LATER - Mater tows Tomber, following Finn and Holley.
                         
                          TOMBER
           You rusty piece of junk, get your
           dirty hook off me!
                         
          INT. A SMALL GARAGE - MOMENTS LATER
                         
          Finn throws open a door. Cars scatter like cockroaches.
                         
                          FINN
           (to the cars)
           Allez! Maintenant - vite!
                         
          Mater unhooks an angry Tomber who spits in French. Finn pulls
          the door down. As it LATCHES TIGHT ---
                         
                          TOMBER
                          (TO FINN)
           Electroshock! Are you kidding me??
                         
                          FINN
           Easy, Tomber. This is her first
           field assignment - she didn't know
           you were my informant.
                         
                          HOLLEY
           Informant?
           67.
                         
                         
                          TOMBER
           A rookie, eh? I never liked new car-
           smell.
                         
          Holley FUMES with anger.
                         
                          FINN
           Tomber was doing 20 to life in a
           Moroccan impound the first time I
           saved him, if I recall correctly.
                         
                          TOMBER
           Speaking of recalls, you're getting
           up there in mileage aren't you,
           Finn?
                         
                          HOLLEY
           Alright, we get it. You both know
           each other, you're both old. So.
                         
          Holley shoots a HOLOGRAPHIC PHOTO of the engine in front of
          Tomber.
                         
                          HOLLEY
           There you go, informant. Inform us.
                         
          Tomber eyes the photo. He recoils, unimpressed.
                         
                          TOMBER
           That is the worst motor ever made.
                         
          Suddenly, Tomber narrows his gaze.
                         
                          TOMBER
           Wait. That oil filter... those
           wheel bearings.
                         
                          FINN
           Do those parts look familiar,
           Tomber?
                         
                          TOMBER
           They should. I sold them.
                         
                          HOLLEY
           To whom?
                         
                          TOMBER
           No idea. He's my best customer, but
           he always does his business over
           the phone. I was always wondering
           why he needs so many parts. Now I
           know.
           68.
                         
                         
                          MATER
           Well, a lemon needs parts. Ain't
           nothing truer than that.
                         
                          FINN
           "Lemon?"
                         
                          MATER
           Yeah, you know. Cars that don't
           ever work right. Lemons is a tow
           truck's bread and butter. Like them
           Gremlins and Pacers we run into at
           the party and the race and the
           airport.
                         
                          FINN
           Holley, pull up the pictures from
           the oil platform. I want to know
           what other type of cars were out
           there.
                         
          Holley complies and suddenly PHOTOS OF CARS FROM THE OIL
          PLATFORM hang suspended in the air in front of them.
                         
                          HOLLEY
           Right. Let's see. There were Hugos.
           And Trunkovs.
                         
                          FINN
           Mater, are these cars considered
           lemons?
                         
                          MATER
           Is the Popemobile Catholic?
                         
                          HOLLEY
           Finn. Everyone involved in this
           plot is one of history's biggest
           loser cars.
                         
          Holley refers to the ENGINE PHOTO, which now rises forward as
          the prominent picture, perhaps the only one in view.
                         
                          FINN
           And they're all taking their orders
           from the car behind this engine.
                         
                          TOMBER
           This explains it!
                         
                          FINN
           What, Tomber?
           69.
                         
                         
                          TOMBER
           Gremlin, Pacer, Hugo and Trunkovs
           never get together. But they're
           having a secret meeting in two
           days.
                         
                          FINN
           Where's this meeting taking place?
                         
                          TOMBER
           Porto Corsa, Italy.
                         
                          MATER
           That's where the next race is!
                         
                          FINN
           Then there's a good chance our
           mystery engine will be there too.
                         
                          TOMBER
           Your chances are more than good. I
           just sent him a new clutch assembly
           yesterday... to Porto Corsa.
                         
                          FINN
           Holley, contact Stephenson and have
           him meet us at Gare de Lyon. Good
           work.

          STEPHENSON, a THREE-CAR LUXURY BULLET TRAIN speeds along a

          Mater, Finn and Holley scroll through surveillance-style
          photos of TRAFFIC on an Italian street. They're in the front
          train car, which doubles as a luxury seating area and
          intelligence command center.

           Wow, not only is you the prettiest
           car I ever met, but you the
           smartest too.

           Thank you. I think.

           That's a familiar sight.
                         
          Mater refers to a photo of VICTOR HUGO, the HUGO Lemonhead,
          being towed by an EASTERN EUROPEAN TOW TRUCK.

           A Hugo being towed. But he looks

                          FINN
           Of course. They must be the heads
           of the lemon families.
                         
                          MATER
           Makes sense. If I was rich and
           broke down every day, I'd hire me
           to tow me around all the time too.
                         
                          FINN
           We've got to infiltrate that

                          HOLLEY
           Hold still.
                         
          Holley SNAPS Mater's picture, temporarily blinding him.

           Good job, Miss Shiftwell.
                         
          Holley isn't sure what surprises her more: the compliment or
          how pleased it makes her.

           I brought my friend Mater along on

           to act different, that we weren't
           in Radiator Springs.

                          UNCLE TOPOLINO
           Then why would you ask him to be
           someone else?
                         
          McQueen considers this - a realization.
                         
                          MCQUEEN
           What did I do? I said some things

                          UNCLE TOPOLINO
           You know, back when Guido and Luigi
           used to work for me, they would
           fight over everything.
                         
          IN THE SQUARE - Guido dances with a girl. Luigi suddenly CUTS
          IN. They begin to ARGUE.
                         
                          UNCLE TOPOLINO
           They fight over what Ferrari was
           the best Ferrari; which one of
           them look more like a Ferrari...
           There were even some non-Ferrari
           fights.
                         
          Guido now LIFTS Luigi, cuts BACK in.
                         
                          UNCLE TOPOLINO
           So I tell them, va bene. It's okay
           to fight. Everybody fights now and
           then, especially best friends.
                         
          McQueen takes this in. Seems to take some small comfort.
                         
                          UNCLE TOPOLINO
           But you gotta make up fast.
                         
          McQueen's comfort quickly evaporates.
                         
                          UNCLE TOPOLINO
           No fight more important than
           friendship.

          Guido and Luigi now dance together with the girl and her
          friend who has just arrived. All having a great time. They

          Holley turns back to her work. The disguise's cloaking is
          larger than Mater. As a result, Holley must dial it back to
          fit his body. As she carefully calibrates the hologram:

           I think you forgot the insulting
           part of that insult.
                         
                          FRANCESCO
           Is no insult. When Francesco is
           away from home, he misses his mama
           just like you miss your tow truck
           amico.
                         
                          MCQUEEN

           Of course, I am at home. And my
           mama is right here.
                         
          Francesco refers to his MAMA who sits in a special box in the
          crowd, cheering him on, blowing him kisses.

          Holley directs her interest toward Ivan.

           I don't know about this, Finn.
           What if I screw things up?
                         
           FINN (OVER RADIO)
           Impossible. Just apply the same
           level of dedication you've been
           using to play the "idiot tow truck"
           and you'll be fine.
                         
                          MATER
           It's just that them guys look
           pretty tough and --- Wait, did you
           say "idiot"? Is that how you see
           me?
                         
           FINN (OVER RADIO)
           That's how everyone sees you. Isn't
           that the idea? I tell you, that's
           the genius of it. No one realizes
           they're being fooled because
           they're too busy laughing at the
           fool. Brilliant.
                         
          While Finn talks, Mater takes this in. He catches his own
          reflection in a nearby window. Seems to be seeing himself
          with new eyes.

          SHOCKED UNCONSCIOUS by Holley's ZAPPERS.

          ON FINN - He SPEEDS up a road, Grem and Acer visible ahead of
          him. He LEAPS over the crevasse toward the AMC cousins ---
                         
          Suddenly, FINN FREEZES. He's immobilized in mid-air!
                         
          He looks up. A CHOPPER with a LARGE MAGNET hovers over him.

           BRENT MUSTANGBURGER (V.O.)
           McQueen's the winner, Francesco's

           I cannot in good conscience
           continue to risk the lives of any

           Allinol must be finished for good.
           McQueen cannot win the last race.

          Mater backs up, KNOCKING his emergency light against one of

          then quickly SCROLLS THROUGH all of his previous disguises,
          finally revealing rusty old Mater.

          ON MATER, out of the frying pan but still toasty. He looks
          around, notices:
                         
          LIGHTNING MCQUEEN, far away, leaving the press podium.

          Mater looks down at the harbor, over which he flies. He spots
          a MOTORBOAT. Mater WHIPS his hook down, steals a ride behind
          the boat TOWARD MCQUEEN.

          him like the world's biggest bling. He looks INSANE.
                         
                          MATER
                          (TO SECURITY)
           You gotta let me in! I gotta get
           through to warn McQueen!
                         
          Security eyes one another. This is serious.
                         
                          ITALIAN SECURITY #1
           You cannot come through here. Back
           up, signore.
                         
                          ITALIAN SECURITY #2
           (into a walkie-talkie)
           We have a lunatic at Gate Nove.
                         
                          MATER
           No, listen! I was disguised as a
           tow truck to infiltrate this
           Lemonhead meeting and my weapons
           system misinterperated what I was
                          SAYING ---
                         
                          ITALIAN SECURITY #2
           I repeat. Lunatic at Gate Nove.
                         
          Mater spots McQueen far off in the distance.
                         
                          MATER
           McQueen! McQueen!
                         
          JUST OFF THE PRESS STAGE - McQueen is led toward the exit.
                         
                          PRESS LIAISON
           Right this way, signore.
           97.
                         
                         
           MATER (O.S.)
                          (DISTANT)
           McQueen!
                         
                          MCQUEEN
           Mater?
                         
          McQueen looks up but can only see A SEA OF VEHICLES,
          flashbulbs, cameras, TV trucks with those tall satellite
          antennae things that spindle toward the sky...
                         
          BACK AT THE SECURITY BARRICADE - Mater, like a nimble running
          back, dances around to avoid capture by security.
                         
                          MATER
           McQueen!
                         
                          ITALIAN SECURITY #1
           Back up, sir. Stop moving! Stop!
                         
          Mater head fakes them and pushes through, into the crowd ---
                         
                          ITALIAN SECURITY #1
           Oy! Stop! Ferma li!
                         
          IN THE CROWD - Mater shoves his way through. He's still far
          in the back.
                         
                          MATER
           McQueen!
                         
                         ON MCQUEEN
                         
                          MCQUEEN
           That really sounded like Mater.
           Mater?
                         
                          PRESS LIAISON
                          (TO MCQUEEN)
           Signore...
                         
          ON MATER, getting CLOSER...
                         
                          MATER
           McQueen, they're gonna kill you!!
                         
          ON MCQUEEN - Okay, he's positive that was his friend, but
          where is he?
                         
                          MCQUEEN
           Mater?!
                         
          McQueen spots a TOW HOOK, moving through the crowd toward
          him, "Jaws"-like.
           98.
                         
                         
                          MCQUEEN
           Excuse me.
                         
          McQueen disappears into the press crowd.
                         
                          PRESS LIAISON
           No, no, where are you going?
           Please, Mr. McQueen!
                         
          McQueen pushes through the press.
                         
                          MCQUEEN
           Scusi. Mater! Scusi...
                         
          McQueen tracks the tow hook, gets closer. He pushes through
          the last few vehicles ---
                         
                          MCQUEEN
           Mater, I'm so glad to see you. I'm
           so sorr ---
                         
          It's NOT MATER. It's IVAN, the Hugo Thug's tow truck.
                         
           IVAN THE TOW TRUCK
           Lightning McQueen! I am a huge fan.
                         
                          MCQUEEN
                          (CONFUSED)
           Oh, I'm sorry. I thought I heard---
                         
           IVAN THE TOW TRUCK
           Yes, but that was me. I said, "You
           killed out there today." You're
           the best.
                         
                          MCQUEEN
           What? Oh. I mean, thanks.
                         
                          PRESS LIAISON
           Right this way, signore ---
                         
          Now the Press Liaison and his assistants are pushing McQueen
          back in the other direction ---
                         
                          MCQUEEN
           (as he's pulled away)
           I really thought I heard my friend.
                         
          As he's pulled away, press and onlookers start to come
          between him and Ivan, who hasn't moved.
           99.
                         
                         
           IVAN THE TOW TRUCK
                          (TO MCQUEEN)
           In England you'll be finished. At
           the finish line.
                         
          Ivan is now obscured again.
                         
                          MCQUEEN
           Wait, what?
                         
          The ITALIAN PRESS being to swarm.
                         
                          PRESS LIAISON
           Please, the world press is waiting.
           You come with me, please.
                         
          McQueen is pulled back ---
                         
          EXT. STREET - PORTO CORSA - MOMENTS LATER
                         
          --- just as Mater, now BOUND and with HIS MOUTH TAPED, is
          pulled away and thrown into the back of a transport vehicle.
          He lands hard on his side, spits out his TAPE.
                         
                          MATER
           Let me go!
                         
                          PROFESSOR ZUNDAPP
           You actually care about that race
           car. A pity you didn't warn him in
           time.
                         
          As the doors close on Mater --- PHHHHHSSSSSSTTTTTTT! A
          thick, noxious gas starts to fill the truck.
                         
          On MATER as the knockout gas works its magic. HIS EYES CLOSE.
                          CUT TO:
                         
          BLACK SCREEN.
                         
           MATER (V.O.)
           Idiot? Is that how you see me?
                         
           FINN (V.O.)
           That's how everyone sees you. I
           tell you, that's the genius of it.
                         
          FADE IN on Mater, back at the Casino, eyeing his reflection
          in the glass window. It's the same moment from before except
          now we are watching it from a DETACHED, FLOATING PERSPECTIVE.
           100.
                         
                         
           FINN (OVER RADIO)
           No one realizes they're being
           fooled because they're too busy
           laughing at the fool.
                         
          - IN THE KABUKI THEATER IN JAPAN - Again, from before. Mater
          makes a spectacle of himself, WHOOPING AND HOLLERING in the
          stands with the face paint on.
                         
                          MATER
           Domo arigato!
                         
          McQueen, Fillmore, Guido, Luigi, Sarge and patrons eye Mater,
          embarrassed and angry.
                         
          - IN THE JAPANESE MUSEUM - The moment of Mater banging on the
          Zen rock garden's glass. Except that now we see all sorts of
          disappointed and eyebrow raising reactions.
                         
                          MATER
           You done good! You got all the
           leaves!
                         
                          JEFF GORVETTE
           Check out that tow truck.
                         
                          LEWIS HAMILTON
           I wonder who that guy's with?
                         
                          MCQUEEN
                          (HUMILIATED)
           Will you guys excuse me just for
           one little second?
                         
          We now REVEAL that this FLOATING, THIRD PERSON PERSPECTIVE is
          MATER. He's INSIDE his past, watching it from others' points
          of view. He doesn't like what he sees.
                         
          - ON MATER, now at the sushi bar.
                         
                          MATER
           Now that's a scoop of ice cream!
                         
          Mater swallows the wasabi with one big bite. He SCREAMS! The
          sushi bar patrons blanch with revulsion at his wail.
                         
          - ON THE FOUNTAIN, as Mater peels into full view of everyone
          else at the party. As Mater laps up water from a fountain:
                         
                          MCQUEEN
                          (EMBARRASSED)
           Mater?!
           101.
                         
                         
          ALL THE RACERS, with FRANCESCO front and center, guffaw at
          Mater.
                         
          - On MCQUEEN, now scolding Mater moments later.
                         
                          MATER
           I never leak oil. Never.
                         
                          MCQUEEN
           Mater, you have to get a hold of
           yourself. You're making a scene!
                         
          - IN MCQUEEN'S PIT GARAGE, after the Japanese race.
                         
                          MATER
           Wait a minute. I didn't screw you
           up, did I?
                         
                          MCQUEEN
           I lost the race because of you!
                         
                          MATER
           Maybe if I talked to somebody, or---
                         
                          MCQUEEN
           I don't need your help. I don't
           want your help!
                         
          - Now BACK AT THE PARTY, a moment we didn't see before but
          which presumably happened. Mater is BANGING a ceremonial
          GONG, to the horror of Japanese guests.
                         
                          MATER
           Bang a gong, get it on!
                         
          GONNNNNNG!!! ---
                         
          On the PARTYGOERS, RACE CARS, PARTY STAFF - they're all
          laughing at Mater as McQueen's final words blend in, making a
                         DISSATISFIED CACOPHONY
                         
                          MCQUEEN
           Listen, this isn't Radiator
           Springs. This is exactly why I
           don't bring you along to these
           things!
                         
          Off the GONG at the party ---
                         
          INT. BIG BENTLEY - DAY
                         
          --- to the GONG of a CLOCK.
                         
          CLOSE ON MATER as he OPENS HIS EYES.
           102.
                         
                         
          All around him, all he sees are GIANT PIECES OF MECHANIZED
          CLOCKWORK.
                         
          HOLLEY and FINN are here too, strapped bumper to bumper in
          the divots of large clock movements.
                         
                          MATER
           Holley! Finn! Where are we?
                         
                          FINN
           We're in London, Mater. Inside Big
           Bentley.
                         
          EXT. BIG BENTLEY - CONTINUOUS
                         
          The BIG HAND finishes ADVANCING one minute. It's 3 PM.
                         
          INT. BIG BENTLEY - CONTINUOUS
                         
          Suddenly Mater DROPS QUICKLY down toward ---
                         
          --- whirring, scary machinery.
                         
                          MATER
           Woaaaah! ---
                         
          WHAP! The chain yanks to a STOP.
                         
          Mater, instead of being 30 feet from death, is now 20.
                         
          Finn and Holley are only a few clicks closer to being crushed
          themselves. The clock ticks to 3:01.
                         
                          MATER
           This... this is all my fault.
                         
                          FINN
           Don't be a fool, Mater.
                         
                          MATER
           But I am, remember? You said so.
                         
                          FINN
           When did I... Oh. Mater, I was
           complimenting you on what a good
           spy you are.
                         
                          MATER
           I'm not a spy!
                         
          This echoes throughout the clock.

                          MATER
           I've been trying to tell you that
           the whole time. I really am just a
           tow truck.
                         
          Finn and Holley take this in.
                         
                          HOLLEY
           Finn, he's not joking.
                         
                          FINN
           I know.
                         
                          MATER
           You were right, Finn. I'm a fool.
           And what's happened to McQueen is
           `cause I'm such a big one. This is
           all my fault.
                         
          GREM and ACER arrive on a lift, roll into view on a catwalk.

           Not for much longer.
                         
          He pushes the camera through an open small window, turns it
          toward the course. Mater DROPS down again ---

           No, no, it's all right.
                         
                          MILES AXLEROD
           I just wanted to come down here and
           personally thank you. Because after
           Italy, I was finished. And then you
           gave me one last shot.

                          MILES AXLEROD
           And I probably shouldn't be saying
           this at all but... I hope you win
           today. Show the world that they've
           been wrong about Allinol.

           talking to the Professor---
                         
          They're all talking at once and for a moment we cannot
          understand what is being said.

          to Mater. But they SPIN IN PLACE, empty.
                         
          Grem and Acer just laugh more.

          seen nothing.

          The COMPUTER responds with each "dadgum." The barrels
          continue to SPIN, CUTTING THROUGH the ropes.

          FIRES HER ELECTROSHOCKERS ---

          into view just beyond the glass.
                         
          Freaked, Zundapp does a 180 and SMASHES out a plate glass
          window, lands on a ridiculously large balloon tethered to the
          ground, and speeds off ---

          --- Professor Zundapp, speeding toward docks along the Thames
          where a COMBAT SHIP waits.

           Hurry, Professor!
                         
          ON ZUNDAPP - With Finn gaining fast, he accelerates. Suddenly
          --- WHAP!
                         
          He's been TETHERED by Finn with tensile cables now attached
          to his rear end. Zundapp SCREAMS like a little girl.
                         
                          FINN
           Do you really think I'm going to
           let you float away, Professor?
                         
          Finn reels him in. Zundapp spins his wheels, caught.
                         
          Suddenly Zundapp miraculously, inconceivably, GAINS TRACTION!
          Now it's FINN'S WHEELS that are spinning.
                         
          ON THE COMBAT SHIP - the ELECTROMAGNET has been turned
          outward and switched on. He's PULLING ZUNDAPP AND FINN IN
          with the magnetic force. He pulls out a laser, TARGETS it at
          Finn's windshield.

          Mater and McQueen, speeding up the street.

          --- MATER. WRENCH BITS are strewn all around him as Guido
          tries wrench after wrench to take the bolts off. No dice.
          Guido gestures wildly, spits Italian a mile a minute.
                         
                          MCQUEEN
           What's he saying?! What's wrong!?
                         
                          LUIGI
           None of his wrenches fit the bolts!
                         
          This is a light bulb moment for Mater. He eyes the bolts.
                         
                          MATER
           I get it. I get it! I know what
           needs to be done.
                         
                          MCQUEEN
           Then do it!
                         
                          MATER
           What? No, I can't do it. Look,
           nobody takes me seriously. I know
           that now. This ain't Radiator
           Springs.
                         
                          MCQUEEN
           Yes it is.
                         
          Mater looks at McQueen. It is?
                         
                          MCQUEEN
           You're yourself in Radiator
           Springs. Be yourself here. And if
           people aren't taking you seriously,
           then they need to change. Not you.
           I know that, because I was wrong
           before. Now you can do this. You're
           the bomb.
           122.
                         
                         
                          MATER
           Thanks, buddy.
                         
                          MCQUEEN
           No no no, you're the actual bomb.
           Now let's go!
                         
                          MATER
           Oh, right! Hang on!
                         
          Mater HOOKS McQueen and they're off.
                         
          They SHOOT PAST FINN, who's in the middle of battling lemons.
                         
                          FINN
           Where's he going?
                         
          ON MATER AND MCQUEEN - Flying down a side street.

                          MATER
           I need that thing you done before
           to get me away from McQueen!

          The ROCKET THRUSTERS kick in. They head right for a WALL.
                         
                          MCQUEEN
           Mater...
                         
                          MATER
           Now I need you to do the chute, the
           second kind not the first!

           Deploying chute.
                         
          Mater's chute POPS OPEN, catching air and sending Mater and
          McQueen SAILING INTO THE AIR.
                         
          Mater starts to steer them the direction he wants. He and
          McQueen are FLYING OVER LONDON.
                         
          EXT. BALCONY - BUCKINGHAM PALACE - DAY
                         
          The QUEEN, her attendants, assorted dignitaries are here.
           123.
                         
                         
                          QUEEN
           Who's winning the race?
                         
          Mater and McQueen drop from the sky. They land and skid to a
          halt just before the Queen's guards who DRAW THEIR WEAPONS.
                         
                          QUEEN'S GUARD
           Back up! Back away!
                         
                          QUEEN
                          (STAR-STRUCK)
           It's Lightning McQueen!
                         
                          QUEEN'S GUARDS
           Get back!
                         
                          MCQUEEN
           No, no, it's okay! Tell them,
           Mater. Explain.
                         
                          MATER
           Okay! Somebody's been sabotaging
           the racers and hurting the cars and
           I know who. Oh wait... Your
           Majesty.
                         
          Mater BOWS to the Queen. In doing so, the TICKING TIME BOMB
          angles into view. The clock's at T-minus 1:53.
                         
                          QUEEN'S GUARDS
           - Bomb! - It's a bomb! - Everybody
           down! - Look out!
                         
           FINN (O.S.)
           Hold your fire! He can't disarm it!
                         
          Finn dives onto the platform and rolls between the Queen and
          Mater.
                         
                          FINN
           Mater, I don't know what you're
           doing but stand down now!
                         
                          MATER
           (aside, to McQueen)
           This ain't nothing at all like
           Radiator Springs.
                         
                          MCQUEEN
           Mater, just cut to the chase!
                         
                          MATER
           Okay.
           124.
                         
                         
          He turns to Miles Axlerod.
                         
                          MATER
           It's him.
                         
                          MILES AXLEROD
           What? Me? You've got to be crazy.
                         
          Everyone exchanges confused looks, including Finn and Holley.
                         
                          MATER
           I figured it out when I realized
           you all attached this ticking time
           bomb with Whitworth bolts. The same
           bolts that hold together that old
           British engine from the photograph.
           Holley! Show that picture.
                         
                          HOLLEY
           O-kay...
                         
          Holley projects the much discussed PHOTO OF THE ENGINE.
                         
                          MATER
           And then I remembered what they say
           about old British engines - "If
           there ain't no oil under `em, there
           ain't no oil in `em."
                         
                          MILES AXLEROD
           What is he talking about?
                         
                          MATER
           It was you leaking oil at the party
           in Japan. You just blamed it on me.
                         
                          MILES AXLEROD
           Electric cars don't use oil, you
           twit.
                         
                          MATER
           Then you're faking it. You didn't
           convert to no electric. We pop that
           hood we gonna see that engine from
           that picture right there.
                         
          Mater moves toward Miles Axlerod to pop his hood.
                         
                          MILES AXLEROD
           This lorry's crazy. He's going to
           kill us all!
                         
          Miles Axlerod BACKS UP to the edge of the stage.
           125.
                         
                         
                          MILES AXLEROD
           Stay away!
                         
                          HOLLEY
           But Sir Axlerod created the race,
           Mater. Why would he want to hurt
           anyone?
                         
                          MATER
           To make Allinol look bad so
           everybody'd go back to using oil. I
           mean, he said it himself with that
           disguised voice.
                         
                          MILES AXLEROD
           "Dee-sguised voice?" What are you
           talking about? You're nuts, you
           are!
                         
          The QUEEN'S GUARDS have had ENOUGH. As has the PRINCE.
                         
                          PRINCE WHEELIAM
           This is going nowhere fast. We
           really should go, Grandmother.
                         
                          QUEEN
           One moment. I'd like to see where
           this is going.
                         
                          FINN
           Mater, he created Allinol.
                         
                          MATER
           Yeah, but what if he found that
           huge oil field just as the world
           was trying to find something else?
                         
          Mater sticks his ticking bomb-nose into Miles Axlerod's
          grill.
                         
                          MATER
           What if he came up with Allinol
           just to make alternative fuel look
           bad?
                         
                          MILES AXLEROD
           "What if?" You're basing this on a
           "What if"?!
                         
                          GUARD
           Okay, that's it.
                         
          And the QUEEN'S GUARDS spirit the Queen and Prince Wheeliam
          out of there FAST ---
           126.
                         
                         
                          MILES AXLEROD
           Wait! Somebody save me! The lorry's
           crazy!
                         
          Now it's just Miles Axlerod, Mater, McQueen, Finn and Holley.
          Miles Axlerod's back tires slip on the edge of the podium as
          he is cornered by Mater.
                         
                          MILES AXLEROD
           Keep away, you idiot!
                         
          00:00:08...
                         
                          FINN
           Mater!
                         
                          HOLLEY
           Mater!
                         
          00:03...00:02...
                         
                          MILES AXLEROD
           Someone do something!
                         
          Everyone FLINCHES, DUCKS or DIVES FOR COVER except McQueen,
          Mater and Axlerod ---
                         
                          MILES AXLEROD
           You're insane, you are!
           Deactivate!!
                         
          The bomb FREEZES at 00:01.
                         
           THE BOMB'S COMPUTER VOICE
           Bomb deactivated. Have a nice day,
           Sir Axlerod.
                         
          General shock all around. Miles Axlerod realizes what he's
          done, looks terrified. Police surround him.
                         
          Mater FLINGS Miles Axlerod's hood open with his hook,
          revealing AN INTERNAL COMBUSTION ENGINE, oil dripping from
          all sides. It MATCHES the photo.
                         
                          FINN
           The engine from the photo.
                         
                          HOLLEY
           It's a perfect match!
                         
                          MILES AXLEROD
           How did the tow truck figure it
           out?
           127.
                         
                         
                          MCQUEEN
                          (TO MATER)
           It's official. You're coming to all
           my races from now on.

           Now you're talking!
                         
          Tire bump.
                         
          EXT. BUCKINGHAM PALACE - DAY
                         
          A massive crowd packs the adjacent streets and parks.
                         
          INT. BUCKINGHAM PALACE - DAY
                         
          Mater does the requisite "silly faces" in an attempt to break
          the composure of a Buckingham Palace Guard. It isn't working.
          McQueen approaches.
                         
                          MCQUEEN
           Mater, let's go. You're on.
                         
          INT. QUEEN'S CHAMBER - BUCKINGHAM PALACE - DAY
                         
          The Queen sits in attention at the front of the Main
          Ballroom. As Mater and McQueen approach:
                         
                          LORD STEWARD
           Your Majesty. May I present for the
           investiture of honorary Knighthood
           of the British Realm. Tow Mater of
           Radiator Springs.
                         
                          MCQUEEN
           Go get `em, buddy.
                         
          McQueen joins his friends from Radiator Springs. Mater rolls
          forward. He bows, as if he's practiced it all day.
                         
                          QUEEN
           I hereby dub thee "Sir Tow Mater."
                         
          Applause from all around.
                         
                          MATER
                          (LOOKS UP)
           "Sir?" Shoot, you can just call me
           Mater, Your Majesty. I don't wanna
           hear none of this "Sir" business.
           By the way, have y'all met each
           other? Queen? McQueen. McQueen,
           Queen. McQueen? McMissile.

          The town sign now reads "WELCOME TO RADIATOR SPRINGS - HOME
          OF LIGHTNING MCQUEEN AND SIR TOW MATER."
                         
          EXT. FLO'S - DAY
                         
          Cars surround Mater and McQueen. The rest of the Radiator
          Springs gang is here too, watches. VAN and MINNY are front
          and center.
                         
                          MATER
           So there I was: rocket jets going
           full blast, McQueen hanging on for
           dear life when suddenly them two
           nasty lemons come out of nowhere,
           guns drawed. We was goners. But
           then out of nowhere, this beautiful
           spy car swoops in from the sky to
           save us!
                         
                          MINNY
           That's a very entertaining story,
           young man.
                         
                          VAN
           Oh, Minny, please. Come on, none of
           this happened. Rocket jets? Flying
           spy cars?
                         
                          HOLLEY
           No, you're quite right. It does
           sound a bit far-fetched.
                         
          The crowd turns, sees HOLLEY, wings out, swooping in. FINN is
          right below her, driving up the street.

           Our investigation proved that
           Allinol was actually gasoline. And
           Miles Axlerod engineered it so that
           when it got hit by the beam it
           would explode.
                         
                          MCQUEEN
           Wait a second. Fillmore, you said
           my fuel was safe.

           alternative fuel with my all-

           Finn, time to go. Siddeley's
           gassed, geared and ready to fly.
                         
          Finn starts to back up.

           You're leaving already?

           We've got another mission, Mater.
           Just stopped by here to "pick
           something up."
                         
          They both eye Mater, expectantly.
                         
                          MATER
           Something tells me you're not
           talking about souvenir bumper
           stickers.
                         
                          FINN
           Her Majesty asked for you
           personally, Mater.
                         
                          MATER
           But I told you all before. I'm not
           a spy.
                         
                          HOLLEY

                          FINN
           Spy or not, you're still the
           smartest, most honest chap we've
           ever met.
                         
                          HOLLEY
           Don't forget massively charming.
                         
          Mater looks over at Holley. He looks touched.
                         
                          MATER
           Well, thanks. But as much fun as it
           was hanging with y'all, this...
                         
          He looks over to his friends who watch the race, CHEER
          MCQUEEN ON.
                         
                          MATER
           This is home.
                         
                          HOLLEY
           That's alright, we understand. But
           I'll be back. You still owe me that
           first date.
                         
                          FINN
           If there's ever anything I can do

           Well, I sure appreciate that, thank
           you.

                                               THIRD DRAFT

                                               March 13, 1998




FADE IN:

EXT.  MARFA, TEXAS - 1993 - WIDE - DAY

The Texas plains, horizon to horizon, nothing but the browns
and ochres of earth and the blue and violet of the sky.  The
sheer scope of it sinks in:  the blank slate of nature, the
absence of man.  On the screen superimpose:

                    MARFA, TEXAS, 1993.

CREDITS BEGIN.

A plume of dust comes into frame.  The dust is from a TRUCK,
orange and white and violet, with "FedEx" blazoned across the
side.

The truck turns into a collection of ramshackle World War II
era Quonset huts and outbuildings.  Around the outbuildings
are large sculptures of wood and metal.

EXT.  QUONSET HUT - DAY

The door is opened by a WOMAN in her late twenties.  Hair
pulled back, casual, an artist.  She hands the DRIVER a FedEx
BOX which is decorated with a drawing of two ANGEL WINGS.
The Driver has a hand-held computer; a portable printer
dangles from his belt.

The Driver scans the package with his hand-held computer,
prints out a label and sticks it on the Box, ready to go.
But something on the box catches her eye.  She wants it back.
He glances at his watch.  She draws RINGS around the Wings,
uniting them.  She gives the box to the Driver, then hands
him a cup of coffee.  They've done this before.

He takes a sip of the coffee, then runs for the truck.  He
jumps in and heads back onto the plains.

EXT.  FEDEX OFFICE - MIDLAND/ODESSA - NIGHT - HOURS LATER

The Driver jams the distinctive Angel Wing Box on top of a
dolly and loads it into a CONTAINER with clear plastic sides.
A female Loader slaps a large bar code label on the
container, scans it, then pulls the container across a belt
of rollers onto a larger truck.  The doors of the truck
close.  The latch slams down.

A forklift hoists the container to the cargo doors of a 737.

EXT.  MEMPHIS AIRPORT SUPERHUB - NIGHT

The 737 lands.

EXT.  SUPERHUB - NIGHT - MINUTES LATER

One of a seemingly endless line of FedEx planes, our 737
taxis to a gate at the FedEx SUPERHUB.  The Hub is a vast
living organism -- loud, complex, overwhelming, as much a
symbol of modern life as was the factory in Modern Times.

Five thousand people work in a frenzy of interconnected
activity inside three vast hangers brightly lit.  Hundreds of
forklifts and cargo-pullers dart about, their headlights
crisscrossing like a laser show.

Loaders quickly roll the container onto a FORKLIFT.

INT.  MEMPHIS SUPERHUB - NIGHT

The forklift speeds inside one of the hangers to a LOADING
BELT, where our Box is spilled into a Mississippi River of
packages, HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS of them, all shapes and
sizes, from shoe boxes to engine blocks.  Large mechanical
arms divert the immense flow of Workers at dozens of
stations.  The packages surge and move.

The Workers place the packages label-side-up on new belts,
where they're scanned by laser readers.  Picking up speed our
Box is shunted across the acres of interlocking belts.

The Box ends up in a much larger CONTAINER labeled CDG.

EXT.  MEMPHIS SUPERHUB - NIGHT

A forklift lifts the Container to a door on a giant MD-11.

INT.  GLOBAL OPERATIONS CENTER - NIGHT

A jumbled room jammed with computers and dominated by a HUGE
WALL GRAPHIC that charts hundreds of airplanes.  An Operator
moves a yellow strip labeled Jumbo 12 across the board.

EXT.  CHARLES DE GAULLE AIRPORT - DAY

SERIES OF SHOTS

The giant place touches down in Paris.  The Angel Wing Box
moves quickly on another belt and disappears into another
CONTAINER, which is loaded onto still another AIRPLANE.

EXT.  ST. PETERSBURG AIRPORT, RUSSIA - NIGHT

The plane lands.  The container is unloaded down a belt.  We
see our Angel Box.  Directly in front of it is a DENTED BOX.

INT.  ST. PETERSBURG FEDEX OFFICE, RUSSIA

SERIES OF SHOTS

Night.  The manic activity has come to a dead stop.  Our two
Boxes sit on a table in a corner not far from a small
Christmas tree.

Daylight now.  YURI, a Supervisor, saunters over, picks up
the Angel Box, sees an attractive co-worker, puts it down.

Night again.  A cat walks by the table where our two Boxes
have come to rest.

EXT.  ST. PETERSBURG FEDEX OFFICE - DAY

A FedEx truck pulls out of the warehouse.  The walls of the
warehouse are covered with graffiti.  The streets are slushy,
the buildings blanketed in snow.

EXT.  ST. PETERSBURG - DAY

The Driver sits in the truck drinking tea.  He takes a last
sip, sighs, gets out with the Angel Box.  Walks slowly toward
an APARTMENT HOUSE.

EXT.  ST. PETERSBURG APARTMENT HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

A beautiful young RUSSIAN WOMAN opens the door.  A young
AMERICAN MAN comes up behind her, signs the form and takes
the Angel Box.  We see Christmas decorations inside.  The
woman puts her arms around him as the door closes.

                     RUSSIAN WOMAN (O.S.)
               (accented English)
          It's pretty.  Who is it from?

                     AMERICAN MAN (O.S.)
          My wife.

We stay with the Driver as he ambles back toward the truck.

EXT.  ST. PETERSBURG OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER

The Driver has just delivered the Dented Box to ALEKSEI,
Russian Businessman, who closes the door of a Czarist-era
building.  Aleksei checks his watch, picks up the phone.

EXT.  FEDEX OFFICES - MANILA - DAY

CHUCK NOLAND, early thirties, walks along a line of brightly
colored jitneys, each bearing the FedEx logo.  With him is a
Filipino FedEx SUPERVISOR wearing a guayabera.  Chuck
glistens with a thin layer of sweat.

                     CHUCK
          My guess is we're talking fuel filters
          here, Fernando.  The gas is dirty, these
          jitneys get in the mountains, their
          engines cut out.

                     FERNANDO
          That could lose us half an hour.

                     CHUCK
          Easy.  Each way.

His beeper goes off.

INT.  FEDEX OFFICES - MANILA - DAY - MOMENTS LATER

Chuck is on the phone.

                     CHUCK
          So it finally turned up...

Chuck hesitates for a moment, then looks at his watch.

                     CHUCK
          I'll catch the sweep tonight.

INT.  FEDEX PLANE - NIGHT

Strapped into the jump seat behind the pilots, Chuck sleeps
with a mask over his eyes.  On his lap are some travel
brochures.  We see sailboats, we see the Florida keys.

EXT.  ST. PETERSBURG FEDEX OFFICES - DAY

Christmas in Russia.  Snow everywhere.  Brightly colored
lights.  Chucks gets out of a Volga with Aleksei.  He has a
bag over his shoulder, the dented package under one arm.

INT.  FEDEX OFFICES - DAY

The staff has assembled near the loading dock.  Yuri the
station manager stands in front, occasionally catching the
eye of the attractive woman.  Chuck displays the FedEx box.

                     CHUCK
          It took this test package thirty-two
          hours to get from Seattle to St.
          Petersburg, a distance of nine thousand
          miles.  And then it took forty-one hours
          to get from our warehouse in St.
          Petersburg to here, a distance of,
          what --

                     ALEKSEI
          Six kilometers.  Four miles.

                     CHUCK
          So how are we going to get this place
          shaped up?

There's a muttered chorus of answers.

                     CHUCK
          There's only one way.  We have to work
          together.  Every one of us depends on
          everyone else.  If one package is late,
          we are all late.  If one truck misses the
          deadline, we all miss the deadline.
          Let's start by taking a look around.

Chuck leads his team through the sorting area.  Yuri squeezes
right next to him, ostentatiously carrying a clipboard.
Chuck stops.

                     CHUCK
          Here, this table is too far from the
          wall.  Packages can slip down...like...
               (pulls out a package from
                behind a table)
          ...this.

He hefts the package, as if trying to guess what's inside.

                     CHUCK
          What could be in here?  Let's say one of
          you sent it.  Could be the closing papers
          on your dacha, could be a toy for your
          grandson's birthday, could be a kidney to
          keep your mother alive.  I don't think
          you want your mother's kidney to end up
          behind a table.

The Sorter shoves the table against the wall.  Yuri says
something to the Translator.

                     TRANSLATOR
          He says they have been very busy.  It is
          hard to get good employees.  He is sure
          you understand.

Wrong answer:  Chuck glances sharply at Yuri.  Aleksei
appears with a cellular phone.

                     ALEKSEI
          Phone call.  Malaysia.

Chuck takes the phone, opening his BAG as he does so.

                     CHUCK
          Kamal?  Right.  I'm getting them.

He pulls out a set of blueprints and tacks them to a bulletin
board as he talks.

                     CHUCK
          I'm looking at the blueprints of K.L.
          right now.  The belts are too small for
          the sorters.  Yeah, sometimes you never
          see what's right in front of your face.
          Look, it's --

Chuck keeps an eye on what is going on in the warehouse.
Then he notices something over by one of the trucks.

                     CHUCK
               (to a loader)
          Hold it!  Hazardous material needs its
          own container!
               (back on the phone)
          -- three in the afternoon there, right?
          That gives you five hours until the sweep
          comes through.  Do the sort by hand
          tonight, then put in a new feeder belt,
          say a twenty-four incher.  Yes, overtime
          is authorized.

He hangs up the phone.  He turns to the crew.

                     CHUCK
          I'm going out on every route, I'm going
          to work every job here, until I know
          enough to help you.  That's it.

The crew disperses back to work.  Chuck and Aleksei walk
toward the office.  They've done this before.  Chuck lets a
corner of his command persona slip.

                     ALEKSEI
          It's bad.

                     CHUCK
          Worse than Warsaw.

                     ALEKSEI
          Nobody remembers that.

                     CHUCK
          The failures they remember.  It's the
          successes they forget.

EXT.  ST. PETERSBURG - DAY - MOMENTS LATER

A FedEx truck pulls out of the FedEx office.  Chuck is
inside.  He notices the graffiti on the walls.

INT.  TRUCK - MOMENTS LATER

Chuck rides next to LEV, the driver, a serious sort.  The
Translator squats on some boxes between them, trying to keep
his balance.

                     CHUCK
          You sorted your packages before you left.
          None of the other drivers did.

The Translator and Lev exchange a few words.

                     TRANSLATOR
          He says he wants to be organized.  Do
          packages in order.

Chuck looks at Lev with respect.  Right answer.

                     CHUCK
          So how come the other drivers haven't
          left yet?

The Translator asks Lev, who looks at him as if he is crazy,
then snorts an answer.  The Translator blushes.

                     TRANSLATOR
          He says -- he is a very rude fellow --

                     CHUCK
          Tell me exactly what he said.

                     TRANSLATOR
          He says why don't his farts smell sweet?

Chuck grins.  Lev shrugs and says something else.

                     TRANSLATOR
          He says that's just the way it is.

                     CHUCK
          Lev -- it's Lev, right?  Listen, this is
          FedEx.  We don't have to accept the way
          it is.

EXT.  HOTEL - ST. PETERSBURG

A weary Chuck enters the hotel.  In the sky above him we see
the Northern Lights.  He doesn't even look up.

INT.  HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT - LATER

Chuck is watching CNN on the television, working his
PowerBook, and holding the phone.

                     CHUCK
          No, keep trying.  A circuit's bound to
          open up.

He hangs up.

                     CHUCK
               (to himself)
          Those damn Northern Lights.

Just then the lights go off.  For a moment everything is
darkness.  Then a small light switches on.  Chuck has a
headlamp on.

He gets up, heads into the bathroom.  We stay in the bedroom.
After only a moment, the light reemerges.  It heads over to
his bag.  We go with it.

Chuck takes out a roll of toilet paper.  The guy is prepared
for anything.  He goes into the bathroom, closes the door.

The lights come back on just as the phone rings.

We hear scuffling sounds on the other side of the door.
Chuck charges out, holding up his pants.

Grabs the phone.

                     CHUCK
          Hello?  Great.  Try it.

He waits.  We hear an ANSWERING MACHINE.

                     KELLY (V.O.)
          This is Kelly, leave me a message and
          I'll call you back soon as I can.

This is not what Chuck wanted to hear.

                     CHUCK
          Kelly, damn, look, this is Chuck.  I'm
          going to be a little late.  Well, more
          than a little.  I had to go to Russia.
          Couldn't be helped.  Could you call and
          cancel the trip?  Look, we'll sail the
          Keys in March.  It's better then anyway.
          I'll be back before Christmas.  I
          promise.  I think.  I mean, I will.  I,
          uh --

He's stumbling over whether to say I love you.

                     CHUCK
          I miss you.

He gently hangs up the phone.

INT.  FEDEX OFFICES - ST. PETERSBURG - SERIES OF SHOTS

A surprised Yuri stands with the attractive assistant as
Chuck takes his clipboard away.

An even more surprised Lev stands by his truck as Chuck hands
the clipboard to him.

Chuck and the loaders clean off the graffiti.

Working alongside the sorters as the packages come in, Chuck
points out how to organize the inflow.

Chuck and Lev go over large maps of St. Petersburg with the
drivers.

INT.  FEDEX WAREHOUSE - ST. PETERSBURG - WEEK LATER

A big semi is being loaded with outgoing packages for the
airport run.  Aleksei, Chuck, Lev and the office executives
watch as containers are rolled on.

                     LEV
          We've never got all the trucks in on
          time.  Never.

Chucks looks at the clock.

                     CHUCK
          Only one still left?

                     LEV
          Route six.

Aleksei points at the big semi.

                     ALEKSEI
          If we don't send it now we may miss the
          connection in Paris.

The pressure in on.  Chuck looks around at his team.

                     CHUCK
               (to Aleksei)
          Give it five minutes.

EXT.  FEDEX OFFICES - ST. PETERSBURG - MINUTES LATER

The last truck rolls in.

INT.  FEDEX OFFICES - ST. PETERSBURG

The last truck enters and loading dock.  A few loaders move
toward it.  The executives all stand and watch.  But not
Chuck.  He's hands on.

                     CHUCK
          Let's go.

He heads toward the truck and begins pulling off packages.
All the other executives follow him.

INT.  FEDEX OFFICES - ST. PETERSBURG - MINUTES LATER

Led by Chuck, who works like a man possessed, they sort the
packages.

                     CHUCK
          That's Bermuda.  Bermuda is in the
          Memphis thru container.  No, Azores is
          Europe.

He gestures at a closed container.

                     CHUCK
          The Paris container.  Africa too.  Japan
          goes to Memphis.

Chuck is everywhere, setting the example.  The whole office
is energized, working together.

INT.  FEDEX OFFICES - ST. PETERSBURG - MINUTES LATER

They load the last container on the waiting truck.  Chuck
pounds the truck on the side.  Go.

The truck roars out of the loading dock.

Everyone takes a breath.  They are happy, proud.

                     LEV
          We did it.  All of them.

                     CHUCK
          Great job, everyone.  Remember, work
          together.  We are like a hand...

They've heard this before.  Lev holds up his hand just before
Chuck does.

                     LEV
          One finger, weak.  All fingers working
          together, strong.

This makes Chuck smile.

                     CHUCK
          You got it.

EXT.  CHARLES DE GAULLE AIRPORT - DAY

A FedEx MD-11 is being loaded with huge containers of
freight.  Chuck goes up the gangway next to the forklifts.

INT.  MD-11 - MOMENTS LATER

The pilots -- JACK and GWEN -- are going down their check
lists.  Chuck sticks his head in the cockpit.

                     CHUCK
          I absolutely, positively, have to get to
          Memphis overnight.

                     JACK
          Can't help you.  Try UPS.

                     CHUCK
          Jack -- gotta be something wrong with our
          physicals, you keep getting certified to
          fly.  Gwen, aren't you worried?

                     GWEN
          Terrified.

                     CHUCK
          We're on time, right?

                     JACK
          On time, Chuck.

Chuck hands Jack and Gwen small packages.

                     CHUCK
          Little present from the emerging
          republics.

Another FedEx Road Warrior named STAN gets on.  He and Chuck
are obviously old hands at this.

                     CHUCK
          What connects the world?  What makes it
          one?
               (they ignore him)
          We do.  FedEx.

                     GWEN
          You are such a lifer.

                     STAN
          What do you expect, from the guy who
          stole a kid's bicycle when his truck
          broke down?

                     CHUCK
          Borrowed.  I borrowed it.

The two of them strap in.

                     STAN
          How'd it go?

                     CHUCK
          Great.  Terrific.  The good guys won one
          for a change.

He's finished a tough job.  He's relaxed and on his way home.
But Stan's his boss, and Stan's got bad news.

                     STAN
          I had to bump your plane last night.

Chuck can't believe it.

                     CHUCK
          You what?

                     STAN
          It was fifteen minutes late.

The plane begins to taxi.

                     CHUCK
          I checked the weather, you had the jet
          stream, you could have made it up.

                     STAN
          But I might not have.

                     CHUCK
          Jesus.  I got it working... You have no
          idea how hard it was... They're finally a
          team...

                     STAN
          I'm touched.

                     CHUCK
          You fucked us over.

                     STAN
          The point of FedEx, as I understand it,
          is to make the damn connection.

                     CHUCK
          I was making a point.

                     STAN
          What?  Let Paris hold its plane?  Let
          Memphis take care of it?  Let somebody
          down the line clean up your mess?

                     CHUCK
          Every person counts, every package
          counts, that's my point.

                     STAN
          You know what your problem is?  You just
          see the packages in front of you.  You
          don't see the big picture.

                     CHUCK
          Baloney.  I do see the damn "big
          picture."

EXT.  CHARLES DE GAULLE AIRPORT - NIGHT

The MD-11 takes off.

INT.  MD-11 - NIGHT

Chuck is focused on his PowerBook with the screen away from
us, Stan is doing tai chi amidst the FedEx containers.  It
feels a little surreal, all those containers surrounding
them.

Stan comes over, looks at the image on the computer.  It's a
sailboat with some technical specifications under it.

                     STAN
          I didn't know we had sailboats.

                     CHUCK
          It's a ketch Kelly and I had chartered.

                     STAN
          For all those vacation days you got
          coming.

Chuck doesn't look up.

                     CHUCK
          And never take.

                     STAN
          Look, I'm sorry about your plane.  But I
          couldn't risk being late into Memphis.

                     CHUCK
          Forget it.

                     STAN
          You know General McLelland, he wouldn't
          attack unless he had everything just
          right.  Finally Abe Lincoln came to him
          and said, General, if you're not going to
          use my army, could I borrow it for a
          while?  So he gave it to Grant and Grant
          just said, let's go.

                     CHUCK
          I'm from Arkansas.  Tell me a story with
          Robert E. Lee in it and maybe I'll pay
          attention.

                     STAN
          We're warriors, not desk jockeys.  We've
          got to be bold.  You always want all your
          ducks lined up.  But nothing's 100
          percent.  It's always 60-40, maybe 51-49.
          Hell, I'd take 40-60.  Then roll the
          dice.

                     CHUCK
          That's why you're a gambling man.

                     STAN
          That's why I'm running foreign and you're
          not.  That's why you're not married and I
          am.

                     CHUCK
          For the third time.

                     STAN
          Take the plunge, admit your mistakes,
          move on to tomorrow.  That's FedEx,
          that's women, that's life.

Stan is so outrageous, Chuck can't help but laugh.

                     CHUCK
          You are one sick fucker.

                     STAN
          I'm trying to help you here.  There's
          Warsaw, there's this --

                     CHUCK
          This was nothing like Warsaw.  I held the
          truck then minutes, it's not that big a
          deal.

But apparently it is.

                     STAN
          Look, that kids' bike, that's a guy
          who'll do what it takes to get there on
          time.  Live up to your legend, that's all
          I'm saying.

Chuck reaches in his pocket, pulls out a bill.

                     CHUCK
          A hundred rubles St. Petersburg hits 95
          percent in a month.

                     STAN
          Ninety five percent?  Just give me the
          money now.

                     CHUCK
          Talk is cheap.  Are we on or not?

                     STAN
          We're on.

Chuck closes the PowerBook.

                     CHUCK
          Let's go off-line.

They both take out their Valium -- the price they pay for
being such road warriors.

                     CHUCK
          Two Valium...

Stan puts on his Walkman.

                     STAN
          And the Stones.  Got to be.

It's their ritual.  Chuck puts headphones from his Walkman
over his ears, puts a mask over his eyes and leans his head
back onto the headrest.  We hear the Rolling Stones.

EXT.  MEMPHIS AIRPORT - NIGHT - WIDE

The MD-11 arrives at its gate.  The cargo doors open.
Forklifts and a gangway roll up to the side.

INT.  MD-11 - NIGHT

Stan stands smiling over Chuck.

                     STAN
          Chuck.  Wake up Chuck.

Chuck pulls off the mask, takes out the earplugs.  He manages
a groggy grin.

                     STAN
          You gotta do your own delivery from here.

INT.  SUPERHUB - NIGHT

Chuck walks through the extraordinary nexus of speeding
packages that intersect in intricate paths above and around
him.  This is the beating center of the FedEx world, the
crossroads, the deep core where everything connects.  In his
still-drugged state it all seems weirdly psychedelic.  A
Christmas tree goes by, then a huge plastic Santa Claus, both
with shipping labels.

EXT.  CHICKASAW GARDENS - MEMPHIS - NIGHT

Chuck's car pulls into the driveway of a small cottage in an
older Memphis neighborhood.  The radio is playing the news.

INT.  CHUCK'S HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

Chuck drops his briefcase and his bag.  The place is a jumble
of clothes, papers, books, etc.  In the living room is a tank
of tropical fish.  The water looks a little green.  No
bubbles are coming from the filter.

Uh oh.

Chuck walks to the tank.  He tightens a piece of tape that
holds the power cord onto the filter, taps the filter with
his finger, once, twice...the bubbles start again.

                     CHUCK
          Damn thing.

But for a couple of fish floating on top of the tank it's too
late.

Chuck gets out his scoop and slowly skims them off.

                     CHUCK
          Sorry, I'm really sorry.

EXT.  CHUCK'S HOUSE - BACK YARD

Chuck digs a small hole in the back yard with a large kitchen
spoon.

Drops the dead fish in.

Fills the hole.

INT.  CHUCK'S HOUSE - LATER

The CD is playing.  Chuck lies in bed, switches on the TV.
This is no good.  He doesn't care how late it is, he's going
to find Kelly.

EXT.  MEMPHIS - NIGHT - LATER

Chuck drives in his car through the streets of Memphis.

EXT.  UNIVERSITY - NIGHT

Chuck pulls up to a lab building at Memphis State.

INT.  LAB - NIGHT

Two doctoral candidates are playing Doom on their computers
when Chuck walks in.

                     CHUCK
          You seen Kelly Frears?

One of them gestures toward a door.

                     GUY
          Xerox machine.

INT.  HALLWAY - NIGHT

Chuck makes his way in the semi-darkness past rack after rack
of specimens in bottles.

Ahead of him we see the flashing green light of a Xerox
machine.

INT.  XEROX ROOM

The light goes off.  KELLY leans over the machine, bangs on
it.

                     KELLY
          Sonofabitch!

                     CHUCK
          Hey, be nice to it, it'll be nice to you.

Surprised, Kelly turns to greet Chuck.

                     KELLY
          Chuck!  You're back!

She leaps into his arms.

                     KELLY
          Your eyes are puffy.  Did you take Valium
          again?

                     CHUCK
          You smell like formaldehyde.

Kelly looks over at the Xerox.

                     KELLY
          My last chapter's in there, and the damn
          machine's jammed.

                     CHUCK
          Let's take a look.

He lifts up the cover.

                     KELLY
          How was Russia?

                     CHUCK
          Cold.

                     KELLY
          Don't overwhelm me with details, you know
          how I hate that.  Did you get it fixed?

                     CHUCK
          I thought I did.

He pries up one feeder, then another.

                     CHUCK
          Got to follow the paper path here.

                     KELLY
          Chuck, forget the Xerox.  So Russia
          didn't turn out well?

But Chuck doesn't want to talk.  He's focused on the machine.

                     CHUCK
          Used to you could fix these yourself.

She pulls him out of the machine.  He has toner on his
fingers.

                     KELLY
          Chuck.

                     CHUCK
          What do you want me to say?  That I
          thought I'd done a great job but it all
          turned to shit?  That I might as well
          have gone sailing for all the good I did?

                     KELLY
          Yeah, tell me.  Tell me all of it.

He suddenly looks really tired.

                     KELLY
          You don't even know what time it is.
          What day it is.

He turns to the Xerox in frustration.

                     CHUCK
          And I can't fix this damn machine.

She looks at him.

                     KELLY
          Come on.

INT.  KELLY'S OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER

A tiny cubicle with a door.  She closes it, takes some paper
towels out of the desk, wipes his fingers.

                     KELLY
          We're on the deck of the ketch, the air's
          soft, the water's clear as crystal...

She licks the last bit of toner off his fingers.

                     CHUCK
          That's carcinogenic.

She ignores that, stays with the fantasy.

                     KELLY
          We're covered with suntan lotion and
          sweat.  Our skin is so hot, it's
          glowing...

And she comes closer to him.

                     KELLY
          We could take a swim.

She's really close now.

                     CHUCK
          On the other hand we could not take a
          swim...

They squiggle themselves onto the desk.

INT.  LAB - NIGHT

Someone kicks the door shut.  Now the figures are in
silhouette, lit by the light in the office.

And then the light goes out.

EXT.  FEDEX OFFICES - NEXT MORNING

A nondescript office park near the airport.  No sign.
Chuck's car screeches into the parking lot.  He jumps out,
glances at this watch, and heads for the building at a run.

INT.  EXECUTIVE CONFERENCE ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

A large room dominated by an animated MAP OF THE WORLD.
Lights at various locations blink and flash.  Above the map
are a large Sign saying "Here Today, Gone Tomorrow" and two
huge digital Clocks -- one keeping time, the other a
countdown clock for that day's package sort at the SuperHub.

The operations team of FedEx sits around a large table.  Each
has on a headset.  BECCA TWIGG, the business-like senior vice
president of Operations, addresses questions to a man --
COLIN PARKER-BOWLES, the European operations manager -- on a
LARGE TV SCREEN in front of her.  "London" is superimposed on
the screen.

                     BECCA
          So why was Milan late, Colin?

                     COLIN
          One of the race horses coming from
          Ireland got colic and had to be off-
          loaded in Brussels.  That put the Jumbo
          15, six hours late into Charles De
          Gaulle.  Customs had difficulty locating
          the dutiable items...

Colin continues as Chuck, out of breath, slips under the
screen and heads for the one remaining vacant seat -- across
from Stan.  Next to Stan is MAYNARD GRAHAM, an MBA systems
man.  Becca addresses a question over to Stan.

                     BECCA
          Stan, can we get P&A down to work with
          Milan customs?

                     STAN
          We're already on it.

                     BECCA
          Good.  And let's look at our live animal
          policy.  I don't think the income stream
          justifies delaying IP product, especially
          at Christmas.

Colin disappears.  A red light goes on.  Becca pushes a
button.  Another face comes on the screen.  "Oakland" appears
under the face.

                     BECCA
          Stand by, Benson, we're still wrapping up
          foreign.

She turns pointedly to Chuck.

                     BECCA
          Chuck, thanks for joining us.  Status?

Chuck swallows nervously, tries to talk matter-of-factly.

                     CHUCK
          Becca, as you know St. Petersburg was
          consistently running late by six to ten
          hours -- sometimes a full day or more.  I
          replaced the station manager.  We
          identified inefficiencies and worked out
          a quality improvement plan I believe can
          be met.

                     MAYNARD
          You replaced the station manager with a
          driver.  A local with no knowledge of our
          systems.

                     BECCA
          Shouldn't you have brought in someone
          from Memphis?  Russia is priority one.

                     MAYNARD
          James Pottinger is available.

The process is being ripped out of Chuck's hands.  He
struggles to get an answer.

                     STAN
          He's a numbers cruncher.  Chuck's done
          all the right things here...

Stan is doing his best to back up Chuck.

                     CHUCK
          Jim's a terrific financial man, no
          question.  But we can't always parachute
          in from Memphis.  We've got to build up
          our local staff.

                     MAYNARD
          We've got to improve foreign on-time,
          that's what we've got to do.  If this new
          guy's so good, how come the very first
          plane he sent missed the connection in
          Paris?

Maynard knows how to go for the jugular.  Everyone looks at
Chuck.

                     CHUCK
          We're building a new team here.  We got
          every package on the truck for the first
          time ever.  Success is the best teacher.

                     MAYNARD
          I don't call missing the plane a success.

Everyone looks at Chuck.

EXT.  KELLY'S HOUSE - DAY - LATE THAT AFTERNOON

Chuck lugs a big package up to the door, knocks on it.  Kelly
opens the door.

                     KELLY
          Merry Christmas eve.

                     CHUCK
          Not if you work for FedEx.

INT.  KELLY'S HOUSE - DAY

Chuck enters as they keep talking.  Her house is cozy but
also where she works.  There's a computer, specimen jars, and
some terrariums with frogs inside.  A Christmas tree with
packages under it.

                     KELLY
          You break four million packages last
          night?

In the b.g. one of the packages by the Christmas tree is
starting to shake on its own.

                     CHUCK
          Four four.  A record.

                     KELLY
          You don't seem too happy about it.

                     CHUCK
          Ah, the staff meeting could have gone
          better.

                     KELLY
          Let me guess, Russia came up?

Chuck's attention goes to the tree.

                     CHUCK
          One of those packages just moved.

The package turns over, something darts out.  It's a puppy,
with a bow around its neck.

                     KELLY
          Merry Christmas.

Chuck bends down to see the puppy.

                     CHUCK
          Hey, look at you.

                     KELLY
          I figure, if we could take care of a
          puppy, we could, you know, take care
          of --

A baby, she wants to say, but that's going a little fast so
she catches herself.  Chuck picks the puppy up.

                     CHUCK
          He is a cute thing.

                     KELLY
          He's your cute thing.

                     CHUCK
          I can't even keep fish alive.

                     KELLY
          A puppy's got a little more personality
          than a fish.

                     CHUCK
          And for you --

Chuck hands over his present.

                     KELLY
          So do good things come in large packages?

Kelly opens Chuck's present -- a very large box.

It's a piece of luggage.

                     CHUCK
          You know, for when you travel.

                     KELLY
          For when I travel?

She can't believe it.  It's the exact opposite of what she
wanted.

                     KELLY
          You should have got me something that
          shows you want us to be together, not
          apart.

Chuck is flummoxed.  Women read so much into things.

                     CHUCK
          I wasn't sending a message.  I though
          you'd like it.

Chuck's beeper goes off.

                     KELLY
          You should have got me a ring.

He checks the number.

                     CHUCK
          I have to go.  I'm on call for overflow
          down at the Hub.

                     KELLY
          A ring.  I wanted a ring.

                     CHUCK
          You did?

She nods.  What to do?

                     CHUCK
          Look, I love the puppy.  I love you.  But
          I have to go.

                     KELLY
          You can't go now.

                     CHUCK
          I have to.

                     KELLY
          You want to.

Chuck picks up the puppy.

                     CHUCK
          What should we call him?  Or is it her?
          How about Jango?

Kelly is having one of those moments when everything comes
clear.

                     KELLY
          This isn't working out.

                     CHUCK
          We're a little emotional here.  It's
          Christmas, maybe we're over-reacting.

                     KELLY
          "We're" not over-reacting.

                     CHUCK
          Could you watch Jango?

                     KELLY
          No.

                     CHUCK
          I can't take him to work.

He hands her the puppy.

                     CHUCK
          We'll talk about it when I come back.
          It'll all be fine.  Really.

This is not a happy woman he is leaving behind.

EXT.  KELLY'S HOUSE - HOUSE LATER

It's dark now.  Chuck returns.  The stars are putting on an
amazing show, but he doesn't notice as he heads for the door.

INT.  KELLY'S HOUSE - MINUTES LATER

Chuck enters.  The tree and the presents under it are gone.

                     CHUCK
          Kelly?  Kelly?

No answer, nothing but the sound of Jango, who begins yelping
in the kitchen.

INT.  KELLY'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER

Chuck picks up Jango, who is barricaded in the kitchen with
some food, some water, and some wet newspapers.

                     CHUCK
          There.  There.  Easy now.

EXT.  KELLY'S HOUSE - BACK YARD - NIGHT - MINUTES LATER

Holding Jango, Chuck walks out into the back yard.

                     CHUCK
          Kelly?

A fire still smolders.  The packages have burned.  The tree
is a blackened mess.

Chuck stares at it.

EXT.  CHUCK'S HOUSE - NEXT MORNING

Chuck gets into his car, puts Jango on the front seat next to
him.  Pulls out of the driveway.

EXT.  ARKANSAS HIGHWAY - DAY

Chuck is in his car, with the dog on his lap.

EXT.  FARM HOUSE - DAY

Chuck's car drives up to a typical Arkansas farm house.  His
MOM is setting some Christmas tree lights around the door.
Chuck gets out of the car.  There's a large wet spot on the
front of his pants.

                     MOM
          What happened to your pants?

                     CHUCK
          Mom, meet Jango.

Chuck displays the puppy.

EXT.  FARM HOUSE - SHED - DAY

Chuck works on an old tractor in the shed.  Some small legs
appear in his vision, then a small face.  This is AMANDA, his
niece.

                     AMANDA
          Dinner's ready.

INT.  FARM HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY

Around the table are Chuck's brother ROGER, his wife MARY,
Amanda, and her TWO BROTHERS.  Mom brings in the turkey,
places it on the table, sits down.  They all hold hands and
bow their heads.

                     MOM
          Chuck?

Chuck hesitates just a moment.

                     CHUCK
          Bless us O Lord, and these thy gifts,
          which we are about to receive, from thou
          bounty, through Christ the Lord.  Amen.

                     ROGER
          Let's eat.

EXT.  FARM HOUSE - LATER THAT DAY

The children burst out the door, shrieking, chased by Jango.

INT.  FARM HOUSE - DAY

The grown-ups are cleaning up after Christmas dinner.  The
scene moves between the table, the kitchen counter, and the
refrigerator.  It's an old-fashioned kitchen, simply
furnished.

                     MARY
          How's Kelly?

                     CHUCK
          Great.

                     ROGER
          Thought you were going to bring her.

                     CHUCK
          So did I.

                     MOM
          It seemed like she had such a good time
          last time.

                     CHUCK
          It's nothing you did, Mom, believe me.

                     MARY
          Jennifer's still down at the post office.
          And she's still got that crush on you.

                     ROGER
          And she's still got those --

                     MARY
          Roger.

                     ROGER
          You should have stuck around.

This is an old, sore subject.

                     CHUCK
          Look, I help take care of the place.  You
          got my check, didn't you Mom?

                     MOM
          That new roof, that's your doing.

                     ROGER
          You're just allergic to farming, that's
          what dad said.  Can't stand to be alone.
          Can't stand to be in one place.  Can't
          stand the sight of...blood.

He drops the turkey giblets into the trash.

                     MARY
          Roger's going to put chickens in here.

Chuck can't believe this.

                     CHUCK
          Come on Roger, this is dad all over
          again.  You already did beefalo,
          chinchillas, and what was that, ostrich?
          They chased Mom around the yard, sprained
          her hip.

Mom goes to the freezer and takes out some frozen
strawberries.

                     MOM
          It wasn't that bad, dear.

                     MARY
          You can't make a living out of this
          place.  We tried.

                     CHUCK
          But chickens?

                     ROGER
          Sixty three pounds consumed per capita,
          up from twenty seven in 1960.  Going to
          pass beef.  Chicken's global.  No
          religious taboos.  You don't see your
          Hindus and your Muslims boycotting
          poultry.

                     CHUCK
          True enough.  No sacred chickens nowhere,
          so far as I know.

                     MOM
          Roger's working at Tyson's now.

Mom mashes the block of frozen strawberries with a fork to
separate the strawberries from the ice.

                     CHUCK
          Really?

                     ROGER
          Come on down to the plant.  It's state of
          the art.  We're doing for chickens what
          FedEx did for the delivery business.

                     CHUCK
          Just don't count 'em before they hatch.

Roger grins at him.  This is just how they are.

                     ROGER
          I'll try to remember that.

                     MOM
          Dessert.

They all sit down.  Mom brings the slushy frozen strawberries
to the table, squirts on some Reddi-whip.  Looks pointedly at
Chuck.

                     MOM
          Speaking of hatching, I could sure use
          some more grandchildren.

Not a timely topic with Chuck.

                     CHUCK
          Mom, this is a farm.  We've got real
          strawberries growing outside, we've got
          real cream.

                     MOM
          Oh no, the prodigal son's home.  We bring
          out the store bought.

Chuck takes a bite, winces a little as the cold strawberries
hit his teeth.

EXT.  MOM'S HOUSE - LATER THAT DAY

Chuck fixes the drain pipe while Mom prunes the rose bushes
around the porch.

                     CHUCK
          Maybe I should take a few days off.
          Roger's working now, you could use some
          help around here...

                     MOM
          Don't you even think about it.

                     CHUCK
          The place is falling apart.

                     MOM
          I'm doing fine.

She looks pointedly at Chuck.

                     CHUCK
          Doing great, Mom, don't worry about me.

                     MOM
          There's settled folks, and there's
          nomads.  You're just not a settled folk.
          You never belonged here.

Chuck finishes the drain pipe.  Gives it a thunk with his
finger.

                     CHUCK
          Come on inside, Mom.  You've had a long
          day.

INT.  FARM HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT

In his boyhood room, we see Chuck's laptop, which is hooked
up to the internet FedEx homepage.  All around him are models
of boats and planes, maps, pictures of far-off places.  The
room of a boy who always fantasized about getting away.

Chuck is beside it, slumped down on the desk.  Asleep.

EXT.  FARM HOUSE - DAY

His mom waves to him as Chuck drives away.

INT.  FEDEX OFFICE - LATER THAT DAY

Chuck enters his office, on the go.  His assistant LESLIE is
waiting for him.

                     CHUCK
          I need the latest PDRs on St. Petersburg.

                     LESLIE
          And how was your Christmas?

                     CHUCK
          Terrific.  Yours?

She nods, used to this.

                     CHUCK
          And get me in to the dentist.  My tooth's
          acting up.

Stan enters.

                     STAN
          Malaysia's tanking.  We're meeting in ten
          in operations.

                     CHUCK
          Right.
               (to Leslie)
          Get me everything on Indonesia, New
          Guinea, all the way to Australia.

INT.  OPERATIONS ROOM - MINUTES LATER

Chuck, Leslie, Stan and another executive from the meeting
named DICK are gathered around the TV screen.  A squawk box
is on the table.

                     CHUCK
          Kamal?  Kamal?  Can you hear us?

The box squawks.  The TV screen rolls an imperfect image.

                     DICK
          Can't we get this working?

A Technician is fiddling with the TV set.

                     TECHNICIAN
          Trying.

                     CHUCK
          Kamal, you're breaking up.  Can you hear
          us?

                     VOICE (SQUAWK BOX)
          Kamal is not here.

                     CHUCK
          Who is this?  Where is Kamal?

                     VOICE (SQUAWK BOX)
          It is Ibrim, I, I am a sorter.

                     CHUCK
          What's going on down there?

                     VOICE (SQUAWK BOX)
          Kamal is not here.  We are very defused.

                     CHUCK
          Who's in charge then, where is Chinn?

The squawk box hums and crackles.  Nothing.  Chuck turns to
the Technician.

                     STAN
          We got Telex, e-mail?

                     TECHNICIAN
          Sure.  Just not getting any answers.

Chuck turns to Leslie.

                     CHUCK
          When's the next Jumbo?

                     LESLIE
          The regular flight is scheduled for oh
          three hundred tomorrow.

                     CHUCK
          Anything else?

                     LESLIE
          There's a sweep leaving Memphis in an
          hour, goes through Sydney.

                     STAN
          Maybe you should get your ducks lined up
          first.

Chuck looks over at Stan.

                     CHUCK
          Call Operations.  Get me on it.

And Stan is impressed.

EXT.  CHUCK'S HOUSE - DAY

Chuck leaves with his bag over his shoulder and the puppy
under his arm.

EXT.  KELLY'S HOUSE - DAY - MINUTES LATER

Kelly opens the door.  Chuck is there with the puppy.

                     KELLY
          That's your dog.

                     CHUCK
          It's our dog.  It belongs to us.

                     KELLY
          There isn't any us.

                     CHUCK
          Yes there is.

Kelly can't stay mad.

                     KELLY
          I'm sorry about the presents.  I got a
          little carried away.

                     CHUCK
          No, it was great.  Maybe a little
          overkill --

                     KELLY
          I burned the Christmas tree.

She's half-laughing, half-wanting-to-cry.

                     KELLY
          Why didn't you come over, get mad at me,
          tell me what a stupid bitch I was.

                     CHUCK
          I guess I hadn't thought through how I
          felt.

                     KELLY
          What, you were going to come over the
          next day all calm and say, Kelly that
          really made me mad?  Don't tell me you're
          mad.  Be mad.  Be who you are right now.

                     CHUCK
          Look, we'll do our trip as soon as I get
          back.

                     KELLY
          Don't even start.

And then it hits her.

                     KELLY
          Get back?  From where?

                     CHUCK
          Malaysia.  They're holding the sweep.

She stares at him for a long moment, then at the puppy.

                     KELLY
          Give him to me.

He hands her the dog.

                     KELLY
          Chuck, you're breaking my heart.

                     CHUCK
          A week, max.  Okay?  Okay?

                     KELLY
          Go on.  We'll be fine.  I'll feed Jango
          to the frogs.

She kisses the puppy.

INT.  FEDEX PLANE - NIGHT

Chuck enters the cockpit, where two different pilots are
going through their checklists.  Chuck repeats his familiar
patter.

                     CHUCK
          Al -- gotta be something wrong with our
          physicals, you keep getting certified to
          fly.  John, aren't you worried?

                     JOHN
          I disconnected his controls.  He only
          thinks he's flying.

Chuck settles into his seat.

                     CHUCK
          You're on your way home, Al?

Al has an Australian accent.

                     AL
          Right.  Down home, down under.

                     CHUCK
          We're on time, right?

                     AL
          On time, Chuck.

INT.  FEDEX PLANE - NIGHT - HOURS LATER

Settled into the jump seat, Chuck finishes up his notes on
his PowerBook and begins his flight ritual.

He puts in his ear plugs and takes out his Valium.  He
swallows one, then thinks, and swallows two more.  Then he
turns on his Walkman to the Rolling Stones, puts the mask
over his eyes, and, as usual, goes to sleep.

                                                 DISSOLVE TO:

INT.  FEDEX PLANE - NIGHT

The plane is SHAKING badly.  HEAR frantic, garbled radio
talk.  Chuck stirs, struggles to his feet, drowsy and
drugged.

INT.  FEDEX PLANE - CHUCK'S POV

Everything is hazy, out of focus, as it was in his earlier
drugged condition.  But this is real haze.  SMOKE.  And the
cabin also TWISTS and TILTS.

Chuck tries to steady himself against the wall.  This is
nightmarish.  Is this really happening?

INT.  FEDEX PLANE - CHUCK'S POV - COCKPIT

The pilots wrestle with the controls.  They have their life
jackets on.  John glances back at Chuck, his face floating in
a cloud of fear.

INT.  FEDEX PLANE - MOMENTS LATER

Chuck struggles to put on his life jacket.  The plane is
VIBRATING VIOLENTLY.  He can't get the straps straight.  He
is KNOCKED against one wall, then another, then to the floor.

Chuck tries to blow on the mouth tubes for his life jacket.
Can't do it!  Puff.  Puff.  Shit!  John motions frantically
for Chuck to pull on the automatic inflators on his jacket.
Chuck fumbles for them.

Huge palettes shift and groan, one BREAKS FREE, banging
violently against the side of the plane, spilling out its
boxes.  Then it swings and KNOCKS Chuck on the head!  He goes
down!

INT.  GLOBAL OPERATIONS CENTER - MOMENTS LATER

A CONTROLLER mans the global operations desk.  His SUPERVISOR
stands behind him, sipping some coffee.  The mood is eerily
calm.  An assistant moves Plane Locator Cards on a giant
board.

                     CONTROLLER
          Jumbo 14 is overdue in Sector K.

                     SUPERVISOR
          Where are they?

Another CONTROLLER tracks a giant computer screen.

                     CONTROLLER 2
          Somewhere east of Port Moresby.  Guam is
          getting a signal but no location.  Maybe
          the GPS is out.

The signal flashes, but is strangely still compared to the
others, which are moving.

EXT.  FEDEX PLANE - NIGHT

The giant plane PLUMMETS down from the sky.

INT.  FEDEX PLANE - NIGHT

Chuck is semi-conscious and bleeding from the head.  John
pulls the inflators on Chuck's life jacket, which fills with
a WHOOSH!, sending Chuck's arms out to the sides.  Al
struggles with the LIFE RAFT.  It's all blurred, frantic,
terrifying.

EXT.  PACIFIC - NIGHT - MOMENTS LATER

The plane hits the ocean with a CRASH and a WAVE of water.

INT.  GLOBAL OPERATIONS CENTER - MOMENTS LATER

The Controller is speaking mechanically into the microphone.

                     CONTROLLER
          Guam, I need a fix on Jumbo 14.

EXT.  PACIFIC - NIGHT

Shrouded with fog and surrounded by debris, the tail of the
big plane slowly SINKS beneath the angry, storm-driven waves.

EXT.  PACIFIC - DAY

A life raft is tossed on dark, storm-driven seas.  Inside it,
semi-conscious, Chuck hangs on.

EXT.  PACIFIC - NIGHT

We catch glimpses of the yellow lift raft in the dark as the
storm continues.

EXT.  BEACH - EARLY MORNING

The storm has ended.  Waves lap gently on a beach cut like a
scallop out of a rocky shore.  On the beach we see scattered
FEDEX BOXES.  And we see, face-down, half-buried in sand, a
MAN IN A SUIT and a life jacket.

Chuck.

The tide gently rocks him, laps at his face.  He chokes.
Slowly he gets to his knees.  Vomits seawater, big heaves.
He rolls over, sits down.  Dazed.  Still confused.  Where am
I?  What happened?

Chuck's first instinct is to check the time.  He looks at his
watch, taps it in frustration.

Then he looks around, and we look with him.

CHUCK'S POV - BEACH

The fog has thinned.  We can see palm groves and mangrove
thickets leading back into a thickly wooded valley climbing
up a steep, rocky hillside.  The rocks on the opposite point
end in a barren ridge.  Clouds hide the top of the hill.

ON CHUCK

as he takes in his surroundings.  He licks his lips.  He's
thirsty.  But something he sees is even more important.  We
stay with him as he WALKS.  He comes to a FEDEX PACKAGE in
the sand, picks it up, brushes off the sand, walks farther.
He picks up another package.

EXT.  BEACH - WIDE

Chuck walks down the beach, picking up FedEx packages,
leaving a trail of footprints in the sand.  Ahead of him we
notice a package decorated with ANGEL WINGS.

EXT.  BEACH - LATER THAT MORNING

Chuck has made a neat stack of FedEx boxes under some palm
trees at the rim of the beach.  He examines the Angel Wing
drawing with passing curiosity, then puts it on the stack.

Chuck takes off his life jacket, sits down in the shade,
makes himself comfortable, and waits.

EXT.  BEACH - SUNSET

Chuck is still waiting.  He's a systems man, and the system
isn't working.

                     CHUCK
          All right, guys.  I'm here.  Check the
          GPS, get moving.

EXT.  BEACH - NIGHT

The full moon shines a ghostly light on the beach.  Trees
cast moon-shadows on the sand.  Chuck seems very, very alone.

We HEAR from the dark thickets a STRANGE NOISE.  Rustling in
the leaves.  Something crashing in the trees, or is it a
wave?  A jolt of adrenaline courses through Chuck's body.  He
lurches to his feet.

We HEAR the noises again.  Chuck edges toward the rocks at
the barb of the hook.  Keeping his eye on the thicket, he
bends down and picks up a stone.  His first weapon.

In the rocks he finds a piece of driftwood.  He picks it up
in his other hand.  He backs between two rocks and stands
facing the thicket, every sense alert.  A cloud passes over
the moon.  The shadow streaks across Chuck's anxious face.

EXT.  BEACH - MORNING

The morning TIDE is coming in.  We follow the tide as it laps
amidst the rocks and finds Chuck, staring out to sea.  The
empty sea.

                     CHUCK
          Where the fuck are you?

But now he is really thirsty.  We WALK with Chuck up the
beach.

Beneath the palms he sees a couple of coconuts.  He picks one
of them up and studies it.  It's heavy, almost the size of a
volleyball.  How to get in it?

He throws it down on a rock.  The coconut just bounces off.
He wedges the coconut between two rocks, then throws a rock
down on it.  It bounces off.  He throws down a bigger rock.
It smashes on the rocks and chips.  Chuck picks up the rock.
OW!  Where the rock had chipped the edge is sharp.  It cuts
him.

                     CHUCK
          Sonofabitch.

The blood stains the rock a bright red.  Chuck sucks on his
finger, then he gets an idea -- the same idea primitive man
first got when he discovered stone tools.

He picks up the rock, test the edge.  Sharp -- really sharp.
He throws another rock down, but it doesn't break.  He picks
up another rock and strikes the first one.  Then again,
harder.  And again.  A large flake shoots off.  This edge is
even sharper.

He has a knife.

OPENING THE COCONUT - SERIES OF SHOTS

Chuck uses the stone knife to saw at the coconut.  No luck.

Chuck clumsily sharpens a stick with the sharp rock.

Chuck brings the sharpened stick down hard on the coconut,
but the stick slides off, sending the coconut rolling away.

Chuck positions the stick, pointed end up, in a hole, then
SLAMS the coconut down hard on it.  Success!  The green nut
of the coconut splits.  The brown inner nut is free!  He
smashes the nut with a rock, but -- OW!  -- he hits his hand!
Chuck licks his fingers, but he is so thirsty there's no more
saliva.  He smashes again.  The shell breaks to smithereens.
Coconut milk splashes everywhere.

                     CHUCK
          That was smart, really smart.

Rotating a nut along its axis and carefully moving his
fingers out of the way, he SMASHES the nut again.  The shell
splits!  The precious liquid splashes out.  Left inside is a
swallow or two, which Chuck laps up eagerly.  The milky white
liquid dribbles down his face.

                     CHUCK
          Ahhh.

EXT.  BEACH - SUNRISE

Chuck squints at the ocean.  His sunburn is bad -- his lips
are cracked.  A stack of broken coconut shells is beside him.
No one's there -- again.

                     CHUCK
          Maybe the GPS malfunctioned.  That Korean
          airliner did.

Clouds scud in front of the sun.  Beyond the reef the waves
are high and churning.  Chuck can see them pound onto the
reef.

                     CHUCK
          Okay, do the math.  Maybe they know where
          you are within, say 500 miles.  That's a
          circle with an area of, uh, pi r squared.
          So, uh, 250,000 times three point one
          four, that's about 800,000 square miles.
          Three times the size of Texas.

This sinks in.  Then Chuck gets an idea.

                     CHUCK
          They could use a satellite.

But even that doesn't give him much hope.

                     CHUCK
          Say each satellite photo is 30 feet
          square, that's uh...fuck it...billions
          and billions of photos.

That sinks in.

                     CHUCK
          Aw, someone will come.

EXT.  BEACH - NIGHT

Chuck sleeps by the coconuts.  The tide is coming in.  Chuck
stirs, gets up, staggers over to a palm tree to relieve
himself.

He stares idly out at the moonlight on the waves.  Then not
so idly.  Something's out there, something floating on the
tide.

                     CHUCK
          What the hell?

EXT.  BEACH - MOMENTS LATER

Chuck splashes into the gentle surf, reaches the dark object.

It's a body.  Chuck turns it over.  It's Al, one of the
pilots, his face gray and waterlogged and very dead.

                     CHUCK
          Oh Jesus.

EXT.  BEACH - MOMENTS LATER

Chuck drags the body up on the beach and then collapses,
exhausted.  He sits by it, staring at it.

                     CHUCK
          I'm so sorry, Al.  So sorry.

EXT.  BEACH - MORNING   

Chuck has almost finished a grave in the sand back of the
palm trees.  He's been digging with a piece of driftwood
sharpened with his stone knife.

He drags the body into the pit.  Stares down at it.  That
could be me.

                     CHUCK
          Got to cover Al up.

He wants to say more, can't.  He scoops some sand over the
body.

                     CHUCK
          Got to cover Al up.

He scoops in some more sand.  It's eerily like burying the
tropical fish in his back yard.

EXT.  BEACH - LATER

With a rock Chuck hammers a crude driftwood marker into the
sand.

EXT.  BEACH - LATER THAT DAY

As Chuck sits on the beach, he half-sings, half-talks "Yellow
Submarine" very quietly to himself.

                     CHUCK
          We all live in a yellow submarine, yellow
          submarine...

He looks over at the deep woods and down to the rocky point.
Comes to a decision.  He takes a drink of coconut, picks up
his club and a coconut, sticks the stone knife in his pants.
He's ready to go.

EXT.  BEACH - DAY - MOMENTS LATER

Chuck climbs over the rocks and disappears out of sight.
He's still half-singing to himself.

                     CHUCK
          Yellow submarine.  We all live in a
          yellow submarine...

EXT.  ISLAND - DAY - MOMENTS LATER

Chuck's way is blocked by rocks and jungle.  He hesitates.
He picks up a rock and THROWS IT to scare away all those bad
things.  It crashes into the ferns and palm trees.  He takes
a step into the jungle.

EXT.  JUNGLE - MINUTES LATER

Chuck struggles through a dense thicket beneath a jungle
canopy.  Vines and creepers reach out toward him.  There is
no path, nothing to show him where to go.

EXT.  JUNGLE - HALF HOUR LATER

Chuck climbs through a tangle of vines and ferns.  He takes a
drink from the coconut he is carrying.  The last drink.

                     CHUCK
          Bad idea.  Should have saved some.

He throws away the husk.  He looks up, but the only sunlight
reaching him is dappled from the canopy above him.

EXT.  ISLAND - MOMENTS LATER

Chuck emerges onto a ridge that leads to a summit.  He climbs
across a rocky lava field covered with scrub lichen and low
ferns, soil dark as coffee beans, his way crossed by steep
gullies that cut like dark fingers into the lava.

The lava field narrows, forcing Chuck closer to the sea.  He
passes a series of CAVES, their mouths dark and mysterious
and scary.  He gives them a wide berth.

EXT.  ISLAND - CLIFF - MOMENTS LATER

The land narrows to a ledge that stretches across a high
cliff perched over the ocean.  Beyond this rock bridge the
path smoothes out to a summit.

Chuck stares at the narrow bridge, then down at the waves
breaking on the rocks far below.  To get any view, he will
have to cross the bridge.  He's thirsty.  The late afternoon
sun is hot.

                     CHUCK
          Other than that, Mrs. Lincoln, how did
          you enjoy the play?

Hugging the wall of the cliff, taking each step with great
caution, he sets out across the bridge.

EXT.  ISLAND - CLIFF

Step by step, Chuck negotiates the narrow bridge.  He reaches
a flume of polished basalt which cuts across the ledge like a
slide in a water park -- except this flume ends high above
the waves.  Chuck tries to step across it, can't quite, tries
one foot first, then the other.

                     CHUCK
          Shit!

He looks back, but that seems even scarier.

                     CHUCK
          Got to get there.  Got to see.  C'mon...
          c'mon.  Don't be such a wuss.  Be bold.

He looks down at the ocean beneath him, closes his eyes, and
jumps.  It's only a few feet, but he's breathing hard when he
lands on the other side.  He hugs the rocks, getting his
breath.

EXT.  ISLAND SUMMIT - SUNSET - MOMENTS LATER

Chuck looks to each point on the compass.  He is on an
ISLAND, small, inhospitable, without sign of habitation or
anything human.  On three sides the waves break against
steep, hostile cliffs.  A reef encloses the cove where he
came from.

                     CHUCK
          No way on.  No way off.

Chuck stares out to sea in every direction.  Nothing.

                     CHUCK
          This is bad.  Really, really bad.

The last rays of sun hit his face.  The ocean turns a deep
reddish gold.

EXT.  CLIFF - MOMENTS LATER

Going down is even scarier.  It's dusk and the light is flat
and gray.  Chuck stares at the ledge.

                     CHUCK
          Come on.  Crawl if you have to.

Chuck crawls on his hands and knees across the rock bridge.

EXT.  ROCKY SLOPE - MOMENTS LATER

Chuck stumbles over the rocks.  The caves look ominous and
primal.

EXT.  EDGE OF JUNGLE - NIGHT

It's getting dark now.  The jungle seems impenetrable, the
dark wood of fable.  Chuck hesitates, then plunges into it.

EXT.  JUNGLE - NIGHT MINUTES LATER

The moon has just begun to rise, casting eerie light into the
jungle.  The shadows reach out to grab Chuck, then real
branches and vines tug at him.  He heads into thick
blackness.

EXT.  BEACH - NIGHT - LATER

Chuck emerges around the rocks.  He reaches the stack of
familiar FedEx boxes -- Ahh, home!  He's breathing hard, from
both fear and exertion.

                     CHUCK
          Got to drink.  Got to drink something.

With his last strength he opens a coconut on the stick.  He
bangs hard on the shell and gulps down the milk.  He stares
at the stack of FedEx boxes.  What could be inside?  He
reaches out and touches one.

                     CHUCK
          They don't belong to you.

Responsibility gets the better of necessity, and he takes his
hand away.

EXT.  BEACH - MORNING

Face red from the sun, Chuck hacks at a palm frond with his
stone knife.  He saws the palm frond off near the base,
leaving it about a foot long.

                     CHUCK
          Got to have shade.  Got to have a hat.

He ties the loose fibers into a sort of circle, then sets it
upon his head.  It looks amazingly like some sort of
primitive cap.

He grabs a couple of FedEx boxes and heads for the beach.

EXT.  BEACH - LATER

Chuck finishes the P on H E L P, which he has spelled out
with the FedEx boxes on the beach.

EXT.  JUNGLE - DAY - LATER

Chuck scrambles down a ravine.  He kneels down and feels the
ground.  It is dry, completely dry.

EXT.  LAVA SLOPE - DAY

Chuck traverses the slope, determined to find water.

A FLAT ROCK - LATER

With a puddle of dirty water trapped in a tiny hollow.
Suddenly Chuck flops down into frame.  He tries to scoop up
some water in his hands, but he just splashes it around.  He
licks his fingers.  Then he gets down on his stomach and laps
up the water with his tongue.  Like an animal.

In the bottom of the small depression is some fine mud.  He
rubs it on his reddened face and across his burned lips.

                     CHUCK
          Oh, God.  Thank you.

EXT.  BEACH - NIGHT

Chuck lies in darkness, his eyes reflecting the moon.

EXT.  JUNGLE - DAY

Chuck is drenched in sweat.  He is at the bottom of a hole
six feet deep.  He takes one last dig with the flat stick,
then licks the moist clay that sticks to it.

EXT.  BEACH - DAY

Chuck breaks open another coconut and gulps down the milky
liquid.  With a stone knife he digs in the shell for some of
the meat, but it's dry and chewy and fibrous.  He spits it
out, then lies back on the sand and stares at the first
stars.  Half sings to himself.

                     CHUCK
          You deserve a break today...

He is desperately thirsty.  Hunger gnaws at him.

EXT.  BEACH - DAY - LATER

Holding a sharpened stick, Chuck wades in the shallows at low
tide, looking for fish.  It's difficult to keep his balance.
Suddenly a shadow flashes by, glinting in the morning
sunlight.  Chuck hurls the spear, which ricochets off the
water and floats away.

Chuck plunges into the water after the fish with his bare
hands.  The fish reverses direction.  Chuck leaps after it
and goes under.  He comes up spluttering, on his hands and
knees in the shallows.

Suddenly a whole school of fish swims by him, moving in
unison, like one creature, splitting around Chuck like
mercury.  He grabs at them desperately.  Nothing.

                     CHUCK
          Damn fish!

On some rocks he sees clusters of limpets.  He takes a rock
and tries to dislodge one, but it smashes into a soggy mess.

EXT.  BEACH - DAY

Discouraged, he sits down on the beach and gets his breath.

Idly, Chuck takes out his wallet.  The money is soaked.  He
lays it out to dry.  He finds a PHOTOGRAPH OF KELLY, soaked
and mushy.

He tries to smooth it out.  For a moment he is overcome.  His
face tightens, his eyes get moist.  He stares out to sea.

                     CHUCK
          Wait a minute.  Wait just a minute.

He picks up his wallet again and takes out a credit card.

EXT.  BEACH - MINUTES LATER

Chuck wades in the water, stops by a rock covered with
limpets.  He uses a CREDIT CARD to scrape off a limpet.

                     CHUCK
          Don't leave home without it.

With his finger, he prods around in the mucous-like meat,
then tilts up the shell and we see the gooey gray stuff slide
off the shell into his mouth.

                     CHUCK
          Yuck.

He starts to spit it out.  Tries to make himself like it.

                     CHUCK
          Yumm.

And he swallow it.

EXT.  BEACH - SUNSET

Chuck sits in the shade of a palm tree surrounded by a pile
of smashed coconut husks and a stack of limpet shells.  He
checks his watch for a moment.

                     CHUCK
          Got to get this fixed.

But what's the point?  Everything that was so valuable before
is useless now.

EXT.  JUNGLE - LATER

Chuck digs yet another hole.  He chants to himself, almost
delusionally.

                     CHUCK
          Water, water, everywhere, water, water
          everywhere...

Covered in sweat, desperate and exhausted, he throws down his
wooden spade.

                     CHUCK
          Where's the water on this fucking island?

He lies on his back, breathing hard.  Pulls his hat over his
eyes.

                     CHUCK
          Just rest a minute.

EXT.  JUNGLE - DAY - LATER

Chuck is lying in the hole.  We find his feet.  Slowly water
is oozing out of the clay, a puddle is building around his
toes.

EXT.  JUNGLE - DAY - LATER

Chuck's eyes snap awake.  He looks down at his feet.  There's
a pool of muddy water there.  He dips his hand in it, touches
a finger to his lips to be sure he's not dreaming.

He grabs his sharpened stone, begins to attack the clay.

                     CHUCK
          Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah.

EXT.  BEACH - SUNSET

Chuck carefully makes marks on a palm tree with his rock
knife.  One for each day.  Very neat.  Very precise.  Very
Chuck.

                     CHUCK
          Let's see, I waited two days.
               (makes marks)
          Then I buried Al.
               (slowly makes another mark)
          Al.  You never made it home, buddy.  Then
          American Express got me those clam
          things...
               (makes another mark)
          I dug all those damn holes, the clouds
          over the moon...
               (makes more marks)
          And today, the historic discovery of H,
          Two, Oh.
               (makes a tenth mark and
                underlines it)
          Ten days.  Shit.

For a moment, he feels the weight of his isolation.  Then he
allows himself a deep breath.  There is order now, after all.
Time is under control.

EXT.  CLIFF - DAY

Very carefully, but standing this time, Chuck makes his way
across the ledge.

EXT.  SUMMIT - DAY

He emerges on the top, takes a drink from a hand-made
canteen, and looks in all directions.  Again, he sees nothing
but ocean.

EXT.  BEACH - DAY

He resumes his efforts at fishing.  A shape scuttles raggedly
beneath him.

                     CHUCK
          A crab, it's a crab.

He freezes, holding his spear motionless.  Then he jabs at
the crab -- misses!  The crab scurries away toward the rocks.

                     CHUCK
          Dammit!

Chuck splashes after it, stabbing as he goes, falling,
getting up, stabbing again.

Suddenly one stab feels different.  Chuck carefully lifts up
the spear.  On the end is a squirming crab.

                     CHUCK
          I did it.  I did it!

He walks carefully with it to the beach.  Lowering the spear,
he lets the crab slip off.  It darts toward the water.  Chuck
heads it off, trying to avoid the snapping claws.

He kicks it back toward the beach, then slams a rock down on
it.  He twists off a crab claw, expecting to see flaky white
meat.  But a crab has an exoskeleton.  The flesh simply pours
out, like mucous.

                     CHUCK
          Jesus.

This is too much.  He needs the next step, from the raw to
the cooked.  The crucial next step from primitive man to the
beginnings of civilization.

EXT.  PALM GROVE SERIES OF SHOTS - TRYING TO MAKE FIRE

Chuck rubs two sticks together.  Nothing.

Chuck positions a makeshift drill in a hole he has scooped
out in a piece of driftwood.  He spins the drill with great
effort.  Nothing.

                     CHUCK
          Stupid fucking thing!

He quits, exhausted.  He looks at his hands.  They are raw
and blistered.  He feels like Job.

                     CHUCK
          I don't know what I did, God, but
          whatever is was, I am really, really
          sorry.  You hear me?  Really sorry.

EXT.  BEACH - DAY

Chuck emerges from the jungle and walks to the edge of the
ocean.  He dips his blistered hands into the sea water, then
looks over at the FedEx boxes that spell out H E L P.

                     CHUCK
          Don't have a choice, do I?

He walks over and picks a few boxes up from the P.

EXT.  PALM GROVE - DAY

With his stone knife and spear to help him.  Chuck begins to
open the FedEx boxes.  Chuck rips open the end of one box and
shakes it.  Out tumble some videotapes.  Chuck looks at them:
what good are they?

Chuck tears another box open.  Out slide some legal papers
covered with Post-its.

In quick cuts, we see him dump out computer memory boards,
some designer dresses, flowers, a pair of roller blades, a
script with a red cover -- which he never reads.

EXT.  BEACH - LATER

By now he has taken all the boxes in the P.  Only H E L
remains.  He pauses to let the irony of that sink in, then
collects more boxes.  He is even more exhausted.

EXT.  PALM GROVE

Two boxes remain.  One is the box with Angel Wings.  Chuck
sets it aside.  He opens the other box.  Out tumbles a
DOCTOR'S BAG.  Chuck can't believe it.  He opens the bag.
It's full of great stuff.  Medicine.  A scalpel.  A saw.

                     CHUCK
          Okay.  Okay now.

EXT.  PALM GROVE - LATER

Hands bandaged, Chuck tries to strike a spark on the roller
blade wheel housing.  Tries over and over.  Nothing.

He takes a long drink from his canteen, and flinches.  His
tooth is starting to hurt.  He fishes some Tylenol out of the
surgeon's bag and takes two.

EXT.  OTHER SIDE OF ISLAND - DAY

Chuck picks some berries and gingerly tries them.  They're
not bad.  He eats more.  Then more.  What a relief.

EXT.  BEACH - NIGHT

Chuck lies on his palm fronds, groaning and holding his
stomach.  He drags himself to his knees, crawls a few feet,
and throws up in great, violent heaves.

EXT.  BEACH - DAY

Still looking a little green, Chuck marks another day on his
tree calendar.

EXT.  SUMMIT

He stares out to sea.  Nothing.

EXT.  WELL - DAY

Chuck lies on his belly and drinks from the well, which has
filled with water.  Then he washes his face and splashes
water over his neck.  The surface of the well stills,
bringing CHUCK'S REFLECTION into focus.  He stares at
himself.

Very carefully Chuck shaves with the surgeon's scalpel.

Chuck checks out his new appearance in the water.  Much
better.  A clean start now.

EXT.  BEACH - LATER THAT DAY

He sits in front of his failed efforts to make fire.

                     CHUCK
          You're not getting it hot enough.  Got to
          hold the heat.  Got to hold the heat.

EXT.  BEACH - LATER

Chuck carefully shaves some tinder.  Puts it under a piece of
bamboo split lengthwise with a notch cut across it.

EXT.  BEACH - LATER

Chuck uses a bamboo stick to try to make friction in the
split half of the bamboo.  He saws back and forth with all
his might, pressing it down in the groove.

EXT.  BEACH - LATER

Chuck gives one last saw with his bamboo and stops, utterly
defeated.  It's all too much.

                     CHUCK
          Sonofabitch!

He starts to rub again.  He breathes hard, sweat pours off
his face.  He is really going for it, what the hell!  A tiny
wisp of smoke appears!  Chuck saws with even more energy.

                     CHUCK
          Come on.  Come on.

The smoke increases.  Chuck rips away the bamboo, grabs the
nest of shavings, and blows on it frantically.  The smoke
flickers and dies.  Chuck can't believe it.

                     CHUCK
          No.  No.  No.

EXT.  BEACH - NIGHT

Chuck lies in his bed of palm fronds, shivering.  He looks up
at the stars, which blaze furiously.

                     CHUCK
          That's the big dipper...Orion...or is
          that the Southern Cross...?  Kelly would
          know.

And he misses her so much.  A shower of meteors streaks
across the sky, as if the very heavens are raining down on
Chuck.

EXT.  BEACH - DAY

Chuck readies his two sticks of bamboo again and begins
sawing with tremendous energy.  He smells something.  Is it
smoke?  He pulls off the log and looks eagerly at the nest of
tinder.  There's nothing there.

                     CHUCK
          Dammit!

He replaces the log and starts wearily to saw again.

TIME CUT

The sun has moved in the sky.  Chuck is still sawing.  Again
the smoke appears.  Again sweat pours from his face.  The
smoke increases.  He saws even harder.  His breath comes in
anguished gulps.  Smoke is curling up now.  Chuck tears away
the bamboo, picks up the nest of kindling, and blows on it
gently.  The smoke increases.

He blows some more.  A fragile crimson spark appears.

                     CHUCK
          Careful now, careful...

He gently places the nest of shavings in the kindling, then
blows on it with utmost care, as if he were holding life
itself.  He shreds his money and business cards over the tiny
flame.

Suddenly, the evening breeze lifts the nest out of the
kindling.  Desperate, Chuck grabs it.  Trying to shield it
with his body, he grabs some palm fronds and jams them into
the sand, trying to make a windbreak.  They rustle and shake
and blow over.

The wind blows harder.  Chuck jams some rocks in a circle to
make an eddy.  But the fire is out.  No words now, just a
loud, primal groan of pure despair.

And then, into his vision floats...smoke.

Chuck looks down.  A wisp of smoke curls up from the nest of
tinder!  Chuck blows on it gently.  Suddenly a tiny tongue of
flame flickers and catches on the kindling!

                     CHUCK
          Yes!  Yes!  Yes!

He feeds in some more twigs, more tinder.  The flames lick
out, catch, grow.

                     CHUCK
          If I ever forgot to thank you God, and I
          am sure I did, thank you now.

EXT.  BEACH - WIDE - NIGHT

The fire burns on the beach.  Chuck rushes about, piling on
driftwood.

EXT.  BEACH - CLOSER

Chuck darts into the jungle and returns dragging a huge log.
He throws it on the fire.  We see his face in the light of
the fire.  He is exultant.  He dances.  He sings at the top
of his lungs.  Papa-ooo-mow-mow!

Chuck throws another huge log on the fire.  Papa-papa-papa-
oooo!  The log splutters and explodes, sending up a huge
shower of sparks that climb and sparkle in the
darkness...until they merge with the stars.

EXT.  PALM GROVE - MORNING

Chuck makes a mark on the tree.  Around it he carves a flame
-- the day he mastered fire.

EXT.  PALM GROVE - LATER THAT MORNING

Chuck sharpens his spear with his stone knife.  Then he
sticks it in the flame to harden it, pulls it out, checks it,
scrapes some more.

EXT.  BEACH - DAY

Chuck wades in the water with his spear.  Suddenly he stabs
it down.  A crab is on the end.

EXT.  BEACH - HALF HOUR LATER

Chuck removes a crab from out of the fire and breaks a
steaming crab claw.  Chuck takes a bite of the flaky white
meat.  Ahhh.  It tastes great.  He takes another bite -- and
flinches.

                     CHUCK
          Damn tooth!

He fumbles for his Tylenol and takes two pills.

EXT.  SUMMIT - SUNSET

Chuck stands on the summit, looking in all directions.  Then,
something on the island brings Chuck's eyes back from their
distant focus on the horizon.  From down on the beach,
beneath the palm grove, there curls a thin column of smoke.
Chuck lets a bit of pride creep into his face as he sees it.
He kneels down and begins to build a signal fire.

EXT.  BEACH - NIGHT - LATER

Chuck curls up in his bed of palm fronds.  The fire burns.
Around it is a large stack of crab shells.  He stares into
the fire.

EXT.  PALM GROVE - MORNING

Chuck makes another mark on the tree.  He has circled the
tree with marks several times now.

EXT.  BEACH - DAY

Using a safety pin and some suturing thread, Chuck fishes
carefully.  Suddenly he jerks his hand back.  On the end is a
flopping fish.

EXT.  PALM GROVE - DAY

Chuck takes a cooked fish off the fire and mixes it with some
breadfruit.  He eats the soft mixture, chewing carefully, but
his tooth hurts even worse.  There are only a few Tylenol
tablets left.  He carefully cuts one in half and swallows it.

EXT.  SUMMIT - AFTERNOON

Chuck arrives with the wood for the night.  He stares out to
sea as usual, but this time he sees something different.

WHALES.  He sees whales.  Leaping.  Broaching.  Spouting.
Water pouring off fins and flukes.  Moving.  Going somewhere.

                     CHUCK
          Beautiful.  So beautiful.

Chuck stares at them, stares until the ocean darkens and he
can see them no more.  It's late now.

Leaving, he takes one last look, as he always does.  And
another remarkable sight greets his eyes.  There, on the
horizon, just below the evening star, is a...LIGHT.  He
stares at it, fixed.

                     CHUCK
          A star.  It's a star.

But then he stares at it really hard.

                     CHUCK
          It's a ship.

EXT.  WOODS - TREE - NEXT DAY

A tree shakes and moves, quivers...

                     CHUCK
          Timberrr!

...then slowly falls with a CRASH!

                     CHUCK
          I heard that...

Chuck holds his surgeon's saw over the stump.  He walks to
another tree and begins to saw his way into the trunk.

EXT.  BEACH - SERIES OF SHOTS

Up above the high tide line, Chuck lashes a log to a row of
five logs already joined with vines.

                     CHUCK
          No more waiting.  Take action.

Chuck sews several designer dresses together with needle and
suturing thread for a sail.

                     CHUCK
          That's right.  Take action.

He cuts bamboo for the mast.  He carves driftwood for an oar.

He fills gourds with water, stores breadfruit and coconut as
he sings "Fly Me to the Moon" to himself.

He ties the sail to the mast and extends it with a bamboo
boom lashed on with palm fiber and video tape.  He ties on
the doctor's kit and the FedEx box with the angel wings.

He examines his handiwork:  a finished raft.

He brings out his old life preserver and puts it on, then
grabs hold of one corner of the raft to pull it down to the
beach.  It doesn't budge.  He tries to pull it again.
Nothing.  He leans his back into it and pushes with his legs.
Nothing.  He collapses on the beach, his breath coming in
heaves.

                     CHUCK
          How could I be so stupid?

He bangs himself on the head, over and over.

                     CHUCK
          Stupid, stupid, stupid.

EXT.  PALM GROVE - NIGHT

Chuck throws new firewood on the dwindling fire.  It comes
back to life.  Meteors streak again across the sky.  He
stares at the indifferent stars.  The moon is almost full.
Shadows of palm trees sway on the sand.

EXT.  BEACH - NIGHT

Chuck stands by the edge of the water, which shimmers in the
reflected light of the fire.  A wave come in, licks at his
toes.  Lifts up a coconut husk, sweeps it gently out.  Chuck
watches, gets an idea.

EXT.  BEACH - NIGHT

He begins to dig in the sand by the raft.  He grabs the oar
and digs faster, making a trench up to where the raft is.

EXT.  BEACH - MORNING

The rising tide floods water into the trench.  Chuck rocks
the raft back and forth.  It floats!  As the wave recedes, it
takes the raft with it.  Chuck has to run beside it.

CHUCK TRYING TO ESCAPE - MONTAGE

Over and over, we see Chuck capsize at the reef.  The first
time he has a bandage on his leg.  He tries everything --
different rafts, different approaches, but each time the
ocean spits him back.

EXT.  LAGOON - DAY

Defeated and utterly exhausted, Chuck swims back from his
latest failure.  He wades back ashore with the FedEx box and
throws it on the ground by the palm tree.  He has tried so
hard to escape, so incredibly hard, done everything humanly
possible and beyond.  He rips off his life preserver, throws
it into the underbrush, then collapses on the beach.

                     CHUCK
          You're too low in the water.  Too damn
          low.

Chuck's shoulders begin to shake, as he is racked with deep
sobs of despair.

And then he throws his head back and lets forth, from deep
inside himself, a SCREAM of rage and anger and pain.  The
Scream pierces the indifferent natural sounds of the island,
the rustling of the breeze, the lulling rhythm of the waves.
It is powerful, disturbing, primal.

The breeze picks up.  Behind Chuck, the palm trees begin to
sway.  The tide is reaching up toward the beach.  The waves
crash louder.  The palm trees sway even more.

Chuck picks up some wet sand and rubs it on his body.

                     CHUCK
          Dust thou art -- that's for damned sure
          -- and unto dust shalt thou return.

A few DROPS OF RAIN begin to fall, splashing on Chuck and
sizzling in the fire.

Chuck looks up:  clouds have obscured the sun.  The wind
blows harder.  The rain falls harder, streaking the sand
Chuck had rubbed on his body.  STEAM sizzles out of the fire.

Chuck looks up, disbelieving.  The bottom falls out of the
heavens -- monsoon rain, more rain than you have ever seen
before.  A long wave rolls up, its frothy fingers reaching
for the fire.

Forget the raft!  Forget despair!  The fire could go out!
This is disaster!

                     CHUCK
          Shit!

He springs into action.  Chuck grabs an empty FedEx box.
With his wooden shovel he frantically SCOOPS SOME COALS out
of the fire as the rain HISSES and POUNDS at them.  He slides
the coals into the FedEx box, grabs some sticks of driftwood
and sets off on a run.

EXT.  WOODS - DAY

Chuck runs through the woods, slipping and stumbling.  Vines
grab at him.  The rain is so thick he can hardly see.

EXT.  WOODS - MINUTES LATER

Chuck bursts out of the woods into the lava field.  Smoke
pours out of the FedEx box.  The coals are about to burn
through!

EXT.  LAVA FIELD - MOMENTS LATER

Chuck stumbles up the slippery rocks, dragging the smoking
box.  His face is drenched, desperate.

EXT.  CAVE - DAY - MINUTES LATER

Chuck tumbles into the cave just as the coals burn through
the FedEx box.

Using the remains of the box, he desperately tries to scoot
the coals into a dry spot.

One by one, THE PRECIOUS COALS GO OUT.

Dripping water off his hands and face, he pushes a few
together with his fingers, ignoring the burns.

                     CHUCK
          Please...please...please...

He stomps on the driftwood and saws at it with his knife.  He
places this kindling on the coals.  They sputter and sizzle.
Barely catch.  He fans them with the box.  A tiny flicker
catches, then starts to grow.

                     CHUCK
          Firewood.  I need firewood.

SERIES OF SHOTS

On the beach, Chuck desperately gathers more firewood in the
driving monsoon.  He can barely see.  Driven by the storm,
the waves are licking at the palm grove.

He runs through the woods.  Branches whip at his face.  Roots
tear at his feet, tripping him.

He stumbles up the lava field.  Sliding.  Struggling.  Barely
able to breathe, the rain is so strong.

INT.  CAVE - DAY

He dumps the firewood on the floor of the cave.  But where
the fire had flickered, there is only a pile of wet black
ashes.

THE FIRE IS OUT.

INT.  CAVE - NIGHT

Chuck lies on the floor of the cave, shivering in the
darkness as the rain falls.  His fire is out, his tooth is
killing him, he can't escape.

EXT.  CAVE - NEXT DAY

Chuck emerges from the cave.  The rain has stopped.  This is
the absolute lowest.  His face reflects his pain and despair.
He's trapped.  It's hopeless.  Everything he tried to build
is gone.

EXT.  LEDGE - DAY

Chuck slowly walks out on the ledge.  He stares down at the
waves breaking on the jagged rocks far below.

He lets go one hand.  Then lets go the other.  He is barely
balanced.  It looks like a wisp of breeze would blow him
right off.  He slides one foot to the very lip of the
precipice.

Suddenly his foot slips!

Instinctively he turns into the cliff, grabs for a hold!  One
hand reaches for a nubbing of rock, slips off!  The other
closes, his fingers straining to hold him.

He breathes in deep gasps.  He had wanted to end it, come so
close.

                     CHUCK
          What the fuck are you doing?

His deepest instinct was to survive.  And that is what he is
going to do.

                     CHUCK
          Hang on.  Just hang on.

Slowly he pulls himself back from the edge.

EXT.  BEACH - LATER

Chuck walks aimlessly down the beach, feeling the burden of
starting over.  The beach is littered with seaweed and
flotsam, bits of rope, plastic bottles.  He picks up a
plastic bottle.  That will come in handy.

The Chuck sees a SOCCER BALL with "Wilson" stamped on it in
big black letters.

He picks it up, holds it, tosses it up in the air.  Then he
kicks it, then kicks it again, then runs down the beach,
trying to kick it and keep it out of the water.  Feeling joy
again, even here.

INT.  CAVE - THAT DAY

The sun is setting on his darkened cave.  The soccer ball
sits in the corner by the black cold ashes of what was once
his fire.

Chuck carves a bit of coconut meat, takes a bite and winces
as the meat hits his sore tooth.  He tosses the shell on a
small new pile of shells.

Chuck shakes out the last half Tylenol tablet.  He puts the
tablet in his mouth, then takes a sip out of his coconut
canteen.  When the water hits his tooth that hurts too.

INT.  CAVE - MORNING

Chuck mixes a mash of breadfruit and coconut.  He tries to
pack the tooth with the mash, but it's so sensitive that even
this hurts.  He pounds the floor of the cave in frustration.

INT.  CAVE - LATER

Chuck holds a stone chisel and his hammer stone.  He
positions the chisel against his inflamed tooth.  But the
thought of what he is about to do is too frightening.  He
lowers the chisel.

                     CHUCK
          Shit.  Shit.  Shit.

EXT.  BEACH - DAY

Chuck tries to fill his mouth with sea water.  The pain is so
great his eyes water.

                     CHUCK
          Whoo, pig.  Sooey!

He falls back in the water and floats there, looking up at
the sky.

INT.  CAVE - LATER

Determined, Chuck hold the stone chisel again.  He raises it
slowly to his mouth and picks up the hammer stone.

                     CHUCK
          No pain, no gain.

He brings the hammer down hard on the chisel!  The screen
goes BLACK as Chuck's SCREAM continues UNDER.

FADE IN:

EXT.  OCEAN - SUNRISE - THREE YEARS LATER

The sky takes on the first colors of the day.  The ocean is
still dark, but a few waves catch the first light.  The
sunrise touches the summit, moves down the cliff, then lights
the cove.  On the screen superimpose:

                     "1000 DAYS LATER"

REFLECTION - WATER

A spear shimmers in the calm morning water.  Attached to the
spear is a man, standing completely still.

ON CHUCK

We move up out of the reflection to the real man.  His legs
are scarred.  The remnants of a dress wrap around his middle.
A stone knife on a neatly mounted haft is stuck in a belt
made of videotape and woven fiber.  Necklaces of shark's
teeth and shells hang from his neck.  His hair is long.  A
coconut frond hat is on his head.

The hand wrapped around the spear is scarred and brown as a
berry.  It holds the spear perfectly still.  The watch is
gone.

We come around slowly until we see Chuck's face.  The eyes
say it all.  They stare out with a survivor's intensity,
staring at the water, unblinking.  This is the man who used
to splash futilely about in the water trying to fish.

This is the FedEx man who was plugged into the tumult of
activity and energy, surrounded by technology and human
activity at its most intense, devoted to making seconds
count.  Now he is utterly alone, and utterly still.

And now he has all the time in the world.

Suddenly, without an once of wasted motion, he shoots the
spear forward at a low angle.  It quivers, stuck on the
bottom.  He pulls it out with a practiced twist.  On the end
is a struggling fish.

But this isn't a thrill anymore.  It's another day at the
office.

EXT.  BEACH - LATER THAT DAY

Chuck makes a mark on a palm tree.  He has completely covered
three other trees with marks.  It sinks in how long he has
been here.

EXT.  JUNGLE - LATER

Chuck carries the fish back from the beach.  Now there is a
well-worn trail.

INT.  CAVE - THAT AFTERNOON

Chuck enters with the fish.  We are greeted with the well-
ordered lair of a primitive stone-age man.

Clam shell spirals weave in and out around the fire hole.
Strips of eel jerky and fish hang drying from racks.

Tools are lined up neatly:  digging sticks, stone hammers and
saws, spears neatly hafted onto shafts, drills, awls.  Bits
and pieces of feathers, skins, bones, rags, leaves -- are all
neatly arranged.  Strings and cords hang from hooks.  Coconut
bowls and cooking rocks form a small kitchen.  A raincoat and
rain-hat woven of palm fronds is neatly draped over a frame.

Evocative pieces of driftwood decorate the room.  A wind
chime of obsidian flakes sways gently.  The watch hangs on a
stick.

The Angel Box has the place of honor on one side.  On the
other side the Wilson soccer ball rests on a throne of rocks.
Seaweed has been placed on the ball as hair.  Clam shells
have been stuck on for eyes, other shells form a mouth.  A
tube shell and conch form a pipe.

INT.  CAVE - FIRE - NIGHT

The fish are being smoke under a palm frond.  Eel skins hang
from sticks, roasting.  Chuck sits by the fire, hafting a
stone knife onto a wooden haft.

He ties some fiber to a stick, then braids it into string,
using both hands and his mouth for the three strands.

He ties the string tightly around the shaft.  He does his
work automatically.

INT.  CAVE - NIGHT - LATER

Chuck eats some fish and some mashed breadfruit.  He chews
each bite, his eyes in distant focus.  The firelight flickers
on his face.

EXT.  CLIFF - SUNRISE

Chuck carries firewood up to the summit.  He mechanically
adds wood to the fire.  As he does so, something out to sea
catches his eye.  He stops and stands up.

CHUCK'S POV - WHALES

WHALES broach out past the rocky point.  Spouts of water
shoot into the air.

ON CHUCK

As he watches them, a light comes back into his eyes.  He
grins.  There's a big gap where his teeth had been.  He turns
and strides down the hill.

EXT.  CLIFF - MOMENTS LATER

He heads across the rock bridge that once had so terrified
him, without losing stride.  It's second nature now.

INT.  CAVE - MOMENTS LATER

Chuck enters the cave, picks up the ball and heads out.

EXT.  SUMMIT - EVENING

The signal fire burns.  A spectacular cloudy sunset lights up
the sky.  Chuck sits with Wilson on the summit, a bowl of
mashed breadfruit in one hand, a bowl of roasted eel skin in
another.

As Chuck watches the sunset unfold, watches the whales going
by in the darkened water, he takes some roasted eel chips,
dips them into the breadfruit paste, and offers one to
Wilson.  His voice is flat, monotonal.

                     CHUCK
          Chips?  Dip?

But Wilson declines.

                     CHUCK
          No?

He takes a big crunchy bite.

                     CHUCK
          Another fucking day in paradise.

PULL BACK as the sun goes down and Chuck reaches into the
bowl again and dips an eel skin chip in the dip.

EXT.  ROCKY LEDGE - NIGHT - LATER

Torch in one hand, Wilson in the other, Chuck walks across
the rocky ledge.  He passes the flume without even noticing.

Suddenly his shoe breaks!  It's sandal made of woven yucca
leaves.

He bends down and fixes it, then heads on down the ledge.

EXT.  LEDGE - MOMENTS LATER

Chuck makes a casual leap, a leap he has made hundreds of
times, but this time the sandal comes loose.  It catches on a
rock, and CHUCK FALLS!

His hands are cut and bruised.  He tries to get up, can't.
Chuck sits back and examines his foot.  His fingers come back
covered with blood.  He reaches out to steady himself, and
leaves a HANDPRINT OF BLOOD on the rock.

INT.  CAVE - LATER

Chuck wraps his foot in bandages.

INT.  CAVE - LATER

Chuck's face is sweaty.  He looks down at his foot.  It is
red, swollen, infected.  He stands up, tries to put some
weight on it.  The pain is intense.

Chuck sticks the scalpel onto some coals to sterilize it.  He
holds it over his foot, takes a breath, then jabs in into the
wound.  The pain is intense.  Chuck passes out.

INT.  CAVE - NIGHT

Chuck stirs, takes a drink, weakly tosses on another log, and
collapses back on the floor.

INT.  CAVE - DAY

Chuck wakes up, trembling, shaking, wet with sweat.  He
staggers up.  His shadow sways on the wall of the cave.  He
struggles to get another log on the fire.  He squints at his
only companion, the soccer ball.

                     CHUCK
          Help me, Wilson...

He collapses again.

INT.  CAVE - NIGHT

Chuck stirs and squints his eyes.  He takes a drink of water.
He is feeling better.  He puts another log on the fire and
slowly begins to chew on some breadfruit and dried fish.

EXT.  BEACH - LATER

Chuck slowly wades into the water, favoring his injured foot.
But something feels different.  He glances around.  What is
it?  And then he sees something, perhaps the worst possible
sight.

CHUCK'S POV - SAIL

A SAIL is moving steadily away from the island.

CHUCK

Throws down the spear and waves his arms.

                     CHUCK
          No!  Wait!  Come back!

He runs into the water and starts to swim.  He is so weak,
however, he can only make a few strokes.  He tries to yell as
he swims...

                     CHUCK
          Wait!  Wait!

Choking and weak, he turns back and drags himself up on the
beach.  In the b.g., the sail dwindles into the distance.

EXT.  SUMMIT - LATER

Chuck struggles to the top of the hill.  His fire has been
extinguished by the rain.  In the distance, far against the
horizon, he sees a sail -- or is it a cloud?  The whiteness
shimmers against the horizon.  Chuck squints.  Whatever it
was, it is gone.  Above him some contrails from jets mark the
sky.

Furious, he kicks his signal fire, scattering the burnt-out
coals.

EXT.  BEACH - LATER THAT DAY

Chuck makes a new mark on his calendar tree.  Then he stops.
He CUTS an angry big line under the last mark, then hacks
away at the palm tree, slashing it with the stone knife,
ripping and marking through all his dates.  Finally the stone
knife breaks in two.  Chuck drops the broken half and catches
his breath.

EXT.  CAVE - NIGHT

Chuck enters the cave.  No signal fires burn.  The island is
dark.

EXT.  SUMMIT - DAY

Chuck stands on the summit, staring out to sea.  Nothing, not
even a contrail, not even a whale spout.

EXT.  CLIFF - MOMENTS LATER

He is on his way down, suddenly he sees something and stops.
It's the HANDPRINT, the bloody handprint, his own handprint.

He slowly extends his hand and covers it, then pulls it away.
Traces it with his fingers.

INT.  CAVE - DAYS LATER

Chuck has the beginnings of an artist's studio.  Several
large clam shells hold paint.  A few egg shells are lined up.
Brushes have been made from roots and feathers.

Chuck covers his hand with paint and makes a handprint on the
wall of the cave.  He stands back and looks at it.

INT.  CAVE - DAY

He chews some berries, then holds his hand against the wall
of the cave and spits a dark blue mist around it.  When he
takes his hand away, the silhouette of his handprint remains.

INT.  CAVE - DAY

With the Angel Wing Box as a model, Chuck dips one of his
feather brushes in paint, and make a tentative line on the
wall of the cave.  He works hesitantly, rubs off a line,
tries again.

INT.  CAVE - NIGHT

Chuck is finishing his first figure, a crude portrait of a
man -- himself?  Hard to tell.  He examines his work.  He
takes some shells and sticks them on as eyes.

Chuck picks up Wilson, thinks.

                     CHUCK
          You old airhead, you need a makeover.

He takes some charcoal out of his fire and draws eyebrows on
the ball.  Then, he mashes some berries, dips his fingers in
the juice, and makes lips.  He sticks shells on with clay for
eyes.  Then he looks at the face.

                     CHUCK
          Wilson, you bad!

He sits back and regards his companion.  He gestures around
the cave at the new paintings.

                     CHUCK
          What do you think?

But Wilson doesn't have an opinion.

                     CHUCK
          You don't share much, do you?

Idly Chuck takes down the Angel Box.

                     CHUCK
          I guess I know how Kelly felt.

For a long time he studies the wings on it.  With a stick, he
tries to draw a similar wing on the dusty floor of the cave.
Dissatisfied, he wipes it away.  He looks at the Angel Box.

Casually he reaches over and cuts it open with a stone knife.
Inside he finds two bottles of green salsa.  And a letter.

He reads over it.

                     CHUCK
          You said our life was a prison.  Dull.
          Boring.  Empty.  I can't begin to tell
          you how much that hurt.  I don't want to
          lose you.  I'm enclosing some salsa, the
          verde you like.  Use it on your sticky
          rice and think of home.  Then come home
          -- to me.  We'll find the spice in our
          lives again.  Together.  I love you.
          Always.  Bettina.

Visibly moved, Chuck puts down the letter.

                     CHUCK
          He never got it.

EXT.  ISLAND - DAY

The monsoon pours down.  Wind whips the palm trees.  The
waves are gray and angry, tearing at the beach.

INT.  CAVE - DAY

As the rain pours down outside, Chuck studies the sodden,
ruined photograph of Kelly, which is really only a gray mess.

                     CHUCK
          She's probably found someone else.  I
          would have.

Chuck dips his finger into one of the bowls of colors and
streaks it slowly across his face.  To exorcise his
loneliness, he will paint on the most expressive canvas there
is:  his own body.

CHUCK PAINTING HIMSELF - MONTAGE

Close-up on scarred fingers, as they paint on Chuck's face
and body.  Color on skin.  Tight dramatic shots of Chuck
being transformed.

Chuck takes white paint and covers his hand.  Then he presses
it into his chest and makes a handprint.  He draws a yellow
spiral on his leg, then takes red and makes jagged lightning
bolts on his chest on either side of the hand.

WATER

Shimmers in a gourd.  Chuck's face swims into focus.  It has
been painted white.  Looking at himself in the reflection, he
dots on blue stars with dark blue from squid ink.

EXT.  CAVE - LATER

The rains have stopped.  The island is washed bright and
green.

ON CHUCK

As he stands up in the cove.  His face is white with blue
stars.  Handprints circle his torso, flanked by red lightning
bolts.  Braided cords circle his biceps.  Bone necklaces hang
from his neck.  Feathers jut out from his hair.

EXT.  JUNGLE - DAY

Chuck goes from tree to tree, making handprints along his
path.  Chuck was here.  This is his mark.

EXT.  PALM GROVE - DAY

He covers the calendar trees with handprints.  Then stops.
Sees something.  Eyes fixed on the beach, he walks toward the
shoreline.

EXT.  BEACH - DAY

Chuck emerges from the palm trees, and now we see what he had
seen.

A FIFTY-FIVE GALLON OIL DRUM.

And another one.  TWO.  Chuck stares at the barrels.

                     CHUCK
          Hello.

EXT.  BEACH - LATER

Chuck sits staring at the oil drums.  It's almost as if he is
hesitating to take advantage of them.  That he may not want,
really, to leave now.

Then his inner struggle ends.

                     CHUCK
          What the hell are you waiting for?

EXT.  BEACH - LATER

Filled with determination, Chuck rolls a barrel up the beach.

EXT.  BEACH - LATER

Using a palm tree as a fulcrum, Chuck hauls hard on a rope
made of vines, pulling the barrel up off the beach.

EXT.  JUNGLE - DAY

Chuck throws aside palm leaves, revealing...the remains of
his raft.

INT.  CAVE - NIGHT

Chuck is drawing with a purpose now.  And we see what he is
working on.  The plans for a raft.

INT.  CAVE - NIGHT

Chuck is making a list of what he needs.  He works intently.

                     CHUCK
          Canteens.  Sea anchor.  Got to weave
          rope.  Spears.  A sail.

EXT.  JUNGLE - DAY

Chuck lashes the barrels onto the raft.  Checks the knots.
Lashes more rope.

INT.  CAVE - NIGHT

He sews dresses together with handmade fiber string.

INT.  CAVE - NIGHT

He weaves videotape together to form a sea anchor.

EXT.  BEACH - DAY

Chuck digs a channel toward the raft.

INT.  CAVE - DAY

Chuck constructs a water collection device with some FedEx
boxes, some plastic weighted with a stone.  Explains it to
Wilson.

                     CHUCK
          Now I'm hoping that if this is airtight
          I'll get condensation down here, a cup or
          so a day.  If I'm careful it should be
          enough.

INT.  CAVE - NIGHT

Chuck writes on the wall.

                     CHUCK
          If I never return, know that here lived
          Chuck Noland for four years.  I drew
          these paintings.  I made these marks.
          And then I took my fate in my own hands
          and set forth to save myself, God
          willing.

EXT.  BEACH - DAY

Chuck loads the raft, which rocks gently in the cove.  He has
a sail made of designer dresses sewn together with fiber
thread.  A sea anchor secured by videotape woven together
into a rope.  Plastic bottles filled with water.  A signal
kite made of FedEx paper.

Then comes the FedEx box with the angel wings.  Then Wilson.

                     CHUCK
          Wilson, my main man.  Time to go.

And he gently leads the raft into the lagoon.

                     CHUCK
          Wonder what odds Stan would give me on
          this.  I'd say 90-10.  Against.

He jumps onto the raft, begins to paddle out toward where the
surf crashes onto the reef.

EXT.  LAGOON - DAY

Waves break against the reef.  With his paddles Chuck
maneuvers the raft toward the cut in the reef.  Boom!  The
wave crashes, the water surges through the cut, then recedes
with a whoosh.

Chuck watches, times the waves, paddles like mad.  He's
committed.  SCRAPE goes the first barrel, then the second,
riding the receding wave.  He's out!

But the next wave is already surging forward.  It smashes the
raft against the reef!  Coconuts and foodstuffs hurtle off
the raft!

The barrels cushion the impact.  The raft tilts, spins, but
stays outside the reef!  The ropes holding the jugs of water
break!  The water sweeps overboard!

The wave recedes again.  Chuck recovers, paddles with all his
strength, and then he's clear of the breakers!

For a long moment he floats on the rollers, getting his
breath.

The water jugs float away, carried by the waves back into the
lagoon.  Chuck could go back and get them.  If he were being
prudent, he definitely would.

But he's out.  He might never get back out again.

He stares at the lagoon and the receding water jugs.  Then he
stares at the island.  Goodbye to all that.

                     CHUCK
          Wilson, we're out of here.

He turns and begins raising the sail.

EXT.  OCEAN - WIDE - MINUTES LATER

Powered by its multicolored makeshift sail, trailing its
gently flapping signal kite of FedEx paper, the raft slowly
moves away from the island, out toward the open ocean.

And we pull back until the ocean swallows the tiny raft and
then we TILT DOWN AND...

                                                 DISSOLVE TO:

EXT.  OCEAN - DAY - FOUR WEEKS LATER

The ocean again, low.  The raft floats into frame.  A trace
of a breeze flaps the signal kite, which barely stays aloft,
its rope frayed and tattered.  The still is set up in the
middle, plastic with a rock weighting down the center.

Chuck is gaunt, his clothes rotted.

He lies looking over the side of the raft, spear in one hand,
staring intently at the water.

Dorados swim like specters, flashing and darting.  Chuck
stabs with his spear.  Stabs again.

                     CHUCK
          Slow down, damn you!

Exhausted, he sinks back to the raft.  Two Dorados leap into
the air ahead of him.

Chuck tries to stare again into the water.  He spots another
fish, a flash of silver under the surface.

Chuck struggles to his feet, raises his spear.  SPLAT!
Something strikes him in the chest, almost knocking him into
the water.

On the raft we see flashes of silver and green and blue.  A
FLYING FISH.  Chuck dives at it, catches it, loses it.

                     CHUCK
          Catch it catch it catch it --

He catches it again just as it almost flops over the side.

EXT.  RAFT - MOMENTS LATER

Chuck sucks the juice out of the head.  He chews meat off the
tiny rib bones.

Chuck is in the stage of malnutrition, vitamin deprivation,
salt insufficiency, and exposure where the personality splits
and becomes external.  Like all castaways, he has
conversations with the two sides of himself.

                     GOODCHUCK
          Save some for tomorrow.

                     BADCHUCK
          Catch another fish tomorrow.

BadChuck wins.  Chuck keeps eating.  He stares up at the sun,
which beats down unmercifully.

EXT.  RAFT - DAY - LATER

The raft drifts.  Chuck has taken down the sail and rigged it
as a canopy.  Drenched with sweat, Chuck lies on the raft,
trying to sleep.  He dabs at some sores that are ulcerating
his body and won't let him get comfortable.  Plus, there's a
chaffing, squeaking sound.  He looks around for the source.

We see it with him.  One of the ropes is frayed and about to
break.  If it does, the logs will come apart from the floats.

                     BADCHUCK
          Shit!  Shit!  Shit!

                     GOODCHUCK
          Stay calm, identify the problem.
          Problem, rope fraying.  Solution, fix
          rope.

                     BADCHUCK
          With what?  There's nothing to fix it
          with.  This rope comes undone, you're
          going to drown.

                     GOOD CHUCK
          Just get up and fix it.

                     BADCHUCK
          Too tired.

                     GOODCHUCK
          Get up.

                     BADCHUCK
          Feels so good to lie here.

                     GOODCHUCK
          Get up, damn you.

Chuck comes to his knees.  Then sinks back down.

                     BADCHUCK
          Can't.  Need water.

                     GOODCHUCK
          You've had today's water.

                     BADCHUCK
          Thirsty.

                     GOODCHUCK
          Come on, shape up, get going, you can do
          it.

                     BADCHUCK
          No water, no work.

Chuck tries another tack.  Sweet reason.

                     GOODCHUCK
          Okay look, I know you're tired, I know
          you're thirsty, but give it one more
          shot, you've just got to do a little
          more.

                     BADCHUCK
          Do too much, I'll die.

                     GOODCHUCK
          Do too little you'll die.

                     BADCHUCK
          Going to die anyway.

That stops GoodChuck for a moment.

                     GOODCHUCK
          Okay, look have an extra swallow.

He holds up the pathetic little jar with its few teaspoons of
murky water.

                     BADCHUCK
          No more water, you said.

                     GOODCHUCK
          Take it.

                     BADCHUCK
          No.

                     GOODCHUCK
          Take it, damn it.

                     BADCHUCK
          No.

                     GOODCHUCK
          Wilson, do you believe this?  Take the
          damn water.

Slowly Chuck gets up, lifts up the water jar, and takes a
swallow.  Then another.

                     GOODCHUCK
          Stop.  Enough.

Then another.

EXT.  RAFT - DAY - LATER

Chuck works to braid a new rope.  He is focused,
concentrating as hard as he can, but everything is slow and
hard and he's weak and clumsy.  He tests the rope, but it
doesn't hold.

                     GOODCHUCK
          Think.  Got to use something else.

He gets an idea, starts to pull the signal kite in.

                     BADCHUCK
          If they can't see you, what's the point?

                     GOODCHUCK
          Survive today, that's the point.

The kite rope is much thinner than the rope he had used to
tie the logs, but it's all he has.  He ties the log with the
kite rope.  Exhausted, he lies back down.

EXT.  RAFT - NIGHT

The moon is full.  The waves cast off shadows on the ocean.
Chuck is staring into the sky, trying to find a star to
navigate by.

                     GOODCHUCK
          Polaris, where are you?  Maybe I'm too
          far south.

                     BADCHUCK
          You don't know where you are.  You missed
          the shipping lanes.

                     GOODCHUCK
          Moon's too bright.

We hear the fraying sound again.

EXT.  RAFT - DAY

Chuck saws at the outer log with his stone knife.  Across the
water comes a storm.  We can see it like a waterfall moving
toward us.

                     BADCHUCK
          You're putting off the inevitable.

                     GOODCHUCK
          I'm putting it off.

He looks at the deteriorating rope, at the rotting sail.

                     BADCHUCK
          That's what's happening to you.

Chuck pushes the outer log away, then takes the loose rope
and begins to lash it around the center logs.

                     BADCHUCK
          You're rotting away.

The raft is rocking.  The waves are stronger.  It's hard to
tie the logs together.

Rain falls like a sheet on Chuck.

                     BADCHUCK
          Get water!

                     GOODCHUCK
          Fix raft first.

                     BADCHUCK
          Water water water --

Chuck works frantically in the rain, trying to tie the rope.
Finally he does.

Then he scrambles for his water collecting funnel, struggles
to pull it up.  One corner is stuck and collapses.
Desperately he rights it, pulls the funnel up.

Drops begin to run down the sides and collect in the jar.
Soaked, Chuck stares at the water as it rises.

Then the rain stops.

We see the line of rain recede away from Chuck, spattering
the ocean.  But all around him the ocean is calm again.

And out comes the sun.

EXT.  OCEAN - DAY

The raft floats on quiet seas.  The sky is blue, with few
high cirrus clouds so motionless they seem pasted on.

Chuck lies on the raft, sick and weak.

Suddenly, from the depths beside him, silently rises a huge
shape.

A SPERM WHALE, still mainly submerged.  The blow hole is near
Chuck, wet and pulsing like giant lips.  The eye of the whale
is only a few feet away.  It looks upon Chuck out of an
intelligence deep and alien.

He slowly comes to his knees and stares at it.

The blow hole opens and WHOOSH, out shoots a geyser of fine
spray which settles on Chuck in a mist.

The whale rises farther, dwarfing the raft.  From the whale
comes a deep sound like a foghorn.

Startled, Chuck jumps back, rocking the raft.  He catches
himself, slowly reaches out and touches the whale.

The whale blows again, drenching Chuck in more spray.

Chuck touches the whale again.

                     GOODCHUCK
          You like that?

Very slowly it drifts along with the raft.

                     GOODCHUCK
          Lost your mate?

We look right into the whale's eye.  Beneath the surface we
can see the huge jaws open and close.

                     GOODCHUCK
          You're beautiful.  Marry me.

                     BADCHUCK
          You idiot, if he dives, he'll capsize the
          raft.

Very slowly the whale moves ahead of the raft, its vast body
passing Chuck.

                     GOODCHUCK
          No, don't go.  Look, I've got fish.

Chuck rips a fillet off the line and throws it in front of
the whale, which ignores it.

                     GOODCHUCK
          Please don't dive.  Please.

The whale slowly sinks, then suddenly arches its huge back
and heads straight for the bottom.

For a moment, all that remains are the flukes, black and
vertical against the dark blue sky.  With one swoop, those
flukes could destroy Chuck and his raft.  But they don't do
anything except slowly sink.

Then it is gone.

We are on Chuck's face as he stares at where the whale had
been, the surface marked only by a ring of concentric ripples
that reach out and gently rock the raft.

EXT.  OCEAN - DAY

Chuck checks the water.  It is green and full of floaties.
It looks awful.  He takes the jug, puts it to his mouth, and
drinks.  Instantly he throws up back into the jug, barely
keeps from dropping it.

                     BADCHUCK
          Look what you've done.

He dips his hand into the ocean, splashes some sea water on
his face, splutters it out, then licks his lips.  He is so
thirsty.

He looks at the water jug, full now with his own vomit, turns
away, begins to work on the sea anchor again.

But the work makes him even thirstier.  He looks at the jug
again.

Picks it up.  Takes a long drink.

EXT.  OCEAN - DAY

The fish return.  Chuck gets up with his spear, then puts it
down.

                     BADCHUCK
          What are you doing?

                     GOODCHUCK
          Can't kill another one.  Can't.  Can't
          kill my friends anymore.

                     BADCHUCK
          You fucking bleeding heart, you kill or
          you die.

                     GOODCHUCK
          Why do they have to die for me?

                     BADCHUCK
          They'd eat you if they could.  They're
          laughing at you.  Listen.

Chuck listens.  Doesn't hear anything.

                     GOODCHUCK
          Got to eat.

Chuck picks up the spear, stabs it, misses.

Suddenly he has a fish on the end of the spear.  It
struggles, he scoops it onto the raft, brutally pounds on its
head, twists the stone knife into its spine.  The struggling
stops.

Chuck looks at the dead fish and begins to sob.

                     GOODCHUCK
          I am so sorry.

He cries uncontrollably.  As he cries he cuts off the head,
pulls out the eyeballs, and eats each one.  Then he sucks the
marrow out of the head.

Then takes the heart and eats that.  Then eats the liver.

As he is chewing, he cuts the meat into strips.

When he is done, he takes the backbone, breaks it, and sucks
on it.

Fish scales shine in his hair, blood covers his chest.

EXT.  OCEAN - NIGHT

The raft rocks gently.  Chuck looks up.  The strips of fish
are glowing.  So is the deck where he killed the fish.

He reaches out to touch the fish strips.  His hand is glowing
too.

                     CHUCK
          I'm an angel.

Suddenly he sees other lights.  A ship.  A ship is out there.
And he hears it, a humming in deep register.

He waves his hands.  He yells.

                     CHUCK
          Here!  Here!

His voice cracks, we can barely hear it over the ocean.

The lights move on.

                     CHUCK
          No...no...no...

His raft is rocked by the wake, rocked hard.  Chuck is thrown
into the water!

He comes to the surface, sputtering.  Where is the raft?

He looks one way, then another.  Darkness.

This is the worst.

He turns again in the water.  There, dimly, he can see the
glow from the fish he killed.  The glow saves his life.

He swims toward it.

He pulls himself back on the raft.

He lies there exhausted, the glow from the phosphorescence
casting a greenish light on his face.

EXT.  OCEAN - DAY

Clouds are building up.  In the distance lightning flashes.
The clouds come closer.

Little bits of electricity jump off the mast.  Saint Elmos
fire jumps around Chuck's hand.

Fascinated, he holds out his hand.  The fire jumps from his
hand to the mast.

Suddenly lightning shoots from the sky and strikes the ocean!
A huge spout of water explodes like a depth charge.  The
CRACK is intense, then rolls away.

Chuck stares, then realizes the danger and throws himself
down on the raft.  Suddenly a wall of rain sweeps over him
and the ocean begins to roll.  The thunder is deafening.
Lightning flashes bursts through the rain.

                     CHUCK
          Sea anchor!  Let out the sea anchor!

Frantic, Chuck lets out the sea anchor as the raft scuds down
a huge wave.  The anchor catches, slowing the raft so that it
rides the wave down.

The waves come at him high as houses.  The raft rides up one
side, then plunges down the next.

All Chuck can do is hold on.

EXT.  OCEAN - DAY

The storm has passed.  The raft floats on big dark rollers.

We hear the chirping and squeaking of dolphins.  They come
close to the raft.  Chuck watches them play.  Then realizes
they are chasing his fish.  They drive them along, into the
path of another dolphin, who darts in and rips into the
dorado, turning the water around the raft into churning,
bloody foam.

                     CHUCK
          Stop!

He takes his oar and begins beating the water.  The killing
continues.

                     CHUCK
          You fucking murderers!

Suddenly the water is still.  One dolphin sticks its head out
of the water and stares at Chuck, squeaking.

Another dolphin lifts its head up, then another.  They squeak
to each other, clearly communicating and talking about Chuck.

                     CHUCK
          I know you're talking about me!

He splashes the water with his oar.

They dive, then jump into the air, squeaking as they go.

                     CHUCK
               (very softly)
          Take me with you.

They're gone.

                     CHUCK
          Why me?  Why me, God?

He begins to laugh.

                     BADCHUCK
          Listen to this, Wilson.
               (deep voice: God)
          Because you piss me off.

EXT.  OCEAN - DAY

Chuck tries to stretch with some simple yoga.  Each movement
takes forever.

He rolls over onto his stomach and tries to do a pushup.  He
can't.  Collapses onto the raft.

                     BADCHUCK
          You're falling apart.

Tries to do another pushup.  Can't.

                     BADCHUCK
          First you eat your fat, then you eat your
          muscle.

He rolls over.

                     BADCHUCK
          Then you eat your mind.

He looks at the ocean.  They're in a line of garbage, a thick
slick of debris dumped off of ships.

                     GOODCHUCK
          Roll on you deep and dark blue ocean
          roll.

He closes his eyes.  After a minute they come open.

                     GOODCHUCK
          I'm late, I'm late, for a very important
          date.

They slowly close again.

                     BADCHUCK
          I'm lost.  Goodbye.

                     GOODCHUCK
          No!

His eyes come open again.

                     BADCHUCK
          Look, just slip off the raft.  The ocean
          would feel so good, the water's so soft
          and warm.  Take a little swim.  Sleep.

                     GOODCHUCK
          You quitter you quitter you quitter.

                     BADCHUCK
          The sea is lovely, dark and deep.

                     GOODCHUCK
          But I have promises to keep.
               (rolls over)
          And miles to go before I sleep.
               (props himself up)
          And miles to go before I sleep.
               (purpose now)
          Got to fix the sea anchor.  Use the sail.

                     BADCHUCK
          Use the sail for a sea anchor and you
          won't move.

                     GOODCHUCK
          If I don't have a sea anchor I'll
          capsize.

                     BADCHUCK
          Die tomorrow or die today.

He hums Beethoven's fifth.  BA BA BA BUM.

                     BADCHUCK
          That's death knocking, knocking on your
          door.  Crazy little woman come knocking,
          knocking at my front door...

                     GOODCHUCK
          Grow up, stop being such a baby.  Other
          people get through a lot worse.

                     BADCHUCK
          Yeah, sure, what?

He hums to himself, begins to sing, Beatles.

                     BADCHUCK
          I'm so tired, my mind is on the blink...

He pulls in the loose sea anchor rope, which is covered with
barnacles.

He scrapes the barnacle off the rope into the water jug, then
sips it.

The sun is setting, huge rays shoot out across the sky.

Out of the empty ocean the Dorados suddenly appear, leaping
flashes of silver right by the raft.

One Dorado swims right by the raft, broadside.

Chuck looks at it, uncomprehending.  Then slowly reaches for
his spear.

                     GOODCHUCK
          What?  Are you sacrificing yourself for
          me?

Carefully he comes to his feet, then shoots the spear into
the fish.

Flapping and struggling, it lands on the deck.  Chuck pounces
on it.

EXT.  RAFT - NIGHT - MOMENTS LATER

He cuts it open.  The other Dorados ram the raft in fury,
like a lynch mob.

                     GOODCHUCK
          Damn it!  I had to do it!

The banging continues.

                     GOODCHUCK
          I'm sorry!

He concentrates on his work, then sits back on his heels in
amazement.  There's another fish inside.  He holds that fish
up, stares at it, then cuts it open.

There's a smaller fish inside it.

                     GOODCHUCK
          I know there's a moral here, God, but
          right now I'm just going to eat.

He pops out an eyeball, then another, and crunches them
between his teeth.

He takes the heart and liver, starts to eat, then stops.

                     GOODCHUCK
          Forgot to say grace.  Sorry Mom.

He struggles to remember.

                     GOODCHUCK
          Bless us O Lord, and these thy gifts and
          Christ and the bounty about to receive,
          or something...amen.

He eats them.

EXT.  RAFT - NEXT MORNING

Chuck splashes sea water on his face.  Adjusts the water
still.

                     GOODCHUCK
          Please don't leak.  Please.

Chuck picks up the smallest fish.  It's half digested.  He
washes it in the ocean, trigger fish come up and nibble at
his fingers.

                     GOODCHUCK
          Don't look at me.  It was that Dorado.

He cuts the small fish and hangs it on the stays.

                     GOODCHUCK
          You know, Wilson, every now and then we
          should say thank you.  Thank you God.

                     BADCHUCK
          Thank you for fucking up my life.

Suddenly something bumps the raft.  Hard.  Then again.

                     GOODCHUCK
          Not again.

Fins cut the water.  SHARKS.  A big hammerhead bumps the
raft.  BadChuck hums the theme from "Jaws."  Chuck takes his
spear stabs at the shark.

                     BADCHUCK
          He's going to get you, going to get
          you...

Another one circles in, bumps the raft.

                     GOODCHUCK
          Get away from me!

The shark circles again, that big hammerhead like a
nightmare.

                     GOODCHUCK
          Get him get him get him.

He stabs at it with his spear.  He might as well have stabbed
concrete.  The shark circle, Chuck stabs again.

But the shark is gone.

                     GOODCHUCK
          Where are you?  Where are you?

Stabs again and again at the empty ocean.

                     GOODCHUCK
          Stop!  You're using energy.  Move slowly.
          Be patient.

Chuck kneels, wavering, on the raft.  The ocean is calm.

Suddenly, BUMP.  The raft tilts.

Chuck hangs on.

Then a shark appears, just out of spear range.  Its lifeless
black eyes seem to stare right through Chuck.

If the Dorado was a gift from God, this is a message from
Hell.

Then the shark is gone.

EXT.  RAFT - DAY - MOMENTS LATER

Chuck lies back on the raft.  He is humming.

                     BADCHUCK
          What are you smiling about?  They'll be
          back.

                     GOODCHUCK
          I'm dancing on the roof of the Peabody
          Hotel.  With Kelly.

He smiles at the thought.

                     GOODCHUCK
          The music ends.  We go back to the table.
          The waiters have brought dinner.  New
          York Strip with Bordelaise Sauce.
          Mushrooms in brown gravy.  Roasted
          potatoes with garlic and rosemary.  Green
          Beans with almonds.  Fresh biscuits and
          cornbread, dripping with butter.  A nice
          salad with ranch dressing.  A jumbo
          shrimp cocktail.

Thinks about that, it spoils the picture.

                     GOODCHUCK
          No shrimp.
               (then)
          We eat.

He closes his eyes.  This is the greatest fantasy.

                     GOODCHUCK
               (as the waiter)
          For dessert, we have pecan pie a la mode,
          we have a double chocolate cake with
          creme anglaise, we have a nice pear
          torte, fresh key lime pie, or perhaps if
          you care to wait a few minutes, a grand
          marnier souffle?

Chuck thinks over the options, thinking of each one.

                     GOODCHUCK
          Why, bring them all, bring them all.

He rolls over.  There, square in his vision, is a ship, its
form coming in and out of a low haze.

Chuck jumps to his feet.  Waves.  Screams.

                     GOODCHUCK
          Here!  Over here!

The ship moves on.  We can see the decks the rigging, the
vastness of it.

Chuck realizes he is naked.  Struggles to pull on the remains
of his pants finally holds them like a diaper with one hand
as he continues to wave.

On the ship no one is to be seen.  It is a spooky sight.

The big tanker moves on.

We are on Chuck's face.  Passed up again.

Then he realizes what is about to happen.  He throws out the
sea anchor.

He throws himself onto the raft and grips it as tight as he
can, wiggles his feet into the ropes.

                     CHUCK
          Oh, shiiiittt!

Then comes the wake of the ship.  It rocks the raft like a
piece of flotsam.  The raft rides high up on the wave, then
shoots down it, but the sea anchor holds, and the raft slows
and rides along with the wave.

And then the sea is calm again.

Slowly Chuck sinks to his knees.  His hand lets loose his
pants.

He lies down on the raft and imagines the conversation with
the ship's captain.

                     CHUCK
          Permission to come aboard, sir.

                     CHUCK/CAPTAIN
          Permission granted.

                     CHUCK
          May I ask, where are you bound?

                     CHUCK/CAPTAIN
          San Francisco.  And you?

                     CHUCK
          As it happens, I'm headed for Frisco
          myself.

                     CHUCK/CAPTAIN
          Would you do us the honor of joining us?
          We're just sitting down at mess.  Pork
          chops and gravy, cranberries, baked
          potatoes with all the trimmings, fresh-
          baked bread, apple pie...

                     CHUCK
          No please, join me.  Some sundried fish
          strips, a few eyeballs, some gills to
          munch on.

The depression comes back again.

                     BADCHUCK
          They're never going to see you.  You're
          just another piece of trash in the ocean.

                     GOODCHUCK
          They're on autopilot.

                     BADCHUCK
          They're always on autopilot.  Or else
          it's night, or you're in the sun, or
          you're in the trough of a wave.  They'll
          never see you.

                     GOODCHUCK
          Damn it!  Don't be so negative!

Chuck picks up Wilson.

                     GOODCHUCK
          Wilson, what's your story?

He holds Wilson close to his chest.

                     BADCHUCK
          I float.  You sink.  End of story.

                     GOODCHUCK
          I'm serious.  I'm always going on about
          me, me, me.  Enough about me.  Your turn.

                     BADCHUCK
          It's a fucking soccer ball, you idiot.

                     GOODCHUCK
          Shut up.

He lies on the raft and holds Wilson close.

We move up until we see --

EXT.  OCEAN - AERIAL - EVENING

Chuck lying curled up on the raft, Wilson cradled in his
arms, and all around the vast empty ocean.

EXT.  OCEAN - NEXT MORNING

Chuck slowly wakes up.  Sets Wilson aside.

                     GOODCHUCK
          Don't shirk, don't procrastinate, don't
          be lazy.  We're okay today.  We're okay
          today.

And the other Chuck begins to laugh.

                     GOODCHUCK
          Shut up.

The laughter goes on.

                     GOODCHUCK
          Shut the fuck up!  I mean it.

He stands up and checks the horizon.

                     GOODCHUCK
          What's so damn funny?

                     BADCHUCK
          You are.

Suddenly Chuck sees something on the horizon.  A bank of
clouds.  A cone of -- land.

He squints, stares again.  The clouds part.  It looks like --
his island.

Chuck doesn't know whether to feel joy or despair.

                     GOODCHUCK
          Jesus.

                     BADCHUCK
          Look again, asshole.  It's a mirage.

Chuck squints.

                     GOODCHUCK
          It's real.

                     BADCHUCK
          Nothing out there but ocean.

                     GOODCHUCK
          Let's get a second opinion.  Wilson?
          What do you see?

Chuck picks up the soccer ball, holds it up, and stares out
at...ocean.

EXT.  RAFT - DAY - LATER

Chuck slowly writes on the sail.

                     CHUCK
          Chuck Noland.  Born October 8, 1958.
          Died -- pick a date -- July 11, 1998.
          And now the epitaph.  Met deadlines.
          Kept appointments.  Lost without a trace.

He sits back, looks at the mock headstone.

                     BADCHUCK
          What did it matter if FedEx was five
          minutes late one day?  The next day we
          just start over again.

                     GOODCHUCK
          It matters.  We do the best we can,
          that's all we have.

                     BADCHUCK
          Then we've just got shit.

He goes on writing.

                     CHUCK
          I am writing this to remind myself to
          live a better life.  If I am lost,
          perhaps you who find this will be
          instructed to live a better live
          yourself.  Live each day.  Love your
          children.  Don't take anyone for granted.

                     BADCHUCK
          Is that it?  Life is a fucking Disney
          movie?

The waves begin to grow, the ocean turns a slate gray.  Far
above him, great frigate birds circle.  Suddenly one dives on
a booby which has caught a fish.  The great frigate bird
swoops all around the booby until, panicked, it drops the
fish, which plummets toward the sea.

With a graceful dive, the huge bird grabs the fish and then
soars up on a thermal, high into the sky.

Lightning flashes back and forth across the horizon, which is
turning black and dark.  Thunder rolls.

EXT.  RAFT - NIGHT

The raft goes up and down huge waves.  Every few seconds
lightning flashes, illuminating the raft and Chuck holding
desperately to it, his eyes wild with fear.

EXT.  RAFT - MORNING

The waves continue.  Chuck holds on, his face pale.

                     BADCHUCK
          You can't make it.

                     GOODCHUCK
          Shut up.  I don't feel like dying today.

EXT.  OCEAN - DAY - LATER

The sky clears.  The waves are still big.  The fish are back.
And then come the sharks, cutting through the water.  Chuck
can't get up to get his spear, he just has to watch as blood
darkens the water.

And then the sharks are gone.

Chuck comes to his knees slowly, then a big wave hits.
Wilson is swept into the ocean!

For a moment Chuck is uncomprehending.  He watches as Wilson
slowly floats away.

                     CHUCK
          Please, no sharks.

Then he dives in to the water!  Swims frantically after
Wilson.

Wilson floats away from him.  He swims, but he's so weak.
Finally he gets to Wilson.  He reaches out, but only pushes
the ball farther away.

It bobs on the waves.  Chuck treads water, exhausted.

Where is the raft?

                     CHUCK
          Jesus.  Jesus.  Jesus.

Then he turns back the other way.  The raft has drifted by
him.  He can go after Wilson, or he can go after the raft.

                     CHUCK
          Shit!  Wilson!

He swims toward the raft, barely moving.  No matter how hard
he swims, the raft seems to recede from him.

Finally he reaches it, hangs on the side, breathing hard,
choking, crying.

He struggles to pull himself on board.

But he is weak, so weak.  He can't do it.

Summoning some primitive reserve of strength, he tries again.
This time he slides on.

He lies on the raft, panting.

Then with all his strength he pulls himself to his feet,
holds on to the mast, scans the ocean for Wilson.

                     CHUCK
          Wilson!

Nothing but waves.

This is too much.  Chuck starts to cry.

EXT.  RAFT - DAY - LATER

Chuck takes a swallow of water, washes it around in his
mouth, then swallows.  With his wet tongue he licks his
cracked lips.

The sun breaks through the clouds.

With what strength he has left, Chuck raises the canopy,
fastens it.

He sits in the meager shade, his head between his knees.

Closes his eyes.  Just for a minute.

EXT.  OCEAN - DAY - LATER

A different sort of shadow crosses Chuck's face.  He opens
his eyes.

There, riding right beside his raft, is a ship, a huge rusty
tanker.  Someone shouts down in a language we don't
understand.

Chuck sits up, can't believe it.  Struggles to cover himself.

EXT.  OCEAN - DAY - LATER

Chuck is lifted up the rusted steel side of the boat in a
Jacob's ladder.

EXT.  SHIP - DAY - LATER

Chuck steps on board, can't support himself.

The crew gathers around.  None of them speak English, but
there is a spontaneous outburst of human connection.

One man brings some water.  Another a blanket.  Another some
warm tea.

Chuck sits there, shivering now.

                     CHUCK
          Thank you.  Oh thank you.

Deliriously happy.  Delirious.

INT.  U.S. NAVAL HOSPITAL - HAWAII

A cavernous hanger-sized ward brightly lit and filled with
row upon row of hospital beds, each with its table, side
chair, and lamp, each with a stainless steel bedpan and
neatly folded sheets and blankets stacked ready to use, and
each completely empty.

Except for one.

And on that bed we see Chuck, in a blue hospital gown.  An IV
drips into his arm.  He plays idly with the remote control of
the bed.  He raises the head, then the foot.  He pushes
another button and the knee rest bends the bed again.

A DOCTOR enters, carrying a thick chart.  Chuck gives him a
big manic grin.  Malcolm MacDowell in "A Clockwork Orange."

                     CHUCK
          My favorite doctor.  What's the verdict?

                     DOCTOR
          Under the circumstances your overall
          health is good.  Those salt water boils
          you picked up on the raft are ulcerated,
          but they're healing nicely.

He checks his blood work records.

                     DOCTOR
          Hemoglobin's 10.8 -- you're anemic,
          that's why we're giving you iron.
          Potassium's low -- we're giving you an
          electrolyte solution with your IV.
          Sodium's over 150, way too high.  You may
          experience swelling in your extremities
          as you rehydrate and discharge the salt.
          In spite of your dietary deficiencies
          there's no sign of mental deterioration.

Chuck has been trying not to laugh.  Now he can't stop
himself.

                     DOCTOR
          What's so funny.

Chuck can't seem to help laughing at everything.

                     CHUCK
          Sorry...sorry... Why do my joints still
          ache?

                     DOCTOR
          Dehydration.  Vitamin deficiency.
          Protein deficiency.  Any or all of the
          above.

                     CHUCK
          All I ate was fish.  That's solid
          protein.

                     DOCTOR
          Protein digestion is very costly in water
          usage.

                     CHUCK
          Which I didn't have.

                     DOCTOR
          And fish are very low in fat, which is
          energy inefficient.  So you're going to
          burn up your own cells no matter how much
          you eat.  Luckily you ate the eyes and
          pancreas, which contain some Vitamin C,
          so you didn't get scurvy.

Chuck laughs again.

                     CHUCK
          I am one lucky guy.

                     DOCTOR
          Your body chemistry and your exposure to
          the elements would normally lead to
          irritability, depression, anxiety,
          periods of self-reproach.  It's almost
          like schizophrenia.  Different sides of
          your personality might come to life,
          speak out, act out.

                     CHUCK
          But all that's behind me.  I'm fine now.

He starts to laugh again.

                     DOCTOR
          If you say you are.

                     CHUCK
          I most definitely say I am.

                     DOCTOR
          Doctor Hegel tells me he discussed the
          Vietnam POW syndrome with you.

Chuck stifles his laughter.

                     CHUCK
          Yes, yes he did.

                     DOCTOR
          You are aware of the potential
          disruptiveness on your loved ones when
          you return to your old life?

                     CHUCK
          Not to mention on me.

The laughter again.  Unsettling.

                     DOCTOR
          You sure you don't want some counseling?

Chuck gives his biggest smile.

                     CHUCK
          Doc, I'm not on the island.  I'm not on
          the raft.  I'm alive.  I'm so glad to be
          back, I can't tell you.  I just want out
          of here.

                     DOCTOR
          Well, when that IV runs out, you're
          through with us.  Just the dentist
          tomorrow.

INT.  HOSPITAL - NIGHT - LATER

Rolling his IV, Chuck walks very slowly out of the ward.
Every step is an effort.

INT.  PHONE CUBICLE - NIGHT - MINUTES LATER

A small windowless room with only a desk and a phone, lit by
a fluorescent lamp.  Chuck is listening to the phone ring.

Kelly answers.

                     KELLY (V.O.)
          Hello.

Chuck is overcome for a moment, can't say a word.

                     KELLY (V.O.)
          Hello?  Hello?

For some reason he can't keep himself from laughing.  He
covers the mouthpiece and laughs.

And then we hear a dial tone, harsh, mechanical, final.

EXT.  PHONE CUBICLE - MINUTES LATER

We can see Chuck inside, staring at the phone.

INT.  PHONE CUBICLE - MINUTES LATER

We hear a faint persistent hum.  Chuck looks around, trying
to locate the sound.  He looks up, focuses on the fluorescent
light, that background sound he can no longer tune out, then
picks up the phone again.

EXT.  PHONE CUBICLE

Stan answers the phone.

                     STAN (V.O.)
          Hello?

                     CHUCK
          Stan, it's Chuck...Chuck Noland...

The laughter again.

                     STAN (V.O.)
          Whoever you are, you are one sick fucker.

And again we hear the dial tone.

INT.  PHONE CUBICLE - MOMENTS LATER

Chuck's on the phone again.

                     CHUCK
          Two Valium and the Rolling Stones.  That
          ring a bell?

There's a long silence.  Then we hear Stan's voice.

                     STAN (V.O.)
          God damn!  God damn!  Chuck, it's you!

                     CHUCK
          It's me.

                     STAN (V.O.)
          You're fucking dead!

                     CHUCK
          I'm most definitely not dead.  And as I
          recall, you're the sick fucker.

Chuck begins to laugh, a little too loud, a little too
shrill.  He's on a high.

EXT.  HAWAII - BEACH RESTAURANT

A terrace by the ocean.  Tables filled with diners.  Food
being delivered by waiters.  So simple, eating.  So taken for
granted.

At one table sits Chuck, dressed in a Hawaiian shirt and
shorts, with a half-dozen plates in front of him.  He
gestures to the waiter.  Bring me more.  It all tastes so
damned good.

Behind him is the ocean.  Chuck doesn't glance at it.

INT.  DENTIST - NEXT DAY

An attractive DENTAL TECHNICIAN with an Australian accent
cleans Chuck's teeth with an ultrasound device.  She's close,
very close.  Chuck looks up at her.  She looks really good.
She smiles at him, then touches the gap where he knocked out
his tooth.

                     TECHNICIAN
          You sure you don't want to have the
          implant done here?  We do quite good
          work.

Chuck shakes his head:  no.  She scrapes behind his front
teeth.

                     TECHNICIAN
          Hmmm, you do have such a lot of tarter
          behind these front incisors.  A little
          wider, please.

Chuck opens his mouth even further.  The technician talks on
in the self-absorbed way dental technicians sometimes do,
that constant babble of human contact which Chuck has not
heard for four years.

                     TECHNICIAN
          Anyway, so the second prosthetic foot
          worked better, but he still couldn't
          drive his new Cortina, it being a
          standard shift, if you follow me.

Chuck nods.  I follow you.

                     TECHNICIAN
          But would he hear of me driving him
          around?  Not on your bloody life.  Rinse
          please.

Chuck does.  Stan bursts into the room.

                     STAN
          Chuck!  God damn!

Chuck struggles out of the chair.

                     STAN
          God damn.  God damn.  God damn.

They are both almost overcome.  Stan holds Chuck by the
shoulders and looks at him.

                     STAN
          You're alive, you're fucking alive!

Chuck laughs, thrilled to see Stan.

                     CHUCK
          I beat the odds!

                     STAN
          You beat 'em to shit, pal!  Jesus!

                     TECHNICIAN
          I still need to floss you.

Stan notices the technician.

                     STAN
          Hello.

                     CHUCK
          This is Amber.  Her boyfriend lost his
          foot in a shark attack.

He says this with an absolute straight face, holding back the
laughter with great effort.  Instantly there's this
connection again between him and Stan.

                     TECHNICIAN
          Ex-boyfriend.

                     STAN
          Really.

And he and Chuck make eye contact and we see a glimpse of
their shared unspoken irony.

                     STAN
          Uh, there's somebody out here who wants
          to see you.

Chuck stares sharply at him.  Kelly?  Stan nods, but there's
something he wants to say.

                     STAN
          She thought you were dead.  We all did.

That's not all Stan wants to say.  But Chuck is limping out
the door.

INT.  DENTIST - WAITING ROOM

Typical dentist waiting room.  Chairs, tropical fish tanks,
magazines, a few waiting patients...and Kelly, looking
nervous.

Slowly and painfully Chuck enters.  He's quite a sight.  She
stands up.  There's a long moment where they look at each
other.

Then she comes into his arms.  Holds him tight.  She's part
laughing, part crying.

                     KELLY
          I'm sorry... I'm sorry...

                     CHUCK
          Hey...hey...it's okay!

Chuck is happy, he's still riding the high.

                     KELLY
          You're so thin.  Am I hurting you?

Well, maybe a little, but who cares?  He hasn't been hugged
or barely touched in so long.

                     CHUCK
          No...no...feels good...

She disengages, looks at him with that old smile.

                     KELLY
          Right back, you said you'd be right back.

                     CHUCK
          A few things came up.  Or went down.

He meets her gaze, looks her over with a smile.

                     CHUCK
          You look...wonderful.  I like your hair.

He notices the ring on her hand.

                     KELLY
          I got married.

                     CHUCK
          I thought you might have.

                     KELLY
          I would never --

                     CHUCK
          I know.

                     KELLY
          If I'd known you were alive --

                     CHUCK
          I would have done the same thing.

His responses come so quick.  Chuck seems blissfully sure of
himself.

                     KELLY
          I didn't want to.  It just happened.  One
          day Gary was there.  He took care of
          everything.  He took care of me.  I was a
          mess.

                     CHUCK
          You have any children?

Kelly nods.

                     CHUCK
          Got a picture?

Kelly fishes for a photo, shows it to Chuck.  It's a little
girl with a dog.

                     KELLY
          Her name's Hannah.

                     CHUCK
          Is that Jango?

                     KELLY
          No, this is Jack.  Jango was hit by a UPS
          truck.  Can you believe it?

Chuck laughs.  It is funny, sort of.

                     CHUCK
          Life's just one big joke after another.

Stan appears, takes in the scene.  The few patients waiting
are edged into the corners, trying to look occupied with
something else.

                     STAN
          How about we go somewhere else?

                     CHUCK
          Want to see my raft?

EXT.  HAWAII - DAY

Chuck's raft sits up on a dock.  Kelly stands staring at it.
How small and fragile it looks.

                     STAN
          This stinks really bad.

                     CHUCK
          You should have smelled me.

Stan examines the ropes around the logs.

                     STAN
          Cool ropes.

                     CHUCK
          I braided them.

                     STAN
          Must have taken a hell of a long time.

                     CHUCK
          Time I had lots of.

Kelly points at something on the raft.

                     KELLY
          What's that?

                     CHUCK
          That's my sea anchor.  My second one.
          Made it out of part of the sail.  It
          keeps you from capsizing in a storm.  In
          theory.
               (picks up his still)
          And this, this I used to collect water.
          About half a cup a day.

He's not feeling sorry for himself.  It's just a fact.

                     STAN
          You were how long on this?

                     CHUCK
          Forty-three days.

They look at the tiny raft.  It speaks for itself.

                     KELLY
          All that time I waited to go on a cruise,
          and you went without me.

                     CHUCK
          Yeah, well...couldn't be helped.

Kelly notices the sail, sees the writing on it.

                     KELLY
          What's that, written on the sail?

                     CHUCK
          My epitaph.

Kelly reads it to herself.  Her eyes are moist.

                     CHUCK
          Bad body chemistry.  Made me a little
          morbid.  But I'm all over that now.

And he seems really to believe it.

                     STAN
          I'll be at the car.
               (to Kelly)
          Take you to the airport.

And he leaves.

                     KELLY
          I buried you, Chuck.  They had to pry my
          fingers off your coffin.

This interests Chuck to no end.

                     CHUCK
          There was a coffin?

                     KELLY
          Yeah, coffin, headstone, the whole thing.

                     CHUCK
          What was inside?

                     KELLY
          Your calendar, your cell phone, your whoo
          pig sooey hat, some pictures of that
          ketch you wanted.

                     CHUCK
          That about sums it up.

                     KELLY
          Maybe now's when you tell me about it.

                     CHUCK
          The plane went down.  My friends died.  I
          washed up on an island.  Then I found
          these barrels, built the raft, and here I
          am.

                     KELLY
          Yeah?

                     CHUCK
          The tide came in, the tide went out.  I
          survived.  That's the headline.  I
          survived.

                     KELLY
          Don't overwhelm me with the details.
               (she smiles remembering)
          You know how I hate that.

He tries to put it into words, isn't quite sure how.

                     KELLY
               (gently)
          Come on.  Try.

                     CHUCK
          Cliches, mainly.  Don't take anyone for
          granted.  Don't sweat the small stuff.
          Live each day like it's your last.

                     KELLY
          So simple to say, so hard to do.

                     CHUCK
          Not when you have no choice.

Kelly looks down at the raft.  It's so small.

                     KELLY
          You hated being alone.  Couldn't stand
          it.  Busy every minute.  Always plugged
          into something.

                     CHUCK
          I didn't know what really being alone
          was.  No one back here does.

He has something more to say.  She waits.

                     CHUCK
          We're not meant to be alone.  Not like
          that.  Share life, that's what came to me
          out there.  Be with someone.

And that's the point, isn't it?  We are social animals.  No
man is an island.

                     KELLY
          This is so unfair.

                     CHUCK
          That's what I told the fish I caught.
          But I ate them anyway.

And the laughter comes again.  Kelly grins, embarrassed, a
little worried.

                     KELLY
          You okay?

                     CHUCK
          Great.  Really.

She stares at his face, reaches out, touches it again, this
time with great tenderness.

He nods, her touch feels so good.

A wave of emotion comes over her:  pity?  love?

                     KELLY
          What will you do?

                     CHUCK
          I don't know.  I really don't know.

We hear a distant beep-beep, discrete as a car horn can be.

                     KELLY
          I've got to get back to Memphis.
          Hannah's babysitter has finals.

                     CHUCK
          It means a lot...that you came.

                     KELLY
          I had to come.  To be sure you were okay.

They hold each other.  For a long time.

                     KELLY
          I love you, Chuck.

                     CHUCK
          You too.

                     KELLY
          I'm so glad you're alive.

Chuck grins.

                     CHUCK
          You too.

Then she heads for the waiting car.  Chuck stands by his
raft, watching her go.

INT.  FEDEX PLANE - NIGHT

Chuck and Stan ride on the plane.  Chuck is coming down off
his survival high.  He has the Angel Wing FedEx package with
him.

                     STAN
          When I first showed up, I thought you'd
          lost your fucking marbles.

                     CHUCK
          I never thought it would end.  Then it
          did.  It was so great to be saved, I
          couldn't stop laughing.

Stan pulls a flask out of his bag.

                     STAN
          You need a drink.

Stan takes two glasses from his bag, rests them on a FedEx
container, and pours the whiskey.

                     CHUCK
          For years my only drinking buddy was a
          soccer ball.  Wilson.

Stan hoists his glass.

                     STAN
          To Wilson.

                     CHUCK
          To Wilson.

Now's when Stan gets to the question he's been wanting to
ask, that Kelly wanted to know, that we all want to know.

                     STAN
          So, what's it all about?

Chuck stares at him.

                     STAN
          You've been over the line and you came
          back.  You've been saved, hallelujah!

                     CHUCK
          Hallelujah.

Stan looks over at him.

                     STAN
          I'm serious.  The burning bush, the big
          picture, the words in neon...

                     CHUCK
          What's it all about?  It's about being so
          thirsty you'd crush a fish's backbone to
          suck out the spinal fluid -- that's what
          it's about.

Stan sits back, repulsed but relieved.

                     STAN
          Do what it takes.  That's what I always
          told you.

He pours another drink.

                     STAN
          To life.  Fuck 'em if they can't take a
          joke.

                     CHUCK
          To life.

                     STAN
          That's all there is.

                     CHUCK
          Believe me I know.

He takes a sip of his drink, just savoring it, thinking.

                     CHUCK
          But it's not being bold or being in the
          game or rolling the dice.

All those things Stan used to tell him.

                     CHUCK
          When I was going crazy, on the raft, I'd
          argue with myself about everything.
          Because everything had a price.  To get
          anything -- a sip of water, a little
          corner of shade, an hour's sleep -- I had
          to let go of something else.  And then I
          could never get it back.

He thinks some more.

                     CHUCK
          You don't win or lose.  You win and lose.

He looks out the window.

                     CHUCK
          You win and lose.

And Chuck has.  Big time.

EXT.  MEMPHIS AIRPORT - NIGHT

A FedEx MD-11 lands.

EXT.  MEMPHIS SUPERHUB - MOMENTS LATER

The MD-11 taxis up.  As usual, the SuperHub is a frenzy of
activity.  A loading crew stands ready, forklifts poised.
Even this plane carries packages.

PHIL STEELE, the chairman of FedEx, Leslie, Becca, Dick, and
other executives wait on a special podium near the gangway.
Everyone looks different -- older, a mustache here, a
thickening around the belly there.

Behind a barrier a cluster of cameras film the scene.

The plane cuts its engine.  The stairs are rolled out.
Forklifts and gangways move forward.  Cargo doors open.
Chuck appears in the door.  He holds the FedEx Package and a
small travel bag.

Chuck blinks against the lights and the glare.  Stan is right
by him.  Everyone bursts into APPLAUSE AND CHEERING.

After four years of total solitude this is completely
overwhelming.

                     STAN
          Smile.

Chuck smiles.

                     STAN
          Wave.

And Chuck waves.  He's overwhelmed by all the input.  Stan
steers Chuck down the steps as the cheers continue.

At the bottom of the steps Roger steps forward.  The two
brothers embrace each other.  After a moment Roger
disengages.  Mary gives Chuck a hug.

                     MARY
          Oh Chuck --

                     CHUCK
          Where's Mom?

                     ROGER
          Waiting for you.  At the farm.  This was
          too much --

He looks around at the crowds.

                     CHUCK
          Tell me about it.

Stan nudges Chuck.  Time to go to the podium.

                     ROGER
          Glad you made it, big brother.

Stan and Chuck head for the podium.  All the loaders and
operators and package scanners begin to applaud.  Chuck
smiles, then laughs, getting into the emotion.  He keeps up
an almost indecipherable babble underneath the cheering.
Occasionally he sees someone he knows.

                     CHUCK
          Wow.  Thank you.  Great.  Thank you.
          Hey, Rasheed, how you doing?  Thank you
          all.

EXT.  SUPERHUB - WIDE

Chuck makes his triumphant way through this amazing
collection of cheering people like Moses parting the Red Sea.

EXT.  SUPERHUB - PLATFORM

With a big smile Phil Steele holds out his hand to Chuck.

                     STEELE
          Welcome home.

He steps to the microphone and addresses the SuperHub.

                     STEELE
          This is an extraordinary moment.  And it
          should be marked in an extraordinary way.
          With something we have never done since
          this company was founded.
               (pause)
          Stop the line!

EXT.  SUPERHUB - SERIES OF SHOTS

All over the SuperHub, belts come to a halt.  Forklifts stop.
Tracking stations shut down.  The vast flow of packages is
suddenly still.  The incredible din of activity is suddenly
quiet.  The stillness and the silence are unexpected and
palpable.  Thousands of workers stop as well, staring either
up at Chuck directly or at his image on video screens.  We
hear Phil's voice piped in.

EXT.  SUPERHUB - PLATFORM

Phil holds a plaque.

                     STEELE
          Four years ago we placed this plaque in
          honor of Charles Noland, and two just
          like it in honor of Al Morris and John
          Durham, the two brave pilots who went
          down with him.

As he talks, we stay on Chuck, who is taking in this amazing
scene, not really listening.

                     STEELE
          Chuck endured years of hardship and
          loneliness.  Like Lazarus, Chuck has come
          back from the dead.  Chuck, this is your
          family, all of us.  So it gives me great
          pleasure...to take this plaque...and to
          present it to our long lost son.  Welcome
          home.

He hands the plaque to Chuck.  Chuck acknowledges the cheers
of the crowd.

                     CHUCK
          Thank you.  Thank you very much...

Everyone applauds.

                     CHUCK
          Give me a minute.  I've spent four years
          looking out at an empty ocean.

He laughs, a short brittle laugh, composes himself.

                     CHUCK
          It's all so -- big.  You never think
          you'll miss -- all this.  But I did.  I
          really, really did.  And I missed all of
          you.

He looks over at the hub.

                     CHUCK
          You've added some new belts, and what's
          that?

He points at some high tech equipment on the edge of the
shed.

                     STAN
          Digital laser readers.

                     CHUCK
          Digital laser readers.  Wow.  Terrific.

He looks around at everyone, doesn't know what else to say.

                     CHUCK
          I've never heard it this quiet.
          Shouldn't you all be getting back to
          work?

The tension is broken.  Everyone laughs.  Phil Steele motions
with his hand.  Let it be done.

ANOTHER ANGLE - WIDE

The vast, incredible machinery creaks to a start.  Everyone
shakes Chuck's hand as he leaves the podium.

As he heads for the car, REPORTERS shout questions.

INT.  CAR - MEMPHIS FREEWAY

We are assaulted by a surge of light, motion, activity.
Snaking lines of traffic in both directions, big overpasses,
the city rising beyond.

Stan drives with a certain aggressiveness.  Chuck looks out
at the traffic, at all the activity, at the vast intricate
anthill of humanity going everywhere and nowhere.

                     CHUCK
          Take your time.

                     STAN
          What?

                     CHUCK
          That's what it's about.

                     STAN
          Being patient.  Don't rush things.  I get
          it.

He swerves into another lane.

                     CHUCK
          Not just that.  Take your time.  Use it.
          Live it.

                     STAN
          Deep, real deep.

He grins, cuts across to the exit.

                     STAN
          So where to?  The office?  The hotel?
          The beach?

Chuck stares at him.  Are you kidding?

                     STAN
          What, then?

                     CHUCK
          Deliver this package.  Then, I dunno.

                     STAN
               (re: the package)
          You want that delivered, we'll deliver
          it.  That's what we do.

                     CHUCK
          I need to do it.

                     STAN
          Finish what you started.  You haven't
          changed, Chuck.  It's still you.

Right.

                     CHUCK
          You want to help, help me find the woman
          who sent this.

INT.  OPERATIONS CENTER - DAY

Stan and Chuck are in the office of a TECHNICIAN who is
working away at his computer.  The Technician pulls the bar
code from the Angel Wing FedEx box up on his computer screen.

                     TECHNICIAN
          Okay.  After three years the PTR reverts
          to tape storage, which is okay because we
          access it through the CPC.  Here it is.
               (gestures at computer map)
          Ten packages from the same sender.  Baku.
          Delhi.  St. Petersburg.  The guy was a
          real road warrior.  This package was
          Kuala Lampur.  No activity in his account
          after this package.  No forwarding
          addresses after K.L.

                     CHUCK
          What about the sender?

                     TECHNICIAN
          Sure.  Bettina Peterson.  Marfa, Texas.
          Let's run a current check.

He works some keys, waits.

                     TECHNICIAN
          Hmmm.  Durango, Colorado; Asheville,
          North Carolina, then...canceled her
          account.

                     CHUCK
          Can you find her?

                     TECHNICIAN
          You're looking at a Level III search.
          For your Level III, you gotta have E-4
          authorization.  I don't have it.

                     STAN
          I do.

He holds out a badge.

                     TECHNICIAN
          Okay, let's let it rip.

He starts to pull up the data.

                     CHUCK
          Thanks.  For everything.

                     STAN
          No sweat.

EXT.  CHUCK'S MOTEL - THAT NIGHT

Chuck leaves the motel, the Angel Box under his arm.  He ties
it into a pannier on the side of a bicycle.

EXT.  MEMPHIS - CHICKASAW GARDENS - NIGHT

Chuck sneaks up to a craftsman cottage and stands by a tree
with a swing on it.  Inside we see Kelly making dinner for
her husband, who plays with their daughter.  For a moment
Chuck watches through the window, and we watch with him.
Then the dog begins to bark.

EXT.  CEMETERY - NIGHT

Chuck walks through the cemetery late at night.  He comes to
his gravestone, stares for a long moment at the inscription,
then takes out a spray can of paint and puts a HANDPRINT on
it.

He gets back on his bicycle and rides away.

EXT.  HIGHWAY - DAY

Chuck rides his bicycle down a road leading into the South.

EXT.  FREEWAY - DAY

Chuck negotiates an overpass crossing an Interstate Highway.
Headed in both directions, cars whoosh by beneath him.

EXT.  HIGHWAY - DUSK - LATER

Chuck rides down a narrow road, shrouded in mist.  Moss drips
from the trees reaching over the road.  A car goes by.  Then
another, their lights like halos in the fog.  It's a mystical
scene, a passage.

EXT.  ARKANSAS - NIGHT

Chuck gets off his bicycle in the rain and walks toward a
roadside cafe.

INT.  CAFE - NIGHT

Chuck draws on a paper place mat as he waits for his meal at
a counter.  Above the counter the television plays.

                     ANNOUNCER
          And here's more from Dingo Dodd, our
          Australian correspondent, on the
          extraordinary story of Chuck Noland, the
          modern Robinson Crusoe.

The waitress sets a plate down in front of Chuck, turns to
watch.

On the TV we see an Australian correspondent standing on
Chuck's beach.

                     DINGO DODD
          Shark infested waters!  A deserted
          island!  Surrounded by reefs!  Accessible
          only by helicopter!  For four years Chuck
          Noland survived here alone, eating fish,
          coconuts and clams, his only companion a
          soccer ball.

Chuck is staring at the screen, seeing his cave, seeing all
those years.

                     DINGO DODD
          I'm now in Chuck's cave where he passed
          the lonely nights, painting on the walls
          like some prehistoric caveman.  What did
          Chuck feel?  These paintings tell the
          story, but only Chuck knows what they
          mean.  And he's not talking.

On the screen we see a photograph of Chuck.

The waitress looks over at Chuck.  The other clients look at
him too.

                     CHUCK
          Check, please.

The waitress comes over.

                     WAITRESS
          No charge, honey.  But could you just
          sign that place mat for me?

Chuck looks down at his doodling.  Hesitates.  Then signs his
name.

INT.  TYSON'S CHICKEN - ARKANSAS - DAY

Thousands of chicken carcasses hanging on hooks circle
through the huge processing plant, a vast structure on the
scale of the SuperHub or the Hospital.

Chuck's Mom, dressed in white with a hairnet, enters a
windowed office in the b.g.  Through the window we see her
hug Chuck.

INT.  TYSON'S CHICKEN - OFFICE - ARKANSAS - DAY

We are in the office now.  Chuck's Mom's eyes are moist.

                     CHUCK
          When'd you start working here?

                     MOM
          Roger got me on.  I wasn't doing
          anything, and -- but you're back, you're
          really back.  I would have come to
          Memphis, but --

                     CHUCK
          I wanted to come here.

INT.  FRAME HOUSE - ARKANSAS - DAY

Chuck eats a Southern fried drumstick.  The table is full of
home-cooked food.

                     MOM
          Have some more potato salad.

Chuck gestures, no, I'm full.  She puts down the spoon.

                     CHUCK
          That was great, Mom, just great.

He looks around the house, everything in its place.  His
mother has been here for forty years.  There's a big crack
running down from the ceiling.

                     CHUCK
          I've got all this back pay coming.  Why
          don't you let me get you a place in town?

                     MOM
          This is my home.  I'm part of the
          wallpaper.

She studies him for a moment.

                     MOM
          You miss it, don't you?  You miss that
          island.

He does, but that's not it entirely.

                     CHUCK
          Miss that island?  Mom, come on.

She looks at him.  She knows her boy.

                     MOM
          What a journey you've had.  It seems more
          than a person should have to bear.

                     CHUCK
          The tide saved me, Mom.  I lived by it.
          I'm just wondering where it will take me
          next.

She looks at him, thinks about this.

                     MOM
          Remember the family motto.  In time.  It
          will come to you, in time.

EXT.  ARKANSAS - DAY

Chuck rides away from the small neat frame house, down a
country lane with trailers up on blocks.

EXT.  GULF COAST - DAY

Chuck leaves a cheap motel as the sun comes up.

EXT.  MISSISSIPPI GULF COAST - DAY - LATER

Chuck rides on a ferry, the wind blowing his face.  The sky
is gray and drizzly.  He smells the salt water.  Watches the
waves.

EXT.  GAS STATION - DAY

Chuck asks for directions.  A kid in baggy pants and no shirt
points him down the road.

EXT.  GAS STATION - MOMENTS LATER

Chuck pulls some clothes out of his saddle bags.

EXT.  GAS STATION - MOMENTS LATER

Chuck emerges from the restroom wearing a FedEx shirt and
shorts.

EXT.  BEACH HOUSE - HOUR LATER

A classic beach house.  Sand dunes, stilts.  Carrying the
Angel Wing Box under his arm, Chuck checks the address in his
hand.  Mounts the steps.  A light mist falls.  You can see
the Gulf behind the house, gray and moody.

A WOMAN, BETTINA, answers the door -- THE woman from the
beginning.  She wears cut-off jeans and a blue work shirt
covered with paint.  There's a tattoo on her ankle.

                     CHUCK
          FedEx for Bettina Peterson.

The woman stares in disbelief at the package she hasn't seen
in years and never expected to see again.

                     BETTINA
          Where did you get that?

Chuck displays a FedEx badge.

                     CHUCK
          Charles Noland.  FedEx Special Projects.

Bettina notices Chuck's bicycle.

                     BETTINA
          You came on a bicycle?  No wonder it's so
          late.

                     CHUCK
          There was an unavoidable delay.

Bettina stares at the package, her own memories coming back.

                     BETTINA
          Well, I have to say, I'm impressed.  You
          never gave up.

                     CHUCK
          No.

She holds the box and studies him for a long moment.
Something -- the look on his face, the extraordinary
reappearance of this long-lost package -- makes her curious.

                     BETTINA
          You know what happened to this?

                     CHUCK
          As much as anybody.

                     BETTINA
          Want to come in?  Get dry for a minute.

                     CHUCK
          Okay.  Sure.

She lets Chuck in the door.

INT.  HOUSE - DAY

Ladders.  Scaffolds.  Huge paintings are everywhere.
Paintings of wings and angels -- like the package.  Chuck
stares at them.  Bettina watches Chuck stare.

                     BETTINA
          I've got some coffee on.  Would you like
          some?

INT.  KITCHEN - LATER

Bettina pours some coffee.  The package sits in the counter.
Some magazines are spread around, including a People Magazine
with Chuck's photograph on the cover.

                     CHUCK
               (takes a sip)
          It's good.

They smile awkwardly at each other.  She starts to open it.

                     BETTINA
          Hmmm.  Feels like it might have gotten
          wet.

                     CHUCK
          Possible.  So you did those wings?

                     BETTINA
          Yeah.  A long time ago.

                     CHUCK
          They're harder to do than they look.

                     BETTINA
          Oh?  You've tried?

                     CHUCK
          Well, I do a little drawing --

She's opened the package.  She pulls out the bottles of salsa
and the letter.

                     CHUCK
          Our apologies that it never made it to
          the recipient.

                     BETTINA
          He was a sorry sonofabitch, and I'm sorry
          I ever married him.

There is a moment where neither knows what to say.

                     BETTINA
          You look familiar.

Her eyes start to register recognition.  She glances at the
magazine with Chuck's picture on it.  She picks it up.

                     BETTINA
          I can't believe this.  I -- I -- They
          are... You're a gifted artist.  You're
          into something very powerful.  Primal.
          Truly.

                     CHUCK
          Well, not really, I --

                     BETTINA
          You are.  Yes you are.
               (so many things she wants to
                say)
          What gave you the idea to paint on that
          cave?

Chuck thinks about that.  After a moment, he grins.

                     CHUCK
          To tell you the truth -- you did.

                     BETTINA
          Do you...have any more packages to
          deliver?

                     CHUCK
          No.  that was the last one.

                     BETTINA
          Just sit here, I'll get us some lunch.

Chuck sits back on the couch, taking in the sight of the
ocean in the light rain.  He looks over at all the canvases,
the easel, the palettes.  The wind rustles the palm trees
around the house.  The surf crashes and rustles.  Familiar
sounds.  Island sounds.

He relaxes a little.  Maybe the package with the wings was a
sign, he kept it all these years precisely for this.  Then
there's a sound of a truck in the driveway.

The engine cuts off.  There are steps on the porch.  The door
opens.  A tanned muscular MAN in neatly kept work clothes
comes in, hangs a tool belt on a hook by the door.

He looks at Chuck with a relaxed, even stare, as if seeing a
man in a FedEx uniform sitting on his couch is not an unusual
occurrence.

                     MAN
          Hey.

                     CHUCK
          Hey.

                     BETTINA (O.S.)
          In here!

The Man nods at Chuck, goes into the kitchen.  We are on
Chuck's face.  Who's this?  We hear muffled laughter from
inside.

EXT.  BEACH HOUSE - HOUR LATER

Arms around each other, the Man and the Woman say goodbye to
Chuck.  In the front yard is a panel truck painted with two
angel wings.  The Man grins at Chuck, an easy, friendly grin.

                     MAN
          Come back anytime.  Coffee's always on.
          Don't even have to bring us a package.

                     CHUCK
          That was my last one.

Bettina hands Chuck a sheet of paper.

                     BETTINA
          The list of paints and brushes I did for
          you.

He takes it, not exactly sure he wants it.

                     BETTINA
          Keep painting.  Promise me.

                     CHUCK
          Sure.

EXT.  BEACH HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

Chuck rides his bicycle away, along the shore.

EXT.  BEACH - MINUTES LATER

Chuck rides along the beach.  Up ahead we see a FedEx truck.

EXT.  BEACH - MOMENTS LATER

Chuck gets off his bike as a female FEDEX DRIVER puts chocks
under the wheels, which have stuck in the sand.

                     CHUCK
          Need some help?

                     DRIVER
          You bet I do.  High tide comes right up
          to this road.

EXT.  BEACH - MOMENTS LATER

Chuck pushes on the truck as the driver gives it gas.  The
truck slowly pulls back onto the pavement.

EXT.  BEACH - MOMENTS LATER

The Driver gets out of the truck with a grin.  She has an
open, friendly face.  There's an instant connection between
them.

                     DRIVER
          Hey, thanks.  I'd never have got that out
          by myself.

Looks at his uniform.  At the bike.

                     DRIVER
          You're not out of Pascagoula, are you?

                     CHUCK
          No.

Where is he from, anyway?

                     CHUCK
          I used to drive one of those.  A long
          time ago.

                     DRIVER
          Hey, once a driver, always a driver.  You
          want a lift?  I've just got one more
          pickup.

                     CHUCK
          Sure.

He picks up his bike.

INT.  FEDEX TRUCK - MOMENTS LATER

The FedEx truck makes its way down the beach, Chuck in his
uniform, the Driver in hers.  Two FedEx people in a truck.
The Driver looks over at Chuck.

                     DRIVER
          You're Chuck Noland.

                     CHUCK
          Yeah.

                     DRIVER/ERICA
          I knew it!  You're a legend!  Mr.
          Robinson Crusoe.

                     CHUCK
          Well --

                     ERICA
          I knew I recognized you.  My name's
          Erica.

They smile at each other.  Then she smiles a little more.

                     ERICA
          Did you really steal a crippled kid's
          bicycle to make your deliveries, or is
          that just some bullshit story?

                     CHUCK
          I didn't steal it, and he wasn't
          crippled.

Erica laughs.

                     ERICA
          Otherwise it's completely true.

And that makes Chuck laugh, really laugh, for the first time.

                     CHUCK
          Yeah, completely.

She looks over at him with a grin.

                     ERICA
          What brings you out to the sticks?

                     CHUCK
          Had a package to deliver.

                     ERICA
          You?  Personally?

                     CHUCK
          I had it on the island with me.

                     ERICA
          Must be a story there.

There's a connection building here, effortlessly.

EXT.  BEACH - MOMENTS LATER

We are wide on the beach, watching the truck move along the
water, kicking up wisps of sand.

                     CHUCK (V.O.)
          Yeah, a long one.

                     ERICA (V.O.)
          I've got lots of time.

                     CHUCK (V.O.)
          So do I.

The truck goes down the beach and then turns inland, away
from the ocean.  Away from all that.

                     CHUCK (V.O.)
          So do I.

And we pull back, taking in the sweep of the beach, the
estuaries, and the green forest stretching back into America.

The end is the beginning.

FADE OUT.
CAST AWAY

                                               THIRD DRAFT

                                               March 13, 1998




FADE IN:

EXT.  MARFA, TEXAS - 1993 - WIDE - DAY

The Texas plains, horizon to horizon, nothing but the browns
and ochres of earth and the blue and violet of the sky.  The
sheer scope of it sinks in:  the blank slate of nature, the
absence of man.  On the screen superimpose:

                    MARFA, TEXAS, 1993.

CREDITS BEGIN.

A plume of dust comes into frame.  The dust is from a TRUCK,
orange and white and violet, with "FedEx" blazoned across the
side.

The truck turns into a collection of ramshackle World War II
era Quonset huts and outbuildings.  Around the outbuildings
are large sculptures of wood and metal.

EXT.  QUONSET HUT - DAY

The door is opened by a WOMAN in her late twenties.  Hair
pulled back, casual, an artist.  She hands the DRIVER a FedEx
BOX which is decorated with a drawing of two ANGEL WINGS.
The Driver has a hand-held computer; a portable printer
dangles from his belt.

The Driver scans the package with his hand-held computer,
prints out a label and sticks it on the Box, ready to go.
But something on the box catches her eye.  She wants it back.
He glances at his watch.  She draws RINGS around the Wings,
uniting them.  She gives the box to the Driver, then hands
him a cup of coffee.  They've done this before.

He takes a sip of the coffee, then runs for the truck.  He
jumps in and heads back onto the plains.

EXT.  FEDEX OFFICE - MIDLAND/ODESSA - NIGHT - HOURS LATER

The Driver jams the distinctive Angel Wing Box on top of a
dolly and loads it into a CONTAINER with clear plastic sides.
A female Loader slaps a large bar code label on the
container, scans it, then pulls the container across a belt
of rollers onto a larger truck.  The doors of the truck
close.  The latch slams down.

A forklift hoists the container to the cargo doors of a 737.

EXT.  MEMPHIS AIRPORT SUPERHUB - NIGHT

The 737 lands.

EXT.  SUPERHUB - NIGHT - MINUTES LATER

One of a seemingly endless line of FedEx planes, our 737
taxis to a gate at the FedEx SUPERHUB.  The Hub is a vast
living organism -- loud, complex, overwhelming, as much a
symbol of modern life as was the factory in Modern Times.

Five thousand people work in a frenzy of interconnected
activity inside three vast hangers brightly lit.  Hundreds of
forklifts and cargo-pullers dart about, their headlights
crisscrossing like a laser show.

Loaders quickly roll the container onto a FORKLIFT.

INT.  MEMPHIS SUPERHUB - NIGHT

The forklift speeds inside one of the hangers to a LOADING
BELT, where our Box is spilled into a Mississippi River of
packages, HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS of them, all shapes and
sizes, from shoe boxes to engine blocks.  Large mechanical
arms divert the immense flow of Workers at dozens of
stations.  The packages surge and move.

The Workers place the packages label-side-up on new belts,
where they're scanned by laser readers.  Picking up speed our
Box is shunted across the acres of interlocking belts.

The Box ends up in a much larger CONTAINER labeled CDG.

EXT.  MEMPHIS SUPERHUB - NIGHT

A forklift lifts the Container to a door on a giant MD-11.

INT.  GLOBAL OPERATIONS CENTER - NIGHT

A jumbled room jammed with computers and dominated by a HUGE
WALL GRAPHIC that charts hundreds of airplanes.  An Operator
moves a yellow strip labeled Jumbo 12 across the board.

EXT.  CHARLES DE GAULLE AIRPORT - DAY

SERIES OF SHOTS

The giant place touches down in Paris.  The Angel Wing Box
moves quickly on another belt and disappears into another
CONTAINER, which is loaded onto still another AIRPLANE.

EXT.  ST. PETERSBURG AIRPORT, RUSSIA - NIGHT

The plane lands.  The container is unloaded down a belt.  We
see our Angel Box.  Directly in front of it is a DENTED BOX.

INT.  ST. PETERSBURG FEDEX OFFICE, RUSSIA

SERIES OF SHOTS

Night.  The manic activity has come to a dead stop.  Our two
Boxes sit on a table in a corner not far from a small
Christmas tree.

Daylight now.  YURI, a Supervisor, saunters over, picks up
the Angel Box, sees an attractive co-worker, puts it down.

Night again.  A cat walks by the table where our two Boxes
have come to rest.

EXT.  ST. PETERSBURG FEDEX OFFICE - DAY

A FedEx truck pulls out of the warehouse.  The walls of the
warehouse are covered with graffiti.  The streets are slushy,
the buildings blanketed in snow.

EXT.  ST. PETERSBURG - DAY

The Driver sits in the truck drinking tea.  He takes a last
sip, sighs, gets out with the Angel Box.  Walks slowly toward
an APARTMENT HOUSE.

EXT.  ST. PETERSBURG APARTMENT HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

A beautiful young RUSSIAN WOMAN opens the door.  A young
AMERICAN MAN comes up behind her, signs the form and takes
the Angel Box.  We see Christmas decorations inside.  The
woman puts her arms around him as the door closes.

                     RUSSIAN WOMAN (O.S.)
               (accented English)
          It's pretty.  Who is it from?

                     AMERICAN MAN (O.S.)
          My wife.

We stay with the Driver as he ambles back toward the truck.

EXT.  ST. PETERSBURG OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER

The Driver has just delivered the Dented Box to ALEKSEI,
Russian Businessman, who closes the door of a Czarist-era
building.  Aleksei checks his watch, picks up the phone.

EXT.  FEDEX OFFICES - MANILA - DAY

CHUCK NOLAND, early thirties, walks along a line of brightly
colored jitneys, each bearing the FedEx logo.  With him is a
Filipino FedEx SUPERVISOR wearing a guayabera.  Chuck
glistens with a thin layer of sweat.

                     CHUCK
          My guess is we're talking fuel filters
          here, Fernando.  The gas is dirty, these
          jitneys get in the mountains, their
          engines cut out.

                     FERNANDO
          That could lose us half an hour.

                     CHUCK
          Easy.  Each way.

His beeper goes off.

INT.  FEDEX OFFICES - MANILA - DAY - MOMENTS LATER

Chuck is on the phone.

                     CHUCK
          So it finally turned up...

Chuck hesitates for a moment, then looks at his watch.

                     CHUCK
          I'll catch the sweep tonight.

INT.  FEDEX PLANE - NIGHT

Strapped into the jump seat behind the pilots, Chuck sleeps
with a mask over his eyes.  On his lap are some travel
brochures.  We see sailboats, we see the Florida keys.

EXT.  ST. PETERSBURG FEDEX OFFICES - DAY

Christmas in Russia.  Snow everywhere.  Brightly colored
lights.  Chucks gets out of a Volga with Aleksei.  He has a
bag over his shoulder, the dented package under one arm.

INT.  FEDEX OFFICES - DAY

The staff has assembled near the loading dock.  Yuri the
station manager stands in front, occasionally catching the
eye of the attractive woman.  Chuck displays the FedEx box.

                     CHUCK
          It took this test package thirty-two
          hours to get from Seattle to St.
          Petersburg, a distance of nine thousand
          miles.  And then it took forty-one hours
          to get from our warehouse in St.
          Petersburg to here, a distance of,
          what --

                     ALEKSEI
          Six kilometers.  Four miles.

                     CHUCK
          So how are we going to get this place
          shaped up?

There's a muttered chorus of answers.

                     CHUCK
          There's only one way.  We have to work
          together.  Every one of us depends on
          everyone else.  If one package is late,
          we are all late.  If one truck misses the
          deadline, we all miss the deadline.
          Let's start by taking a look around.

Chuck leads his team through the sorting area.  Yuri squeezes
right next to him, ostentatiously carrying a clipboard.
Chuck stops.

                     CHUCK
          Here, this table is too far from the
          wall.  Packages can slip down...like...
               (pulls out a package from
                behind a table)
          ...this.

He hefts the package, as if trying to guess what's inside.

                     CHUCK
          What could be in here?  Let's say one of
          you sent it.  Could be the closing papers
          on your dacha, could be a toy for your
          grandson's birthday, could be a kidney to
          keep your mother alive.  I don't think
          you want your mother's kidney to end up
          behind a table.

The Sorter shoves the table against the wall.  Yuri says
something to the Translator.

                     TRANSLATOR
          He says they have been very busy.  It is
          hard to get good employees.  He is sure
          you understand.

Wrong answer:  Chuck glances sharply at Yuri.  Aleksei
appears with a cellular phone.

                     ALEKSEI
          Phone call.  Malaysia.

Chuck takes the phone, opening his BAG as he does so.

                     CHUCK
          Kamal?  Right.  I'm getting them.

He pulls out a set of blueprints and tacks them to a bulletin
board as he talks.

                     CHUCK
          I'm looking at the blueprints of K.L.
          right now.  The belts are too small for
          the sorters.  Yeah, sometimes you never
          see what's right in front of your face.
          Look, it's --

Chuck keeps an eye on what is going on in the warehouse.
Then he notices something over by one of the trucks.

                     CHUCK
               (to a loader)
          Hold it!  Hazardous material needs its
          own container!
               (back on the phone)
          -- three in the afternoon there, right?
          That gives you five hours until the sweep
          comes through.  Do the sort by hand
          tonight, then put in a new feeder belt,
          say a twenty-four incher.  Yes, overtime
          is authorized.

He hangs up the phone.  He turns to the crew.

                     CHUCK
          I'm going out on every route, I'm going
          to work every job here, until I know
          enough to help you.  That's it.

The crew disperses back to work.  Chuck and Aleksei walk
toward the office.  They've done this before.  Chuck lets a
corner of his command persona slip.

                     ALEKSEI
          It's bad.

                     CHUCK
          Worse than Warsaw.

                     ALEKSEI
          Nobody remembers that.

                     CHUCK
          The failures they remember.  It's the
          successes they forget.

EXT.  ST. PETERSBURG - DAY - MOMENTS LATER

A FedEx truck pulls out of the FedEx office.  Chuck is
inside.  He notices the graffiti on the walls.

INT.  TRUCK - MOMENTS LATER

Chuck rides next to LEV, the driver, a serious sort.  The
Translator squats on some boxes between them, trying to keep
his balance.

                     CHUCK
          You sorted your packages before you left.
          None of the other drivers did.

The Translator and Lev exchange a few words.

                     TRANSLATOR
          He says he wants to be organized.  Do
          packages in order.

Chuck looks at Lev with respect.  Right answer.

                     CHUCK
          So how come the other drivers haven't
          left yet?

The Translator asks Lev, who looks at him as if he is crazy,
then snorts an answer.  The Translator blushes.

                     TRANSLATOR
          He says -- he is a very rude fellow --

                     CHUCK
          Tell me exactly what he said.

                     TRANSLATOR
          He says why don't his farts smell sweet?

Chuck grins.  Lev shrugs and says something else.

                     TRANSLATOR
          He says that's just the way it is.

                     CHUCK
          Lev -- it's Lev, right?  Listen, this is
          FedEx.  We don't have to accept the way
          it is.

EXT.  HOTEL - ST. PETERSBURG

A weary Chuck enters the hotel.  In the sky above him we see
the Northern Lights.  He doesn't even look up.

INT.  HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT - LATER

Chuck is watching CNN on the television, working his
PowerBook, and holding the phone.

                     CHUCK
          No, keep trying.  A circuit's bound to
          open up.

He hangs up.

                     CHUCK
               (to himself)
          Those damn Northern Lights.

Just then the lights go off.  For a moment everything is
darkness.  Then a small light switches on.  Chuck has a
headlamp on.

He gets up, heads into the bathroom.  We stay in the bedroom.
After only a moment, the light reemerges.  It heads over to
his bag.  We go with it.

Chuck takes out a roll of toilet paper.  The guy is prepared
for anything.  He goes into the bathroom, closes the door.

The lights come back on just as the phone rings.

We hear scuffling sounds on the other side of the door.
Chuck charges out, holding up his pants.

Grabs the phone.

                     CHUCK
          Hello?  Great.  Try it.

He waits.  We hear an ANSWERING MACHINE.

                     KELLY (V.O.)
          This is Kelly, leave me a message and
          I'll call you back soon as I can.

This is not what Chuck wanted to hear.

                     CHUCK
          Kelly, damn, look, this is Chuck.  I'm
          going to be a little late.  Well, more
          than a little.  I had to go to Russia.
          Couldn't be helped.  Could you call and
          cancel the trip?  Look, we'll sail the
          Keys in March.  It's better then anyway.
          I'll be back before Christmas.  I
          promise.  I think.  I mean, I will.  I,
          uh --

He's stumbling over whether to say I love you.

                     CHUCK
          I miss you.

He gently hangs up the phone.

INT.  FEDEX OFFICES - ST. PETERSBURG - SERIES OF SHOTS

A surprised Yuri stands with the attractive assistant as
Chuck takes his clipboard away.

An even more surprised Lev stands by his truck as Chuck hands
the clipboard to him.

Chuck and the loaders clean off the graffiti.

Working alongside the sorters as the packages come in, Chuck
points out how to organize the inflow.

Chuck and Lev go over large maps of St. Petersburg with the
drivers.

INT.  FEDEX WAREHOUSE - ST. PETERSBURG - WEEK LATER

A big semi is being loaded with outgoing packages for the
airport run.  Aleksei, Chuck, Lev and the office executives
watch as containers are rolled on.

                     LEV
          We've never got all the trucks in on
          time.  Never.

Chucks looks at the clock.

                     CHUCK
          Only one still left?

                     LEV
          Route six.

Aleksei points at the big semi.

                     ALEKSEI
          If we don't send it now we may miss the
          connection in Paris.

The pressure in on.  Chuck looks around at his team.

                     CHUCK
               (to Aleksei)
          Give it five minutes.

EXT.  FEDEX OFFICES - ST. PETERSBURG - MINUTES LATER

The last truck rolls in.

INT.  FEDEX OFFICES - ST. PETERSBURG

The last truck enters and loading dock.  A few loaders move
toward it.  The executives all stand and watch.  But not
Chuck.  He's hands on.

                     CHUCK
          Let's go.

He heads toward the truck and begins pulling off packages.
All the other executives follow him.

INT.  FEDEX OFFICES - ST. PETERSBURG - MINUTES LATER

Led by Chuck, who works like a man possessed, they sort the
packages.

                     CHUCK
          That's Bermuda.  Bermuda is in the
          Memphis thru container.  No, Azores is
          Europe.

He gestures at a closed container.

                     CHUCK
          The Paris container.  Africa too.  Japan
          goes to Memphis.

Chuck is everywhere, setting the example.  The whole office
is energized, working together.

INT.  FEDEX OFFICES - ST. PETERSBURG - MINUTES LATER

They load the last container on the waiting truck.  Chuck
pounds the truck on the side.  Go.

The truck roars out of the loading dock.

Everyone takes a breath.  They are happy, proud.

                     LEV
          We did it.  All of them.

                     CHUCK
          Great job, everyone.  Remember, work
          together.  We are like a hand...

They've heard this before.  Lev holds up his hand just before
Chuck does.

                     LEV
          One finger, weak.  All fingers working
          together, strong.

This makes Chuck smile.

                     CHUCK
          You got it.

EXT.  CHARLES DE GAULLE AIRPORT - DAY

A FedEx MD-11 is being loaded with huge containers of
freight.  Chuck goes up the gangway next to the forklifts.

INT.  MD-11 - MOMENTS LATER

The pilots -- JACK and GWEN -- are going down their check
lists.  Chuck sticks his head in the cockpit.

                     CHUCK
          I absolutely, positively, have to get to
          Memphis overnight.

                     JACK
          Can't help you.  Try UPS.

                     CHUCK
          Jack -- gotta be something wrong with our
          physicals, you keep getting certified to
          fly.  Gwen, aren't you worried?

                     GWEN
          Terrified.

                     CHUCK
          We're on time, right?

                     JACK
          On time, Chuck.

Chuck hands Jack and Gwen small packages.

                     CHUCK
          Little present from the emerging
          republics.

Another FedEx Road Warrior named STAN gets on.  He and Chuck
are obviously old hands at this.

                     CHUCK
          What connects the world?  What makes it
          one?
               (they ignore him)
          We do.  FedEx.

                     GWEN
          You are such a lifer.

                     STAN
          What do you expect, from the guy who
          stole a kid's bicycle when his truck
          broke down?

                     CHUCK
          Borrowed.  I borrowed it.

The two of them strap in.

                     STAN
          How'd it go?

                     CHUCK
          Great.  Terrific.  The good guys won one
          for a change.

He's finished a tough job.  He's relaxed and on his way home.
But Stan's his boss, and Stan's got bad news.

                     STAN
          I had to bump your plane last night.

Chuck can't believe it.

                     CHUCK
          You what?

                     STAN
          It was fifteen minutes late.

The plane begins to taxi.

                     CHUCK
          I checked the weather, you had the jet
          stream, you could have made it up.

                     STAN
          But I might not have.

                     CHUCK
          Jesus.  I got it working... You have no
          idea how hard it was... They're finally a
          team...

                     STAN
          I'm touched.

                     CHUCK
          You fucked us over.

                     STAN
          The point of FedEx, as I understand it,
          is to make the damn connection.

                     CHUCK
          I was making a point.

                     STAN
          What?  Let Paris hold its plane?  Let
          Memphis take care of it?  Let somebody
          down the line clean up your mess?

                     CHUCK
          Every person counts, every package
          counts, that's my point.

                     STAN
          You know what your problem is?  You just
          see the packages in front of you.  You
          don't see the big picture.

                     CHUCK
          Baloney.  I do see the damn "big
          picture."

EXT.  CHARLES DE GAULLE AIRPORT - NIGHT

The MD-11 takes off.

INT.  MD-11 - NIGHT

Chuck is focused on his PowerBook with the screen away from
us, Stan is doing tai chi amidst the FedEx containers.  It
feels a little surreal, all those containers surrounding
them.

Stan comes over, looks at the image on the computer.  It's a
sailboat with some technical specifications under it.

                     STAN
          I didn't know we had sailboats.

                     CHUCK
          It's a ketch Kelly and I had chartered.

                     STAN
          For all those vacation days you got
          coming.

Chuck doesn't look up.

                     CHUCK
          And never take.

                     STAN
          Look, I'm sorry about your plane.  But I
          couldn't risk being late into Memphis.

                     CHUCK
          Forget it.

                     STAN
          You know General McLelland, he wouldn't
          attack unless he had everything just
          right.  Finally Abe Lincoln came to him
          and said, General, if you're not going to
          use my army, could I borrow it for a
          while?  So he gave it to Grant and Grant
          just said, let's go.

                     CHUCK
          I'm from Arkansas.  Tell me a story with
          Robert E. Lee in it and maybe I'll pay
          attention.

                     STAN
          We're warriors, not desk jockeys.  We've
          got to be bold.  You always want all your
          ducks lined up.  But nothing's 100
          percent.  It's always 60-40, maybe 51-49.
          Hell, I'd take 40-60.  Then roll the
          dice.

                     CHUCK
          That's why you're a gambling man.

                     STAN
          That's why I'm running foreign and you're
          not.  That's why you're not married and I
          am.

                     CHUCK
          For the third time.

                     STAN
          Take the plunge, admit your mistakes,
          move on to tomorrow.  That's FedEx,
          that's women, that's life.

Stan is so outrageous, Chuck can't help but laugh.

                     CHUCK
          You are one sick fucker.

                     STAN
          I'm trying to help you here.  There's
          Warsaw, there's this --

                     CHUCK
          This was nothing like Warsaw.  I held the
          truck then minutes, it's not that big a
          deal.

But apparently it is.

                     STAN
          Look, that kids' bike, that's a guy
          who'll do what it takes to get there on
          time.  Live up to your legend, that's all
          I'm saying.

Chuck reaches in his pocket, pulls out a bill.

                     CHUCK
          A hundred rubles St. Petersburg hits 95
          percent in a month.

                     STAN
          Ninety five percent?  Just give me the
          money now.

                     CHUCK
          Talk is cheap.  Are we on or not?

                     STAN
          We're on.

Chuck closes the PowerBook.

                     CHUCK
          Let's go off-line.

They both take out their Valium -- the price they pay for
being such road warriors.

                     CHUCK
          Two Valium...

Stan puts on his Walkman.

                     STAN
          And the Stones.  Got to be.

It's their ritual.  Chuck puts headphones from his Walkman
over his ears, puts a mask over his eyes and leans his head
back onto the headrest.  We hear the Rolling Stones.

EXT.  MEMPHIS AIRPORT - NIGHT - WIDE

The MD-11 arrives at its gate.  The cargo doors open.
Forklifts and a gangway roll up to the side.

INT.  MD-11 - NIGHT

Stan stands smiling over Chuck.

                     STAN
          Chuck.  Wake up Chuck.

Chuck pulls off the mask, takes out the earplugs.  He manages
a groggy grin.

                     STAN
          You gotta do your own delivery from here.

INT.  SUPERHUB - NIGHT

Chuck walks through the extraordinary nexus of speeding
packages that intersect in intricate paths above and around
him.  This is the beating center of the FedEx world, the
crossroads, the deep core where everything connects.  In his
still-drugged state it all seems weirdly psychedelic.  A
Christmas tree goes by, then a huge plastic Santa Claus, both
with shipping labels.

EXT.  CHICKASAW GARDENS - MEMPHIS - NIGHT

Chuck's car pulls into the driveway of a small cottage in an
older Memphis neighborhood.  The radio is playing the news.

INT.  CHUCK'S HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

Chuck drops his briefcase and his bag.  The place is a jumble
of clothes, papers, books, etc.  In the living room is a tank
of tropical fish.  The water looks a little green.  No
bubbles are coming from the filter.

Uh oh.

Chuck walks to the tank.  He tightens a piece of tape that
holds the power cord onto the filter, taps the filter with
his finger, once, twice...the bubbles start again.

                     CHUCK
          Damn thing.

But for a couple of fish floating on top of the tank it's too
late.

Chuck gets out his scoop and slowly skims them off.

                     CHUCK
          Sorry, I'm really sorry.

EXT.  CHUCK'S HOUSE - BACK YARD

Chuck digs a small hole in the back yard with a large kitchen
spoon.

Drops the dead fish in.

Fills the hole.

INT.  CHUCK'S HOUSE - LATER

The CD is playing.  Chuck lies in bed, switches on the TV.
This is no good.  He doesn't care how late it is, he's going
to find Kelly.

EXT.  MEMPHIS - NIGHT - LATER

Chuck drives in his car through the streets of Memphis.

EXT.  UNIVERSITY - NIGHT

Chuck pulls up to a lab building at Memphis State.

INT.  LAB - NIGHT

Two doctoral candidates are playing Doom on their computers
when Chuck walks in.

                     CHUCK
          You seen Kelly Frears?

One of them gestures toward a door.

                     GUY
          Xerox machine.

INT.  HALLWAY - NIGHT

Chuck makes his way in the semi-darkness past rack after rack
of specimens in bottles.

Ahead of him we see the flashing green light of a Xerox
machine.

INT.  XEROX ROOM

The light goes off.  KELLY leans over the machine, bangs on
it.

                     KELLY
          Sonofabitch!

                     CHUCK
          Hey, be nice to it, it'll be nice to you.

Surprised, Kelly turns to greet Chuck.

                     KELLY
          Chuck!  You're back!

She leaps into his arms.

                     KELLY
          Your eyes are puffy.  Did you take Valium
          again?

                     CHUCK
          You smell like formaldehyde.

Kelly looks over at the Xerox.

                     KELLY
          My last chapter's in there, and the damn
          machine's jammed.

                     CHUCK
          Let's take a look.

He lifts up the cover.

                     KELLY
          How was Russia?

                     CHUCK
          Cold.

                     KELLY
          Don't overwhelm me with details, you know
          how I hate that.  Did you get it fixed?

                     CHUCK
          I thought I did.

He pries up one feeder, then another.

                     CHUCK
          Got to follow the paper path here.

                     KELLY
          Chuck, forget the Xerox.  So Russia
          didn't turn out well?

But Chuck doesn't want to talk.  He's focused on the machine.

                     CHUCK
          Used to you could fix these yourself.

She pulls him out of the machine.  He has toner on his
fingers.

                     KELLY
          Chuck.

                     CHUCK
          What do you want me to say?  That I
          thought I'd done a great job but it all
          turned to shit?  That I might as well
          have gone sailing for all the good I did?

                     KELLY
          Yeah, tell me.  Tell me all of it.

He suddenly looks really tired.

                     KELLY
          You don't even know what time it is.
          What day it is.

He turns to the Xerox in frustration.

                     CHUCK
          And I can't fix this damn machine.

She looks at him.

                     KELLY
          Come on.

INT.  KELLY'S OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER

A tiny cubicle with a door.  She closes it, takes some paper
towels out of the desk, wipes his fingers.

                     KELLY
          We're on the deck of the ketch, the air's
          soft, the water's clear as crystal...

She licks the last bit of toner off his fingers.

                     CHUCK
          That's carcinogenic.

She ignores that, stays with the fantasy.

                     KELLY
          We're covered with suntan lotion and
          sweat.  Our skin is so hot, it's
          glowing...

And she comes closer to him.

                     KELLY
          We could take a swim.

She's really close now.

                     CHUCK
          On the other hand we could not take a
          swim...

They squiggle themselves onto the desk.

INT.  LAB - NIGHT

Someone kicks the door shut.  Now the figures are in
silhouette, lit by the light in the office.

And then the light goes out.

EXT.  FEDEX OFFICES - NEXT MORNING

A nondescript office park near the airport.  No sign.
Chuck's car screeches into the parking lot.  He jumps out,
glances at this watch, and heads for the building at a run.

INT.  EXECUTIVE CONFERENCE ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

A large room dominated by an animated MAP OF THE WORLD.
Lights at various locations blink and flash.  Above the map
are a large Sign saying "Here Today, Gone Tomorrow" and two
huge digital Clocks -- one keeping time, the other a
countdown clock for that day's package sort at the SuperHub.

The operations team of FedEx sits around a large table.  Each
has on a headset.  BECCA TWIGG, the business-like senior vice
president of Operations, addresses questions to a man --
COLIN PARKER-BOWLES, the European operations manager -- on a
LARGE TV SCREEN in front of her.  "London" is superimposed on
the screen.

                     BECCA
          So why was Milan late, Colin?

                     COLIN
          One of the race horses coming from
          Ireland got colic and had to be off-
          loaded in Brussels.  That put the Jumbo
          15, six hours late into Charles De
          Gaulle.  Customs had difficulty locating
          the dutiable items...

Colin continues as Chuck, out of breath, slips under the
screen and heads for the one remaining vacant seat -- across
from Stan.  Next to Stan is MAYNARD GRAHAM, an MBA systems
man.  Becca addresses a question over to Stan.

                     BECCA
          Stan, can we get P&A down to work with
          Milan customs?

                     STAN
          We're already on it.

                     BECCA
          Good.  And let's look at our live animal
          policy.  I don't think the income stream
          justifies delaying IP product, especially
          at Christmas.

Colin disappears.  A red light goes on.  Becca pushes a
button.  Another face comes on the screen.  "Oakland" appears
under the face.

                     BECCA
          Stand by, Benson, we're still wrapping up
          foreign.

She turns pointedly to Chuck.

                     BECCA
          Chuck, thanks for joining us.  Status?

Chuck swallows nervously, tries to talk matter-of-factly.

                     CHUCK
          Becca, as you know St. Petersburg was
          consistently running late by six to ten
          hours -- sometimes a full day or more.  I
          replaced the station manager.  We
          identified inefficiencies and worked out
          a quality improvement plan I believe can
          be met.

                     MAYNARD
          You replaced the station manager with a
          driver.  A local with no knowledge of our
          systems.

                     BECCA
          Shouldn't you have brought in someone
          from Memphis?  Russia is priority one.

                     MAYNARD
          James Pottinger is available.

The process is being ripped out of Chuck's hands.  He
struggles to get an answer.

                     STAN
          He's a numbers cruncher.  Chuck's done
          all the right things here...

Stan is doing his best to back up Chuck.

                     CHUCK
          Jim's a terrific financial man, no
          question.  But we can't always parachute
          in from Memphis.  We've got to build up
          our local staff.

                     MAYNARD
          We've got to improve foreign on-time,
          that's what we've got to do.  If this new
          guy's so good, how come the very first
          plane he sent missed the connection in
          Paris?

Maynard knows how to go for the jugular.  Everyone looks at
Chuck.

                     CHUCK
          We're building a new team here.  We got
          every package on the truck for the first
          time ever.  Success is the best teacher.

                     MAYNARD
          I don't call missing the plane a success.

Everyone looks at Chuck.

EXT.  KELLY'S HOUSE - DAY - LATE THAT AFTERNOON

Chuck lugs a big package up to the door, knocks on it.  Kelly
opens the door.

                     KELLY
          Merry Christmas eve.

                     CHUCK
          Not if you work for FedEx.

INT.  KELLY'S HOUSE - DAY

Chuck enters as they keep talking.  Her house is cozy but
also where she works.  There's a computer, specimen jars, and
some terrariums with frogs inside.  A Christmas tree with
packages under it.

                     KELLY
          You break four million packages last
          night?

In the b.g. one of the packages by the Christmas tree is
starting to shake on its own.

                     CHUCK
          Four four.  A record.

                     KELLY
          You don't seem too happy about it.

                     CHUCK
          Ah, the staff meeting could have gone
          better.

                     KELLY
          Let me guess, Russia came up?

Chuck's attention goes to the tree.

                     CHUCK
          One of those packages just moved.

The package turns over, something darts out.  It's a puppy,
with a bow around its neck.

                     KELLY
          Merry Christmas.

Chuck bends down to see the puppy.

                     CHUCK
          Hey, look at you.

                     KELLY
          I figure, if we could take care of a
          puppy, we could, you know, take care
          of --

A baby, she wants to say, but that's going a little fast so
she catches herself.  Chuck picks the puppy up.

                     CHUCK
          He is a cute thing.

                     KELLY
          He's your cute thing.

                     CHUCK
          I can't even keep fish alive.

                     KELLY
          A puppy's got a little more personality
          than a fish.

                     CHUCK
          And for you --

Chuck hands over his present.

                     KELLY
          So do good things come in large packages?

Kelly opens Chuck's present -- a very large box.

It's a piece of luggage.

                     CHUCK
          You know, for when you travel.

                     KELLY
          For when I travel?

She can't believe it.  It's the exact opposite of what she
wanted.

                     KELLY
          You should have got me something that
          shows you want us to be together, not
          apart.

Chuck is flummoxed.  Women read so much into things.

                     CHUCK
          I wasn't sending a message.  I though
          you'd like it.

Chuck's beeper goes off.

                     KELLY
          You should have got me a ring.

He checks the number.

                     CHUCK
          I have to go.  I'm on call for overflow
          down at the Hub.

                     KELLY
          A ring.  I wanted a ring.

                     CHUCK
          You did?

She nods.  What to do?

                     CHUCK
          Look, I love the puppy.  I love you.  But
          I have to go.

                     KELLY
          You can't go now.

                     CHUCK
          I have to.

                     KELLY
          You want to.

Chuck picks up the puppy.

                     CHUCK
          What should we call him?  Or is it her?
          How about Jango?

Kelly is having one of those moments when everything comes
clear.

                     KELLY
          This isn't working out.

                     CHUCK
          We're a little emotional here.  It's
          Christmas, maybe we're over-reacting.

                     KELLY
          "We're" not over-reacting.

                     CHUCK
          Could you watch Jango?

                     KELLY
          No.

                     CHUCK
          I can't take him to work.

He hands her the puppy.

                     CHUCK
          We'll talk about it when I come back.
          It'll all be fine.  Really.

This is not a happy woman he is leaving behind.

EXT.  KELLY'S HOUSE - HOUSE LATER

It's dark now.  Chuck returns.  The stars are putting on an
amazing show, but he doesn't notice as he heads for the door.

INT.  KELLY'S HOUSE - MINUTES LATER

Chuck enters.  The tree and the presents under it are gone.

                     CHUCK
          Kelly?  Kelly?

No answer, nothing but the sound of Jango, who begins yelping
in the kitchen.

INT.  KELLY'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER

Chuck picks up Jango, who is barricaded in the kitchen with
some food, some water, and some wet newspapers.

                     CHUCK
          There.  There.  Easy now.

EXT.  KELLY'S HOUSE - BACK YARD - NIGHT - MINUTES LATER

Holding Jango, Chuck walks out into the back yard.

                     CHUCK
          Kelly?

A fire still smolders.  The packages have burned.  The tree
is a blackened mess.

Chuck stares at it.

EXT.  CHUCK'S HOUSE - NEXT MORNING

Chuck gets into his car, puts Jango on the front seat next to
him.  Pulls out of the driveway.

EXT.  ARKANSAS HIGHWAY - DAY

Chuck is in his car, with the dog on his lap.

EXT.  FARM HOUSE - DAY

Chuck's car drives up to a typical Arkansas farm house.  His
MOM is setting some Christmas tree lights around the door.
Chuck gets out of the car.  There's a large wet spot on the
front of his pants.

                     MOM
          What happened to your pants?

                     CHUCK
          Mom, meet Jango.

Chuck displays the puppy.

EXT.  FARM HOUSE - SHED - DAY

Chuck works on an old tractor in the shed.  Some small legs
appear in his vision, then a small face.  This is AMANDA, his
niece.

                     AMANDA
          Dinner's ready.

INT.  FARM HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY

Around the table are Chuck's brother ROGER, his wife MARY,
Amanda, and her TWO BROTHERS.  Mom brings in the turkey,
places it on the table, sits down.  They all hold hands and
bow their heads.

                     MOM
          Chuck?

Chuck hesitates just a moment.

                     CHUCK
          Bless us O Lord, and these thy gifts,
          which we are about to receive, from thou
          bounty, through Christ the Lord.  Amen.

                     ROGER
          Let's eat.

EXT.  FARM HOUSE - LATER THAT DAY

The children burst out the door, shrieking, chased by Jango.

INT.  FARM HOUSE - DAY

The grown-ups are cleaning up after Christmas dinner.  The
scene moves between the table, the kitchen counter, and the
refrigerator.  It's an old-fashioned kitchen, simply
furnished.

                     MARY
          How's Kelly?

                     CHUCK
          Great.

                     ROGER
          Thought you were going to bring her.

                     CHUCK
          So did I.

                     MOM
          It seemed like she had such a good time
          last time.

                     CHUCK
          It's nothing you did, Mom, believe me.

                     MARY
          Jennifer's still down at the post office.
          And she's still got that crush on you.

                     ROGER
          And she's still got those --

                     MARY
          Roger.

                     ROGER
          You should have stuck around.

This is an old, sore subject.

                     CHUCK
          Look, I help take care of the place.  You
          got my check, didn't you Mom?

                     MOM
          That new roof, that's your doing.

                     ROGER
          You're just allergic to farming, that's
          what dad said.  Can't stand to be alone.
          Can't stand to be in one place.  Can't
          stand the sight of...blood.

He drops the turkey giblets into the trash.

                     MARY
          Roger's going to put chickens in here.

Chuck can't believe this.

                     CHUCK
          Come on Roger, this is dad all over
          again.  You already did beefalo,
          chinchillas, and what was that, ostrich?
          They chased Mom around the yard, sprained
          her hip.

Mom goes to the freezer and takes out some frozen
strawberries.

                     MOM
          It wasn't that bad, dear.

                     MARY
          You can't make a living out of this
          place.  We tried.

                     CHUCK
          But chickens?

                     ROGER
          Sixty three pounds consumed per capita,
          up from twenty seven in 1960.  Going to
          pass beef.  Chicken's global.  No
          religious taboos.  You don't see your
          Hindus and your Muslims boycotting
          poultry.

                     CHUCK
          True enough.  No sacred chickens nowhere,
          so far as I know.

                     MOM
          Roger's working at Tyson's now.

Mom mashes the block of frozen strawberries with a fork to
separate the strawberries from the ice.

                     CHUCK
          Really?

                     ROGER
          Come on down to the plant.  It's state of
          the art.  We're doing for chickens what
          FedEx did for the delivery business.

                     CHUCK
          Just don't count 'em before they hatch.

Roger grins at him.  This is just how they are.

                     ROGER
          I'll try to remember that.

                     MOM
          Dessert.

They all sit down.  Mom brings the slushy frozen strawberries
to the table, squirts on some Reddi-whip.  Looks pointedly at
Chuck.

                     MOM
          Speaking of hatching, I could sure use
          some more grandchildren.

Not a timely topic with Chuck.

                     CHUCK
          Mom, this is a farm.  We've got real
          strawberries growing outside, we've got
          real cream.

                     MOM
          Oh no, the prodigal son's home.  We bring
          out the store bought.

Chuck takes a bite, winces a little as the cold strawberries
hit his teeth.

EXT.  MOM'S HOUSE - LATER THAT DAY

Chuck fixes the drain pipe while Mom prunes the rose bushes
around the porch.

                     CHUCK
          Maybe I should take a few days off.
          Roger's working now, you could use some
          help around here...

                     MOM
          Don't you even think about it.

                     CHUCK
          The place is falling apart.

                     MOM
          I'm doing fine.

She looks pointedly at Chuck.

                     CHUCK
          Doing great, Mom, don't worry about me.

                     MOM
          There's settled folks, and there's
          nomads.  You're just not a settled folk.
          You never belonged here.

Chuck finishes the drain pipe.  Gives it a thunk with his
finger.

                     CHUCK
          Come on inside, Mom.  You've had a long
          day.

INT.  FARM HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT

In his boyhood room, we see Chuck's laptop, which is hooked
up to the internet FedEx homepage.  All around him are models
of boats and planes, maps, pictures of far-off places.  The
room of a boy who always fantasized about getting away.

Chuck is beside it, slumped down on the desk.  Asleep.

EXT.  FARM HOUSE - DAY

His mom waves to him as Chuck drives away.

INT.  FEDEX OFFICE - LATER THAT DAY

Chuck enters his office, on the go.  His assistant LESLIE is
waiting for him.

                     CHUCK
          I need the latest PDRs on St. Petersburg.

                     LESLIE
          And how was your Christmas?

                     CHUCK
          Terrific.  Yours?

She nods, used to this.

                     CHUCK
          And get me in to the dentist.  My tooth's
          acting up.

Stan enters.

                     STAN
          Malaysia's tanking.  We're meeting in ten
          in operations.

                     CHUCK
          Right.
               (to Leslie)
          Get me everything on Indonesia, New
          Guinea, all the way to Australia.

INT.  OPERATIONS ROOM - MINUTES LATER

Chuck, Leslie, Stan and another executive from the meeting
named DICK are gathered around the TV screen.  A squawk box
is on the table.

                     CHUCK
          Kamal?  Kamal?  Can you hear us?

The box squawks.  The TV screen rolls an imperfect image.

                     DICK
          Can't we get this working?

A Technician is fiddling with the TV set.

                     TECHNICIAN
          Trying.

                     CHUCK
          Kamal, you're breaking up.  Can you hear
          us?

                     VOICE (SQUAWK BOX)
          Kamal is not here.

                     CHUCK
          Who is this?  Where is Kamal?

                     VOICE (SQUAWK BOX)
          It is Ibrim, I, I am a sorter.

                     CHUCK
          What's going on down there?

                     VOICE (SQUAWK BOX)
          Kamal is not here.  We are very defused.

                     CHUCK
          Who's in charge then, where is Chinn?

The squawk box hums and crackles.  Nothing.  Chuck turns to
the Technician.

                     STAN
          We got Telex, e-mail?

                     TECHNICIAN
          Sure.  Just not getting any answers.

Chuck turns to Leslie.

                     CHUCK
          When's the next Jumbo?

                     LESLIE
          The regular flight is scheduled for oh
          three hundred tomorrow.

                     CHUCK
          Anything else?

                     LESLIE
          There's a sweep leaving Memphis in an
          hour, goes through Sydney.

                     STAN
          Maybe you should get your ducks lined up
          first.

Chuck looks over at Stan.

                     CHUCK
          Call Operations.  Get me on it.

And Stan is impressed.

EXT.  CHUCK'S HOUSE - DAY

Chuck leaves with his bag over his shoulder and the puppy
under his arm.

EXT.  KELLY'S HOUSE - DAY - MINUTES LATER

Kelly opens the door.  Chuck is there with the puppy.

                     KELLY
          That's your dog.

                     CHUCK
          It's our dog.  It belongs to us.

                     KELLY
          There isn't any us.

                     CHUCK
          Yes there is.

Kelly can't stay mad.

                     KELLY
          I'm sorry about the presents.  I got a
          little carried away.

                     CHUCK
          No, it was great.  Maybe a little
          overkill --

                     KELLY
          I burned the Christmas tree.

She's half-laughing, half-wanting-to-cry.

                     KELLY
          Why didn't you come over, get mad at me,
          tell me what a stupid bitch I was.

                     CHUCK
          I guess I hadn't thought through how I
          felt.

                     KELLY
          What, you were going to come over the
          next day all calm and say, Kelly that
          really made me mad?  Don't tell me you're
          mad.  Be mad.  Be who you are right now.

                     CHUCK
          Look, we'll do our trip as soon as I get
          back.

                     KELLY
          Don't even start.

And then it hits her.

                     KELLY
          Get back?  From where?

                     CHUCK
          Malaysia.  They're holding the sweep.

She stares at him for a long moment, then at the puppy.

                     KELLY
          Give him to me.

He hands her the dog.

                     KELLY
          Chuck, you're breaking my heart.

                     CHUCK
          A week, max.  Okay?  Okay?

                     KELLY
          Go on.  We'll be fine.  I'll feed Jango
          to the frogs.

She kisses the puppy.

INT.  FEDEX PLANE - NIGHT

Chuck enters the cockpit, where two different pilots are
going through their checklists.  Chuck repeats his familiar
patter.

                     CHUCK
          Al -- gotta be something wrong with our
          physicals, you keep getting certified to
          fly.  John, aren't you worried?

                     JOHN
          I disconnected his controls.  He only
          thinks he's flying.

Chuck settles into his seat.

                     CHUCK
          You're on your way home, Al?

Al has an Australian accent.

                     AL
          Right.  Down home, down under.

                     CHUCK
          We're on time, right?

                     AL
          On time, Chuck.

INT.  FEDEX PLANE - NIGHT - HOURS LATER

Settled into the jump seat, Chuck finishes up his notes on
his PowerBook and begins his flight ritual.

He puts in his ear plugs and takes out his Valium.  He
swallows one, then thinks, and swallows two more.  Then he
turns on his Walkman to the Rolling Stones, puts the mask
over his eyes, and, as usual, goes to sleep.

                                                 DISSOLVE TO:

INT.  FEDEX PLANE - NIGHT

The plane is SHAKING badly.  HEAR frantic, garbled radio
talk.  Chuck stirs, struggles to his feet, drowsy and
drugged.

INT.  FEDEX PLANE - CHUCK'S POV

Everything is hazy, out of focus, as it was in his earlier
drugged condition.  But this is real haze.  SMOKE.  And the
cabin also TWISTS and TILTS.

Chuck tries to steady himself against the wall.  This is
nightmarish.  Is this really happening?

INT.  FEDEX PLANE - CHUCK'S POV - COCKPIT

The pilots wrestle with the controls.  They have their life
jackets on.  John glances back at Chuck, his face floating in
a cloud of fear.

INT.  FEDEX PLANE - MOMENTS LATER

Chuck struggles to put on his life jacket.  The plane is
VIBRATING VIOLENTLY.  He can't get the straps straight.  He
is KNOCKED against one wall, then another, then to the floor.

Chuck tries to blow on the mouth tubes for his life jacket.
Can't do it!  Puff.  Puff.  Shit!  John motions frantically
for Chuck to pull on the automatic inflators on his jacket.
Chuck fumbles for them.

Huge palettes shift and groan, one BREAKS FREE, banging
violently against the side of the plane, spilling out its
boxes.  Then it swings and KNOCKS Chuck on the head!  He goes
down!

INT.  GLOBAL OPERATIONS CENTER - MOMENTS LATER

A CONTROLLER mans the global operations desk.  His SUPERVISOR
stands behind him, sipping some coffee.  The mood is eerily
calm.  An assistant moves Plane Locator Cards on a giant
board.

                     CONTROLLER
          Jumbo 14 is overdue in Sector K.

                     SUPERVISOR
          Where are they?

Another CONTROLLER tracks a giant computer screen.

                     CONTROLLER 2
          Somewhere east of Port Moresby.  Guam is
          getting a signal but no location.  Maybe
          the GPS is out.

The signal flashes, but is strangely still compared to the
others, which are moving.

EXT.  FEDEX PLANE - NIGHT

The giant plane PLUMMETS down from the sky.

INT.  FEDEX PLANE - NIGHT

Chuck is semi-conscious and bleeding from the head.  John
pulls the inflators on Chuck's life jacket, which fills with
a WHOOSH!, sending Chuck's arms out to the sides.  Al
struggles with the LIFE RAFT.  It's all blurred, frantic,
terrifying.

EXT.  PACIFIC - NIGHT - MOMENTS LATER

The plane hits the ocean with a CRASH and a WAVE of water.

INT.  GLOBAL OPERATIONS CENTER - MOMENTS LATER

The Controller is speaking mechanically into the microphone.

                     CONTROLLER
          Guam, I need a fix on Jumbo 14.

EXT.  PACIFIC - NIGHT

Shrouded with fog and surrounded by debris, the tail of the
big plane slowly SINKS beneath the angry, storm-driven waves.

EXT.  PACIFIC - DAY

A life raft is tossed on dark, storm-driven seas.  Inside it,
semi-conscious, Chuck hangs on.

EXT.  PACIFIC - NIGHT

We catch glimpses of the yellow lift raft in the dark as the
storm continues.

EXT.  BEACH - EARLY MORNING

The storm has ended.  Waves lap gently on a beach cut like a
scallop out of a rocky shore.  On the beach we see scattered
FEDEX BOXES.  And we see, face-down, half-buried in sand, a
MAN IN A SUIT and a life jacket.

Chuck.

The tide gently rocks him, laps at his face.  He chokes.
Slowly he gets to his knees.  Vomits seawater, big heaves.
He rolls over, sits down.  Dazed.  Still confused.  Where am
I?  What happened?

Chuck's first instinct is to check the time.  He looks at his
watch, taps it in frustration.

Then he looks around, and we look with him.

CHUCK'S POV - BEACH

The fog has thinned.  We can see palm groves and mangrove
thickets leading back into a thickly wooded valley climbing
up a steep, rocky hillside.  The rocks on the opposite point
end in a barren ridge.  Clouds hide the top of the hill.

ON CHUCK

as he takes in his surroundings.  He licks his lips.  He's
thirsty.  But something he sees is even more important.  We
stay with him as he WALKS.  He comes to a FEDEX PACKAGE in
the sand, picks it up, brushes off the sand, walks farther.
He picks up another package.

EXT.  BEACH - WIDE

Chuck walks down the beach, picking up FedEx packages,
leaving a trail of footprints in the sand.  Ahead of him we
notice a package decorated with ANGEL WINGS.

EXT.  BEACH - LATER THAT MORNING

Chuck has made a neat stack of FedEx boxes under some palm
trees at the rim of the beach.  He examines the Angel Wing
drawing with passing curiosity, then puts it on the stack.

Chuck takes off his life jacket, sits down in the shade,
makes himself comfortable, and waits.

EXT.  BEACH - SUNSET

Chuck is still waiting.  He's a systems man, and the system
isn't working.

                     CHUCK
          All right, guys.  I'm here.  Check the
          GPS, get moving.

EXT.  BEACH - NIGHT

The full moon shines a ghostly light on the beach.  Trees
cast moon-shadows on the sand.  Chuck seems very, very alone.

We HEAR from the dark thickets a STRANGE NOISE.  Rustling in
the leaves.  Something crashing in the trees, or is it a
wave?  A jolt of adrenaline courses through Chuck's body.  He
lurches to his feet.

We HEAR the noises again.  Chuck edges toward the rocks at
the barb of the hook.  Keeping his eye on the thicket, he
bends down and picks up a stone.  His first weapon.

In the rocks he finds a piece of driftwood.  He picks it up
in his other hand.  He backs between two rocks and stands
facing the thicket, every sense alert.  A cloud passes over
the moon.  The shadow streaks across Chuck's anxious face.

EXT.  BEACH - MORNING

The morning TIDE is coming in.  We follow the tide as it laps
amidst the rocks and finds Chuck, staring out to sea.  The
empty sea.

                     CHUCK
          Where the fuck are you?

But now he is really thirsty.  We WALK with Chuck up the
beach.

Beneath the palms he sees a couple of coconuts.  He picks one
of them up and studies it.  It's heavy, almost the size of a
volleyball.  How to get in it?

He throws it down on a rock.  The coconut just bounces off.
He wedges the coconut between two rocks, then throws a rock
down on it.  It bounces off.  He throws down a bigger rock.
It smashes on the rocks and chips.  Chuck picks up the rock.
OW!  Where the rock had chipped the edge is sharp.  It cuts
him.

                     CHUCK
          Sonofabitch.

The blood stains the rock a bright red.  Chuck sucks on his
finger, then he gets an idea -- the same idea primitive man
first got when he discovered stone tools.

He picks up the rock, test the edge.  Sharp -- really sharp.
He throws another rock down, but it doesn't break.  He picks
up another rock and strikes the first one.  Then again,
harder.  And again.  A large flake shoots off.  This edge is
even sharper.

He has a knife.

OPENING THE COCONUT - SERIES OF SHOTS

Chuck uses the stone knife to saw at the coconut.  No luck.

Chuck clumsily sharpens a stick with the sharp rock.

Chuck brings the sharpened stick down hard on the coconut,
but the stick slides off, sending the coconut rolling away.

Chuck positions the stick, pointed end up, in a hole, then
SLAMS the coconut down hard on it.  Success!  The green nut
of the coconut splits.  The brown inner nut is free!  He
smashes the nut with a rock, but -- OW!  -- he hits his hand!
Chuck licks his fingers, but he is so thirsty there's no more
saliva.  He smashes again.  The shell breaks to smithereens.
Coconut milk splashes everywhere.

                     CHUCK
          That was smart, really smart.

Rotating a nut along its axis and carefully moving his
fingers out of the way, he SMASHES the nut again.  The shell
splits!  The precious liquid splashes out.  Left inside is a
swallow or two, which Chuck laps up eagerly.  The milky white
liquid dribbles down his face.

                     CHUCK
          Ahhh.

EXT.  BEACH - SUNRISE

Chuck squints at the ocean.  His sunburn is bad -- his lips
are cracked.  A stack of broken coconut shells is beside him.
No one's there -- again.

                     CHUCK
          Maybe the GPS malfunctioned.  That Korean
          airliner did.

Clouds scud in front of the sun.  Beyond the reef the waves
are high and churning.  Chuck can see them pound onto the
reef.

                     CHUCK
          Okay, do the math.  Maybe they know where
          you are within, say 500 miles.  That's a
          circle with an area of, uh, pi r squared.
          So, uh, 250,000 times three point one
          four, that's about 800,000 square miles.
          Three times the size of Texas.

This sinks in.  Then Chuck gets an idea.

                     CHUCK
          They could use a satellite.

But even that doesn't give him much hope.

                     CHUCK
          Say each satellite photo is 30 feet
          square, that's uh...fuck it...billions
          and billions of photos.

That sinks in.

                     CHUCK
          Aw, someone will come.

EXT.  BEACH - NIGHT

Chuck sleeps by the coconuts.  The tide is coming in.  Chuck
stirs, gets up, staggers over to a palm tree to relieve
himself.

He stares idly out at the moonlight on the waves.  Then not
so idly.  Something's out there, something floating on the
tide.

                     CHUCK
          What the hell?

EXT.  BEACH - MOMENTS LATER

Chuck splashes into the gentle surf, reaches the dark object.

It's a body.  Chuck turns it over.  It's Al, one of the
pilots, his face gray and waterlogged and very dead.

                     CHUCK
          Oh Jesus.

EXT.  BEACH - MOMENTS LATER

Chuck drags the body up on the beach and then collapses,
exhausted.  He sits by it, staring at it.

                     CHUCK
          I'm so sorry, Al.  So sorry.

EXT.  BEACH - MORNING   

Chuck has almost finished a grave in the sand back of the
palm trees.  He's been digging with a piece of driftwood
sharpened with his stone knife.

He drags the body into the pit.  Stares down at it.  That
could be me.

                     CHUCK
          Got to cover Al up.

He wants to say more, can't.  He scoops some sand over the
body.

                     CHUCK
          Got to cover Al up.

He scoops in some more sand.  It's eerily like burying the
tropical fish in his back yard.

EXT.  BEACH - LATER

With a rock Chuck hammers a crude driftwood marker into the
sand.

EXT.  BEACH - LATER THAT DAY

As Chuck sits on the beach, he half-sings, half-talks "Yellow
Submarine" very quietly to himself.

                     CHUCK
          We all live in a yellow submarine, yellow
          submarine...

He looks over at the deep woods and down to the rocky point.
Comes to a decision.  He takes a drink of coconut, picks up
his club and a coconut, sticks the stone knife in his pants.
He's ready to go.

EXT.  BEACH - DAY - MOMENTS LATER

Chuck climbs over the rocks and disappears out of sight.
He's still half-singing to himself.

                     CHUCK
          Yellow submarine.  We all live in a
          yellow submarine...

EXT.  ISLAND - DAY - MOMENTS LATER

Chuck's way is blocked by rocks and jungle.  He hesitates.
He picks up a rock and THROWS IT to scare away all those bad
things.  It crashes into the ferns and palm trees.  He takes
a step into the jungle.

EXT.  JUNGLE - MINUTES LATER

Chuck struggles through a dense thicket beneath a jungle
canopy.  Vines and creepers reach out toward him.  There is
no path, nothing to show him where to go.

EXT.  JUNGLE - HALF HOUR LATER

Chuck climbs through a tangle of vines and ferns.  He takes a
drink from the coconut he is carrying.  The last drink.

                     CHUCK
          Bad idea.  Should have saved some.

He throws away the husk.  He looks up, but the only sunlight
reaching him is dappled from the canopy above him.

EXT.  ISLAND - MOMENTS LATER

Chuck emerges onto a ridge that leads to a summit.  He climbs
across a rocky lava field covered with scrub lichen and low
ferns, soil dark as coffee beans, his way crossed by steep
gullies that cut like dark fingers into the lava.

The lava field narrows, forcing Chuck closer to the sea.  He
passes a series of CAVES, their mouths dark and mysterious
and scary.  He gives them a wide berth.

EXT.  ISLAND - CLIFF - MOMENTS LATER

The land narrows to a ledge that stretches across a high
cliff perched over the ocean.  Beyond this rock bridge the
path smoothes out to a summit.

Chuck stares at the narrow bridge, then down at the waves
breaking on the rocks far below.  To get any view, he will
have to cross the bridge.  He's thirsty.  The late afternoon
sun is hot.

                     CHUCK
          Other than that, Mrs. Lincoln, how did
          you enjoy the play?

Hugging the wall of the cliff, taking each step with great
caution, he sets out across the bridge.

EXT.  ISLAND - CLIFF

Step by step, Chuck negotiates the narrow bridge.  He reaches
a flume of polished basalt which cuts across the ledge like a
slide in a water park -- except this flume ends high above
the waves.  Chuck tries to step across it, can't quite, tries
one foot first, then the other.

                     CHUCK
          Shit!

He looks back, but that seems even scarier.

                     CHUCK
          Got to get there.  Got to see.  C'mon...
          c'mon.  Don't be such a wuss.  Be bold.

He looks down at the ocean beneath him, closes his eyes, and
jumps.  It's only a few feet, but he's breathing hard when he
lands on the other side.  He hugs the rocks, getting his
breath.

EXT.  ISLAND SUMMIT - SUNSET - MOMENTS LATER

Chuck looks to each point on the compass.  He is on an
ISLAND, small, inhospitable, without sign of habitation or
anything human.  On three sides the waves break against
steep, hostile cliffs.  A reef encloses the cove where he
came from.

                     CHUCK
          No way on.  No way off.

Chuck stares out to sea in every direction.  Nothing.

                     CHUCK
          This is bad.  Really, really bad.

The last rays of sun hit his face.  The ocean turns a deep
reddish gold.

EXT.  CLIFF - MOMENTS LATER

Going down is even scarier.  It's dusk and the light is flat
and gray.  Chuck stares at the ledge.

                     CHUCK
          Come on.  Crawl if you have to.

Chuck crawls on his hands and knees across the rock bridge.

EXT.  ROCKY SLOPE - MOMENTS LATER

Chuck stumbles over the rocks.  The caves look ominous and
primal.

EXT.  EDGE OF JUNGLE - NIGHT

It's getting dark now.  The jungle seems impenetrable, the
dark wood of fable.  Chuck hesitates, then plunges into it.

EXT.  JUNGLE - NIGHT MINUTES LATER

The moon has just begun to rise, casting eerie light into the
jungle.  The shadows reach out to grab Chuck, then real
branches and vines tug at him.  He heads into thick
blackness.

EXT.  BEACH - NIGHT - LATER

Chuck emerges around the rocks.  He reaches the stack of
familiar FedEx boxes -- Ahh, home!  He's breathing hard, from
both fear and exertion.

                     CHUCK
          Got to drink.  Got to drink something.

With his last strength he opens a coconut on the stick.  He
bangs hard on the shell and gulps down the milk.  He stares
at the stack of FedEx boxes.  What could be inside?  He
reaches out and touches one.

                     CHUCK
          They don't belong to you.

Responsibility gets the better of necessity, and he takes his
hand away.

EXT.  BEACH - MORNING

Face red from the sun, Chuck hacks at a palm frond with his
stone knife.  He saws the palm frond off near the base,
leaving it about a foot long.

                     CHUCK
          Got to have shade.  Got to have a hat.

He ties the loose fibers into a sort of circle, then sets it
upon his head.  It looks amazingly like some sort of
primitive cap.

He grabs a couple of FedEx boxes and heads for the beach.

EXT.  BEACH - LATER

Chuck finishes the P on H E L P, which he has spelled out
with the FedEx boxes on the beach.

EXT.  JUNGLE - DAY - LATER

Chuck scrambles down a ravine.  He kneels down and feels the
ground.  It is dry, completely dry.

EXT.  LAVA SLOPE - DAY

Chuck traverses the slope, determined to find water.

A FLAT ROCK - LATER

With a puddle of dirty water trapped in a tiny hollow.
Suddenly Chuck flops down into frame.  He tries to scoop up
some water in his hands, but he just splashes it around.  He
licks his fingers.  Then he gets down on his stomach and laps
up the water with his tongue.  Like an animal.

In the bottom of the small depression is some fine mud.  He
rubs it on his reddened face and across his burned lips.

                     CHUCK
          Oh, God.  Thank you.

EXT.  BEACH - NIGHT

Chuck lies in darkness, his eyes reflecting the moon.

EXT.  JUNGLE - DAY

Chuck is drenched in sweat.  He is at the bottom of a hole
six feet deep.  He takes one last dig with the flat stick,
then licks the moist clay that sticks to it.

EXT.  BEACH - DAY

Chuck breaks open another coconut and gulps down the milky
liquid.  With a stone knife he digs in the shell for some of
the meat, but it's dry and chewy and fibrous.  He spits it
out, then lies back on the sand and stares at the first
stars.  Half sings to himself.

                     CHUCK
          You deserve a break today...

He is desperately thirsty.  Hunger gnaws at him.

EXT.  BEACH - DAY - LATER

Holding a sharpened stick, Chuck wades in the shallows at low
tide, looking for fish.  It's difficult to keep his balance.
Suddenly a shadow flashes by, glinting in the morning
sunlight.  Chuck hurls the spear, which ricochets off the
water and floats away.

Chuck plunges into the water after the fish with his bare
hands.  The fish reverses direction.  Chuck leaps after it
and goes under.  He comes up spluttering, on his hands and
knees in the shallows.

Suddenly a whole school of fish swims by him, moving in
unison, like one creature, splitting around Chuck like
mercury.  He grabs at them desperately.  Nothing.

                     CHUCK
          Damn fish!

On some rocks he sees clusters of limpets.  He takes a rock
and tries to dislodge one, but it smashes into a soggy mess.

EXT.  BEACH - DAY

Discouraged, he sits down on the beach and gets his breath.

Idly, Chuck takes out his wallet.  The money is soaked.  He
lays it out to dry.  He finds a PHOTOGRAPH OF KELLY, soaked
and mushy.

He tries to smooth it out.  For a moment he is overcome.  His
face tightens, his eyes get moist.  He stares out to sea.

                     CHUCK
          Wait a minute.  Wait just a minute.

He picks up his wallet again and takes out a credit card.

EXT.  BEACH - MINUTES LATER

Chuck wades in the water, stops by a rock covered with
limpets.  He uses a CREDIT CARD to scrape off a limpet.

                     CHUCK
          Don't leave home without it.

With his finger, he prods around in the mucous-like meat,
then tilts up the shell and we see the gooey gray stuff slide
off the shell into his mouth.

                     CHUCK
          Yuck.

He starts to spit it out.  Tries to make himself like it.

                     CHUCK
          Yumm.

And he swallow it.

EXT.  BEACH - SUNSET

Chuck sits in the shade of a palm tree surrounded by a pile
of smashed coconut husks and a stack of limpet shells.  He
checks his watch for a moment.

                     CHUCK
          Got to get this fixed.

But what's the point?  Everything that was so valuable before
is useless now.

EXT.  JUNGLE - LATER

Chuck digs yet another hole.  He chants to himself, almost
delusionally.

                     CHUCK
          Water, water, everywhere, water, water
          everywhere...

Covered in sweat, desperate and exhausted, he throws down his
wooden spade.

                     CHUCK
          Where's the water on this fucking island?

He lies on his back, breathing hard.  Pulls his hat over his
eyes.

                     CHUCK
          Just rest a minute.

EXT.  JUNGLE - DAY - LATER

Chuck is lying in the hole.  We find his feet.  Slowly water
is oozing out of the clay, a puddle is building around his
toes.

EXT.  JUNGLE - DAY - LATER

Chuck's eyes snap awake.  He looks down at his feet.  There's
a pool of muddy water there.  He dips his hand in it, touches
a finger to his lips to be sure he's not dreaming.

He grabs his sharpened stone, begins to attack the clay.

                     CHUCK
          Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah.

EXT.  BEACH - SUNSET

Chuck carefully makes marks on a palm tree with his rock
knife.  One for each day.  Very neat.  Very precise.  Very
Chuck.

                     CHUCK
          Let's see, I waited two days.
               (makes marks)
          Then I buried Al.
               (slowly makes another mark)
          Al.  You never made it home, buddy.  Then
          American Express got me those clam
          things...
               (makes another mark)
          I dug all those damn holes, the clouds
          over the moon...
               (makes more marks)
          And today, the historic discovery of H,
          Two, Oh.
               (makes a tenth mark and
                underlines it)
          Ten days.  Shit.

For a moment, he feels the weight of his isolation.  Then he
allows himself a deep breath.  There is order now, after all.
Time is under control.

EXT.  CLIFF - DAY

Very carefully, but standing this time, Chuck makes his way
across the ledge.

EXT.  SUMMIT - DAY

He emerges on the top, takes a drink from a hand-made
canteen, and looks in all directions.  Again, he sees nothing
but ocean.

EXT.  BEACH - DAY

He resumes his efforts at fishing.  A shape scuttles raggedly
beneath him.

                     CHUCK
          A crab, it's a crab.

He freezes, holding his spear motionless.  Then he jabs at
the crab -- misses!  The crab scurries away toward the rocks.

                     CHUCK
          Dammit!

Chuck splashes after it, stabbing as he goes, falling,
getting up, stabbing again.

Suddenly one stab feels different.  Chuck carefully lifts up
the spear.  On the end is a squirming crab.

                     CHUCK
          I did it.  I did it!

He walks carefully with it to the beach.  Lowering the spear,
he lets the crab slip off.  It darts toward the water.  Chuck
heads it off, trying to avoid the snapping claws.

He kicks it back toward the beach, then slams a rock down on
it.  He twists off a crab claw, expecting to see flaky white
meat.  But a crab has an exoskeleton.  The flesh simply pours
out, like mucous.

                     CHUCK
          Jesus.

This is too much.  He needs the next step, from the raw to
the cooked.  The crucial next step from primitive man to the
beginnings of civilization.

EXT.  PALM GROVE SERIES OF SHOTS - TRYING TO MAKE FIRE

Chuck rubs two sticks together.  Nothing.

Chuck positions a makeshift drill in a hole he has scooped
out in a piece of driftwood.  He spins the drill with great
effort.  Nothing.

                     CHUCK
          Stupid fucking thing!

He quits, exhausted.  He looks at his hands.  They are raw
and blistered.  He feels like Job.

                     CHUCK
          I don't know what I did, God, but
          whatever is was, I am really, really
          sorry.  You hear me?  Really sorry.

EXT.  BEACH - DAY

Chuck emerges from the jungle and walks to the edge of the
ocean.  He dips his blistered hands into the sea water, then
looks over at the FedEx boxes that spell out H E L P.

                     CHUCK
          Don't have a choice, do I?

He walks over and picks a few boxes up from the P.

EXT.  PALM GROVE - DAY

With his stone knife and spear to help him.  Chuck begins to
open the FedEx boxes.  Chuck rips open the end of one box and
shakes it.  Out tumble some videotapes.  Chuck looks at them:
what good are they?

Chuck tears another box open.  Out slide some legal papers
covered with Post-its.

In quick cuts, we see him dump out computer memory boards,
some designer dresses, flowers, a pair of roller blades, a
script with a red cover -- which he never reads.

EXT.  BEACH - LATER

By now he has taken all the boxes in the P.  Only H E L
remains.  He pauses to let the irony of that sink in, then
collects more boxes.  He is even more exhausted.

EXT.  PALM GROVE

Two boxes remain.  One is the box with Angel Wings.  Chuck
sets it aside.  He opens the other box.  Out tumbles a
DOCTOR'S BAG.  Chuck can't believe it.  He opens the bag.
It's full of great stuff.  Medicine.  A scalpel.  A saw.

                     CHUCK
          Okay.  Okay now.

EXT.  PALM GROVE - LATER

Hands bandaged, Chuck tries to strike a spark on the roller
blade wheel housing.  Tries over and over.  Nothing.

He takes a long drink from his canteen, and flinches.  His
tooth is starting to hurt.  He fishes some Tylenol out of the
surgeon's bag and takes two.

EXT.  OTHER SIDE OF ISLAND - DAY

Chuck picks some berries and gingerly tries them.  They're
not bad.  He eats more.  Then more.  What a relief.

EXT.  BEACH - NIGHT

Chuck lies on his palm fronds, groaning and holding his
stomach.  He drags himself to his knees, crawls a few feet,
and throws up in great, violent heaves.

EXT.  BEACH - DAY

Still looking a little green, Chuck marks another day on his
tree calendar.

EXT.  SUMMIT

He stares out to sea.  Nothing.

EXT.  WELL - DAY

Chuck lies on his belly and drinks from the well, which has
filled with water.  Then he washes his face and splashes
water over his neck.  The surface of the well stills,
bringing CHUCK'S REFLECTION into focus.  He stares at
himself.

Very carefully Chuck shaves with the surgeon's scalpel.

Chuck checks out his new appearance in the water.  Much
better.  A clean start now.

EXT.  BEACH - LATER THAT DAY

He sits in front of his failed efforts to make fire.

                     CHUCK
          You're not getting it hot enough.  Got to
          hold the heat.  Got to hold the heat.

EXT.  BEACH - LATER

Chuck carefully shaves some tinder.  Puts it under a piece of
bamboo split lengthwise with a notch cut across it.

EXT.  BEACH - LATER

Chuck uses a bamboo stick to try to make friction in the
split half of the bamboo.  He saws back and forth with all
his might, pressing it down in the groove.

EXT.  BEACH - LATER

Chuck gives one last saw with his bamboo and stops, utterly
defeated.  It's all too much.

                     CHUCK
          Sonofabitch!

He starts to rub again.  He breathes hard, sweat pours off
his face.  He is really going for it, what the hell!  A tiny
wisp of smoke appears!  Chuck saws with even more energy.

                     CHUCK
          Come on.  Come on.

The smoke increases.  Chuck rips away the bamboo, grabs the
nest of shavings, and blows on it frantically.  The smoke
flickers and dies.  Chuck can't believe it.

                     CHUCK
          No.  No.  No.

EXT.  BEACH - NIGHT

Chuck lies in his bed of palm fronds, shivering.  He looks up
at the stars, which blaze furiously.

                     CHUCK
          That's the big dipper...Orion...or is
          that the Southern Cross...?  Kelly would
          know.

And he misses her so much.  A shower of meteors streaks
across the sky, as if the very heavens are raining down on
Chuck.

EXT.  BEACH - DAY

Chuck readies his two sticks of bamboo again and begins
sawing with tremendous energy.  He smells something.  Is it
smoke?  He pulls off the log and looks eagerly at the nest of
tinder.  There's nothing there.

                     CHUCK
          Dammit!

He replaces the log and starts wearily to saw again.

TIME CUT

The sun has moved in the sky.  Chuck is still sawing.  Again
the smoke appears.  Again sweat pours from his face.  The
smoke increases.  He saws even harder.  His breath comes in
anguished gulps.  Smoke is curling up now.  Chuck tears away
the bamboo, picks up the nest of kindling, and blows on it
gently.  The smoke increases.

He blows some more.  A fragile crimson spark appears.

                     CHUCK
          Careful now, careful...

He gently places the nest of shavings in the kindling, then
blows on it with utmost care, as if he were holding life
itself.  He shreds his money and business cards over the tiny
flame.

Suddenly, the evening breeze lifts the nest out of the
kindling.  Desperate, Chuck grabs it.  Trying to shield it
with his body, he grabs some palm fronds and jams them into
the sand, trying to make a windbreak.  They rustle and shake
and blow over.

The wind blows harder.  Chuck jams some rocks in a circle to
make an eddy.  But the fire is out.  No words now, just a
loud, primal groan of pure despair.

And then, into his vision floats...smoke.

Chuck looks down.  A wisp of smoke curls up from the nest of
tinder!  Chuck blows on it gently.  Suddenly a tiny tongue of
flame flickers and catches on the kindling!

                     CHUCK
          Yes!  Yes!  Yes!

He feeds in some more twigs, more tinder.  The flames lick
out, catch, grow.

                     CHUCK
          If I ever forgot to thank you God, and I
          am sure I did, thank you now.

EXT.  BEACH - WIDE - NIGHT

The fire burns on the beach.  Chuck rushes about, piling on
driftwood.

EXT.  BEACH - CLOSER

Chuck darts into the jungle and returns dragging a huge log.
He throws it on the fire.  We see his face in the light of
the fire.  He is exultant.  He dances.  He sings at the top
of his lungs.  Papa-ooo-mow-mow!

Chuck throws another huge log on the fire.  Papa-papa-papa-
oooo!  The log splutters and explodes, sending up a huge
shower of sparks that climb and sparkle in the
darkness...until they merge with the stars.

EXT.  PALM GROVE - MORNING

Chuck makes a mark on the tree.  Around it he carves a flame
-- the day he mastered fire.

EXT.  PALM GROVE - LATER THAT MORNING

Chuck sharpens his spear with his stone knife.  Then he
sticks it in the flame to harden it, pulls it out, checks it,
scrapes some more.

EXT.  BEACH - DAY

Chuck wades in the water with his spear.  Suddenly he stabs
it down.  A crab is on the end.

EXT.  BEACH - HALF HOUR LATER

Chuck removes a crab from out of the fire and breaks a
steaming crab claw.  Chuck takes a bite of the flaky white
meat.  Ahhh.  It tastes great.  He takes another bite -- and
flinches.

                     CHUCK
          Damn tooth!

He fumbles for his Tylenol and takes two pills.

EXT.  SUMMIT - SUNSET

Chuck stands on the summit, looking in all directions.  Then,
something on the island brings Chuck's eyes back from their
distant focus on the horizon.  From down on the beach,
beneath the palm grove, there curls a thin column of smoke.
Chuck lets a bit of pride creep into his face as he sees it.
He kneels down and begins to build a signal fire.

EXT.  BEACH - NIGHT - LATER

Chuck curls up in his bed of palm fronds.  The fire burns.
Around it is a large stack of crab shells.  He stares into
the fire.

EXT.  PALM GROVE - MORNING

Chuck makes another mark on the tree.  He has circled the
tree with marks several times now.

EXT.  BEACH - DAY

Using a safety pin and some suturing thread, Chuck fishes
carefully.  Suddenly he jerks his hand back.  On the end is a
flopping fish.

EXT.  PALM GROVE - DAY

Chuck takes a cooked fish off the fire and mixes it with some
breadfruit.  He eats the soft mixture, chewing carefully, but
his tooth hurts even worse.  There are only a few Tylenol
tablets left.  He carefully cuts one in half and swallows it.

EXT.  SUMMIT - AFTERNOON

Chuck arrives with the wood for the night.  He stares out to
sea as usual, but this time he sees something different.

WHALES.  He sees whales.  Leaping.  Broaching.  Spouting.
Water pouring off fins and flukes.  Moving.  Going somewhere.

                     CHUCK
          Beautiful.  So beautiful.

Chuck stares at them, stares until the ocean darkens and he
can see them no more.  It's late now.

Leaving, he takes one last look, as he always does.  And
another remarkable sight greets his eyes.  There, on the
horizon, just below the evening star, is a...LIGHT.  He
stares at it, fixed.

                     CHUCK
          A star.  It's a star.

But then he stares at it really hard.

                     CHUCK
          It's a ship.

EXT.  WOODS - TREE - NEXT DAY

A tree shakes and moves, quivers...

                     CHUCK
          Timberrr!

...then slowly falls with a CRASH!

                     CHUCK
          I heard that...

Chuck holds his surgeon's saw over the stump.  He walks to
another tree and begins to saw his way into the trunk.

EXT.  BEACH - SERIES OF SHOTS

Up above the high tide line, Chuck lashes a log to a row of
five logs already joined with vines.

                     CHUCK
          No more waiting.  Take action.

Chuck sews several designer dresses together with needle and
suturing thread for a sail.

                     CHUCK
          That's right.  Take action.

He cuts bamboo for the mast.  He carves driftwood for an oar.

He fills gourds with water, stores breadfruit and coconut as
he sings "Fly Me to the Moon" to himself.

He ties the sail to the mast and extends it with a bamboo
boom lashed on with palm fiber and video tape.  He ties on
the doctor's kit and the FedEx box with the angel wings.

He examines his handiwork:  a finished raft.

He brings out his old life preserver and puts it on, then
grabs hold of one corner of the raft to pull it down to the
beach.  It doesn't budge.  He tries to pull it again.
Nothing.  He leans his back into it and pushes with his legs.
Nothing.  He collapses on the beach, his breath coming in
heaves.

                     CHUCK
          How could I be so stupid?

He bangs himself on the head, over and over.

                     CHUCK
          Stupid, stupid, stupid.

EXT.  PALM GROVE - NIGHT

Chuck throws new firewood on the dwindling fire.  It comes
back to life.  Meteors streak again across the sky.  He
stares at the indifferent stars.  The moon is almost full.
Shadows of palm trees sway on the sand.

EXT.  BEACH - NIGHT

Chuck stands by the edge of the water, which shimmers in the
reflected light of the fire.  A wave come in, licks at his
toes.  Lifts up a coconut husk, sweeps it gently out.  Chuck
watches, gets an idea.

EXT.  BEACH - NIGHT

He begins to dig in the sand by the raft.  He grabs the oar
and digs faster, making a trench up to where the raft is.

EXT.  BEACH - MORNING

The rising tide floods water into the trench.  Chuck rocks
the raft back and forth.  It floats!  As the wave recedes, it
takes the raft with it.  Chuck has to run beside it.

CHUCK TRYING TO ESCAPE - MONTAGE

Over and over, we see Chuck capsize at the reef.  The first
time he has a bandage on his leg.  He tries everything --
different rafts, different approaches, but each time the
ocean spits him back.

EXT.  LAGOON - DAY

Defeated and utterly exhausted, Chuck swims back from his
latest failure.  He wades back ashore with the FedEx box and
throws it on the ground by the palm tree.  He has tried so
hard to escape, so incredibly hard, done everything humanly
possible and beyond.  He rips off his life preserver, throws
it into the underbrush, then collapses on the beach.

                     CHUCK
          You're too low in the water.  Too damn
          low.

Chuck's shoulders begin to shake, as he is racked with deep
sobs of despair.

And then he throws his head back and lets forth, from deep
inside himself, a SCREAM of rage and anger and pain.  The
Scream pierces the indifferent natural sounds of the island,
the rustling of the breeze, the lulling rhythm of the waves.
It is powerful, disturbing, primal.

The breeze picks up.  Behind Chuck, the palm trees begin to
sway.  The tide is reaching up toward the beach.  The waves
crash louder.  The palm trees sway even more.

Chuck picks up some wet sand and rubs it on his body.

                     CHUCK
          Dust thou art -- that's for damned sure
          -- and unto dust shalt thou return.

A few DROPS OF RAIN begin to fall, splashing on Chuck and
sizzling in the fire.

Chuck looks up:  clouds have obscured the sun.  The wind
blows harder.  The rain falls harder, streaking the sand
Chuck had rubbed on his body.  STEAM sizzles out of the fire.

Chuck looks up, disbelieving.  The bottom falls out of the
heavens -- monsoon rain, more rain than you have ever seen
before.  A long wave rolls up, its frothy fingers reaching
for the fire.

Forget the raft!  Forget despair!  The fire could go out!
This is disaster!

                     CHUCK
          Shit!

He springs into action.  Chuck grabs an empty FedEx box.
With his wooden shovel he frantically SCOOPS SOME COALS out
of the fire as the rain HISSES and POUNDS at them.  He slides
the coals into the FedEx box, grabs some sticks of driftwood
and sets off on a run.

EXT.  WOODS - DAY

Chuck runs through the woods, slipping and stumbling.  Vines
grab at him.  The rain is so thick he can hardly see.

EXT.  WOODS - MINUTES LATER

Chuck bursts out of the woods into the lava field.  Smoke
pours out of the FedEx box.  The coals are about to burn
through!

EXT.  LAVA FIELD - MOMENTS LATER

Chuck stumbles up the slippery rocks, dragging the smoking
box.  His face is drenched, desperate.

EXT.  CAVE - DAY - MINUTES LATER

Chuck tumbles into the cave just as the coals burn through
the FedEx box.

Using the remains of the box, he desperately tries to scoot
the coals into a dry spot.

One by one, THE PRECIOUS COALS GO OUT.

Dripping water off his hands and face, he pushes a few
together with his fingers, ignoring the burns.

                     CHUCK
          Please...please...please...

He stomps on the driftwood and saws at it with his knife.  He
places this kindling on the coals.  They sputter and sizzle.
Barely catch.  He fans them with the box.  A tiny flicker
catches, then starts to grow.

                     CHUCK
          Firewood.  I need firewood.

SERIES OF SHOTS

On the beach, Chuck desperately gathers more firewood in the
driving monsoon.  He can barely see.  Driven by the storm,
the waves are licking at the palm grove.

He runs through the woods.  Branches whip at his face.  Roots
tear at his feet, tripping him.

He stumbles up the lava field.  Sliding.  Struggling.  Barely
able to breathe, the rain is so strong.

INT.  CAVE - DAY

He dumps the firewood on the floor of the cave.  But where
the fire had flickered, there is only a pile of wet black
ashes.

THE FIRE IS OUT.

INT.  CAVE - NIGHT

Chuck lies on the floor of the cave, shivering in the
darkness as the rain falls.  His fire is out, his tooth is
killing him, he can't escape.

EXT.  CAVE - NEXT DAY

Chuck emerges from the cave.  The rain has stopped.  This is
the absolute lowest.  His face reflects his pain and despair.
He's trapped.  It's hopeless.  Everything he tried to build
is gone.

EXT.  LEDGE - DAY

Chuck slowly walks out on the ledge.  He stares down at the
waves breaking on the jagged rocks far below.

He lets go one hand.  Then lets go the other.  He is barely
balanced.  It looks like a wisp of breeze would blow him
right off.  He slides one foot to the very lip of the
precipice.

Suddenly his foot slips!

Instinctively he turns into the cliff, grabs for a hold!  One
hand reaches for a nubbing of rock, slips off!  The other
closes, his fingers straining to hold him.

He breathes in deep gasps.  He had wanted to end it, come so
close.

                     CHUCK
          What the fuck are you doing?

His deepest instinct was to survive.  And that is what he is
going to do.

                     CHUCK
          Hang on.  Just hang on.

Slowly he pulls himself back from the edge.

EXT.  BEACH - LATER

Chuck walks aimlessly down the beach, feeling the burden of
starting over.  The beach is littered with seaweed and
flotsam, bits of rope, plastic bottles.  He picks up a
plastic bottle.  That will come in handy.

The Chuck sees a SOCCER BALL with "Wilson" stamped on it in
big black letters.

He picks it up, holds it, tosses it up in the air.  Then he
kicks it, then kicks it again, then runs down the beach,
trying to kick it and keep it out of the water.  Feeling joy
again, even here.

INT.  CAVE - THAT DAY

The sun is setting on his darkened cave.  The soccer ball
sits in the corner by the black cold ashes of what was once
his fire.

Chuck carves a bit of coconut meat, takes a bite and winces
as the meat hits his sore tooth.  He tosses the shell on a
small new pile of shells.

Chuck shakes out the last half Tylenol tablet.  He puts the
tablet in his mouth, then takes a sip out of his coconut
canteen.  When the water hits his tooth that hurts too.

INT.  CAVE - MORNING

Chuck mixes a mash of breadfruit and coconut.  He tries to
pack the tooth with the mash, but it's so sensitive that even
this hurts.  He pounds the floor of the cave in frustration.

INT.  CAVE - LATER

Chuck holds a stone chisel and his hammer stone.  He
positions the chisel against his inflamed tooth.  But the
thought of what he is about to do is too frightening.  He
lowers the chisel.

                     CHUCK
          Shit.  Shit.  Shit.

EXT.  BEACH - DAY

Chuck tries to fill his mouth with sea water.  The pain is so
great his eyes water.

                     CHUCK
          Whoo, pig.  Sooey!

He falls back in the water and floats there, looking up at
the sky.

INT.  CAVE - LATER

Determined, Chuck hold the stone chisel again.  He raises it
slowly to his mouth and picks up the hammer stone.

                     CHUCK
          No pain, no gain.

He brings the hammer down hard on the chisel!  The screen
goes BLACK as Chuck's SCREAM continues UNDER.

FADE IN:

EXT.  OCEAN - SUNRISE - THREE YEARS LATER

The sky takes on the first colors of the day.  The ocean is
still dark, but a few waves catch the first light.  The
sunrise touches the summit, moves down the cliff, then lights
the cove.  On the screen superimpose:

                     "1000 DAYS LATER"

REFLECTION - WATER

A spear shimmers in the calm morning water.  Attached to the
spear is a man, standing completely still.

ON CHUCK

We move up out of the reflection to the real man.  His legs
are scarred.  The remnants of a dress wrap around his middle.
A stone knife on a neatly mounted haft is stuck in a belt
made of videotape and woven fiber.  Necklaces of shark's
teeth and shells hang from his neck.  His hair is long.  A
coconut frond hat is on his head.

The hand wrapped around the spear is scarred and brown as a
berry.  It holds the spear perfectly still.  The watch is
gone.

We come around slowly until we see Chuck's face.  The eyes
say it all.  They stare out with a survivor's intensity,
staring at the water, unblinking.  This is the man who used
to splash futilely about in the water trying to fish.

This is the FedEx man who was plugged into the tumult of
activity and energy, surrounded by technology and human
activity at its most intense, devoted to making seconds
count.  Now he is utterly alone, and utterly still.

And now he has all the time in the world.

Suddenly, without an once of wasted motion, he shoots the
spear forward at a low angle.  It quivers, stuck on the
bottom.  He pulls it out with a practiced twist.  On the end
is a struggling fish.

But this isn't a thrill anymore.  It's another day at the
office.

EXT.  BEACH - LATER THAT DAY

Chuck makes a mark on a palm tree.  He has completely covered
three other trees with marks.  It sinks in how long he has
been here.

EXT.  JUNGLE - LATER

Chuck carries the fish back from the beach.  Now there is a
well-worn trail.

INT.  CAVE - THAT AFTERNOON

Chuck enters with the fish.  We are greeted with the well-
ordered lair of a primitive stone-age man.

Clam shell spirals weave in and out around the fire hole.
Strips of eel jerky and fish hang drying from racks.

Tools are lined up neatly:  digging sticks, stone hammers and
saws, spears neatly hafted onto shafts, drills, awls.  Bits
and pieces of feathers, skins, bones, rags, leaves -- are all
neatly arranged.  Strings and cords hang from hooks.  Coconut
bowls and cooking rocks form a small kitchen.  A raincoat and
rain-hat woven of palm fronds is neatly draped over a frame.

Evocative pieces of driftwood decorate the room.  A wind
chime of obsidian flakes sways gently.  The watch hangs on a
stick.

The Angel Box has the place of honor on one side.  On the
other side the Wilson soccer ball rests on a throne of rocks.
Seaweed has been placed on the ball as hair.  Clam shells
have been stuck on for eyes, other shells form a mouth.  A
tube shell and conch form a pipe.

INT.  CAVE - FIRE - NIGHT

The fish are being smoke under a palm frond.  Eel skins hang
from sticks, roasting.  Chuck sits by the fire, hafting a
stone knife onto a wooden haft.

He ties some fiber to a stick, then braids it into string,
using both hands and his mouth for the three strands.

He ties the string tightly around the shaft.  He does his
work automatically.

INT.  CAVE - NIGHT - LATER

Chuck eats some fish and some mashed breadfruit.  He chews
each bite, his eyes in distant focus.  The firelight flickers
on his face.

EXT.  CLIFF - SUNRISE

Chuck carries firewood up to the summit.  He mechanically
adds wood to the fire.  As he does so, something out to sea
catches his eye.  He stops and stands up.

CHUCK'S POV - WHALES

WHALES broach out past the rocky point.  Spouts of water
shoot into the air.

ON CHUCK

As he watches them, a light comes back into his eyes.  He
grins.  There's a big gap where his teeth had been.  He turns
and strides down the hill.

EXT.  CLIFF - MOMENTS LATER

He heads across the rock bridge that once had so terrified
him, without losing stride.  It's second nature now.

INT.  CAVE - MOMENTS LATER

Chuck enters the cave, picks up the ball and heads out.

EXT.  SUMMIT - EVENING

The signal fire burns.  A spectacular cloudy sunset lights up
the sky.  Chuck sits with Wilson on the summit, a bowl of
mashed breadfruit in one hand, a bowl of roasted eel skin in
another.

As Chuck watches the sunset unfold, watches the whales going
by in the darkened water, he takes some roasted eel chips,
dips them into the breadfruit paste, and offers one to
Wilson.  His voice is flat, monotonal.

                     CHUCK
          Chips?  Dip?

But Wilson declines.

                     CHUCK
          No?

He takes a big crunchy bite.

                     CHUCK
          Another fucking day in paradise.

PULL BACK as the sun goes down and Chuck reaches into the
bowl again and dips an eel skin chip in the dip.

EXT.  ROCKY LEDGE - NIGHT - LATER

Torch in one hand, Wilson in the other, Chuck walks across
the rocky ledge.  He passes the flume without even noticing.

Suddenly his shoe breaks!  It's sandal made of woven yucca
leaves.

He bends down and fixes it, then heads on down the ledge.

EXT.  LEDGE - MOMENTS LATER

Chuck makes a casual leap, a leap he has made hundreds of
times, but this time the sandal comes loose.  It catches on a
rock, and CHUCK FALLS!

His hands are cut and bruised.  He tries to get up, can't.
Chuck sits back and examines his foot.  His fingers come back
covered with blood.  He reaches out to steady himself, and
leaves a HANDPRINT OF BLOOD on the rock.

INT.  CAVE - LATER

Chuck wraps his foot in bandages.

INT.  CAVE - LATER

Chuck's face is sweaty.  He looks down at his foot.  It is
red, swollen, infected.  He stands up, tries to put some
weight on it.  The pain is intense.

Chuck sticks the scalpel onto some coals to sterilize it.  He
holds it over his foot, takes a breath, then jabs in into the
wound.  The pain is intense.  Chuck passes out.

INT.  CAVE - NIGHT

Chuck stirs, takes a drink, weakly tosses on another log, and
collapses back on the floor.

INT.  CAVE - DAY

Chuck wakes up, trembling, shaking, wet with sweat.  He
staggers up.  His shadow sways on the wall of the cave.  He
struggles to get another log on the fire.  He squints at his
only companion, the soccer ball.

                     CHUCK
          Help me, Wilson...

He collapses again.

INT.  CAVE - NIGHT

Chuck stirs and squints his eyes.  He takes a drink of water.
He is feeling better.  He puts another log on the fire and
slowly begins to chew on some breadfruit and dried fish.

EXT.  BEACH - LATER

Chuck slowly wades into the water, favoring his injured foot.
But something feels different.  He glances around.  What is
it?  And then he sees something, perhaps the worst possible
sight.

CHUCK'S POV - SAIL

A SAIL is moving steadily away from the island.

CHUCK

Throws down the spear and waves his arms.

                     CHUCK
          No!  Wait!  Come back!

He runs into the water and starts to swim.  He is so weak,
however, he can only make a few strokes.  He tries to yell as
he swims...

                     CHUCK
          Wait!  Wait!

Choking and weak, he turns back and drags himself up on the
beach.  In the b.g., the sail dwindles into the distance.

EXT.  SUMMIT - LATER

Chuck struggles to the top of the hill.  His fire has been
extinguished by the rain.  In the distance, far against the
horizon, he sees a sail -- or is it a cloud?  The whiteness
shimmers against the horizon.  Chuck squints.  Whatever it
was, it is gone.  Above him some contrails from jets mark the
sky.

Furious, he kicks his signal fire, scattering the burnt-out
coals.

EXT.  BEACH - LATER THAT DAY

Chuck makes a new mark on his calendar tree.  Then he stops.
He CUTS an angry big line under the last mark, then hacks
away at the palm tree, slashing it with the stone knife,
ripping and marking through all his dates.  Finally the stone
knife breaks in two.  Chuck drops the broken half and catches
his breath.

EXT.  CAVE - NIGHT

Chuck enters the cave.  No signal fires burn.  The island is
dark.

EXT.  SUMMIT - DAY

Chuck stands on the summit, staring out to sea.  Nothing, not
even a contrail, not even a whale spout.

EXT.  CLIFF - MOMENTS LATER

He is on his way down, suddenly he sees something and stops.
It's the HANDPRINT, the bloody handprint, his own handprint.

He slowly extends his hand and covers it, then pulls it away.
Traces it with his fingers.

INT.  CAVE - DAYS LATER

Chuck has the beginnings of an artist's studio.  Several
large clam shells hold paint.  A few egg shells are lined up.
Brushes have been made from roots and feathers.

Chuck covers his hand with paint and makes a handprint on the
wall of the cave.  He stands back and looks at it.

INT.  CAVE - DAY

He chews some berries, then holds his hand against the wall
of the cave and spits a dark blue mist around it.  When he
takes his hand away, the silhouette of his handprint remains.

INT.  CAVE - DAY

With the Angel Wing Box as a model, Chuck dips one of his
feather brushes in paint, and make a tentative line on the
wall of the cave.  He works hesitantly, rubs off a line,
tries again.

INT.  CAVE - NIGHT

Chuck is finishing his first figure, a crude portrait of a
man -- himself?  Hard to tell.  He examines his work.  He
takes some shells and sticks them on as eyes.

Chuck picks up Wilson, thinks.

                     CHUCK
          You old airhead, you need a makeover.

He takes some charcoal out of his fire and draws eyebrows on
the ball.  Then, he mashes some berries, dips his fingers in
the juice, and makes lips.  He sticks shells on with clay for
eyes.  Then he looks at the face.

                     CHUCK
          Wilson, you bad!

He sits back and regards his companion.  He gestures around
the cave at the new paintings.

                     CHUCK
          What do you think?

But Wilson doesn't have an opinion.

                     CHUCK
          You don't share much, do you?

Idly Chuck takes down the Angel Box.

                     CHUCK
          I guess I know how Kelly felt.

For a long time he studies the wings on it.  With a stick, he
tries to draw a similar wing on the dusty floor of the cave.
Dissatisfied, he wipes it away.  He looks at the Angel Box.

Casually he reaches over and cuts it open with a stone knife.
Inside he finds two bottles of green salsa.  And a letter.

He reads over it.

                     CHUCK
          You said our life was a prison.  Dull.
          Boring.  Empty.  I can't begin to tell
          you how much that hurt.  I don't want to
          lose you.  I'm enclosing some salsa, the
          verde you like.  Use it on your sticky
          rice and think of home.  Then come home
          -- to me.  We'll find the spice in our
          lives again.  Together.  I love you.
          Always.  Bettina.

Visibly moved, Chuck puts down the letter.

                     CHUCK
          He never got it.

EXT.  ISLAND - DAY

The monsoon pours down.  Wind whips the palm trees.  The
waves are gray and angry, tearing at the beach.

INT.  CAVE - DAY

As the rain pours down outside, Chuck studies the sodden,
ruined photograph of Kelly, which is really only a gray mess.

                     CHUCK
          She's probably found someone else.  I
          would have.

Chuck dips his finger into one of the bowls of colors and
streaks it slowly across his face.  To exorcise his
loneliness, he will paint on the most expressive canvas there
is:  his own body.

CHUCK PAINTING HIMSELF - MONTAGE

Close-up on scarred fingers, as they paint on Chuck's face
and body.  Color on skin.  Tight dramatic shots of Chuck
being transformed.

Chuck takes white paint and covers his hand.  Then he presses
it into his chest and makes a handprint.  He draws a yellow
spiral on his leg, then takes red and makes jagged lightning
bolts on his chest on either side of the hand.

WATER

Shimmers in a gourd.  Chuck's face swims into focus.  It has
been painted white.  Looking at himself in the reflection, he
dots on blue stars with dark blue from squid ink.

EXT.  CAVE - LATER

The rains have stopped.  The island is washed bright and
green.

ON CHUCK

As he stands up in the cove.  His face is white with blue
stars.  Handprints circle his torso, flanked by red lightning
bolts.  Braided cords circle his biceps.  Bone necklaces hang
from his neck.  Feathers jut out from his hair.

EXT.  JUNGLE - DAY

Chuck goes from tree to tree, making handprints along his
path.  Chuck was here.  This is his mark.

EXT.  PALM GROVE - DAY

He covers the calendar trees with handprints.  Then stops.
Sees something.  Eyes fixed on the beach, he walks toward the
shoreline.

EXT.  BEACH - DAY

Chuck emerges from the palm trees, and now we see what he had
seen.

A FIFTY-FIVE GALLON OIL DRUM.

And another one.  TWO.  Chuck stares at the barrels.

                     CHUCK
          Hello.

EXT.  BEACH - LATER

Chuck sits staring at the oil drums.  It's almost as if he is
hesitating to take advantage of them.  That he may not want,
really, to leave now.

Then his inner struggle ends.

                     CHUCK
          What the hell are you waiting for?

EXT.  BEACH - LATER

Filled with determination, Chuck rolls a barrel up the beach.

EXT.  BEACH - LATER

Using a palm tree as a fulcrum, Chuck hauls hard on a rope
made of vines, pulling the barrel up off the beach.

EXT.  JUNGLE - DAY

Chuck throws aside palm leaves, revealing...the remains of
his raft.

INT.  CAVE - NIGHT

Chuck is drawing with a purpose now.  And we see what he is
working on.  The plans for a raft.

INT.  CAVE - NIGHT

Chuck is making a list of what he needs.  He works intently.

                     CHUCK
          Canteens.  Sea anchor.  Got to weave
          rope.  Spears.  A sail.

EXT.  JUNGLE - DAY

Chuck lashes the barrels onto the raft.  Checks the knots.
Lashes more rope.

INT.  CAVE - NIGHT

He sews dresses together with handmade fiber string.

INT.  CAVE - NIGHT

He weaves videotape together to form a sea anchor.

EXT.  BEACH - DAY

Chuck digs a channel toward the raft.

INT.  CAVE - DAY

Chuck constructs a water collection device with some FedEx
boxes, some plastic weighted with a stone.  Explains it to
Wilson.

                     CHUCK
          Now I'm hoping that if this is airtight
          I'll get condensation down here, a cup or
          so a day.  If I'm careful it should be
          enough.

INT.  CAVE - NIGHT

Chuck writes on the wall.

                     CHUCK
          If I never return, know that here lived
          Chuck Noland for four years.  I drew
          these paintings.  I made these marks.
          And then I took my fate in my own hands
          and set forth to save myself, God
          willing.

EXT.  BEACH - DAY

Chuck loads the raft, which rocks gently in the cove.  He has
a sail made of designer dresses sewn together with fiber
thread.  A sea anchor secured by videotape woven together
into a rope.  Plastic bottles filled with water.  A signal
kite made of FedEx paper.

Then comes the FedEx box with the angel wings.  Then Wilson.

                     CHUCK
          Wilson, my main man.  Time to go.

And he gently leads the raft into the lagoon.

                     CHUCK
          Wonder what odds Stan would give me on
          this.  I'd say 90-10.  Against.

He jumps onto the raft, begins to paddle out toward where the
surf crashes onto the reef.

EXT.  LAGOON - DAY

Waves break against the reef.  With his paddles Chuck
maneuvers the raft toward the cut in the reef.  Boom!  The
wave crashes, the water surges through the cut, then recedes
with a whoosh.

Chuck watches, times the waves, paddles like mad.  He's
committed.  SCRAPE goes the first barrel, then the second,
riding the receding wave.  He's out!

But the next wave is already surging forward.  It smashes the
raft against the reef!  Coconuts and foodstuffs hurtle off
the raft!

The barrels cushion the impact.  The raft tilts, spins, but
stays outside the reef!  The ropes holding the jugs of water
break!  The water sweeps overboard!

The wave recedes again.  Chuck recovers, paddles with all his
strength, and then he's clear of the breakers!

For a long moment he floats on the rollers, getting his
breath.

The water jugs float away, carried by the waves back into the
lagoon.  Chuck could go back and get them.  If he were being
prudent, he definitely would.

But he's out.  He might never get back out again.

He stares at the lagoon and the receding water jugs.  Then he
stares at the island.  Goodbye to all that.

                     CHUCK
          Wilson, we're out of here.

He turns and begins raising the sail.

EXT.  OCEAN - WIDE - MINUTES LATER

Powered by its multicolored makeshift sail, trailing its
gently flapping signal kite of FedEx paper, the raft slowly
moves away from the island, out toward the open ocean.

And we pull back until the ocean swallows the tiny raft and
then we TILT DOWN AND...

                                                 DISSOLVE TO:

EXT.  OCEAN - DAY - FOUR WEEKS LATER

The ocean again, low.  The raft floats into frame.  A trace
of a breeze flaps the signal kite, which barely stays aloft,
its rope frayed and tattered.  The still is set up in the
middle, plastic with a rock weighting down the center.

Chuck is gaunt, his clothes rotted.

He lies looking over the side of the raft, spear in one hand,
staring intently at the water.

Dorados swim like specters, flashing and darting.  Chuck
stabs with his spear.  Stabs again.

                     CHUCK
          Slow down, damn you!

Exhausted, he sinks back to the raft.  Two Dorados leap into
the air ahead of him.

Chuck tries to stare again into the water.  He spots another
fish, a flash of silver under the surface.

Chuck struggles to his feet, raises his spear.  SPLAT!
Something strikes him in the chest, almost knocking him into
the water.

On the raft we see flashes of silver and green and blue.  A
FLYING FISH.  Chuck dives at it, catches it, loses it.

                     CHUCK
          Catch it catch it catch it --

He catches it again just as it almost flops over the side.

EXT.  RAFT - MOMENTS LATER

Chuck sucks the juice out of the head.  He chews meat off the
tiny rib bones.

Chuck is in the stage of malnutrition, vitamin deprivation,
salt insufficiency, and exposure where the personality splits
and becomes external.  Like all castaways, he has
conversations with the two sides of himself.

                     GOODCHUCK
          Save some for tomorrow.

                     BADCHUCK
          Catch another fish tomorrow.

BadChuck wins.  Chuck keeps eating.  He stares up at the sun,
which beats down unmercifully.

EXT.  RAFT - DAY - LATER

The raft drifts.  Chuck has taken down the sail and rigged it
as a canopy.  Drenched with sweat, Chuck lies on the raft,
trying to sleep.  He dabs at some sores that are ulcerating
his body and won't let him get comfortable.  Plus, there's a
chaffing, squeaking sound.  He looks around for the source.

We see it with him.  One of the ropes is frayed and about to
break.  If it does, the logs will come apart from the floats.

                     BADCHUCK
          Shit!  Shit!  Shit!

                     GOODCHUCK
          Stay calm, identify the problem.
          Problem, rope fraying.  Solution, fix
          rope.

                     BADCHUCK
          With what?  There's nothing to fix it
          with.  This rope comes undone, you're
          going to drown.

                     GOOD CHUCK
          Just get up and fix it.

                     BADCHUCK
          Too tired.

                     GOODCHUCK
          Get up.

                     BADCHUCK
          Feels so good to lie here.

                     GOODCHUCK
          Get up, damn you.

Chuck comes to his knees.  Then sinks back down.

                     BADCHUCK
          Can't.  Need water.

                     GOODCHUCK
          You've had today's water.

                     BADCHUCK
          Thirsty.

                     GOODCHUCK
          Come on, shape up, get going, you can do
          it.

                     BADCHUCK
          No water, no work.

Chuck tries another tack.  Sweet reason.

                     GOODCHUCK
          Okay look, I know you're tired, I know
          you're thirsty, but give it one more
          shot, you've just got to do a little
          more.

                     BADCHUCK
          Do too much, I'll die.

                     GOODCHUCK
          Do too little you'll die.

                     BADCHUCK
          Going to die anyway.

That stops GoodChuck for a moment.

                     GOODCHUCK
          Okay, look have an extra swallow.

He holds up the pathetic little jar with its few teaspoons of
murky water.

                     BADCHUCK
          No more water, you said.

                     GOODCHUCK
          Take it.

                     BADCHUCK
          No.

                     GOODCHUCK
          Take it, damn it.

                     BADCHUCK
          No.

                     GOODCHUCK
          Wilson, do you believe this?  Take the
          damn water.

Slowly Chuck gets up, lifts up the water jar, and takes a
swallow.  Then another.

                     GOODCHUCK
          Stop.  Enough.

Then another.

EXT.  RAFT - DAY - LATER

Chuck works to braid a new rope.  He is focused,
concentrating as hard as he can, but everything is slow and
hard and he's weak and clumsy.  He tests the rope, but it
doesn't hold.

                     GOODCHUCK
          Think.  Got to use something else.

He gets an idea, starts to pull the signal kite in.

                     BADCHUCK
          If they can't see you, what's the point?

                     GOODCHUCK
          Survive today, that's the point.

The kite rope is much thinner than the rope he had used to
tie the logs, but it's all he has.  He ties the log with the
kite rope.  Exhausted, he lies back down.

EXT.  RAFT - NIGHT

The moon is full.  The waves cast off shadows on the ocean.
Chuck is staring into the sky, trying to find a star to
navigate by.

                     GOODCHUCK
          Polaris, where are you?  Maybe I'm too
          far south.

                     BADCHUCK
          You don't know where you are.  You missed
          the shipping lanes.

                     GOODCHUCK
          Moon's too bright.

We hear the fraying sound again.

EXT.  RAFT - DAY

Chuck saws at the outer log with his stone knife.  Across the
water comes a storm.  We can see it like a waterfall moving
toward us.

                     BADCHUCK
          You're putting off the inevitable.

                     GOODCHUCK
          I'm putting it off.

He looks at the deteriorating rope, at the rotting sail.

                     BADCHUCK
          That's what's happening to you.

Chuck pushes the outer log away, then takes the loose rope
and begins to lash it around the center logs.

                     BADCHUCK
          You're rotting away.

The raft is rocking.  The waves are stronger.  It's hard to
tie the logs together.

Rain falls like a sheet on Chuck.

                     BADCHUCK
          Get water!

                     GOODCHUCK
          Fix raft first.

                     BADCHUCK
          Water water water --

Chuck works frantically in the rain, trying to tie the rope.
Finally he does.

Then he scrambles for his water collecting funnel, struggles
to pull it up.  One corner is stuck and collapses.
Desperately he rights it, pulls the funnel up.

Drops begin to run down the sides and collect in the jar.
Soaked, Chuck stares at the water as it rises.

Then the rain stops.

We see the line of rain recede away from Chuck, spattering
the ocean.  But all around him the ocean is calm again.

And out comes the sun.

EXT.  OCEAN - DAY

The raft floats on quiet seas.  The sky is blue, with few
high cirrus clouds so motionless they seem pasted on.

Chuck lies on the raft, sick and weak.

Suddenly, from the depths beside him, silently rises a huge
shape.

A SPERM WHALE, still mainly submerged.  The blow hole is near
Chuck, wet and pulsing like giant lips.  The eye of the whale
is only a few feet away.  It looks upon Chuck out of an
intelligence deep and alien.

He slowly comes to his knees and stares at it.

The blow hole opens and WHOOSH, out shoots a geyser of fine
spray which settles on Chuck in a mist.

The whale rises farther, dwarfing the raft.  From the whale
comes a deep sound like a foghorn.

Startled, Chuck jumps back, rocking the raft.  He catches
himself, slowly reaches out and touches the whale.

The whale blows again, drenching Chuck in more spray.

Chuck touches the whale again.

                     GOODCHUCK
          You like that?

Very slowly it drifts along with the raft.

                     GOODCHUCK
          Lost your mate?

We look right into the whale's eye.  Beneath the surface we
can see the huge jaws open and close.

                     GOODCHUCK
          You're beautiful.  Marry me.

                     BADCHUCK
          You idiot, if he dives, he'll capsize the
          raft.

Very slowly the whale moves ahead of the raft, its vast body
passing Chuck.

                     GOODCHUCK
          No, don't go.  Look, I've got fish.

Chuck rips a fillet off the line and throws it in front of
the whale, which ignores it.

                     GOODCHUCK
          Please don't dive.  Please.

The whale slowly sinks, then suddenly arches its huge back
and heads straight for the bottom.

For a moment, all that remains are the flukes, black and
vertical against the dark blue sky.  With one swoop, those
flukes could destroy Chuck and his raft.  But they don't do
anything except slowly sink.

Then it is gone.

We are on Chuck's face as he stares at where the whale had
been, the surface marked only by a ring of concentric ripples
that reach out and gently rock the raft.

EXT.  OCEAN - DAY

Chuck checks the water.  It is green and full of floaties.
It looks awful.  He takes the jug, puts it to his mouth, and
drinks.  Instantly he throws up back into the jug, barely
keeps from dropping it.

                     BADCHUCK
          Look what you've done.

He dips his hand into the ocean, splashes some sea water on
his face, splutters it out, then licks his lips.  He is so
thirsty.

He looks at the water jug, full now with his own vomit, turns
away, begins to work on the sea anchor again.

But the work makes him even thirstier.  He looks at the jug
again.

Picks it up.  Takes a long drink.

EXT.  OCEAN - DAY

The fish return.  Chuck gets up with his spear, then puts it
down.

                     BADCHUCK
          What are you doing?

                     GOODCHUCK
          Can't kill another one.  Can't.  Can't
          kill my friends anymore.

                     BADCHUCK
          You fucking bleeding heart, you kill or
          you die.

                     GOODCHUCK
          Why do they have to die for me?

                     BADCHUCK
          They'd eat you if they could.  They're
          laughing at you.  Listen.

Chuck listens.  Doesn't hear anything.

                     GOODCHUCK
          Got to eat.

Chuck picks up the spear, stabs it, misses.

Suddenly he has a fish on the end of the spear.  It
struggles, he scoops it onto the raft, brutally pounds on its
head, twists the stone knife into its spine.  The struggling
stops.

Chuck looks at the dead fish and begins to sob.

                     GOODCHUCK
          I am so sorry.

He cries uncontrollably.  As he cries he cuts off the head,
pulls out the eyeballs, and eats each one.  Then he sucks the
marrow out of the head.

Then takes the heart and eats that.  Then eats the liver.

As he is chewing, he cuts the meat into strips.

When he is done, he takes the backbone, breaks it, and sucks
on it.

Fish scales shine in his hair, blood covers his chest.

EXT.  OCEAN - NIGHT

The raft rocks gently.  Chuck looks up.  The strips of fish
are glowing.  So is the deck where he killed the fish.

He reaches out to touch the fish strips.  His hand is glowing
too.

                     CHUCK
          I'm an angel.

Suddenly he sees other lights.  A ship.  A ship is out there.
And he hears it, a humming in deep register.

He waves his hands.  He yells.

                     CHUCK
          Here!  Here!

His voice cracks, we can barely hear it over the ocean.

The lights move on.

                     CHUCK
          No...no...no...

His raft is rocked by the wake, rocked hard.  Chuck is thrown
into the water!

He comes to the surface, sputtering.  Where is the raft?

He looks one way, then another.  Darkness.

This is the worst.

He turns again in the water.  There, dimly, he can see the
glow from the fish he killed.  The glow saves his life.

He swims toward it.

He pulls himself back on the raft.

He lies there exhausted, the glow from the phosphorescence
casting a greenish light on his face.

EXT.  OCEAN - DAY

Clouds are building up.  In the distance lightning flashes.
The clouds come closer.

Little bits of electricity jump off the mast.  Saint Elmos
fire jumps around Chuck's hand.

Fascinated, he holds out his hand.  The fire jumps from his
hand to the mast.

Suddenly lightning shoots from the sky and strikes the ocean!
A huge spout of water explodes like a depth charge.  The
CRACK is intense, then rolls away.

Chuck stares, then realizes the danger and throws himself
down on the raft.  Suddenly a wall of rain sweeps over him
and the ocean begins to roll.  The thunder is deafening.
Lightning flashes bursts through the rain.

                     CHUCK
          Sea anchor!  Let out the sea anchor!

Frantic, Chuck lets out the sea anchor as the raft scuds down
a huge wave.  The anchor catches, slowing the raft so that it
rides the wave down.

The waves come at him high as houses.  The raft rides up one
side, then plunges down the next.

All Chuck can do is hold on.

EXT.  OCEAN - DAY

The storm has passed.  The raft floats on big dark rollers.

We hear the chirping and squeaking of dolphins.  They come
close to the raft.  Chuck watches them play.  Then realizes
they are chasing his fish.  They drive them along, into the
path of another dolphin, who darts in and rips into the
dorado, turning the water around the raft into churning,
bloody foam.

                     CHUCK
          Stop!

He takes his oar and begins beating the water.  The killing
continues.

                     CHUCK
          You fucking murderers!

Suddenly the water is still.  One dolphin sticks its head out
of the water and stares at Chuck, squeaking.

Another dolphin lifts its head up, then another.  They squeak
to each other, clearly communicating and talking about Chuck.

                     CHUCK
          I know you're talking about me!

He splashes the water with his oar.

They dive, then jump into the air, squeaking as they go.

                     CHUCK
               (very softly)
          Take me with you.

They're gone.

                     CHUCK
          Why me?  Why me, God?

He begins to laugh.

                     BADCHUCK
          Listen to this, Wilson.
               (deep voice: God)
          Because you piss me off.

EXT.  OCEAN - DAY

Chuck tries to stretch with some simple yoga.  Each movement
takes forever.

He rolls over onto his stomach and tries to do a pushup.  He
can't.  Collapses onto the raft.

                     BADCHUCK
          You're falling apart.

Tries to do another pushup.  Can't.

                     BADCHUCK
          First you eat your fat, then you eat your
          muscle.

He rolls over.

                     BADCHUCK
          Then you eat your mind.

He looks at the ocean.  They're in a line of garbage, a thick
slick of debris dumped off of ships.

                     GOODCHUCK
          Roll on you deep and dark blue ocean
          roll.

He closes his eyes.  After a minute they come open.

                     GOODCHUCK
          I'm late, I'm late, for a very important
          date.

They slowly close again.

                     BADCHUCK
          I'm lost.  Goodbye.

                     GOODCHUCK
          No!

His eyes come open again.

                     BADCHUCK
          Look, just slip off the raft.  The ocean
          would feel so good, the water's so soft
          and warm.  Take a little swim.  Sleep.

                     GOODCHUCK
          You quitter you quitter you quitter.

                     BADCHUCK
          The sea is lovely, dark and deep.

                     GOODCHUCK
          But I have promises to keep.
               (rolls over)
          And miles to go before I sleep.
               (props himself up)
          And miles to go before I sleep.
               (purpose now)
          Got to fix the sea anchor.  Use the sail.

                     BADCHUCK
          Use the sail for a sea anchor and you
          won't move.

                     GOODCHUCK
          If I don't have a sea anchor I'll
          capsize.

                     BADCHUCK
          Die tomorrow or die today.

He hums Beethoven's fifth.  BA BA BA BUM.

                     BADCHUCK
          That's death knocking, knocking on your
          door.  Crazy little woman come knocking,
          knocking at my front door...

                     GOODCHUCK
          Grow up, stop being such a baby.  Other
          people get through a lot worse.

                     BADCHUCK
          Yeah, sure, what?

He hums to himself, begins to sing, Beatles.

                     BADCHUCK
          I'm so tired, my mind is on the blink...

He pulls in the loose sea anchor rope, which is covered with
barnacles.

He scrapes the barnacle off the rope into the water jug, then
sips it.

The sun is setting, huge rays shoot out across the sky.

Out of the empty ocean the Dorados suddenly appear, leaping
flashes of silver right by the raft.

One Dorado swims right by the raft, broadside.

Chuck looks at it, uncomprehending.  Then slowly reaches for
his spear.

                     GOODCHUCK
          What?  Are you sacrificing yourself for
          me?

Carefully he comes to his feet, then shoots the spear into
the fish.

Flapping and struggling, it lands on the deck.  Chuck pounces
on it.

EXT.  RAFT - NIGHT - MOMENTS LATER

He cuts it open.  The other Dorados ram the raft in fury,
like a lynch mob.

                     GOODCHUCK
          Damn it!  I had to do it!

The banging continues.

                     GOODCHUCK
          I'm sorry!

He concentrates on his work, then sits back on his heels in
amazement.  There's another fish inside.  He holds that fish
up, stares at it, then cuts it open.

There's a smaller fish inside it.

                     GOODCHUCK
          I know there's a moral here, God, but
          right now I'm just going to eat.

He pops out an eyeball, then another, and crunches them
between his teeth.

He takes the heart and liver, starts to eat, then stops.

                     GOODCHUCK
          Forgot to say grace.  Sorry Mom.

He struggles to remember.

                     GOODCHUCK
          Bless us O Lord, and these thy gifts and
          Christ and the bounty about to receive,
          or something...amen.

He eats them.

EXT.  RAFT - NEXT MORNING

Chuck splashes sea water on his face.  Adjusts the water
still.

                     GOODCHUCK
          Please don't leak.  Please.

Chuck picks up the smallest fish.  It's half digested.  He
washes it in the ocean, trigger fish come up and nibble at
his fingers.

                     GOODCHUCK
          Don't look at me.  It was that Dorado.

He cuts the small fish and hangs it on the stays.

                     GOODCHUCK
          You know, Wilson, every now and then we
          should say thank you.  Thank you God.

                     BADCHUCK
          Thank you for fucking up my life.

Suddenly something bumps the raft.  Hard.  Then again.

                     GOODCHUCK
          Not again.

Fins cut the water.  SHARKS.  A big hammerhead bumps the
raft.  BadChuck hums the theme from "Jaws."  Chuck takes his
spear stabs at the shark.

                     BADCHUCK
          He's going to get you, going to get
          you...

Another one circles in, bumps the raft.

                     GOODCHUCK
          Get away from me!

The shark circles again, that big hammerhead like a
nightmare.

                     GOODCHUCK
          Get him get him get him.

He stabs at it with his spear.  He might as well have stabbed
concrete.  The shark circle, Chuck stabs again.

But the shark is gone.

                     GOODCHUCK
          Where are you?  Where are you?

Stabs again and again at the empty ocean.

                     GOODCHUCK
          Stop!  You're using energy.  Move slowly.
          Be patient.

Chuck kneels, wavering, on the raft.  The ocean is calm.

Suddenly, BUMP.  The raft tilts.

Chuck hangs on.

Then a shark appears, just out of spear range.  Its lifeless
black eyes seem to stare right through Chuck.

If the Dorado was a gift from God, this is a message from
Hell.

Then the shark is gone.

EXT.  RAFT - DAY - MOMENTS LATER

Chuck lies back on the raft.  He is humming.

                     BADCHUCK
          What are you smiling about?  They'll be
          back.

                     GOODCHUCK
          I'm dancing on the roof of the Peabody
          Hotel.  With Kelly.

He smiles at the thought.

                     GOODCHUCK
          The music ends.  We go back to the table.
          The waiters have brought dinner.  New
          York Strip with Bordelaise Sauce.
          Mushrooms in brown gravy.  Roasted
          potatoes with garlic and rosemary.  Green
          Beans with almonds.  Fresh biscuits and
          cornbread, dripping with butter.  A nice
          salad with ranch dressing.  A jumbo
          shrimp cocktail.

Thinks about that, it spoils the picture.

                     GOODCHUCK
          No shrimp.
               (then)
          We eat.

He closes his eyes.  This is the greatest fantasy.

                     GOODCHUCK
               (as the waiter)
          For dessert, we have pecan pie a la mode,
          we have a double chocolate cake with
          creme anglaise, we have a nice pear
          torte, fresh key lime pie, or perhaps if
          you care to wait a few minutes, a grand
          marnier souffle?

Chuck thinks over the options, thinking of each one.

                     GOODCHUCK
          Why, bring them all, bring them all.

He rolls over.  There, square in his vision, is a ship, its
form coming in and out of a low haze.

Chuck jumps to his feet.  Waves.  Screams.

                     GOODCHUCK
          Here!  Over here!

The ship moves on.  We can see the decks the rigging, the
vastness of it.

Chuck realizes he is naked.  Struggles to pull on the remains
of his pants finally holds them like a diaper with one hand
as he continues to wave.

On the ship no one is to be seen.  It is a spooky sight.

The big tanker moves on.

We are on Chuck's face.  Passed up again.

Then he realizes what is about to happen.  He throws out the
sea anchor.

He throws himself onto the raft and grips it as tight as he
can, wiggles his feet into the ropes.

                     CHUCK
          Oh, shiiiittt!

Then comes the wake of the ship.  It rocks the raft like a
piece of flotsam.  The raft rides high up on the wave, then
shoots down it, but the sea anchor holds, and the raft slows
and rides along with the wave.

And then the sea is calm again.

Slowly Chuck sinks to his knees.  His hand lets loose his
pants.

He lies down on the raft and imagines the conversation with
the ship's captain.

                     CHUCK
          Permission to come aboard, sir.

                     CHUCK/CAPTAIN
          Permission granted.

                     CHUCK
          May I ask, where are you bound?

                     CHUCK/CAPTAIN
          San Francisco.  And you?

                     CHUCK
          As it happens, I'm headed for Frisco
          myself.

                     CHUCK/CAPTAIN
          Would you do us the honor of joining us?
          We're just sitting down at mess.  Pork
          chops and gravy, cranberries, baked
          potatoes with all the trimmings, fresh-
          baked bread, apple pie...

                     CHUCK
          No please, join me.  Some sundried fish
          strips, a few eyeballs, some gills to
          munch on.

The depression comes back again.

                     BADCHUCK
          They're never going to see you.  You're
          just another piece of trash in the ocean.

                     GOODCHUCK
          They're on autopilot.

                     BADCHUCK
          They're always on autopilot.  Or else
          it's night, or you're in the sun, or
          you're in the trough of a wave.  They'll
          never see you.

                     GOODCHUCK
          Damn it!  Don't be so negative!

Chuck picks up Wilson.

                     GOODCHUCK
          Wilson, what's your story?

He holds Wilson close to his chest.

                     BADCHUCK
          I float.  You sink.  End of story.

                     GOODCHUCK
          I'm serious.  I'm always going on about
          me, me, me.  Enough about me.  Your turn.

                     BADCHUCK
          It's a fucking soccer ball, you idiot.

                     GOODCHUCK
          Shut up.

He lies on the raft and holds Wilson close.

We move up until we see --

EXT.  OCEAN - AERIAL - EVENING

Chuck lying curled up on the raft, Wilson cradled in his
arms, and all around the vast empty ocean.

EXT.  OCEAN - NEXT MORNING

Chuck slowly wakes up.  Sets Wilson aside.

                     GOODCHUCK
          Don't shirk, don't procrastinate, don't
          be lazy.  We're okay today.  We're okay
          today.

And the other Chuck begins to laugh.

                     GOODCHUCK
          Shut up.

The laughter goes on.

                     GOODCHUCK
          Shut the fuck up!  I mean it.

He stands up and checks the horizon.

                     GOODCHUCK
          What's so damn funny?

                     BADCHUCK
          You are.

Suddenly Chuck sees something on the horizon.  A bank of
clouds.  A cone of -- land.

He squints, stares again.  The clouds part.  It looks like --
his island.

Chuck doesn't know whether to feel joy or despair.

                     GOODCHUCK
          Jesus.

                     BADCHUCK
          Look again, asshole.  It's a mirage.

Chuck squints.

                     GOODCHUCK
          It's real.

                     BADCHUCK
          Nothing out there but ocean.

                     GOODCHUCK
          Let's get a second opinion.  Wilson?
          What do you see?

Chuck picks up the soccer ball, holds it up, and stares out
at...ocean.

EXT.  RAFT - DAY - LATER

Chuck slowly writes on the sail.

                     CHUCK
          Chuck Noland.  Born October 8, 1958.
          Died -- pick a date -- July 11, 1998.
          And now the epitaph.  Met deadlines.
          Kept appointments.  Lost without a trace.

He sits back, looks at the mock headstone.

                     BADCHUCK
          What did it matter if FedEx was five
          minutes late one day?  The next day we
          just start over again.

                     GOODCHUCK
          It matters.  We do the best we can,
          that's all we have.

                     BADCHUCK
          Then we've just got shit.

He goes on writing.

                     CHUCK
          I am writing this to remind myself to
          live a better life.  If I am lost,
          perhaps you who find this will be
          instructed to live a better live
          yourself.  Live each day.  Love your
          children.  Don't take anyone for granted.

                     BADCHUCK
          Is that it?  Life is a fucking Disney
          movie?

The waves begin to grow, the ocean turns a slate gray.  Far
above him, great frigate birds circle.  Suddenly one dives on
a booby which has caught a fish.  The great frigate bird
swoops all around the booby until, panicked, it drops the
fish, which plummets toward the sea.

With a graceful dive, the huge bird grabs the fish and then
soars up on a thermal, high into the sky.

Lightning flashes back and forth across the horizon, which is
turning black and dark.  Thunder rolls.

EXT.  RAFT - NIGHT

The raft goes up and down huge waves.  Every few seconds
lightning flashes, illuminating the raft and Chuck holding
desperately to it, his eyes wild with fear.

EXT.  RAFT - MORNING

The waves continue.  Chuck holds on, his face pale.

                     BADCHUCK
          You can't make it.

                     GOODCHUCK
          Shut up.  I don't feel like dying today.

EXT.  OCEAN - DAY - LATER

The sky clears.  The waves are still big.  The fish are back.
And then come the sharks, cutting through the water.  Chuck
can't get up to get his spear, he just has to watch as blood
darkens the water.

And then the sharks are gone.

Chuck comes to his knees slowly, then a big wave hits.
Wilson is swept into the ocean!

For a moment Chuck is uncomprehending.  He watches as Wilson
slowly floats away.

                     CHUCK
          Please, no sharks.

Then he dives in to the water!  Swims frantically after
Wilson.

Wilson floats away from him.  He swims, but he's so weak.
Finally he gets to Wilson.  He reaches out, but only pushes
the ball farther away.

It bobs on the waves.  Chuck treads water, exhausted.

Where is the raft?

                     CHUCK
          Jesus.  Jesus.  Jesus.

Then he turns back the other way.  The raft has drifted by
him.  He can go after Wilson, or he can go after the raft.

                     CHUCK
          Shit!  Wilson!

He swims toward the raft, barely moving.  No matter how hard
he swims, the raft seems to recede from him.

Finally he reaches it, hangs on the side, breathing hard,
choking, crying.

He struggles to pull himself on board.

But he is weak, so weak.  He can't do it.

Summoning some primitive reserve of strength, he tries again.
This time he slides on.

He lies on the raft, panting.

Then with all his strength he pulls himself to his feet,
holds on to the mast, scans the ocean for Wilson.

                     CHUCK
          Wilson!

Nothing but waves.

This is too much.  Chuck starts to cry.

EXT.  RAFT - DAY - LATER

Chuck takes a swallow of water, washes it around in his
mouth, then swallows.  With his wet tongue he licks his
cracked lips.

The sun breaks through the clouds.

With what strength he has left, Chuck raises the canopy,
fastens it.

He sits in the meager shade, his head between his knees.

Closes his eyes.  Just for a minute.

EXT.  OCEAN - DAY - LATER

A different sort of shadow crosses Chuck's face.  He opens
his eyes.

There, riding right beside his raft, is a ship, a huge rusty
tanker.  Someone shouts down in a language we don't
understand.

Chuck sits up, can't believe it.  Struggles to cover himself.

EXT.  OCEAN - DAY - LATER

Chuck is lifted up the rusted steel side of the boat in a
Jacob's ladder.

EXT.  SHIP - DAY - LATER

Chuck steps on board, can't support himself.

The crew gathers around.  None of them speak English, but
there is a spontaneous outburst of human connection.

One man brings some water.  Another a blanket.  Another some
warm tea.

Chuck sits there, shivering now.

                     CHUCK
          Thank you.  Oh thank you.

Deliriously happy.  Delirious.

INT.  U.S. NAVAL HOSPITAL - HAWAII

A cavernous hanger-sized ward brightly lit and filled with
row upon row of hospital beds, each with its table, side
chair, and lamp, each with a stainless steel bedpan and
neatly folded sheets and blankets stacked ready to use, and
each completely empty.

Except for one.

And on that bed we see Chuck, in a blue hospital gown.  An IV
drips into his arm.  He plays idly with the remote control of
the bed.  He raises the head, then the foot.  He pushes
another button and the knee rest bends the bed again.

A DOCTOR enters, carrying a thick chart.  Chuck gives him a
big manic grin.  Malcolm MacDowell in "A Clockwork Orange."

                     CHUCK
          My favorite doctor.  What's the verdict?

                     DOCTOR
          Under the circumstances your overall
          health is good.  Those salt water boils
          you picked up on the raft are ulcerated,
          but they're healing nicely.

He checks his blood work records.

                     DOCTOR
          Hemoglobin's 10.8 -- you're anemic,
          that's why we're giving you iron.
          Potassium's low -- we're giving you an
          electrolyte solution with your IV.
          Sodium's over 150, way too high.  You may
          experience swelling in your extremities
          as you rehydrate and discharge the salt.
          In spite of your dietary deficiencies
          there's no sign of mental deterioration.

Chuck has been trying not to laugh.  Now he can't stop
himself.

                     DOCTOR
          What's so funny.

Chuck can't seem to help laughing at everything.

                     CHUCK
          Sorry...sorry... Why do my joints still
          ache?

                     DOCTOR
          Dehydration.  Vitamin deficiency.
          Protein deficiency.  Any or all of the
          above.

                     CHUCK
          All I ate was fish.  That's solid
          protein.

                     DOCTOR
          Protein digestion is very costly in water
          usage.

                     CHUCK
          Which I didn't have.

                     DOCTOR
          And fish are very low in fat, which is
          energy inefficient.  So you're going to
          burn up your own cells no matter how much
          you eat.  Luckily you ate the eyes and
          pancreas, which contain some Vitamin C,
          so you didn't get scurvy.

Chuck laughs again.

                     CHUCK
          I am one lucky guy.

                     DOCTOR
          Your body chemistry and your exposure to
          the elements would normally lead to
          irritability, depression, anxiety,
          periods of self-reproach.  It's almost
          like schizophrenia.  Different sides of
          your personality might come to life,
          speak out, act out.

                     CHUCK
          But all that's behind me.  I'm fine now.

He starts to laugh again.

                     DOCTOR
          If you say you are.

                     CHUCK
          I most definitely say I am.

                     DOCTOR
          Doctor Hegel tells me he discussed the
          Vietnam POW syndrome with you.

Chuck stifles his laughter.

                     CHUCK
          Yes, yes he did.

                     DOCTOR
          You are aware of the potential
          disruptiveness on your loved ones when
          you return to your old life?

                     CHUCK
          Not to mention on me.

The laughter again.  Unsettling.

                     DOCTOR
          You sure you don't want some counseling?

Chuck gives his biggest smile.

                     CHUCK
          Doc, I'm not on the island.  I'm not on
          the raft.  I'm alive.  I'm so glad to be
          back, I can't tell you.  I just want out
          of here.

                     DOCTOR
          Well, when that IV runs out, you're
          through with us.  Just the dentist
          tomorrow.

INT.  HOSPITAL - NIGHT - LATER

Rolling his IV, Chuck walks very slowly out of the ward.
Every step is an effort.

INT.  PHONE CUBICLE - NIGHT - MINUTES LATER

A small windowless room with only a desk and a phone, lit by
a fluorescent lamp.  Chuck is listening to the phone ring.

Kelly answers.

                     KELLY (V.O.)
          Hello.

Chuck is overcome for a moment, can't say a word.

                     KELLY (V.O.)
          Hello?  Hello?

For some reason he can't keep himself from laughing.  He
covers the mouthpiece and laughs.

And then we hear a dial tone, harsh, mechanical, final.

EXT.  PHONE CUBICLE - MINUTES LATER

We can see Chuck inside, staring at the phone.

INT.  PHONE CUBICLE - MINUTES LATER

We hear a faint persistent hum.  Chuck looks around, trying
to locate the sound.  He looks up, focuses on the fluorescent
light, that background sound he can no longer tune out, then
picks up the phone again.

EXT.  PHONE CUBICLE

Stan answers the phone.

                     STAN (V.O.)
          Hello?

                     CHUCK
          Stan, it's Chuck...Chuck Noland...

The laughter again.

                     STAN (V.O.)
          Whoever you are, you are one sick fucker.

And again we hear the dial tone.

INT.  PHONE CUBICLE - MOMENTS LATER

Chuck's on the phone again.

                     CHUCK
          Two Valium and the Rolling Stones.  That
          ring a bell?

There's a long silence.  Then we hear Stan's voice.

                     STAN (V.O.)
          God damn!  God damn!  Chuck, it's you!

                     CHUCK
          It's me.

                     STAN (V.O.)
          You're fucking dead!

                     CHUCK
          I'm most definitely not dead.  And as I
          recall, you're the sick fucker.

Chuck begins to laugh, a little too loud, a little too
shrill.  He's on a high.

EXT.  HAWAII - BEACH RESTAURANT

A terrace by the ocean.  Tables filled with diners.  Food
being delivered by waiters.  So simple, eating.  So taken for
granted.

At one table sits Chuck, dressed in a Hawaiian shirt and
shorts, with a half-dozen plates in front of him.  He
gestures to the waiter.  Bring me more.  It all tastes so
damned good.

Behind him is the ocean.  Chuck doesn't glance at it.

INT.  DENTIST - NEXT DAY

An attractive DENTAL TECHNICIAN with an Australian accent
cleans Chuck's teeth with an ultrasound device.  She's close,
very close.  Chuck looks up at her.  She looks really good.
She smiles at him, then touches the gap where he knocked out
his tooth.

                     TECHNICIAN
          You sure you don't want to have the
          implant done here?  We do quite good
          work.

Chuck shakes his head:  no.  She scrapes behind his front
teeth.

                     TECHNICIAN
          Hmmm, you do have such a lot of tarter
          behind these front incisors.  A little
          wider, please.

Chuck opens his mouth even further.  The technician talks on
in the self-absorbed way dental technicians sometimes do,
that constant babble of human contact which Chuck has not
heard for four years.

                     TECHNICIAN
          Anyway, so the second prosthetic foot
          worked better, but he still couldn't
          drive his new Cortina, it being a
          standard shift, if you follow me.

Chuck nods.  I follow you.

                     TECHNICIAN
          But would he hear of me driving him
          around?  Not on your bloody life.  Rinse
          please.

Chuck does.  Stan bursts into the room.

                     STAN
          Chuck!  God damn!

Chuck struggles out of the chair.

                     STAN
          God damn.  God damn.  God damn.

They are both almost overcome.  Stan holds Chuck by the
shoulders and looks at him.

                     STAN
          You're alive, you're fucking alive!

Chuck laughs, thrilled to see Stan.

                     CHUCK
          I beat the odds!

                     STAN
          You beat 'em to shit, pal!  Jesus!

                     TECHNICIAN
          I still need to floss you.

Stan notices the technician.

                     STAN
          Hello.

                     CHUCK
          This is Amber.  Her boyfriend lost his
          foot in a shark attack.

He says this with an absolute straight face, holding back the
laughter with great effort.  Instantly there's this
connection again between him and Stan.

                     TECHNICIAN
          Ex-boyfriend.

                     STAN
          Really.

And he and Chuck make eye contact and we see a glimpse of
their shared unspoken irony.

                     STAN
          Uh, there's somebody out here who wants
          to see you.

Chuck stares sharply at him.  Kelly?  Stan nods, but there's
something he wants to say.

                     STAN
          She thought you were dead.  We all did.

That's not all Stan wants to say.  But Chuck is limping out
the door.

INT.  DENTIST - WAITING ROOM

Typical dentist waiting room.  Chairs, tropical fish tanks,
magazines, a few waiting patients...and Kelly, looking
nervous.

Slowly and painfully Chuck enters.  He's quite a sight.  She
stands up.  There's a long moment where they look at each
other.

Then she comes into his arms.  Holds him tight.  She's part
laughing, part crying.

                     KELLY
          I'm sorry... I'm sorry...

                     CHUCK
          Hey...hey...it's okay!

Chuck is happy, he's still riding the high.

                     KELLY
          You're so thin.  Am I hurting you?

Well, maybe a little, but who cares?  He hasn't been hugged
or barely touched in so long.

                     CHUCK
          No...no...feels good...

She disengages, looks at him with that old smile.

                     KELLY
          Right back, you said you'd be right back.

                     CHUCK
          A few things came up.  Or went down.

He meets her gaze, looks her over with a smile.

                     CHUCK
          You look...wonderful.  I like your hair.

He notices the ring on her hand.

                     KELLY
          I got married.

                     CHUCK
          I thought you might have.

                     KELLY
          I would never --

                     CHUCK
          I know.

                     KELLY
          If I'd known you were alive --

                     CHUCK
          I would have done the same thing.

His responses come so quick.  Chuck seems blissfully sure of
himself.

                     KELLY
          I didn't want to.  It just happened.  One
          day Gary was there.  He took care of
          everything.  He took care of me.  I was a
          mess.

                     CHUCK
          You have any children?

Kelly nods.

                     CHUCK
          Got a picture?

Kelly fishes for a photo, shows it to Chuck.  It's a little
girl with a dog.

                     KELLY
          Her name's Hannah.

                     CHUCK
          Is that Jango?

                     KELLY
          No, this is Jack.  Jango was hit by a UPS
          truck.  Can you believe it?

Chuck laughs.  It is funny, sort of.

                     CHUCK
          Life's just one big joke after another.

Stan appears, takes in the scene.  The few patients waiting
are edged into the corners, trying to look occupied with
something else.

                     STAN
          How about we go somewhere else?

                     CHUCK
          Want to see my raft?

EXT.  HAWAII - DAY

Chuck's raft sits up on a dock.  Kelly stands staring at it.
How small and fragile it looks.

                     STAN
          This stinks really bad.

                     CHUCK
          You should have smelled me.

Stan examines the ropes around the logs.

                     STAN
          Cool ropes.

                     CHUCK
          I braided them.

                     STAN
          Must have taken a hell of a long time.

                     CHUCK
          Time I had lots of.

Kelly points at something on the raft.

                     KELLY
          What's that?

                     CHUCK
          That's my sea anchor.  My second one.
          Made it out of part of the sail.  It
          keeps you from capsizing in a storm.  In
          theory.
               (picks up his still)
          And this, this I used to collect water.
          About half a cup a day.

He's not feeling sorry for himself.  It's just a fact.

                     STAN
          You were how long on this?

                     CHUCK
          Forty-three days.

They look at the tiny raft.  It speaks for itself.

                     KELLY
          All that time I waited to go on a cruise,
          and you went without me.

                     CHUCK
          Yeah, well...couldn't be helped.

Kelly notices the sail, sees the writing on it.

                     KELLY
          What's that, written on the sail?

                     CHUCK
          My epitaph.

Kelly reads it to herself.  Her eyes are moist.

                     CHUCK
          Bad body chemistry.  Made me a little
          morbid.  But I'm all over that now.

And he seems really to believe it.

                     STAN
          I'll be at the car.
               (to Kelly)
          Take you to the airport.

And he leaves.

                     KELLY
          I buried you, Chuck.  They had to pry my
          fingers off your coffin.

This interests Chuck to no end.

                     CHUCK
          There was a coffin?

                     KELLY
          Yeah, coffin, headstone, the whole thing.

                     CHUCK
          What was inside?

                     KELLY
          Your calendar, your cell phone, your whoo
          pig sooey hat, some pictures of that
          ketch you wanted.

                     CHUCK
          That about sums it up.

                     KELLY
          Maybe now's when you tell me about it.

                     CHUCK
          The plane went down.  My friends died.  I
          washed up on an island.  Then I found
          these barrels, built the raft, and here I
          am.

                     KELLY
          Yeah?

                     CHUCK
          The tide came in, the tide went out.  I
          survived.  That's the headline.  I
          survived.

                     KELLY
          Don't overwhelm me with the details.
               (she smiles remembering)
          You know how I hate that.

He tries to put it into words, isn't quite sure how.

                     KELLY
               (gently)
          Come on.  Try.

                     CHUCK
          Cliches, mainly.  Don't take anyone for
          granted.  Don't sweat the small stuff.
          Live each day like it's your last.

                     KELLY
          So simple to say, so hard to do.

                     CHUCK
          Not when you have no choice.

Kelly looks down at the raft.  It's so small.

                     KELLY
          You hated being alone.  Couldn't stand
          it.  Busy every minute.  Always plugged
          into something.

                     CHUCK
          I didn't know what really being alone
          was.  No one back here does.

He has something more to say.  She waits.

                     CHUCK
          We're not meant to be alone.  Not like
          that.  Share life, that's what came to me
          out there.  Be with someone.

And that's the point, isn't it?  We are social animals.  No
man is an island.

                     KELLY
          This is so unfair.

                     CHUCK
          That's what I told the fish I caught.
          But I ate them anyway.

And the laughter comes again.  Kelly grins, embarrassed, a
little worried.

                     KELLY
          You okay?

                     CHUCK
          Great.  Really.

She stares at his face, reaches out, touches it again, this
time with great tenderness.

He nods, her touch feels so good.

A wave of emotion comes over her:  pity?  love?

                     KELLY
          What will you do?

                     CHUCK
          I don't know.  I really don't know.

We hear a distant beep-beep, discrete as a car horn can be.

                     KELLY
          I've got to get back to Memphis.
          Hannah's babysitter has finals.

                     CHUCK
          It means a lot...that you came.

                     KELLY
          I had to come.  To be sure you were okay.

They hold each other.  For a long time.

                     KELLY
          I love you, Chuck.

                     CHUCK
          You too.

                     KELLY
          I'm so glad you're alive.

Chuck grins.

                     CHUCK
          You too.

Then she heads for the waiting car.  Chuck stands by his
raft, watching her go.

INT.  FEDEX PLANE - NIGHT

Chuck and Stan ride on the plane.  Chuck is coming down off
his survival high.  He has the Angel Wing FedEx package with
him.

                     STAN
          When I first showed up, I thought you'd
          lost your fucking marbles.

                     CHUCK
          I never thought it would end.  Then it
          did.  It was so great to be saved, I
          couldn't stop laughing.

Stan pulls a flask out of his bag.

                     STAN
          You need a drink.

Stan takes two glasses from his bag, rests them on a FedEx
container, and pours the whiskey.

                     CHUCK
          For years my only drinking buddy was a
          soccer ball.  Wilson.

Stan hoists his glass.

                     STAN
          To Wilson.

                     CHUCK
          To Wilson.

Now's when Stan gets to the question he's been wanting to
ask, that Kelly wanted to know, that we all want to know.

                     STAN
          So, what's it all about?

Chuck stares at him.

                     STAN
          You've been over the line and you came
          back.  You've been saved, hallelujah!

                     CHUCK
          Hallelujah.

Stan looks over at him.

                     STAN
          I'm serious.  The burning bush, the big
          picture, the words in neon...

                     CHUCK
          What's it all about?  It's about being so
          thirsty you'd crush a fish's backbone to
          suck out the spinal fluid -- that's what
          it's about.

Stan sits back, repulsed but relieved.

                     STAN
          Do what it takes.  That's what I always
          told you.

He pours another drink.

                     STAN
          To life.  Fuck 'em if they can't take a
          joke.

                     CHUCK
          To life.

                     STAN
          That's all there is.

                     CHUCK
          Believe me I know.

He takes a sip of his drink, just savoring it, thinking.

                     CHUCK
          But it's not being bold or being in the
          game or rolling the dice.

All those things Stan used to tell him.

                     CHUCK
          When I was going crazy, on the raft, I'd
          argue with myself about everything.
          Because everything had a price.  To get
          anything -- a sip of water, a little
          corner of shade, an hour's sleep -- I had
          to let go of something else.  And then I
          could never get it back.

He thinks some more.

                     CHUCK
          You don't win or lose.  You win and lose.

He looks out the window.

                     CHUCK
          You win and lose.

And Chuck has.  Big time.

EXT.  MEMPHIS AIRPORT - NIGHT

A FedEx MD-11 lands.

EXT.  MEMPHIS SUPERHUB - MOMENTS LATER

The MD-11 taxis up.  As usual, the SuperHub is a frenzy of
activity.  A loading crew stands ready, forklifts poised.
Even this plane carries packages.

PHIL STEELE, the chairman of FedEx, Leslie, Becca, Dick, and
other executives wait on a special podium near the gangway.
Everyone looks different -- older, a mustache here, a
thickening around the belly there.

Behind a barrier a cluster of cameras film the scene.

The plane cuts its engine.  The stairs are rolled out.
Forklifts and gangways move forward.  Cargo doors open.
Chuck appears in the door.  He holds the FedEx Package and a
small travel bag.

Chuck blinks against the lights and the glare.  Stan is right
by him.  Everyone bursts into APPLAUSE AND CHEERING.

After four years of total solitude this is completely
overwhelming.

                     STAN
          Smile.

Chuck smiles.

                     STAN
          Wave.

And Chuck waves.  He's overwhelmed by all the input.  Stan
steers Chuck down the steps as the cheers continue.

At the bottom of the steps Roger steps forward.  The two
brothers embrace each other.  After a moment Roger
disengages.  Mary gives Chuck a hug.

                     MARY
          Oh Chuck --

                     CHUCK
          Where's Mom?

                     ROGER
          Waiting for you.  At the farm.  This was
          too much --

He looks around at the crowds.

                     CHUCK
          Tell me about it.

Stan nudges Chuck.  Time to go to the podium.

                     ROGER
          Glad you made it, big brother.

Stan and Chuck head for the podium.  All the loaders and
operators and package scanners begin to applaud.  Chuck
smiles, then laughs, getting into the emotion.  He keeps up
an almost indecipherable babble underneath the cheering.
Occasionally he sees someone he knows.

                     CHUCK
          Wow.  Thank you.  Great.  Thank you.
          Hey, Rasheed, how you doing?  Thank you
          all.

EXT.  SUPERHUB - WIDE

Chuck makes his triumphant way through this amazing
collection of cheering people like Moses parting the Red Sea.

EXT.  SUPERHUB - PLATFORM

With a big smile Phil Steele holds out his hand to Chuck.

                     STEELE
          Welcome home.

He steps to the microphone and addresses the SuperHub.

                     STEELE
          This is an extraordinary moment.  And it
          should be marked in an extraordinary way.
          With something we have never done since
          this company was founded.
               (pause)
          Stop the line!

EXT.  SUPERHUB - SERIES OF SHOTS

All over the SuperHub, belts come to a halt.  Forklifts stop.
Tracking stations shut down.  The vast flow of packages is
suddenly still.  The incredible din of activity is suddenly
quiet.  The stillness and the silence are unexpected and
palpable.  Thousands of workers stop as well, staring either
up at Chuck directly or at his image on video screens.  We
hear Phil's voice piped in.

EXT.  SUPERHUB - PLATFORM

Phil holds a plaque.

                     STEELE
          Four years ago we placed this plaque in
          honor of Charles Noland, and two just
          like it in honor of Al Morris and John
          Durham, the two brave pilots who went
          down with him.

As he talks, we stay on Chuck, who is taking in this amazing
scene, not really listening.

                     STEELE
          Chuck endured years of hardship and
          loneliness.  Like Lazarus, Chuck has come
          back from the dead.  Chuck, this is your
          family, all of us.  So it gives me great
          pleasure...to take this plaque...and to
          present it to our long lost son.  Welcome
          home.

He hands the plaque to Chuck.  Chuck acknowledges the cheers
of the crowd.

                     CHUCK
          Thank you.  Thank you very much...

Everyone applauds.

                     CHUCK
          Give me a minute.  I've spent four years
          looking out at an empty ocean.

He laughs, a short brittle laugh, composes himself.

                     CHUCK
          It's all so -- big.  You never think
          you'll miss -- all this.  But I did.  I
          really, really did.  And I missed all of
          you.

He looks over at the hub.

                     CHUCK
          You've added some new belts, and what's
          that?

He points at some high tech equipment on the edge of the
shed.

                     STAN
          Digital laser readers.

                     CHUCK
          Digital laser readers.  Wow.  Terrific.

He looks around at everyone, doesn't know what else to say.

                     CHUCK
          I've never heard it this quiet.
          Shouldn't you all be getting back to
          work?

The tension is broken.  Everyone laughs.  Phil Steele motions
with his hand.  Let it be done.

ANOTHER ANGLE - WIDE

The vast, incredible machinery creaks to a start.  Everyone
shakes Chuck's hand as he leaves the podium.

As he heads for the car, REPORTERS shout questions.

INT.  CAR - MEMPHIS FREEWAY

We are assaulted by a surge of light, motion, activity.
Snaking lines of traffic in both directions, big overpasses,
the city rising beyond.

Stan drives with a certain aggressiveness.  Chuck looks out
at the traffic, at all the activity, at the vast intricate
anthill of humanity going everywhere and nowhere.

                     CHUCK
          Take your time.

                     STAN
          What?

                     CHUCK
          That's what it's about.

                     STAN
          Being patient.  Don't rush things.  I get
          it.

He swerves into another lane.

                     CHUCK
          Not just that.  Take your time.  Use it.
          Live it.

                     STAN
          Deep, real deep.

He grins, cuts across to the exit.

                     STAN
          So where to?  The office?  The hotel?
          The beach?

Chuck stares at him.  Are you kidding?

                     STAN
          What, then?

                     CHUCK
          Deliver this package.  Then, I dunno.

                     STAN
               (re: the package)
          You want that delivered, we'll deliver
          it.  That's what we do.

                     CHUCK
          I need to do it.

                     STAN
          Finish what you started.  You haven't
          changed, Chuck.  It's still you.

Right.

                     CHUCK
          You want to help, help me find the woman
          who sent this.

INT.  OPERATIONS CENTER - DAY

Stan and Chuck are in the office of a TECHNICIAN who is
working away at his computer.  The Technician pulls the bar
code from the Angel Wing FedEx box up on his computer screen.

                     TECHNICIAN
          Okay.  After three years the PTR reverts
          to tape storage, which is okay because we
          access it through the CPC.  Here it is.
               (gestures at computer map)
          Ten packages from the same sender.  Baku.
          Delhi.  St. Petersburg.  The guy was a
          real road warrior.  This package was
          Kuala Lampur.  No activity in his account
          after this package.  No forwarding
          addresses after K.L.

                     CHUCK
          What about the sender?

                     TECHNICIAN
          Sure.  Bettina Peterson.  Marfa, Texas.
          Let's run a current check.

He works some keys, waits.

                     TECHNICIAN
          Hmmm.  Durango, Colorado; Asheville,
          North Carolina, then...canceled her
          account.

                     CHUCK
          Can you find her?

                     TECHNICIAN
          You're looking at a Level III search.
          For your Level III, you gotta have E-4
          authorization.  I don't have it.

                     STAN
          I do.

He holds out a badge.

                     TECHNICIAN
          Okay, let's let it rip.

He starts to pull up the data.

                     CHUCK
          Thanks.  For everything.

                     STAN
          No sweat.

EXT.  CHUCK'S MOTEL - THAT NIGHT

Chuck leaves the motel, the Angel Box under his arm.  He ties
it into a pannier on the side of a bicycle.

EXT.  MEMPHIS - CHICKASAW GARDENS - NIGHT

Chuck sneaks up to a craftsman cottage and stands by a tree
with a swing on it.  Inside we see Kelly making dinner for
her husband, who plays with their daughter.  For a moment
Chuck watches through the window, and we watch with him.
Then the dog begins to bark.

EXT.  CEMETERY - NIGHT

Chuck walks through the cemetery late at night.  He comes to
his gravestone, stares for a long moment at the inscription,
then takes out a spray can of paint and puts a HANDPRINT on
it.

He gets back on his bicycle and rides away.

EXT.  HIGHWAY - DAY

Chuck rides his bicycle down a road leading into the South.

EXT.  FREEWAY - DAY

Chuck negotiates an overpass crossing an Interstate Highway.
Headed in both directions, cars whoosh by beneath him.

EXT.  HIGHWAY - DUSK - LATER

Chuck rides down a narrow road, shrouded in mist.  Moss drips
from the trees reaching over the road.  A car goes by.  Then
another, their lights like halos in the fog.  It's a mystical
scene, a passage.

EXT.  ARKANSAS - NIGHT

Chuck gets off his bicycle in the rain and walks toward a
roadside cafe.

INT.  CAFE - NIGHT

Chuck draws on a paper place mat as he waits for his meal at
a counter.  Above the counter the television plays.

                     ANNOUNCER
          And here's more from Dingo Dodd, our
          Australian correspondent, on the
          extraordinary story of Chuck Noland, the
          modern Robinson Crusoe.

The waitress sets a plate down in front of Chuck, turns to
watch.

On the TV we see an Australian correspondent standing on
Chuck's beach.

                     DINGO DODD
          Shark infested waters!  A deserted
          island!  Surrounded by reefs!  Accessible
          only by helicopter!  For four years Chuck
          Noland survived here alone, eating fish,
          coconuts and clams, his only companion a
          soccer ball.

Chuck is staring at the screen, seeing his cave, seeing all
those years.

                     DINGO DODD
          I'm now in Chuck's cave where he passed
          the lonely nights, painting on the walls
          like some prehistoric caveman.  What did
          Chuck feel?  These paintings tell the
          story, but only Chuck knows what they
          mean.  And he's not talking.

On the screen we see a photograph of Chuck.

The waitress looks over at Chuck.  The other clients look at
him too.

                     CHUCK
          Check, please.

The waitress comes over.

                     WAITRESS
          No charge, honey.  But could you just
          sign that place mat for me?

Chuck looks down at his doodling.  Hesitates.  Then signs his
name.

INT.  TYSON'S CHICKEN - ARKANSAS - DAY

Thousands of chicken carcasses hanging on hooks circle
through the huge processing plant, a vast structure on the
scale of the SuperHub or the Hospital.

Chuck's Mom, dressed in white with a hairnet, enters a
windowed office in the b.g.  Through the window we see her
hug Chuck.

INT.  TYSON'S CHICKEN - OFFICE - ARKANSAS - DAY

We are in the office now.  Chuck's Mom's eyes are moist.

                     CHUCK
          When'd you start working here?

                     MOM
          Roger got me on.  I wasn't doing
          anything, and -- but you're back, you're
          really back.  I would have come to
          Memphis, but --

                     CHUCK
          I wanted to come here.

INT.  FRAME HOUSE - ARKANSAS - DAY

Chuck eats a Southern fried drumstick.  The table is full of
home-cooked food.

                     MOM
          Have some more potato salad.

Chuck gestures, no, I'm full.  She puts down the spoon.

                     CHUCK
          That was great, Mom, just great.

He looks around the house, everything in its place.  His
mother has been here for forty years.  There's a big crack
running down from the ceiling.

                     CHUCK
          I've got all this back pay coming.  Why
          don't you let me get you a place in town?

                     MOM
          This is my home.  I'm part of the
          wallpaper.

She studies him for a moment.

                     MOM
          You miss it, don't you?  You miss that
          island.

He does, but that's not it entirely.

                     CHUCK
          Miss that island?  Mom, come on.

She looks at him.  She knows her boy.

                     MOM
          What a journey you've had.  It seems more
          than a person should have to bear.

                     CHUCK
          The tide saved me, Mom.  I lived by it.
          I'm just wondering where it will take me
          next.

She looks at him, thinks about this.

                     MOM
          Remember the family motto.  In time.  It
          will come to you, in time.

EXT.  ARKANSAS - DAY

Chuck rides away from the small neat frame house, down a
country lane with trailers up on blocks.

EXT.  GULF COAST - DAY

Chuck leaves a cheap motel as the sun comes up.

EXT.  MISSISSIPPI GULF COAST - DAY - LATER

Chuck rides on a ferry, the wind blowing his face.  The sky
is gray and drizzly.  He smells the salt water.  Watches the
waves.

EXT.  GAS STATION - DAY

Chuck asks for directions.  A kid in baggy pants and no shirt
points him down the road.

EXT.  GAS STATION - MOMENTS LATER

Chuck pulls some clothes out of his saddle bags.

EXT.  GAS STATION - MOMENTS LATER

Chuck emerges from the restroom wearing a FedEx shirt and
shorts.

EXT.  BEACH HOUSE - HOUR LATER

A classic beach house.  Sand dunes, stilts.  Carrying the
Angel Wing Box under his arm, Chuck checks the address in his
hand.  Mounts the steps.  A light mist falls.  You can see
the Gulf behind the house, gray and moody.

A WOMAN, BETTINA, answers the door -- THE woman from the
beginning.  She wears cut-off jeans and a blue work shirt
covered with paint.  There's a tattoo on her ankle.

                     CHUCK
          FedEx for Bettina Peterson.

The woman stares in disbelief at the package she hasn't seen
in years and never expected to see again.

                     BETTINA
          Where did you get that?

Chuck displays a FedEx badge.

                     CHUCK
          Charles Noland.  FedEx Special Projects.

Bettina notices Chuck's bicycle.

                     BETTINA
          You came on a bicycle?  No wonder it's so
          late.

                     CHUCK
          There was an unavoidable delay.

Bettina stares at the package, her own memories coming back.

                     BETTINA
          Well, I have to say, I'm impressed.  You
          never gave up.

                     CHUCK
          No.

She holds the box and studies him for a long moment.
Something -- the look on his face, the extraordinary
reappearance of this long-lost package -- makes her curious.

                     BETTINA
          You know what happened to this?

                     CHUCK
          As much as anybody.

                     BETTINA
          Want to come in?  Get dry for a minute.

                     CHUCK
          Okay.  Sure.

She lets Chuck in the door.

INT.  HOUSE - DAY

Ladders.  Scaffolds.  Huge paintings are everywhere.
Paintings of wings and angels -- like the package.  Chuck
stares at them.  Bettina watches Chuck stare.

                     BETTINA
          I've got some coffee on.  Would you like
          some?

INT.  KITCHEN - LATER

Bettina pours some coffee.  The package sits in the counter.
Some magazines are spread around, including a People Magazine
with Chuck's photograph on the cover.

                     CHUCK
               (takes a sip)
          It's good.

They smile awkwardly at each other.  She starts to open it.

                     BETTINA
          Hmmm.  Feels like it might have gotten
          wet.

                     CHUCK
          Possible.  So you did those wings?

                     BETTINA
          Yeah.  A long time ago.

                     CHUCK
          They're harder to do than they look.

                     BETTINA
          Oh?  You've tried?

                     CHUCK
          Well, I do a little drawing --

She's opened the package.  She pulls out the bottles of salsa
and the letter.

                     CHUCK
          Our apologies that it never made it to
          the recipient.

                     BETTINA
          He was a sorry sonofabitch, and I'm sorry
          I ever married him.

There is a moment where neither knows what to say.

                     BETTINA
          You look familiar.

Her eyes start to register recognition.  She glances at the
magazine with Chuck's picture on it.  She picks it up.

                     BETTINA
          I can't believe this.  I -- I -- They
          are... You're a gifted artist.  You're
          into something very powerful.  Primal.
          Truly.

                     CHUCK
          Well, not really, I --

                     BETTINA
          You are.  Yes you are.
               (so many things she wants to
                say)
          What gave you the idea to paint on that
          cave?

Chuck thinks about that.  After a moment, he grins.

                     CHUCK
          To tell you the truth -- you did.

                     BETTINA
          Do you...have any more packages to
          deliver?

                     CHUCK
          No.  that was the last one.

                     BETTINA
          Just sit here, I'll get us some lunch.

Chuck sits back on the couch, taking in the sight of the
ocean in the light rain.  He looks over at all the canvases,
the easel, the palettes.  The wind rustles the palm trees
around the house.  The surf crashes and rustles.  Familiar
sounds.  Island sounds.

He relaxes a little.  Maybe the package with the wings was a
sign, he kept it all these years precisely for this.  Then
there's a sound of a truck in the driveway.

The engine cuts off.  There are steps on the porch.  The door
opens.  A tanned muscular MAN in neatly kept work clothes
comes in, hangs a tool belt on a hook by the door.

He looks at Chuck with a relaxed, even stare, as if seeing a
man in a FedEx uniform sitting on his couch is not an unusual
occurrence.

                     MAN
          Hey.

                     CHUCK
          Hey.

                     BETTINA (O.S.)
          In here!

The Man nods at Chuck, goes into the kitchen.  We are on
Chuck's face.  Who's this?  We hear muffled laughter from
inside.

EXT.  BEACH HOUSE - HOUR LATER

Arms around each other, the Man and the Woman say goodbye to
Chuck.  In the front yard is a panel truck painted with two
angel wings.  The Man grins at Chuck, an easy, friendly grin.

                     MAN
          Come back anytime.  Coffee's always on.
          Don't even have to bring us a package.

                     CHUCK
          That was my last one.

Bettina hands Chuck a sheet of paper.

                     BETTINA
          The list of paints and brushes I did for
          you.

He takes it, not exactly sure he wants it.

                     BETTINA
          Keep painting.  Promise me.

                     CHUCK
          Sure.

EXT.  BEACH HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

Chuck rides his bicycle away, along the shore.

EXT.  BEACH - MINUTES LATER

Chuck rides along the beach.  Up ahead we see a FedEx truck.

EXT.  BEACH - MOMENTS LATER

Chuck gets off his bike as a female FEDEX DRIVER puts chocks
under the wheels, which have stuck in the sand.

                     CHUCK
          Need some help?

                     DRIVER
          You bet I do.  High tide comes right up
          to this road.

EXT.  BEACH - MOMENTS LATER

Chuck pushes on the truck as the driver gives it gas.  The
truck slowly pulls back onto the pavement.

EXT.  BEACH - MOMENTS LATER

The Driver gets out of the truck with a grin.  She has an
open, friendly face.  There's an instant connection between
them.

                     DRIVER
          Hey, thanks.  I'd never have got that out
          by myself.

Looks at his uniform.  At the bike.

                     DRIVER
          You're not out of Pascagoula, are you?

                     CHUCK
          No.

Where is he from, anyway?

                     CHUCK
          I used to drive one of those.  A long
          time ago.

                     DRIVER
          Hey, once a driver, always a driver.  You
          want a lift?  I've just got one more
          pickup.

                     CHUCK
          Sure.

He picks up his bike.

INT.  FEDEX TRUCK - MOMENTS LATER

The FedEx truck makes its way down the beach, Chuck in his
uniform, the Driver in hers.  Two FedEx people in a truck.
The Driver looks over at Chuck.

                     DRIVER
          You're Chuck Noland.

                     CHUCK
          Yeah.

                     DRIVER/ERICA
          I knew it!  You're a legend!  Mr.
          Robinson Crusoe.

                     CHUCK
          Well --

                     ERICA
          I knew I recognized you.  My name's
          Erica.

They smile at each other.  Then she smiles a little more.

                     ERICA
          Did you really steal a crippled kid's
          bicycle to make your deliveries, or is
          that just some bullshit story?

                     CHUCK
          I didn't steal it, and he wasn't
          crippled.

Erica laughs.

                     ERICA
          Otherwise it's completely true.

And that makes Chuck laugh, really laugh, for the first time.

                     CHUCK
          Yeah, completely.

She looks over at him with a grin.

                     ERICA
          What brings you out to the sticks?

                     CHUCK
          Had a package to deliver.

                     ERICA
          You?  Personally?

                     CHUCK
          I had it on the island with me.

                     ERICA
          Must be a story there.

There's a connection building here, effortlessly.

EXT.  BEACH - MOMENTS LATER

We are wide on the beach, watching the truck move along the
water, kicking up wisps of sand.

                     CHUCK (V.O.)
          Yeah, a long one.

                     ERICA (V.O.)
          I've got lots of time.

                     CHUCK (V.O.)
          So do I.

The truck goes down the beach and then turns inland, away
from the ocean.  Away from all that.

                     CHUCK (V.O.)
          So do I.

And we pull back, taking in the sweep of the beach, the
estuaries, and the green forest stretching back into America.

The end is the beginning.

FADE OUT.

                         There now... off you go.

                         Come on, we've got to stay together 
                         now. Everything's going to be okay

                         I know how to get on a train

                                     PETER
                         Bye Mom, we'll miss you

                                     MRS. PEVENSIE

                         The Professor knew we were coming?
 
                         
                                     EDMUND
                         Perhaps we've been incorrectly labeled?
 
                         
                                     PETER
                         Mrs. Macready?

                                     MRS. MACREADY
                         I'm afraid so. Is that it then? Haven't 
                         you brought anything else?
 
                                     PETER
                         No, ma'am. It's just us.

                                     MRS. MACREADY
                         Small favours.


               IN THE HOUSE

               While driving the horse over the lawn, some comments like giddy 
               up, good girl
 
                                     MRS. MACREADY
                         The professor is unaccustomed to having 
                         children in his house, and as such, 
                         there are a few rules we need to follow. 
                         There will be no shouting' or running', 
                         no improper use of the dumbwaiter, NO 
                         touching of the historical artifacts 
                         and above all, there shall be no disturbing' 
                         of the Professor.

                         Wars don't last forever, Lucy. We'll 
                         be home soon.
 
                                     EDMUND
                         If home's still there.

                         Isn't time you were in bed?

                                     EDMUND
                         YES, Mom!

               To Lucy You saw the outside. This place is huge. We'll be able 
               to do whatever we want.  Tomorrow's going to be great. Really.

                                     PETER
                         Is it Latin?

                                     SUSAN
                         Yes...

                                     EDMUND
                         Is it Latin for worst game ever invented?
 
                         
                                     LUCY
                         We could play hide-and-seek

                                     PETER
                         but we're already having so much fun!

                         (pushes Lucy) Get out! I was here first!
 
                         
               Lucy finds wardrobe with Peter counting in the background.

               LUCY IN WARDROBE/NARNIA



                                     LUCY
                         (Gasp)

               Looks behind and finds Narnia. Tumnus shows up

                                     LUCY AND TUMNUS
                         AAAUUUGGGGHHHHH!!!

                                     TUMNUS
                         (slowly walking out as Lucy picks up 
                         packages) Uh, CH... gk, ch (random noises)
 
                         
                                     LUCY
                         Were you hiding from me?

                                     TUMNUS
                         Huh, um, n..n.. no, I..I... I didn't 
                         want to scare you,
 
                                     LUCY
                         if you don't mind my asking...what are 
                         you?
 
                                     TUMNUS
                         Why, I'm a faun! And you must be some 
                         beardless dwarf?
 
                                     LUCY
                         I'm not a dwarf, I'm a girl! And actually 
                         I'm tallest in my class.
 
                                     TUMNUS
                         But you're saying, you're a daughter 
                         of Eve?
 
                                     LUCY
                         Well, my mum's name is Helen...

                                     TUMNUS
                         Yes, but you are, in fact, human.

                                     LUCY
                         Of course.

                                     TUMNUS
                         What are you doing here?

                                     LUCY
                         Well, I came in through the wardrobe 
                         in the spare room, and-
 
                                     TUMNUS
                         Spare Oom, is that in Narnia?

                                     LUCY
                         Narnia? What's that?

                                     TUMNUS
                         My dear girl, you're in it!  Everything 
                         from the lamp post, all the way to castle 
                         Cair Paravel on the Eastern Sea, every 
                         stick and stone, every icicle, is Narnia,
 
                         
                                     LUCY
                         This is an awfully big wardrobe

                                     TUMNUS
                         I'm sorry, please allow me to introduce 
                         myself, my name is Tumnus
 
                                     LUCY
                         Glad to meet you, Mr. Tumnus! *extends 
                         hand* I'm Lucy Pevensie. Oh, you shake 
                         it!
 
                                     TUMNUS
                         Why?

                                     LUCY
                         I-I don't know! People do it when they 
                         meet each other.
 
                                     TUMNUS
                         Lucy Pevensie, from the shining city 
                         of War Drobe in the far land of Spare 
                         Oom, how would it be if you came and 
                         had tea with me?
 
                                     LUCY
                         Oh! Well, thank you very much! But I 
                         probably should be getting back...
 
                         
                                     TUMNUS
                         Oh, come on! It's not every day I get 
                         to make a new friend! And there's a... 
                         roaring fire! And toast and cakes! And 
                         maybe... we'll even break into the sardines.
 
                         
                                     LUCY
                         Well, maybe for just a little while... 
                         if you have... sardines.
 
                                     TUMNUS
                         By the bucket load,

                                     TUMNUS
                         Come Along.

                                     IN TUMNUS' HOUSE
                         
                                     LUCY
                         Can I help you with that?

                                     TUMNUS
                         Why thank you!

               Lucy looks at the picture.

                                     TUMNUS
                         Oh... That is my father.

                                     LUCY
                         He had a nice face. You look just like 
                         him.
 
                                     TUMNUS
                         No, were not alike at all really.

                                     LUCY
                         My father is fighting in the war.

                                     TUMNUS
                         My father went away to war too... but 
                         that was a very long time ago... before 
                         this dreadful winter.
 
                                     LUCY
                         Winter isn't all bad. There's ice skating 
                         and snow ball fights. Oh! And Christmas!
 
                         
                                     TUMNUS
                         We haven't had Christmas in a hundred 
                         years here.
 
                                     LUCY
                         (shocked) No presents for a hundred 
                         years?
 
                                     TUMNUS
                         But, oh, you would have loved Narnia 
                         in spring! The Dryads and the Fauns 
                         would dance all night... but we never 
                         got tired. And oh, the music! Such music. 
                         Would you... like to hear some now?
 
                         
                                     LUCY
                         yes please

                                     TUMNUS
                         (gets flute out) Now, are you familiar 
                         with the Narnia lullabies?
 
                                     LUCY
                         (shakes her head): No, I'm afraid I'm 
                         not
 
                                     TUMNUS
                         Good, because this probably won't sound 
                         anything like one.
 
                                     LUCY
                         Oh I must go

                                     TUMNUS
                         It's too late for that now I'm such 
                         a bad faun
 
                                     LUCY
                         No. You're the nicest faun I've ever 
                         met.
 
                                     TUMNUS
                         Then I'm afraid you've had a very poor 
                         sampling.
 
                                     LUCY
                         I'm sure you're very sorry, and you'll 
                         never do it again.
 
                                     TUMNUS
                         It's not something I have done, Lucy 
                         Pevensie. It's something I'm doing.
 
                         
                                     LUCY
                         What are you doing?

                                     TUMNUS
                         I'm kidnapping you. It's the White Witch, 
                         the one that makes it always winter, 
                         and never Christmas. She told me that 
                         I If I ever was to come across a son 
                         of Adam or a daughter of Eve, I am supposed 
                         to turn it over to her!
 
                                     LUCY
                         But I thought you were my friend



               TUMNUS AND LUCY OUTSIDE/RETURN TO ENGLAND



                                     TUMNUS
                         We must move quietly the woods are full 
                         of her spies, even some of the trees 
                         are on her side
 
                                     LUCY
                         I think so. (Tumnus starts to return 
                         her handkerchief, but she gives it back) 
                         Keep it, you need it more than I do.
 
                         
               Tumnus laughs, and touches Lucy's nose...

                                     MR. TUMNUS
                         Go...   Come on, go!

               Lucy runs off, and Mr. Tumnus returns to his home

               Lucy heads for the wardrobe



               BACK IN ENGLAND



                                     PETER
                         98, 99, 100... Ready or not here I come.
 
                         
                                     LUCY
                         I'm back, I'm back, it's alright,

                                     EDMUND
                         Shhh, he's coming.

                                     PETER
                         You know, I'm not sure if you two have 
                         quite gotten the idea of this game!
 
                         
                                     LUCY
                         but weren't you wondering where I was?
 
                         
                                     EDMUND
                         That's the point! That's why he was 
                         seeking you!
 
                                     SUSAN
                         Does this mean I win?

                                     PETER
                         I don't think Lucy wants to play anymore.
 
                         
               Susan looks in the wardrobe..

                                     SUSAN
                         The only wood in here is the back of 
                         the wardrobe.
 
                                     PETER
                         One game at a time Lu, we don't all 
                         have your imagination.
 
                                     LUCY
                         But I wasn't imagining!

                                     SUSAN
                         that's enough

                                     EDMUND
                         Well I believe you.

                                     LUCY
                         You do?

                                     EDMUND
                         Yah, didn't I tell you about the football 
                         field I found in the bathroom closet?
 
                         
                                     PETER
                         Why don't you just stop it, you always 
                         have to make everything worse. Grow 
                         up!
 
                                     EDMUND
                         Shut up! You think you're dad, but you're 
                         not! (storms out)
 
                                     SUSAN
                         well, that was nicely handled! (walks 
                         away too..)
 
                                     LUCY
                         It was really there... 

                                     PETER
                         Susan's right. That's enough..



               THAT EVENING... EDMUND ENTERS NARNIA AND MEETS THE WHITE WITCH



               Lucy closes the wardrobe and she dissolves to night

               Pan down on candle burning out, Lucy gets out boots and not slippers 
               and takes candle.
 
               Flushing toilet as Edmund comes out and sees Lucy

               Follows her to wardrobe Candle blows out when she opens it and 
               walks in as Edmund does
 
                                     EDMUND
                         Lucy, Lucy. I hope you're not afraid 
                         of the dark (shuts door)
 
               Lucy, Lucy?

               Edmund is soon in Narnia, he walks around... and is amazed by 
               it all
 
                                     EDMUND
                         Lucy? Lucy! I think I believe you now!
 
                         
               Hears bells.

                                     EDMUND
                         Lucy?

                                     DWARF
                         Yah! (whipping sound)

               Edmund dives out of the way into the snow and then the dwarf 
               jumps out and throws a whip around Edmunds legs
 
               Dwarf puts knife to Edmund's throat

                                     WHITE WITCH
                         What is it Ginarrbrik?

                                     EDMUND
                         He won't let go!

                                     DWARF
                         Is that how you address the Queen of 
                         Narnia?
 
                                     EDMUND
                         I didn't know?

                                     DWARF
                         Well, you shall know her better afterwards.
 
                         
                                     WHITE WITCH
                         Wait! What is your name Son-of-Adam?
 
                         
                                     EDMUND
                         Edmund, your majesty.

                                     WHITE WITCH
                         And how was it, Edmund, that you came 
                         to enter my dominion?
 
                                     EDMUND
                         I walked through a wardrobe following 
                         my sister.
 
                                     WHITE WITCH
                         Your sister? How many are you?

                                     EDMUND
                         four

                                     WHITE WITCH
                         Edmund you look so cold! Come and sit 
                         with me here on my sledge. (Edmund joins 
                         her) Now, would like something warm 
                         to drink.
 
                                     EDMUND
                         Yes...your majesty.(Take vial and drops 
                         a green drop on snow that become a hot 
                         drink that the dwarf gives Edmund) How 
                         did you do that?
 
                                     WHITE WITCH
                         I can make anything you like.

                                     EDMUND
                         Could you make me taller?

                                     WHITE WITCH
                         I can make anything you like to eat
 
                         
                                     EDMUND
                         Turkish Delight

               Drop once again comes down and makes the box of Turkish Delight 
               and the Dwarf gives it to Edmund
 
                                     WHITE WITCH
                         I'd love to see your family

                                     EDMUND
                         They're nothing special

                                     WHITE WITCH
                         I have no children of my own and you 
                         are such a good little boy (I never 
                         could hear those words right) where 
                         I could see, one day, you becoming prince 
                         of Narnia - maybe even king.
 
                                     EDMUND
                         (mouth full) Really?

                                     WHITE WITCH
                         (nods) Of course you'd have to bring 
                         your family.
 
                                     EDMUND
                         They're nothing special

                                     EDMUND
                         Oh, Peter will be king too?

                                     WHITE WITCH
                         No! But a king needs servants.

                                     EDMUND
                         I-I guess I could bring 'em.

                                     WHITE WITCH
                         Beyond these woods, do you see those 
                         two little hills? My house is right 
                         between them. You'd love it there Edmund, 
                         it has whole rooms simply stuffed with 
                         Turkish Delight!
 
                                     EDMUND
                         Couldn't I have some more now?

                                     WHITE WITCH
                         NO! (smiles) Don't want to ruin you 
                         appetite.
 
                                     WHITE WITCH
                         I'm going to miss you Edmund. But we 
                         are going to see each other soon.
 
                         
                                     EDMUND
                         I hope so.

                                     WHITE WITCH
                         Until then...dear one. (WW drives of 
                         and Ed is left alone)
 
                                     LUCY
                         Edmund? Oh Edmund!!!! (hugs her brother) 
                         I saw Mr. Tumnus again and he's fine!!! 
                         The White Witch hasn't found out about 
                         him helping me!
 
                                     EDMUND
                         The White Witch?

                                     LUCY
                         She calls herself the Queen of Narnia, 
                         but she really isn't. Edmund? Are you 
                         okay? You look awful.
 
                                     EDMUND
                         Well what do you expect! It's freezing! 
                         How do we get out of here?
 
                                     LUCY
                         Come on...this way.



               BACK IN ENGLAND

                         (turns on the light and jumps on Peter) 
                         Peter, Peter wake up! It's there, it's 
                         really there!
 
                                     PETER
                         (rolls over still half asleep) Lucy, 
                         what are talking about?
 
                                     LUCY
                         Narnia! It's all in the wardrobe, like 
                         I told you!
 
               Susan comes in.

                                     SUSAN
                         Oh Lucy, you've been dreaming.

                                     LUCY
                         No I wasn't, I saw Mr. Tumnus again! 
                         Oh, and this time - Edmund went too.
 
                         
                                     PETER
                         You saw the faun?

                                     LUCY
                         Well, he didn't actually go there with 
                         me. What were you doing Edmund?
 
                                     EDMUND
                         I-I was just playing along. You know 
                         what little children are like these 
                         days, they just don't know when to stop 
                         pretending (sits on his bed looking 
                         smugly at Lucy)
 
               Lucy starts to cry and runs out of the room. Susan runs after 
               her and so does Peter - who shoves Edmund over
 
                                     EDMUND
                         Ow!

               Lucy runs down the hall and smack into the Professor, she looks 
               up a little frightened and then starts her crying all over again, 
               hugging him
 
                                     MRS. MACREADY
                         You children are one shenanigan shy 
                         of sleeping' in the stable- oh, Professor! 
                         I told them you were not to be disturbed.
 
                         
                                     PROFESSOR
                         Oh, it's alright Mrs. Macready - I'm 
                         sure there's a logical explanation. 
                         But I think this one needs some hot 
                         chocolate.
 
                                     MRS. MACREADY
                         Yes Professor. Come on, dear.

               Mrs. Macready takes Lucy down the hall. Peter and Susan turn 
               to go
 
                                     PROFESSOR
                         *Ahem* (the two turn and follow him 
                         into his office and the Professor sits 
                         at his desk and takes some tobacco out 
                         of it's silver apple case and puts it 
                         in his pipe)
 
                                     PROFESSOR
                         You seem to have upset the internal 
                         balance of my housekeeper.
 
                                     PETER
                         We are very sorry sir, it won't happen 
                         again.
 
                                     SUSAN
                         It's our sister sir, Lucy.

                                     PROF
                         The weeping girl?

                                     SUSAN
                         Yes sir, she's upset.

                                     PROFESSOR
                         Hence the weeping

                                     PETER
                         We can handle it! (takes Susan's sleeve)
 
                         
                                     PROFESSOR
                         Oh, I can see that.

                                     SUSAN
                         She thinks she's found a magical land 
                         in the upstairs wardrobe.
 
                                     PROFESSOR
                         What did you say!?

                                     PETER
                         The wardrobe upstairs, Lucy thinks she's 
                         found a forest inside.
 
               Susan and Peter sit on a couch and the Professor sits in a chair 
               across from them
 
                                     PROFESSOR
                         What was it like?

                                     SUSAN
                         Like talking to a lunatic!

                                     PROFESSOR
                         No, not her - the forest!

                                     PETER
                         You're-you're not saying you believe 
                         her?
 
                                     PROFESSOR
                         No, not her - the forest!

                                     PETER
                         You....you actually believe her?

                                     PROFESSOR
                         Well don't you?

                                     SUSAN
                         Well, logically it couldn't possibly 
                         be there!
 
                                     PROFESSOR
                         What do they teach at these schools?
 
                         
                                     PETER
                         Edmund said they were only pretending
 
                         
                                     PROFESSOR
                         And he's the more truthful one is he?
 
                         
                                     PETER
                         No, this would be the first time.

                                     PROFESSOR
                         Well then, id your sister isn't lying 
                         and isn't mad then logically we must 
                         assume that she is telling the truth. 
                         She's your sister, isn't she? You're 
                         a family! It's high time you start acting 
                         like one!
 
               


               CRICKET



                                     PETER
                         Peter winds up, goes for the bowl!
 
                         
               Ball hits Edmund in the leg

                                     EDMUND
                         Ow!

                                     PETER
                         Whoops! Wake up, Dolly Daydream!

                                     EDMUND
                         Can't we play hide and go seek again?
 
                         
                                     PETER
                         I thought you said that it was a kid's 
                         game.
 
                                     SUSAN
                         Besides, we can all use the fresh air.
 
                         
                                     EDMUND
                         Not like there's air inside

                                     PETER
                         Are you ready then?

                                     EDMUND
                         Are you? (smacks his bat on the ground 
                         and gets ready to hit the ball)
 
               Peter pitches the ball, hard, and Edmund whacks it good and it 
               smashes through an upstairs window and crashes into a suit of 
               armor.


 
               UPSTAIRS



               The children are looking at the broken window and the suit of 
               armor on the floor
 
                                     PETER
                         Well done, Ed!

                                     EDMUND
                         You bowled it!

                                     SUSAN
                         Listen, Mrs. Macready is coming

                                     PETER
                         Run!

                                     EDMUND
                         (runs to the wardrobe and opens the 
                         door) Come on!
 
                                     SUSAN
                         You have got to be joking.

                                     PETER
                         Go!

                                     SUSAN
                         Get back!

               SOUNDS OF KIDS GRIPING

               Susan and Peter fall backwards.



               IN NARNIA



                                     SUSAN
                         Impossible!

                                     LUCY
                         Don't worry, it's probably just your 
                         imagination
 
                                     PETER
                         I don't suppose saying we're sorry would 
                         quite cover it?
 
                                     LUCY
                         No, it wouldn't. But this might!

               Lucy nails Peter in the face with a snowball, he throws one back 
               at her and a snowball fight
 
               begins. Susan hits Ed in the arm with one

                                     EDMUND
                         Ow! (rubs his arm) Stop it! (They all 
                         realize that Ed lied)
 
                                     PETER
                         You little liar!

                                     EDMUND
                         You didn't believe her either!

                                     PETER
                         Apologize to Lucy. (He just looks at 
                         her)
 
                                     PETER
                         Say you're sorry! (Peter steps up to 
                         him)
 
                                     EDMUND
                         Alright! I'm sorry.

                                     LUCY
                         That's alright, some little children 
                         just don't know when to stop pretending. 
                         (looks at him smugly)
 
                                     EDMUND
                         (mutters): Very funny.

                                     SUSAN
                         Maybe we should go back

                                     EDMUND
                         Can't we at lease take a look around?
 
                         
                                     PETER
                         I think Lucy must decide!

                                     LUCY
                         I all want you to meet Mr. Tumnus!
 
                         
                                     PETER
                         Well Mr. Tumnus it is (walks into the 
                         wardrobe again)
 
                                     SUSAN
                         We can't just walk around in these clothes!
 
                         
                                     PETER
                         (comes out) We can use these coats.
 
                         
                                     SUSAN
                         Peter, they don't belong to us.

                                     PETER
                         Well I don't think the professor will 
                         mind. And if you think about it logically 
                         we are not even taking them out of the 
                         wardrobe. (Hands coat to Edmund)
 
                                     EDMUND
                         But that's a girl's coat!

                                     PETER
                         I know.

               OUTSIDE AGAIN



               They step outside, they hear rustles from the bushes. Mr. Beaver 
               approaches
 
                                     LUCY
                         It's a beaver.

               Peter approaches the beaver, clicking his tongue

                                     PETER
                         Here, boy *clicks* come here...*clicks*
 
                         
               Peter let's out his hand, Mr. Beaver stares at it then sits upright
 
               
                                     MR.BEAVER
                         Well, I ain't gonna smell it if that's 
                         what you want!
 
                                     EDMUND
                         It's a talking beaver!

                                     MR.BEAVER
                         Lucy Pevensie?

                                     LUCY
                         Yes?

               Mr. Beaver hands her the handkerchief

                                     LUCY
                         This is the handkerchief I gave to Mr-
 
                         
                                     MR. BEAVER
                         Tumnus. He gave it to me just before 
                         they took him.
 
                                     LUCY
                         Is he alright?

                                     MR. BEAVER
                         Further in.(Mr. Beaver scurries off, 
                         Susan grabs Peter by the arm)
 
                                     SUSAN
                         Peter, we don't know what you are doing.
 
                         
                                     EDMUND
                         She's right. How do we know we can trust 
                         this beaver?
 
                                     PETER
                         He say's he knows the faun.

                                     SUSAN
                         He's a beaver...he shouldn't be saying 
                         anything!
 
                                     MR. BEAVER
                         Is everything alright?

                                     PETER
                         Yes. We were just talking

                                     MR. BEAVER
                         That's better left for safer corners.

                         He means the trees.

                                     MRS. BEAVER

                         You know that doesn't really rhyme.
 
                         
                                     MR. BEAVER
                         I know, but you're missing the point!
 
                         
                                     MRS. BEAVER
                         It's long been told that two sons of 
                         Adam and two daughters of Eve will appear 
                         to defeat the White Witch, and restore 
                         peace to Narnia.
 
                                     PETER

                         I think you've made a mistake; we're 
                         not heroes!
 
                                     SUSAN

                                     MR. BEAVER
                         You may not have to...Has Edmund been 
                         to Narnia before?
 
               Shot of Ed walking to the Witch's castle without his coat - shot 
               of the others trying to catch up to him
 
                                     PETER
                         Hurry up!

               They reach the top of the hill and see Ed going through the Witch's 
               castle gates
 
                                     LUCY
                         (shouting) Edmund!

                         Shh! They'll hear ya!

               Peter starts to run after Edmund but Mr. Beaver grabs him by 
               the sleeve of his coat
 
                                     PETER

                         We just can't let him go!

                                     BEAVER
                         Don't you get it?! He's the bait! She

                                     SUSAN
                         This is all your fault! None of this 
                         would have happened if you had just 
                         listened to me in the first place!
 
                         
                                     PETER
                         So you knew this would happen?

                                     SUSAN
                         I didn't know what would happen...
 
                         
                                     LUCY
                         Stop, this fighting isn't going to help 
                         Edmund
 
                                     BEAVER
                         She's right. Only Aslan can save him 
                         now.
 
                                     PETER
                         Then take us to him.



               EDMUND AT THE WITCH'S HOUSE



               Edmund is walking through the courtyard and see's Giant Rumblebuffin. 
               He walks further in and see's a stone lion - he draws glasses 
               and a moustache on it
 
               Edmund continues through the courtyard, he steps over what he 
               thinks is a log of some sort...only to be lurched on by Maugrim!
 
               
                                     MAUGRIM
                         Stand still stranger!

                                     EDMUND
                         I'm a Son of Adam, I met the Queen in 
                         the woods!
 
               Maugrim gets off him.

                                     MAUGRIM
                         My apologies, fortunate favourite of 
                         the queen - or perhaps not so fortunate.
 
                         
               walks into the throne-room

                                     MAUGRIM
                         Wait here (Edmund sees the glorious 
                         throne, and sits on it longingly. Then, 
                         the witch comes up behind him and says, 
                         scaring him half to death.)
 
                                     WHITE WITCH
                         You like it!

                                     EDMUND
                         (he jumps up startled) Ye... yes, your 
                         majesty!
 
                                     WHITE WITCH
                         I thought you might

                                     WHITE WITCH
                         Tell me, you sisters, are they deaf?
 
                         
                                     EDMUND
                         No

                                     WHITE WITCH
                         and your brother, unintelligent?

                                     EDMUND
                         Well I think so, but mom says...

                                     WHITE WITCH
                         Then how dare you come alone! Edmund, 
                         I ask so little of you
 
                                     EDMUND
                         They just don't listen to me!

                                     WHITE WITCH
                         Couldn't even do that!

                                     EDMUND
                         I...I did bring them half way. There 
                         at the dam at the house of the beaver's!
 
                         
                                     WHITE WITCH
                         Well...I guess your not a total lost 
                         then.
 
               Edmund approaches again.

                                     EDMUND
                         Is there any chance I may have some 
                         more Turkish delight now?
 
                                     WHITE WITCH
                         Ginnabrick, our guest is hungry

                                     GINNABRICK
                         This way...for your num nums...

                                     WHITE WITCH
                         Maugrim!!!! You know what to do....
 
                         
               Maugrim let's out a howl, Edmund realizes the horrible truth 
               as wolves surround the castle...they charge from the castle
 
               

               BACK AT THE BEAVERS HOUSE



                                     MAUGRIM

                                     SUSAN
                         What is she doing?

                                     MRS. BEAVER
                         Don't worry, you'll thank you me later. 
                         it's a long journey and a beaver gets 
                         cranky when he's hungry.
 
                                     BEAVER
                         I'M CRANKY NOW!

                                     SUSAN
                         Do you think we should bring jam?

                                     PETER
                         Only if the Witch has toast.



               GOES INSIDE THE TUNNEL



                                     MR. BEAVER
                         This should lead to Aslan's

                                     MRS. BEAVER
                         I thought it lead to your mums!

               Lucy falls howling.

                                     LUCY
                         They're in the tunnel!

               (run further, comes to dead end)

                                     MRS. BEAVER
                         You should have brought a map!

                                     BEAVER
                         There was no room next to the jam!
 
                         
               He jumps out of the hole. Everyone else follow. Once Peter gets 
               out, Lucy falls on a bunch of stone things.
 
               Lucy gets up! They all see stone animals!

                                     MR. BEAVER
                         He was my best mate! (cries)

               BACK TO THE WITCHES HOUSE.. IN THE DUNGEON



               Edmund, in chains at the witches palace. He attempts to eat the 
               food he is given, but coughs and spits it out, because of its 
               taste. He then attempts to drink a cup, which is frozen. He then 
               throws it on the tray.
 
                                     MR. TUMNUS
                         Are you gonna eat that? (from the other 
                         prison)
 
               Edmund gives him the food.

                                     EDMUND
                         Mr... Tumnus.

                         Is your sister alright? (no answer)

                         Stranger has only been in Narnia a short...(Hit 
                         in head)
 
                                     EDMUND
                         I left before I could hear anymore...I 
                         wanted to see you again.
 
                                     WHITE WITCH
                         Guard!

                                     WHITE WITCH
                         Release the Faun (Guard hit chains and 
                         Tumnus cries out in pain as they drop 
                         him by the Witch) Do you know why you 
                         are here?
 
                                     MR. TUMNUS
                         Because I believe in a free Narnia
 
                         
               Witch stares at him coldly

                                     WHITE WITCH
                         You're here because he (points at Edmund) 
                         turned you in...for sweeties. (turns 
                         to dwarf and guard) Take him (Tumnus) 
                         upstairs and ready my sleigh, Edmund 
                         misses his family.
 


               THE ROCK BRIDGE



                                     MR. BEAVER
                         Now Aslan's camp is just over there 
                         by the stone table just across the frozen 
                         river.
 
                                     SUSAN
                         River?

                                     MRS. BEAVER
                         It's been frozen for 100 years

                                     PETER
                         It seems so far

                                     MRS. BEAVER
                         It's the world dear, did you expect 
                         it to be small?
 
                                     SUSAN
                         Smaller...

               They continue their journey.



               BACK TO EDMUND



               Dwarf brings Edmund up and he sees Tumnus turned to stone

                                     WHITE WITCH
                         Whenever you are ready Son-of-Adam.
 
                         
               Sleigh goes off into forest with Edmund looking at the cold White 
               Witch

                         If he tells me to Hurry up one more 
                         time I'm going to turn him into a big 
                         fluffy hat
 
                                     MR. BEAVER

                                     MR. BEAVER

               Quick down here!



               FEW MINUTES PASSES



                                     LUCY
                         Maybe she's gone.

                                     PETER
                         I'll go and have a look

                                     MR. BEAVER
                         No, you're no good to Narnia dead.
 
                         
                                     MRS. BEAVER
                         Neither are you Beaver.

                                     MR. BEAVER
                         Thanks dear.

               Long pause and some noise then...

                                     MR. BEAVER
                         AHHH!....

                                     LUCY
                         AHHH!

                                     MR. BEAVER
                         I hope you've been good, because there 
                         is someone here to see you.
 
               Father Christmas stands there.

                                     LUCY
                         Merry Christmas, Sir!

                                     FATHER CHRISTMAS
                         It certainly is, Lucy. Thanks to you.
 
                         
                                     SUSAN
                         I thought there was no Christmas in 
                         Narnia.
 
                                     FATHER CHRISTMAS
                         It hasn't been for a hundred years. 
                         But now the Witch's power is crumbling. 
                         (he goes to his bag and throws it to 
                         the ground)
 
                                     LUCY
                         Presents!

                                     FATHER CHRISTMAS
                         Lucy, Eve's Daughter. These are for 
                         you. The juice of the fire flower. If 
                         you, or one of your friends are wounded, 
                         one drop of this cordial will restore 
                         them. And though I do not expect you 
                         to use it, this.
 
                                     LUCY
                         Well, I think I could be brave enough.
 
                         
                                     FATHER CHRISTMAS
                         I'm sure you could. But battles are 
                         ugly affairs. Eve's Daughter, Susan. 
                         Trust in this bow, for it does not easily 
                         miss.
 
                                     SUSAN
                         What happened to, 'battles are ugly 
                         affairs?'
 
                                     FATHER CHRISTMAS
                         And, though you don't seem to have trouble 
                         making yourself heard, this. When you 
                         put this horn to your lips and blow 
                         it, wherever you are, help will come.
 
                         
                                     SUSAN
                         Thanks.

                                     FATHER CHRISTMAS
                         And, Peter. These are tools, not toys. 
                         The time to use them may be soon at 
                         hand.
 
                                     FATHER CHRISTMAS

                         Long live Aslan! (he gets in his sleigh 
                         and rides off)
 
                                     THE CHILDREN
                         Bye... Merry Christmas!

                                     LUCY
                         Told you he was real!

                                     PETER

                                     SUSAN
                         Wait, maybe we should think about this.
 
                         
                                     PETER

                         I don't think you'll be needing those 
                         coats any more!
 
               Walk through and see spring coming about and flowers budding 
               as they leave there coats and head toward Aslan's Camp
 
               BACK TO THE WATERFALL, THE WITCH, EDMUND AND DWARF

                         I think I'll go check the sleigh.

                         We found the traitor (Carrying the Fox) 
                         He was gathering troops near the sharwood 
                         forest.

                         Nice of you to drop by. I understand 
                         you were so helpful to my wolves last 
                         night.
 
                                     FOX
                         Forgive me your majesty

                                     WHITE WITCH
                         Don't waste my time with flattery.

                         Not to seem rude, but I wasn't actually 
                         talking to you (Looks at Edmund)
 
                                     WHITE WITCH
                         (Looks first to Edmund and than at Fox) 
                         Where is ASLAN! Answer me! (About to 
                         hit him with wand)
 
                                     EDMUND
                         Wait! The Beavers said something about 
                         the Stone Table and an army.
 
                                     WHITE WITCH
                         Thank you Edmund. It is good for this 
                         creature to see some honesty before 
                         he dies..
 
                                     EDMUND
                         NO!(Fox to stone and White Slaps Edmund 
                         across face)
 
                                     WHITE WITCH
                         Think who's side you are on. MINE...(turns 
                         his head) Or theirs? If it is a war 
                         Aslan wants (turns butterfly to stone) 
                         It's a war he shall get.
 


               AT ASLAN'S CAMP



                                     SUSAN
                         Why are they all staring at us?

                                     LUCY
                         Maybe they think you look funny.

               Peter smiles.

                                     MR. BEAVER
                         Oh stop your fussing Mrs. Beaver. You 
                         look lovely.
 
               Peter pulls out sword.

                                     PETER
                         (To Oreius) We have come to see Aslan.
 
                         
               Tent starts to blow in breeze and everyone kneels. Aslan comes 
               from the tent and the children kneel
 
                                     ASLAN
                         Welcome Peter Adam's son, Welcome Susan 
                         and Lucy daughters-of-Eve. Welcome Beavers. 
                          You have my thanks, but where is the 
                         fourth.
 
                                     PETER
                         That's why we are here.

                                     SUSAN
                         We had a little trouble along the way.
 
                         
                                     PETER
                         He's been captured by the White Witch
 
                         
                                     CROWD
                         Captured!

                                     MR. BEAVER
                         He betrayed them your Excellence!

                                     OREIUS
                         Then he has betrayed us all

                                     ASLAN
                         Peace Oreius.

                                     PETER
                         It is my fault really. I was too hard 
                         on him.
 
                                     SUSAN
                         We all were.

                                     LUCY
                         Sir, he's our brother.

                                     ASLAN
                         I know dear and that makes the betrayal 
                         all the worse. It may be harder than 
                         you think
 


               PETER AND ASLAN ON HILL



                                     ASLAN
                         That is Cair Paravel of the four thrones 
                         one of which you must sit as High King.
 
                         
                                     PETER
                         (...)

                                     ASLAN
                         You doubt the prophecy

                                     PETER
                         No, that's just it...you're not who 
                         I think I am
 
                                     ASLAN
                         Peter Pevensie formerly of Finnchley. 
                         Beaver also said you wanted to turn 
                         him into a hat.
 
               light laughes Peter there is a Deep Magic that rules over Narnia. 
               It defines right from wrong and helps us fulfill destinies, both 
               yours and mine.
 
                                     PETER
                         I don't think I will be able.

                                     ASLAN
                         You were able to get your family here.
 
                         
                                     PETER
                         Not all of them.

                                     ASLAN
                         I will do what I can for Edmund. I too 
                         want my family safe.
 


               SUSAN AND LUCY ARE GOING DOWN TO THE RIVER



                                     SUSAN
                         Mother hasn't had a dress like this 
                         since before the war
 
                                     LUCY
                         Maybe we had bring back a whole trunk 
                         load when we go home.
 
                                     SUSAN
                         If we go home...Sorry I guess I am like 
                         that. Remember when we use to have fun?
 
                         
                                     LUCY
                         Yes, before you go boring.

                                     SUSAN
                         Oh really (Splashes water and this continues 
                         as Susan goes to get towel and...)
 
                         
               WOLVES

                                     WOLF
                         Now, We're very tired. We'd prefer to 
                         kill you quickly.
 
               (Throws towel)

                                     CUT TO
                         Peter and Aslan

               Susan's horn is blown, Peter runs to her direction, Aslan follows 
               him
 
                                     CUT TO
                         Susan and Lucy

               Susan and Lucy are in a tree and wolf trying to get them. Peter 
               come back through the river
 
               Aslan pins the second wolf to the ground and says to his group
 
               
               Stay back. This is Peter's battle.

               The wolf attacks him. And everyone thinks he is dead

                                     SUSAN AND LUCY
                         Peter... no!

               They run up to him, and see he is alive and looks disgusted by 
               killing the wolf. Aslan lets go the other wolf
 
                                     ASLAN
                         Follow him! He'll lead you to Edmund. 
                         Peter, clean your sword.
 
                                     ASLAN
                         Rise, Sir Peter Wolfsbane--Knight of 
                         Narnia.
 
               Peter looks at Aslan in awe

               All embrace him and are excited about this



               WITCHES CAMP



               Edmund is tied to tree as the Dwarf taunts him

                                     GENERAL OTMIN
                         The Minotaurs on the left, send in the 
                         dwarfs first.
 
               White Witch looks at the plans and then...

               Aslan's army comes in and there is confusion. White Witch goes 
               through camp and see Dwarf to tree, knife in hat and him tied 
               and gagged. She takes the knife and looks like she's going to 
               kill him then cuts him down
 
                                     DWARF
                         You're not going to kill him?

                                     WHITE WITCH
                         Not yet! We have work to do (turning 
                         to Otmin)
 


               MORNING ASLAN'S CAMP



               Aslan and Edmund are on the rock above camp Peter comes out and 
               see him and then the girls
 
                                     LUCY
                         EDMUND!

               Peter stops her. Aslan motions Edmund down and they go to the 
               group of his siblings
 
                                     ASLAN
                         What's done is done. There is no reason 
                         to bring up the past with your brother.
 
                         
                                     EDMUND
                         Hello...

                                     LUCY
                         Oh, Edmund (Hugs him and Susan does 
                         too)
 
                                     SUSAN
                         How are you feeling?

                                     EDMUND
                         I'm feeling kinda tired

                                     PETER
                         Get some rest...and Edmund try not to 
                         wander off again.
 
               Some time later, breakfast

                                     LUCY
                         Narnia isn't going to run out of toast 
                         Edmund
 
                                     PETER
                         then you better pack some for the journey
 
                         
                                     SUSAN
                         So were going home?

                                     PETER
                         You are, I promised I'd keep you three 
                         safe but there's no reason I can't stay 
                         and help.
 
                                     LUCY
                         but they need us...All four of us

                                     PETER
                         Lucy it's too dangerous. You almost 
                         drowned, Edmund was almost killed!
 
                         
                                     EDMUND
                         Which is why we have to stay.

               They all look at him.

                                     EDMUND
                         I've seen what the White Witch can do 
                         and I've helped her do it, and we can't 
                         leave these people behind to suffer for it.

               Lucy holds Ed's hand.

                                     SUSAN
                         Well I guess that's it then. *gets up*
 
                         
                                     PETER
                         Where are you going?

                                     SUSAN
                         (picks up bow and quiver) To get in 
                         some practice.
 
               Susan and Lucy practice shooting at the target. Then it cuts 
               to Peter and Edmund practicing sword fighting
 
                                     PETER
                         Come on Ed, sword hand up like Oreius 
                         showed us.
 
               The beavers come running up. Edmund's horse rears

                                     EDMUND
                         Whoa horsey!

                                     HORSE
                         My name is Philip.

                                     EDMUND
                         Oh, sorry

                                     MR. BEAVER
                         you better come quick the White Witch 
                         has requested a meeting with Aslan...
 

                         
               WITCH IN ASLANS CAMP



                                     DWARF
                         Jadis.. Jadis!!!

               Jadis arrives at the camp, Cyclops carry her bed-thingy...She 
               hops down, and walks towards Aslan
 
                                     JADIS
                         You have a traitor in your midst, Aslan.
 
                         
               Everyone gasps.

                                     ASLAN
                         His offence was not against you.

                                     WHITE WITCH
                         Have you forgotten the Deep Magic?
 
                         
                                     ASLAN
                         Do not cite the Deep Magic to me, Witch. 
                         I was there when it was made.
 
                                     WHITE WITCH
                         Then you will know that the boy belongs 
                         to me. (turns to crowd) That boy (points 
                         to Edmund) will die on the Stone Table.
 
                         
                                     PETER
                         Come and take it then.

                                     WHITE WITCH
                         You think that a simple threat will 
                         deny me my right, little king? Aslan 
                         knows that if I do not have blood as 
                         the law demands, all of Narnia will 
                         be overturned, and perish, in fire and 
                         water.
 
                                     ASLAN
                         Enough, I shall talk with you alone.
 
                         
               (time passes and the Witch exits tent)

                                     ASLAN
                         The Witch has denounced her claim on 
                         Edmund
 
               Narnians cheer.

                                     WHITE WITCH
                         How will I know your promise will be 
                         kept?
 
               Aslan roars. the White Witch falls into her seat and the Narnians 
               laugh. The White Witch leaves. Aslan sighs and walks into his 
               tent.
 


               THAT NIGHT...



               Lucy is quietly resting, when she see's a shadow...she wakes 
               Susan
 
                                     LUCY
                         Susan!

               Susan see's the shadow, the two leave their tent. Aslan is leaving 
               the camp...they follow him. and follow him...and follow him. 
               Until-
 
                                     ASLAN
                         Aren't you suppose to be in bed?

                                     LUCY
                         We couldn't sleep

                                     SUSAN
                         Please, Aslan. Couldn't we come with 
                         you?
 
                                     ASLAN
                         I would be glad of the company tonight.
 
                         
               (Walk further)

                                     ASLAN
                         It is time. From now on, I must go on 
                         alone. Thank you Susan. Thank you Lucy. 
                         And farewell.
 
                                     LUCY
                         (later after lots of jeers towards Aslan 
                         as he walks to the Stone Table) Why 
                         doesn't he fight back?
 
                                     WHITE WITCH
                         Bind him. Wait. First let him be shaved.
 
                         
               More jeers and catcalls...

                                     WHITE WITCH
                         Tonight, the Deep magic will be appeased, 
                         but tomorrow, we will take Narnia, Forever!
 
                         
                                     WHITE WITCH
                         You know, Aslan, I'm a little disappointed 
                         in you. Did you really think that by 
                         giving your life you would save the 
                         Human boy? Ha. You are giving up your 
                         life, and saving no one. So much for 
                         love.
 
                                     WHITE WITCH
                         In that knowledge... Despair... and 
                         DIE!!!!!!
 
               She plunges in the knife and Aslan's growls in pain and his eyes 
               slowly close
 
                                     WHITE WITCH
                         The great cat is DEAD!!

               Her army cheers loudly.

                                     WHITE WITCH
                         General, gather your army and prepare 
                         for battle. However short it may be.
 
                         
               Otmin lets out a huge roar



               AFTER THE WHITE WITCH AND CREATURES ARE GONE


               The girls come up and cry and lean on Aslan. Lucy gets an idea, 
               unscrews her potion
 
                                     SUSAN
                         It's too late. He's gone. I'm sure he 
                         knew what he was doing.
 
                                     
                         We have to go.

                                     LUCY
                         We can't just leave him here.

                                     SUSAN
                         Lucy there's not time. We have to tell 
                         the others.
 
                                     LUCY
                         The Trees

               Back at Aslan's camp in the boys' tent

                                     DRYAD
                         Fear not my princes. I come with tidings 
                         of grave news..
 
               Peter walks out of the tent.

                                     PETER
                         It is true, he's gone

                                     EDMUND
                         Then you'll have to lead us. There's 
                         a whole army out there waiting to follow 
                         you.
 
                                     PETER
                         I can't

                                     EDMUND
                         Aslan believed you could. And so do 
                         I.
 
                                     OREIUS
                         what are your orders?

               Peter looks at map... you see the battle field



               BATTLE



                                     GRYPHON
                         They come, you highness, in numbers 
                         and weapons far greater then our own.
 
                         
                                     OREIUS
                         Numbers do not win a battle

                                     PETER
                         No, but I bet they help

               Arrival of the Witch's army

                                     WHITE WITCH
                         I take no interest in prisoners. Kill 
                         them all
 
               Army charges, gryphons attack

                                     OTMAN
                         Look to the sky



               BATTLE TRULY BEGINS



                                     PETER
                         Are you with me?

                                     ORIEUS
                         To the death!

                                     PETER
                         FOR NARNIA, AND FOR ASLAN!!!!

               PETER'S CHARGE BEGINS

               Back to the girls at the Stone Table

               Lucy and Susan wake up.

                                     SUSAN
                         We should go.

                                     LUCY
                         I'm so cold.

               They start walking away...Stone Table cracks

                                     LUCY
                         Susan!

                                     SUSAN
                         What have they done?

               Aslan appears, sending shivers down EVERYONE'S spine!

                                     SUSAN AND LUCY
                         ASLAN!

               Aslan laughs.

                                     SUSAN
                         We saw the Witch, the knife.

                                     ASLAN
                         If the Witch knew the true meaning of 
                         sacrifice, she might have interpreted 
                         the Deep Magic a little differently. 
                         For she would know that if a willing 
                         victim who had committed no treachery 
                         died in a traitors stead, the Stone 
                         Table would crack and death itself would 
                         begin to unwind.
 
                                     SUSAN
                         We sent the word that you were dead. 
                         Peter and Edmund would have gone to 
                         war.
 
                                     LUCY
                         (draws knife) We have to help them.
 
                         
                                     ASLAN
                         We will, but not alone. Now, climb on 
                         my back. We have a long ways to go and 
                         little time to get there. And you might 
                         want to cover your ears. ROAR!!!!!!!!!!!!!
 
                         
               BACK TO THE BATTLE

                                     PETER
                         Fall back! Draw them to the rocks!
 
                         
                                     BEAVER
                         That's the signal! Get ready!

                                     EDMUND
                         FIRE!

               Swish! Bang! Grunt! Crash! Clash! Roar! Aaaahhh!!! Ouch!

               Peter falls off his unicorn. Oreius and the rhino charge

                                     PETER
                         Stop!

               They don't.

               Witch ducks attack, parries blades, spins her wand and turns 
               Oreius to stone
 
               Back to Aslan and the girls.. at the Witches house

               Cuts to stone centaur in the Witch's castle. Lucy and Susan are 
               looking for Mr. Tumnus. Lucy finds him and starts to cry, while 
               Susan hugs her. Aslan walks up and breathes on Mr. Tumnus, and 
               Mr. Tumnus is restored. He falls forward into Lucy and Susan's 
               arm
 
                                     LUCY
                         Susan this is...

                                     SUSAN
                         MR TUMNUS!!!!

               They hug....then they see Aslan

                                     ASLAN
                         Come, lets search the castle - others 
                         may still be trapped inside and Peter 
                         will need all the help he can get.
 
                         
               BACK TO THE BATTLE

                                     PETER
                         Ed! There are too many of them! Go! 
                         Get out of here! Get the girls, and 
                         get them home!
 
                                     BEAVER
                         Come on, you heard him!

               Ed starts to leave, then sees the Witch. And starts to go back
 
               
                                     BEAVER
                         Peter said to go!

                                     EDMUND
                         Peter's not King yet!

               Edmund rushes down the hill and breaks the witch's sword, then 
               she stabs him with the remainders of her wand. so the next thing 
               that is actually said is a grunt issued from Edmund and... 
 
               
                                     PETER
                         Edmund!!(silenced)

               Peter and the Witch fight, then they see Aslan

                                     WITCH
                         Impossible!

               Aslan rushes to kill the Witch, everything disappears

                                     ASLAN
                         It is finished.

               The three Pevensies reunite

                                     SUSAN
                         Where's Edmund?

               The dwarf hobbles up and is about to finish Edmund

                                     SUSAN
                         Edmund! (shoots arrow, kills the dwarf)
 
                         
               Edmund coughs and gasps. Lucy pulls out her cordial and places 
               one drop on Edmund's lips. He stops moving momentarily before 
               gasping and sitting up
 
                                     PETER
                         When are you ever going to do are you're 
                         told?
 
               Laughing and hugging  Group Hug Lucy gets the idea to heal everyone 
               and she walks over too someone else who is hurt. Then you see 
               Cair Paravel, and horns blowing. The coronation of the Pevensies 
               began. They walk up the aisle happily, and stand next to their 
               cool chairs.
 
                                     ASLAN
                         Bring forth the crowns!

               Tumnus and Mr. Beaver bring out the crowns.

                                     ASLAN
                         (As they put on her crown) To the glistening 
                         eastern sea, I give you Queen Lucy the 
                         Valiant. To the great western woods,

                         crown on) Queen Susan the Gentle. (crown 
                         put on) And to the clear northern skies, 
                         King Peter the Magnificent. Once a king 
                         or Queen of Narnia, always a king or 
                         queen.
 
                                     EVERYONE
                         Long live King Peter! Long live Queen 
                         Susan! Long live King Edmund! And long 
                         live Queen Lucy!
 
               Aslan walking on the beach in the sunset

               Lucy runs out to the balcony and see him walking away

                                     TUMNUS
                         We'll see him again.

                                     TUMNUS
                         In time...you mustn't press him, He 
                         isn't a tame lion...
 
                                     LUCY
                         No, but he's good...

                                     TUMNUS
                         Here (pulling a hankie from his person) 
                         I think you need this more than I do.
 
                         
               she takes it and sees that Aslan has disappeared and begins to 
               cry softly, her and Tumnus hold hands as she looks into the sunset.

                         I expect so, probably when you least

                         FADE IN:
          CLOSE ON a spectacular example of PEUCETIA VIRIDANS.
          Descending through mid-air on a silken thread. Neon green
          with black leopard spots on its legs. A Green Lynx Spider.
          As we follow it down, the threaded opening of a GLASS JAR
          appears from the bottom of frame.
          Just before the spider continues inside the jar, it stops,
          suspended. Something's not right. It waves a leg
          tentatively through the air...

                         DARREN'S VOICE
          Come on... Just a little lower...
          WIDEN TO REVEAL a Middle School TOILET STALL. Standing on
          the lid of the closed toilet, holding the glass jar up over
          his head, is DARREN SHAN.
          Darren is 14 and a well-liked kid. Tenacious. Diligent.
           The spider just hangs there.

                         DARREN
          Come on... I'll take good care of
          you. All the bugs you can eat.

          MIDDLE SCHOOL BOYS ROOM
          The door bangs open and STEVE LEONARD enters. Unlike Darren,
          Steve's not so well-liked. In fact, he can be trouble.
          Maybe that's why they're friends.

                         STEVE
          Hey, Darren!
          No answer. Steve walks along the stall, scoots low so he can
          see any feet in front of the bowls.

                         STEVE
          Did you fall in? Darren!

                         DARREN'S VOICE
          Shhh...
          Steve looks to the last stall, sees the jar being held up.
          INTERCUT from in and outside of the stall.

                         DARREN
          You're gonna scare him away.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          2.

                         STEVE
          Man, we're getting killed out
          there. It's three to nothing.
          Darren is all concentration as the spider drops a little.

                         DARREN
          Your problem, Steve, not mine...
          Steve gets a waggish idea. Stepping to the sink, pressing
          his forefinger over the spigot, he turns the faucet.
          WATER SHOOTS out in a stream, which Steve directs into and
          then over the stall door. Reacting, the spider zips up its
          thread, is lost in the darkened ceiling.
          The stall door opens. Dripping water, Darren stares at Steve
          who flashes a wicked grin...

                         CUT TO:

          EXT. SCHOOL YARD - DAY

          Kids eat lunch, off in their groups. On the field: Darren
          has a SOCCER BALL practically glued to his foot. He dribbles
          through defenders, shoots, SCORES! Steve pumps a fist:

                         STEVE
          GOAL! Three to one!
          The other team regroups, starts back upfield with the ball.
          Darren steals it. A few strides and WHUMP!
          Darren catches the goalie too far out. The ball lofts just
          over the backpedaling goalie's head, bounces into the goal.

                         STEVE

                         (EXULTANT)
          Three to two!
          Angry at himself, the goalie KICKS the ball away. It veers
          off toward the street. Steve takes it as a personal insult.

                         STEVE
          What does that prove? Huh?
          The goalie blanches as Steve moves at him. Kids are nervous
          about Steve. He likes to fight. Darren gets between them.

                         DARREN
          Go get the ball. It's 3 to 2.
          Lunch's almost over.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          3.

                         STEVE
          That's why he kicked it. To kill
          time. Well, I still got time to
          kick your face.

                         DARREN

                         (BLOCKING HIM)
          Forget it. The ball.
          Steve decides, heads after it. The goalie gulps in relief.

                         GOALIE
          Thanks, Darren. He's crazy.
          Darren watches after Steve. He does have a vicious streak.

                         THE STREET
          Steve tracks down the ball which has rolled into the street.
          From seemingly out of nowhere...
          A gleaming black 1966 LINCOLN Continental. Its tires sucking
          at the asphalt as it rolls. The windows blacked out.
          It speeds up reaching the ball. Ba-Dump! The ball BURSTS.

                         STEVE
          You idiot!
          The car SCREECHES to a stop, idles ominously. Suddenly Steve
          doesn't seem so tough. He looks nervously back to Darren.
          But as a WIND picks up, the Lincoln suddenly tears off.
          A sheet of PAPER is kicked up by one of the car tires. The
          wind sends it sailing. It drifts down, until... Steve
          notices, snatches it out of the air.
          Darren steps up beside him, watches the Lincoln disappear
          down the street. Creepy...

                         STEVE
          Look at this.
          The paper is a FLYER. A startling, violent layout. Beneath
          a snarling WOLF'S HEAD: CIROUE DU FREAK - Human oddities and
          other living curiosities. Midnight. Zeiterion Theater. $20
          - Admission is at the discretion of the proprietor.

                         STEVE
          .Human oddities and other living
          curiosities...

                         (TO DARREN)
          Other. Does that mean not human?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          4.
          Darren shrugs, takes the flyer.

                         DARREN
          A freak show. Ever been to one?

                         STEVE

                         (GRINS)
          Just this school.
          Darren turns the flyer over. There are tire tracks on the
          back. They hear the sound of distant tire squeals, but the
          Lincoln is long out of view. Just an empty street now...

                         CUT TO:

          A BOA OCCIDENTALIS
          Probing the confines of its glass prison. A BOA CONSTRICTOR
          by any other name. It's a prison within a prison because
          we're inside...

          THE SCHOOL SCIENCE LAB - DAY
          The teacher, MR. DALTON, moves ponderously around the room.
          His voice like a metronome.

          MR. DALTON
          As you can see reptiles and
          amphibians are not one in the same.
          As Mr. Dalton continues, we see various PAIRS OF STUDENTS,
          their computer screens showing text or pictures of various
          FROGS, ALLIGATORS and LIZARDS...
          DARREN and STEVE sit together staring at a Komodo Dragon.
          After Mr. Dalton passes by, Steve switches screen views.
          He's done a WebSearch of Cirque du Freak. There are a dozen
          or so entries. He picks one: History of the Side Show.
          Under 1920's there's an older, much more 'Victorian' pamphlet
          for the Cirque du Freak. A more ornate version of the same
          Wolf Head. The same notice from the proprietor.
          Steve spreads the flyer out to compare. They whisper:

                         STEVE

          1923...

                         DARREN
          Must be a different one.
          Steve scrolls down through pictures:

                         

                         

                         

                         

          5.
          Sword swallower and glass eater: OHIO GRAY.
          Frog boy: AVERY CHILDS.
          Human skeleton: J.D. COMBS. .and then...
          Egyptian Soothsayer: LARTEN CREPSLEY. Crepsley's gaze is
          startling. Like he can see through the screen, even from
          1923. Steve looks like he's just seen a ghost.
          Suddenly, he hits print. As a PRINTER against the wall
          clicks to life, Steve looks back at Darren.

                         STEVE
          I gotta show you something...

                         CUT TO:

          EXT. THE SHAN HOUSE - DAY

          Picture perfect: two stories, dormers, trellises. 9-year-old
          ANNIE rides up on her bike, bookbag over her shoulder.
          Without stopping, she hops off, dumps it on the lawn by two
          other bikes. A few steps and she's through the door.

                         CUT TO:

          INT. DARREN'S ROOM - DAY

          Moody for the daytime. Only the light from the half-closed
          blinds streaking the floor where:
          Darren and Steve are huddled over several clippings and
          pictures that Steve has spread out. They all deal with
          VAMPIRES in some form or another. Steve pulls another stack
          from his backpack, spreads them out as well.

                         DARREN
          I don't get it.

                         STEVE
          Vampires. I've been studying them.
          Vampires? Darren looks at him a beat.

                         DARREN
          Right. You're failing half your
          classes at school, but you're
          studying vampires.

                         STEVE
          They been around 1000's of years.
          Two tribes. They even fight wars.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          6.

                         DARREN
          What? When?

                         STEVE
          Okay, sometimes, when humans fight?
          They fight at the same time. And
          no one knows it. Like at the
          Battle of Stalingrad they fought at
          the same time the Russians and
          Germans were fighting.
          Darren just looks at him, wonders if he's serious.

                         STEVE
          Some people know about it. There
          have even been books written.
          He pulls a frayed old yellow hardcover from his bag.

                         DARREN
          That's your proof? It smells.
          Steve's really trying to convince him now.

                         STEVE
          It's everywhere if you look. On
          the internet, in blogs, newspapers,
          weird places. But you can find it.
          The room starts to tighten a notch around them.

                         STEVE
          I chatted online with one of them.

                         DARREN
          Come on.

                         STEVE
          Serious.
          We become aware of...

          A SINISTER POV
          Someone watching Darren and Steve through the half open
          doorway. It moves in, starts coming up from behind.

                         DARREN
          What was his name? Mr. Dracula?
          Mad now, Steve opens the book, flips pages, finds an old 19th
          Century painting. He slaps down the science lab internet
          print-out of Larten Crepsley. It's the same guy! Maybe...

                         

                         

                         

                         

          7.

                         STEVE
          Here he is in 1923. And here 1855.
          Huh? Maybe he'll be there tonight.
          Would that make you believe?
          As Darren looks them over, the POV looms up behind them.
          Suddenly Darren spins...
          And ROARS at what's behind them: his sister Annie. She
          SCREAMS in response. Steve jumps a mile. Darren LAUGHS.

                         ANNIE
          How'd you know?

                         DARREN
          Saw your shadow on the floor.
          Gotta try harder, knucklehead.
          Steve snaps his book shut, shoves it in his backpack.

                         STEVE
          I'm gonna get a soda.

                         DARREN
          Get me one, too.
          Steve gets up, stomps out of the room.

          INT. KITCHEN - SHAN HOUSE - DAY

          Steve opens the refrigerator, looks to see what's in there.
          At the same time Darren's MOTHER arrives home. Coming in
          through the kitchen door, she sees the refrigerator door
          open, two sneakered feet behind it.

                         MOM
          I know you want to fight global
          warming, Darren, but that's not the
          way to do it.
          Steve leans back to show his face.

                         STEVE
          Sorry, Mrs. Shan.

                         MOM
          Oh hi, Steve. I thought you were,
          Darren.

                         STEVE
          I wish I was.

                         (RE: FRIDGE)
          You guys got everything in here.

                         MOM
          Help yourself.
          She sets her PURSE down on the counter.

                         MOM
          How's your mother?

                         STEVE
          She's okay... She's been working a
          lot lately.
          A little frown of concern crosses Darren's mom. Something
          about Steve... His mom... He brings out a bottle of soda.

                         MOM

                         (POINTS)
          Glasses are up there.

                         STEVE
          I know.
          Darren's mom exits as Steve pulls down two glasses, starts to
          pour soda. As he waits for the foam to settle, he sees...
          The purse. Just there. A quick look around, it doesn't take
          him long to decide. Steve steps over, opens the purse.
          A quick rifling finds a wallet: $200 in $20's. He peels off
          three bills, shoves them in his pocket. BLLEEEP!
          A cell phone starts going off in the purse. Fumbling,
          frantic, Steve stuffs the rest of the money back in the
          wallet, the wallet back in the purse, closes the purse --
          Darren's Mom is back in. She's hurrying to get to her
          celiphone, so...

                         MOM

                         (INTO PHONE)
          Hello?
          .it takes her a second to realize something's up. Not
          listening to her call, she watches Steve grab the two glasses
          and hurry out, leaving the soda bottle on the counter and
          guilt in the air. As she looks over at her purse...

          INT. HALLWAY - SHAN HOUSE - DAY

          Steve comes up off the stairs. He sets the glasses on a hall
          table, continues into...

                         DARREN'S ROOM
          Darren's looking through Steve's vampire memorabilia. Steve
          reaches past, starts packing it up.

                         STEVE
          I gotta go. See ya tonight.

                         DARREN
          Huh? Tonight where?
          He zips the bag, slings it over his shoulder.

                         STEVE
          Cirque du Freak.

                         DARREN
          I got no money right now.

                         STEVE
          Don't sweat it. I got money. Meet
          me ten to Midnight. The Zeiterion
          Theater.

                         DARREN
          That place is supposed to be
          haunted.
          Steve rolls his eyes, starts out...

                         DARREN
          What am I going to tell my parents?

                         STEVE
          Tell them you're sleeping over. We
          can meet early, walk over together.

                         DARREN
          I don't know, man...

                         STEVE
          D, it's Cirque du Freak. You wanna
          hear about it Monday? Or see it
          tonight?
          Steve lets his point sink in, then goes.

          INT. KITCHEN - SHAN HOUSE - NIGHT

          Darren and Annie and his mom and DAD eat dinner. Annie
          chatters away.

                         ANNIE
          And that's why we need a dog.
          She waits for an answer. Mom and Dad exchange a look.

                         DAD
          We'll have to think about it.

                         ANNIE
          How do you guys decide who's going
          to say no when you look at each
          other.

                         DAD
          Whoever's eyes are the widest. And
          I didn't say no. Yet.
          As she tries to think through a new approach...

                         DARREN
          Mom? I'm gonna sleep over Steve's
          tonight? Okay?

                         MOM

          No.

          What? Why not?

                         MOM
          Because I said so, Darren.

                         DARREN
          I'm fourteen. I shouldn't even
          have to ask stuff like this.

                         MOM
          The answer is no. And I'm not sure
          I want you hanging around with
          Steve anymore.

                         DARREN
          I've known him since I was five
          years old!

                         DARREN
          But -- That's not fair!

                         DAD
          Stop arguing with her, Darren.
          Furious at his treatment, Darren gets up, stomps out. As
          Annie wonders if she should ask what's up...

          EXT. DARREN'S ROOM - NIGHT

          The moonlight glinting off Darren's spider terrarium.
          Darren, under the covers, gets out of bed. Fully dressed.
          Going to his door, he listens. Then he crosses to the
          window. Pulling out the screen, he starts to climb out.

          EXT. TRELLIS - SHAN HOUSE - NIGHT

          Darren out his second floor bedroom window, starts to climb
          down via the trellis. CRACK! A section of the trellis
          BREAKS under his feet. Darren almost falls, catches hold.
          He pulls himself over, starts down again.

                         CUT TO:

          EXT. UNION STREET - NIGHT

          Part of a dilapidated, mostly abandoned downtown. Noirish.
          Darren and Steve hurry around a corner.

                         STEVE
          I came here after your house.
          There was a van there, guy selling
          tickets.
          (holds up tickets)
          Rest is history.
          They cross toward the ornate, albeit crumbling facade of the
          ZEITERION THEATER. Deserted, except for a few CANDLES
          burning on the sidewalk by a door. The wind moans.

                         DARREN
          You know why they closed it, right?
          Years ago a kid fell out of the
          balcony and died. It's haunted.

          Get inside.

                         A HALLWAY
          They move toward a light at the end. Darren pauses at a
          darkened staircase. Headed up. He points it out to Steve...

                         DARREN
          The balcony. Where he fell...

                         VOICE
          May I help you?
          They wheel around, react to the sight behind them. MR. TALL.
          Gaunt, but oozing an elegant toughness.

                         STEVE
          We're here to see the show.
          He takes an ominous step forward, then holds out a hand.

          MR. TALL
          Ticket.
          Steve hands it over. Mr. Tall pockets it, looks to Darren.

          MR. TALL
          Do you have your ticket? Darren.
          Darren starts to hand it over, hesitates. The guy knew his
          name. Mr. Tall reaches, takes it.

          MR. TALL
          This way. We're about to begin.
          Mr. Tall turns on his heel and strides off. As they follow:

                         DARREN

                         (LOW)
          He knew my name.

                         STEVE
          Maybe he heard me say it.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          13.
          Mr. Tall turns a corner, only steps ahead of them. But...

                         AROUND CORNER
          When they turn it, Mr. Tall is gone. Vanished. Ahead, a
          threadbare velvet CURTAIN. A low murmur on the other side.
          The boys exchange a last look, then push through into...

          THE ZEITERION THEATER
          Mouldings removed, cherubs gouged from the walls of a once
          proud theater. Rows of seats are missing as well. Those
          that remain are filled. The crowd seems nervous, watching
          the empty stage expectantly. Yearning for something special.
          No sign of Mr. Tall. Darren and Steve stand at the top of
          the aisle. The only kids here. Somewhere off stage a
          TRUMPET sounds and with it a stage light goes out.
          Steve nudges Darren, points out two empty seats halfway down.
          As they move for them, a second trumpet sounds and a second
          stage light goes out.
          And so on. By the time Darren and Steve take their seats,
          the theater has gone black. A final flourish from the
          trumpets and all is silent.
          Then, a dull green light glows across the stage. Before it
          was empty; now there is a CAGE, set on wheels, in the center.
          There's the scraping of chain. A low guttural sound.
          A white spot shines down, leaves the front half of the cage
          in light, the back half in shadow. A FIGURE moves in there..
          The AUDIENCE lean forward, hoping to see when there's a ROAR!
          Several people SCREAM as the figure CRASHES to the front of
          the cage. A WOLFMAN for lack of a better term, its body
          covered in thick, matted hair. It roars again, shakes the
          bars. Its half-canine teeth yellow, its eyes red. A chain
          hangs attached to an iron collar around its neck.
          Half the audience believe it's real. The other half are
          amazed at how real this 'performer' seems. As they buzz, Mr.
          Tall steps out on stage. Wearing red leather gloves and hat.

          MR. TALL
          Ladies and Gentlemen. Welcome to
          the Cirque du Freak. We are an
          ancient circus. We have toured for
          five hundred years...

                         

                         

                         

                         

          14.
          Darren and Steve exchange a look at this information.

          MR. TALL
          .Bringing the remarkable and
          grotesque to generations. Our
          freaks are not people in masks.
          They are not harmless misfits.
          What you see tonight is real. Each
          performer unique. None harmless.
          To prove this, the Wolfman lunges, reaches a claw through the
          bars to swipe just centimeters short of Mr. Tall who's non-
          reaction shows he knows exactly where he's standing.
          A ripple goes through the crowd as they become aware of
          TRUSKA. Startlingly beautiful. Dressed for the Moulin
          Rouge. Crossing the stage in a languid catwalk. Several MEN
          in the audience begin to cough and shift in their seats.
          Even the Wolfman takes notice.

          MR. TALL
          Beauty and the beast.
          Truska approaches the cage, makes soothing motions, her upper
          body swaying. The Wolfman lulls to a trance.
          Two stage hands - MIDGETS apparently, hidden by blue robes,
          step out and start to push the cage off stage.
          Truska steps toward the audience, moving in the same
          languorous rhythm. And then: she begins to grow a BEARD.
          Hairs creeping from above her lip, curling from her chin.
          Some in the audience recoil.
          Darren and Steve trade grins. This is great. Then...
          From either wing of the stage come twin contortionists: SIVE
          & SERSA. They walk on their hands, their legs pulled back
          with their ankles cinched behind there necks.
          As Truska exits, Sive and Sersa meet in the middle. Like
          Hindu wrestlers they take turns, climbing up and down each
          other, look like one person with two fronts. They twist like
          pretzels, getting huge LAUGHS when they pretend to be stuck.
          As it goes on, RHAMUS TWOBELLIES pads out to watch. The
          floorboards creak under his feet. He must weigh 600 pounds.
          After a moment, he turns, walks toward the audience. The
          light leaves the contortionists and focuses on Rhamus.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          15.

                         RHAMUS
          My name is Rhamus Twobellies. And
          I do have two.
          He TRIPS, stumbles toward the edge of the stage. PEOPLE in
          the front row jump back to keep from being crushed. Rhamus
          stops short, LAUGHS at them. He was pretending. He's
          practically doubled-over, resting his hands on his haunches.
          More blue-robed MIDGETS roll out a CART covered with food and
          lots of other stuff. Rhamus grabs a GLASS BOTTLE of soda.
          Instead of opening it, he bites off the glass top, chews it
          and swallows. Soon he's eating food almost as fast as he can
          grab it. Disgusting, but great fun at the same time.
          Next, he holds up a couple of nuts and bolts. Then swallows
          them whole. He swings his belly around. You can hear the
          sound of metal shifting inside.
          The crowd recoils as he starts to regurgitate, spitting out
          BOLTS, NAILS, BOTTLE CAPS, a JACKKNIFE. They clatter on
          stage. Finally, a METAL LINK appears between his teeth.
          He pinches hold of it and pulls. A CHAIN starts out of his
          mouth, up from his belly. One foot...two...six feet in all.
          With a shrug he starts off stage, dragging it behind him.
          Darren & Steve break into applause. So does the audience.
          As Rhamus' chain slides out of sight, a SNAKE slides in. An
          enormous BOA CONSTRICTOR. Impossibly huge. It slithers out
          to the center of the stage, its tongue flicking in and out.
          A SPOTLIGHT flicks down from above. The snake stops, raises
          itself several feet off the ground as it looks up, seemingly
          transfixed by the light. But in reality...
          The end of a thick ROPE drops down. And moving (headfirst!)
          down the rope is a BOY. Very thin, his blonde hair tinged
          with green. This is EVRA VON. He moves smoothly, twists
          over backwards to set his feet down on the stage.
          Evra wears a sort of cloak which he suddenly spins out of.
          The audience GASPS... Wearing only shorts, Evra's body
          SPARKLES. He's covered in gold, blue and green scales!
          He moves a vaguely webbed hand through the air, charming the
          snake which raises itself higher still. He slowly slides
          forward till he and the boa are nearly eye-to-eye.
          Then Evra leans forward and KISSES the snake on the nose.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          16.

                         DARREN & STEVE

                         DARREN
          He's as old as us.

                         STAGE
          Evra starts to make a HISSING sound. In response, the snake
          begins corkscrewing around him like the stripes on a barber
          shop pole. Finally, it slithers around his neck, pulls back
          to look him in the eye. And then...
          Evra bends at the knees, lays down and starts to roll. Like
          he was wrapped in a snake carpet, he disappears stage left.
          More applause from the audience.
          Then the stage goes dark except for a small focused spot at
          the center. Everyone waits, but nothing happens until...
          Appearing literally out of nowhere - one instant there's
          nothing under the spot and the next instant there is --

          LARTEN CREPSLEY!
          Motionless, looking past the crowd. The only difference from
          his pictures is he's a bit older and a SCAR runs down his
          left cheek. It stretches his mouth up on that side.

                         DARREN & STEVE
          Recognize him. Can't believe their eyes. Steve pulls the
          print-out from his pocket, compares.

                         DARREN
          It's him...

                         STAGE
          Crepsley disappears! The crowd mumble nervously. And just
          as suddenly he's back! On the edge of the stage, lit by the
          footlights. This time he holds a draped BIRDCAGE.

                         CREPSLEY
          It's not true. That all tarantulas
          are poisonous. Though some can
          kill a man. With one bite.
          Crepsley whisks off the covering. In the cage: a TARANTULA
          the size of a large man's hand. So big you can make out
          individual eyes. As deadly looking as it is beautiful.

                         DARREN
          Reacts. A spider!

                         

                         

                         

                         

          17.

                         STAGE
          Crepsley makes the introduction.

                         CREPSLEY
          Her name? Madam Octa. Pray that
          she never learns yours.
          Two of the blue-robed 'little people' lead a GOAT onto the
          stage. A ripple of worry runs through the crowd. Crepsley
          starts over. The goat BLEATS. The little people hold it.
          Mr. Crepsley flicks open the cage door with his finger. The
          spider sets its front legs on the bars, pulls itself through.
          A few gasps from the audience. The goat bucks.
          Madam Octa bares her fangs, poised to leap on her prey.
          Several audience members CRY OUT that this should stop.
          Crepsley looks out with mock-theatrical surprise.

                         CREPSLEY
          No...? Shall it be life?
          Chuckling to himself, he looks to the goat tenders. They
          release the goat which bee-lines its way off the stage.
          Crepsley faces the audience.

                         CREPSLEY
          I wonder if you would be as shocked
          to see the same fate for me?
          Madam Octa moves -- climbing the outside of the cage --
          taking a cautious step onto the hand holding the cage, then
          starting up Crepsley's arm. He stands dead still.

                         DARREN & STEVE
          Have a million questions, but right now the performance has
          their full edge-of-their-seat attention.

                         STAGE
          Madam Octa has nearly reached Crepsley's left shoulder.

                         CREPSLEY
          Though we have been together such a
          long time, she is no pet. I think
          she would quite enjoy killing me.
          Crepsley calmly raises his free hand. It holds a shiny TIN
          WHISTLE. Madam Octa has reaches his shoulder.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          18.

                         CREPSLEY
          For her bite there is no cure.
          Madam Octa bares her fangs, even longer now. Her malevolence
          about to be directed at her master.
          Crepsley carefully puts the whistle to his mouth and starts
          to play, as simple as it is evocative.
          Madam Octa hesitates. Then, she moves around his throat,
          starts to climb his face using his scar as her guide. She
          gets to the top of his head, stands in his shock of hair.
          She sways; she's dancing!
          Then she leaps, lands on the end of the whistle. Crepsley
          keeps playing as Madam Octa attaches a web, drops down about
          18 inches off the end. She starts to swing.
          Crepsley takes the whistle from his mouth and twirls it
          around. Octa does a few 360s and the thread breaks. She
          sails up high over Crepsley's head.
          He cranes back to watch as down she comes, legs splayed. She
          lands flat on his face. The whistle is in his hand.
          Crepsley looks out at the audience. Looking out between her
          hairy legs, his eyes are wide with horror.
          Without warning, the spotlight on him goes out. As the stage
          is plunged into darkness, we hear Crepsley SCREAM.
          A horrible, horrible sound. The audience wait, but nothing
          happens. Some of them rise from their seats, peer into the
          gloom. It's too dark.
          The sound of something being DRAGGED. Then nothing. A light
          comes up stage left as Mr. Tall steps out.

          MR. TALL
          Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.
          That is the end of our show.

                         AUDIENCE MAN
          But... What happened to him?!

          MR. TALL
          Don't you know? What happens to us
          all, can happen to any of us.
          That said, there's a crack of thunder and an explosion
          seemingly at Mr. Tall's feet. He's nowhere to be seen.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          19.
          The houselights come up. The stage is empty. Some in the
          audience start to clap. Others are a bit dismayed.
          Darren and Steve sit there as people start for the exits.

                         DARREN
          Let's get outta here.

                         STEVE
          No, you go. I'm staying.
          Steve starts down toward the stage. Darren follows.

                         DARREN
          Wait. What're you doing?
          Steve reaches the stage, looks around. The audience is
          mostly exited; no one from the Cirque is in sight.
          As Steve starts up onto the stage, Darren grabs his shoulder.
          Steve wheels, shoves Darren who stumbles back into a seat.

                         STEVE
          This is my destiny. Don't ruin it.
          Steve looks dangerous as he looms. Darren raises his hands
          in surrender. Steve eases off, but he's still intense.

                         STEVE
          That car today. It was a sign.
          Sending me here. I was told
          there'd be a sign.
          Too friggin' weird.

                         DARREN
          Told by who? The guy in the chat
          room? The internet guy?

                         STEVE
          I'll tell you later. If I can.
          Steve scrambles onto the stage and disappears into the back.
          Darren stands, whispers into the dark.

                         DARREN
          Steve...
          Decision time. Darren climbs up, starts after his friend.

                         CUT TO:

                         

                         

                         

                         

          20.

          INT. ZEITERION THEATER - BACKSTAGE - NIGHT

          Darren moves back into the gloom. Deserted, the junk casts
          sinister shadows. Then, a sound at his feet. Darren stops
          short. Sees that he's almost walked into an open stage DOOR
          IN THE FLOOR. The sound is someone moving below.

                         DARREN
          Steve...?
          No answer. Darren decides, starts down steep, rickety steps.

                         CUT TO:

          STEVE - UNDERSTAGE STORAGE AREA
          He moves past a dilapidated stage elevator. Stumbles. As he
          heads further into the dark.

                         DARREN
          Coming down the creaky stairs. Spooky.

                         DARREN
          Steve...

                         CUT TO:

                         STEVE
          Turning a corner, is startled by what turns out to be a
          costume mannequin. But beyond: a LONG BOX set on two
          sawhorses. Coffin-sized. Empty, its lid propped up by it.
          The dust is tracked with footsteps. A mini-FRIDGE hums in a
          corner. Steve steps over, sees an EXTENSION CORD which runs
          up the wall, disappears into a hole punched in the ceiling.

                         DARREN
          Stops short as a LIGHT suddenly cuts through the gloom to his
          left. Darren steps over low behind a CREDENZA. He sees...

                         STEVE
          He's opened the door to the fridge. The little bulb inside
          pushes through the gloom, lighting the area up.

                         DARREN
          Reacts as MADAM OCTA tries to jump on his face! The bars of
          her CAGE stop her. It rests on the credenza he crouches
          behind. The whistle is there too. Darren looks over as...

                         

                         

                         

                         

          21.

                         STEVE
          Reaches in the fridge, takes out a glass jar that looks to be
          filled with BLOOD. Steve raises it, swirls it around inside.

                         CREPSLEY'S VOICE
          Are you looking for me?
          Steve whirls -- drops the bottle -- SMASH!
          Standing behind him - dead still - CREPSLEY.

                         DARREN
          Rooted to the spot. Watching...

                         STEVE & CREPSLEY
          Crespley sniffs the air - the spilled blood to be exact.

                         STEVE
          I -- I know who you are.

                         CREPSLEY
          Tell me, boy. Who am I?

                         STEVE
          You're a vampire.

                         CREPSLEY
          Too broad a definition. Do you
          introduce yourself as a human? Who
          I am is Larten Crepsley.

                         DARREN
          Moving slightly to get a clearer view.

                         STEVE & CREPSLEY
          Crepsley suddenly DISAPPEARS, REAPPEARS much closer. Steve
          jumps, twists around. Unnerved.

                         CREPSLEY
          Who sent you and what do they want?

                         STEVE
          Nothing. No one.
          Crepsley takes a moment to decide if he believes him.

                         CREPSLEY
          Then what do you want?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          22.

                         STEVE
          I want to join you.

                         CREPSLEY
          Join me? I don't understand.

                         STEVE
          I want you to make me a vampire.
          Not what Crepsley (or Darren) expected. Steve stands there
          trying to look resolved. Crepsley is surprised, intrigued.

                         CREPSLEY
          Is it because you want to live
          forever? Because we don't.

                         STEVE
          I don't care about living forever.
          But you do seem to live a long
          time.

                         CREPSLEY
          A long time alone. Do you want to
          live alone?

                         STEVE
          I already do.

                         CREPSLEY
          Are you an orphan?

                         STEVE
          My father's gone; my mother doesn't
          care about me.

                         CREPSLEY
          Nor mine. You're friendless also?

                         STEVE
          I have a friend, but he doesn't
          understand. He's got too much to
          know what it's like to be alone.
          As Darren reacts to this...

                         STEVE
          When you're alone you feel weak.
          Useless. But I know there must be
          something strong about it, too. I
          want to feel the power of being
          alone. I want to be a vampire.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          23.

                         CREPSLEY
          The power of being alone will never
          be greater than the weakness of it.

                         STEVE
          I don't care.
          Crepsley's actually impressed, but after a moment he waves a
          dismissive hand.

                         CREPSLEY
          It makes no matter. We do not
          blood children. I'm sorry.
          Steve pulls a JACKKNIFE from his pocket, flips open the 2-
          inch blade. Crepsley laughs out loud.

                         CREPSLEY
          Do you intend to use that on me?
          And we feel it more than see it, but Steve cuts into his own
          palm. He holds it up, moist and red in Crepsley's face.

                         STEVE
          Do it. Make me a vampire.

                         CREPSLEY
          Do not tempt me.

                         DARREN
          Can't believe what he's watching. He sees Crepsley suddenly
          get 'scent' of something. Something to do with Steve's
          blood. Not quite a clear view as Crepsley grabs Steve's
          wrist, dabs a finger into his palm and then tastes it.

                         CREPSLEY
          Crepsley shoves Steve down to the ground and immediately
          begins spitting onto the floor. Like it was poison.

                         STEVE
          What's wrong?

                         CREPSLEY
          You have bad blood.

                         STEVE
          What do you mean?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          24.

                         CREPSLEY
          I can taste the menace in your
          blood. You can never be a vampire.
          You're evil.
          Steve scrambles to his feet.

                         STEVE
          That's a lie. You take that back!
          Crepsley draws himself full, his voice deadly.

                         CREPSLEY
          Go home.
          Suddenly cowed, Steve just stands there blinking.

                         CREPSLEY

          GO!
          Steve runs, disappears into the gloom. After a moment, we
          can hear him scurrying up the stairs. Then he's gone.

                         DARREN
          Frozen to his spot, watches as Crepsley, seemingly ill, holds
          his head and spits again onto the floor. Then he steps over
          and kicks the fridge door closed.
          And in the blink of an eye, he's gone. Disappeared.
          Darren is alone. He starts out, then stops. Looks back.
          That beautiful spider. And Darren takes Madam Octa's cage
          and the whistle and makes a run for it. Just like that.

                         CUT TO:

          EXT. STREETS - DARREN'S NEIGHBORHOOD - NIGHT

          3 AM. Dead quiet. Darren hurries home, cage in hand.
          Looking over his shoulder. So far so good. He nearly trips
          over an untied shoelace. He sets down the cage, to tie it.
          Madam Octa lunges across her cage at a WORM on the sidewalk.

                         DARREN
          Oh. You want that?
          Darren picks up the worm, lowers it between the bars. A beat
          and then Madam Octa snatches it away from him. Dinner.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          25.

                         DARREN
          See? I'm your friend... You're so
          beautiful I stopped thinking.
          The wind rustles. Darren grabs the cage, continues.

                         CUT TO:

          EXT. THE SHAN HOUSE - NIGHT

          The house dark. Holding the cage with one hand, Darren
          starts climbing the side of the house using the other. He
          avoids the broken section, but as he reaches the window:
          His Dad is standing there looking out. Busted.

                         DAD
          Get inside.
          From his angle, Darren's Dad can't see the cage in his son's
          hand. Darren hooks it over the end piece of part of the
          trellis and climbs in. Leaving the cage hanging behind.

                         CUT TO:

          INT. DARREN'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

          Darren stands across from his Dad.

                         DAD
          A freak show? Are you kidding me?

                         DARREN
          It was down at the old Zeiterion
          Theater. Look, dad, I'm sorry.
          It's just, I couldn't resist. I --

                         DAD
          You told me the other day you were
          broke. You were looking for a job
          to do around the house this
          weekend.

                         DARREN
          Yeah? So?

                         DAD
          Where'd you get money for the show?

                         DARREN
          Steve had money.
          Darren's Dad's suspicion is confirmed.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          26.

                         DAD
          Steve... We weren't going to tell
          you, but we think Steve stole money
          from your Mom's purse yesterday.

                         DARREN
          He wouldn't do that.

                         DAD
          Mom's pretty sure about it.

                         DARREN
          Man, what is this? You don't want
          me hanging around with him. Now
          you say you think he stole money?
          Do you know for sure?

                         DAD
          No.

                         DARREN
          Steve's had some bad times lately.
          I'm trying to be a good friend.

                         DAD
          Being a good friend and sneaking
          out are two different things.

                         DARREN
          I have to sneak out! You treat me
          like a kid!
          A moment as Darren's raised voice rings out of the room.

                         DAD
          Then act like an adult if that's
          how you want to be treated. This
          world is crossed by fences --
          Darren interrupts. He's heard it a million times.

                         DARKEN
          I know, I know. And you gotta
          decide which side you stand on.
          And you can't sit on it either.
          His Dad doesn't enjoy hearing his words thrown back at him.
          He starts for the door, looks back before exiting.

                         DAD
          A freak show. What do they do, put
          people in cages for everyone to
          laugh at?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          27.
          Darren feels bad, like a kid. He looks down at the floor.

                         DARREN
          It wasn't like that.
          A beat. Darren's Dad goes, closing the door. Darren sighs.
          He goes to the window, pulls up the cage. He scans a look
          outside. Except for his Dad, the coast is clear.

                         CUT TO:

          INT. CLOSET - DARREN'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

          Darren sets the cage on a shelf, shuts the door. Black.

                         CUT TO:

          INT. KITCHEN - SHAN HOUSE - MORNING

          Darren's Mom making omelettes. Darren's DAD helping, dicing
          up some ham. Annie sits at the table awaiting the results.

                         ANNIE
          Is he in a lot of trouble?

                         DAD
          Nothing a few years in prison won't
          take care of.

                         ANNIE
          I don't see what the big deal is...

                         DAD

                         (TO MOM)
          Did you talk to Steve's mom yet?

                         MOM
          Get this. She said she couldn't
          comment because she didn't make it
          home last night herself.

                         ANNIE
          Where was she?

                         MOM
          Go tell Darren it's breakfast.

                         CUT TO:

                         DARREN'S ROOM
          Darren's just snapped her photo with his DIGITAL CAMERA.
          As the door bursts open and Annie enters... Darren scrambles
          to block the cage from view.

                         DARREN
          Annie, you gotta learn to knock.

                         ANNIE
          Mom said to come eat. What's that?
          As Annie tries to look, Darren stays in front of her.

                         DARREN
          Out.
          Annie sighs, heads out. Darren puts the cage in the closet.

                         CUT TO:

          INT. KITCHEN - SHAN HOUSE - DAY

          Darren arrives, sits as everyone pretends not to notice. His
          mom slides his omelette off the pan into his plate. Annie
          watches everyone's every move. Darren eats a bite.

                         DARREN
          Mom, this is the best omelette I
          ever had.
          His Dad can't help but smile. Good move. Mom is pleased,
          but knows she's being manipulated. As Annie stifles a laugh,
          Darren shoots her a look.
          A KNOCK at the kitchen door. Annie gets up, opens the door
          to reveal: Steve. From his angle he can only sees Annie.

                         STEVE
          Hey, midget, where's the idiot?
          Annie motions Steve in. He stops short when he see everyone
          else. He recovers, does his best Eddie Haskell...

                         STEVE
          Hi, Mr. Shan, Mrs. Shan. It's nice
          to see ya.

          INT. DARREN'S ROOM - DAY

          Darren and Steve enter his bedroom.

                         STEVE
          What was that? Everyone acting
          like they don't know me. Did I
          walk in on something?
          Darren closes the door. Gets to the point.

                         DARREN
          What happened last night?

                         STEVE
          Nothing. I hung out in the theater
          for awhile, but no one was around.
          The lie hangs in the air a moment.

                         STEVE
          Sorry about the way I acted. I'm
          sorry I pushed you.

                         DARREN
          Don't worry. There's, you know, no
          bad blood or anything like that.

                         STEVE
          What?

                         DARREN
          I said don't worry.

                         STEVE
          You said bad blood. I never heard
          you say something like that before.

                         DARREN
          What are you, the word police?
          Steve gives him a look. A weird tension in the air. Darren
          glances at the bandage on Steve's palm, changes the topic.

                         DARREN
          Wanna see that new game I got?

                         STEVE
          Sure...
          Darren steps over, starts his computer up. While waiting,
          Steve sees the digital camera on the dresser, picks it up.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          30.

                         STEVE
          I gotta get one of these.
          Steve switches it on. Something occurs to Darren too late...

                         DARREN
          Let me see that --
          On the screen: the PHOTO OF MADAM OCTA. Steve twists around
          to keep the camera out of Darren's reach.

                         STEVE
          It's Madam Octa.

                         DARREN
          I took it at the show.

                         STEVE
          Liar. Look at the background.
          This got taken right on your desk.
          Darren's caught. As they just stare at each other.

                         CUT TO:

                         MADAM OCTA
          In her cage, on the desk. Darren and Steve looking her over.

                         STEVE
          How'd you do it?

                         DARREN
          They were loading a van outside.
          I, I just took her.

                         STEVE
          Just like that...
          (after a look)
          You stole from a vampire you know?

                         DARREN
          Just because he had a coffin
          doesn't mean he's really a...
          Darren trails off. Steve realizes Darren saw the coffin.

                         STEVE
          You were there, weren't you?

                         (NO ANSWER)
          You heard what he said to me? That
          I was evil?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          31.

                         DARREN
          I didn't believe it.
          Steve studies Darren, hopes that's true.

                         DARREN
          I heard what you said to him, too.
          That you wanted to be a vampire.
          Steve doesn't want to talk about it. He looks at Madam Octa.

                         STEVE
          How do you think he made her do
          what he wanted?
          Darren opens his desk drawer, pulls out the flute.

                         DARREN
          I wish I knew how to play it.

                         STEVE
          I think that was just for show. I
          think he used something else. Some
          kind of mind control.

                         DARREN
          You mean telepathy?

                         STEVE
          I bet anyone with a brain could do
          it. Which leaves you out.
          Steve smiles, gives Darren a little punch in the arm. The
          tension is loosening. They react to a KNOCK on the door.

                         ANNIE'S VOICE
          Can I come in?
          Darren goes to the door. Opens it a few inches.

                         DARREN
          I swear to God, Annie...

                         ANNIE
          What? I knocked.
          As they talk, Steve opens the cage door. Madam Octa sets her
          arms on the edge, pulls herself out.

                         LEAPS --
          Lands on Steve's shoulder. Her fangs, wet with poison, glint
          just before she sinks them into Steve's throat. She BITES!

                         

                         

                         

                         

          32.
          Steve surges upward, his shout dying in his throat. He
          stiffens, eyes snapped wide, and then crumples to the floor.
          Darren and Annie react as --
          Madam Octa scurries off, disappears behind the curtain.

                         DARREN

                         (TO ANNIE)
          Don't move.
          Annie freezes. Darren grabs a BASEBALL BAT which leans in
          the corner. He reaches out, pokes at the curtain with it.
          Madam Octa drops down onto the window sill -- WHAM! Wood
          cracks as Darren brings down the bat, but Madam Octa is too
          quick. She disappears, leaping out the open window!
          Darren pulls it shut. He rushes back to Steve, turns him
          over. Steve's skin is already a deathly pale.

                         DARREN
          Steve...
          Annie reaches out, takes Steve's hand.

                         ANNIE
          Darren, he's freezing.

                         DARREN
          Get dad. Go.

                         CUT TO:

          INT. EMERGENCY ROOM - DAY

          Hospital doors BANG OPEN as a gurney bearing Steve is rushed
          through. Darren and his Dad follow with a DOCTOR.

                         DOCTOR
          What kind of spider was it?

                         DARREN
          I think some kind of a tarantula.

                         DOCTOR
          Where is it?

                         DARREN
          It got away.
          Darren's Dad holds up the camera.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          33.

                         DAD
          We have a picture of it.
          The doctor takes it as a NURSE meets the gurney.

                         DOCTOR
          Anaphylactic shock. Get Doctor
          Lund. And we need to download a
          photo to poison control.
          This is as far as Darren goes. Steve is wheeled in,
          surrounded. Syringes are drawn, handed in. All we can see
          of Steve is one skinny arm hanging out.
          PUSH IN ON DARREN. Sick for Steve. Scared. Unaware that
          his world has only just started to crash down around him.

                         CUT TO:

          DR. LUND - HOSPITAL CORRIDOR
          Tough, no nonsense. Marching along, carrying a print-out,
          coming to a stop where Darren sits on a plastic chair. He
          sticks the print-out into his face. The PHOTO of Madam Octa.

          DR. LUND
          How did you make this and why would
          you make this?
          Darren's Mom and Dad start over from down the corridor.

          DR. LUND
          Poison control couldn't ID it. In
          fact, the department of Entomology
          at Harvard couldn't find it in
          their data base. So either it's a
          new species or it's a fake photo.

                         DAD
          If my son said he took that photo,
          then that's the truth.
          Dr. Lund just stares at Darren. Then:

                         WOMAN'S VOICE
          What have you done to him?!
          STEVE'S MOM approaches, her eyes on Darren. Disheveled,
          cheap looking, she hasn't quite started her hangover yet.
          She lunges past Darren's dad, grabs Darren by the shoulder.

                         STEVE'S MOM
          Did you hurt Stevie?! Did you?!

                         

                         

                         

                         

          34.
          She shakes Darren hard. Darren's Dad gets between them. She
          breaks down, sobbing. Darren's mom tries to soothe her as
          she moans about what a bad mother she is.

          DR. LUND
          Your friend's going to die unless
          we find out what's in him.
          On Darren. He looks down to where light spills out from
          Steve's room. His friend is going to die in there.

          MATCH CUT TO:

          INT. DARREN'S ROOM - NIGHT

          Darren as he lays in bed, staring at the ceiling. His clock
          switches to 2:58 AM. Deciding, Darren gets out of bed.

                         CUT TO:

          EXT. SHAN HOUSE - NIGHT

          Dressed, Darren climbs out the window, starts down.

                         CUT TO:

          EXT. ZEITERION THEATER - NIGHT

          Dead lonely as Darren approaches, steps up to the glass door.
          As he leans in to look into the lobby, the door gives a
          little. It's unlocked. Darren pushes it open with a finger.

                         CUT TO:

          INT. UNDERSTAGE STORAGE AREA - ZEITERION - NIGHT

          Darren's by the credenza where he hid. The coffin is gone.

                         DARREN
          Hello?

                         CUT TO:

          INT. BACKSTAGE AREA - NIGHT

          MOVE WITH DARREN who comes up from below and crosses. Stay
          with him as he parts the curtains and comes out on the...

                         ZEITERION STAGE
          Where he stops short, sees in the center of the stage --
          Crepsley's COFFIN. A beat and Darren steps up. He grips the
          lid, starts sliding it back. He looks inside to see --

                         

                         

                         

                         

          35.
          Madam Octa perched on the side, staring back at him!
          Darren stumbles back. The coffin lid SLAMS to the stage as
          Darren loses his footing, lands on his butt. And then --
          APPLAUSE. One pair of hands create a hollow echo.
          Crepsley sits alone in the middle of the theater. Clapping.
          And then he's gone! Only to reappear over Darren, offering a
          hand up. Darren scrambles to his feet. A beat.

                         CREPSLEY
          What have you come for this time?
          Darren pulls out a CRUCIFIX, holds it in Crepsley's face.
          The vampire takes it, looks it over. It has no effect.

                         DARREN
          Crosses don't hurt you?

                         CREPSLEY
          Why should they?

                         DARREN
          Because... you're evil.

                         CREPSLEY
          Am I? Are vampire bats evil when
          they drink the blood of cows?

                         DARREN
          That's different. Bats are animals.

                         CREPSLEY
          So am I. So are you. Our
          appetites don't make us evil.
          (as Darren ponders...)
          Why are you here?

                         DARREN
          Your spider bit my friend Steve.
          Crepsley shrugs, tosses Darren back his crucifix.

                         DARREN
          He's dying.

                         CREPSLEY
          Yes, well, boys who play with
          things they do not understand can
          hardly complain if --

                         

                         

                         

                         

          36.

                         DARREN
          You have to help him!

                         CREPSLEY
          The antidote to her poison is rare.
          Expensive. Why should someone as
          evil as I am waste it on Steve?

                         DARREN
          I'll pay you back. If it takes 50
          years. Whatever it costs.

                         CREPSLEY
          Money doesn't interest me.

                         DARREN
          There's something you want. That's
          why you're here waiting for me.
          Right?
          Crepsley's surprised and pleased by Darren's intuitiveness.

                         CREPSLEY
          The night Steve came below to speak
          to me, you were there. Did you
          hear what we talked about?

                         DARREN
          He wanted to... become like you.

                         CREPSLEY
          You don't just 'become' a vampire.
          The change is too extreme. And if
          the shock didn't kill you, your
          inexperience would. So you become
          one in stages. A half-vampire at
          first. With greater strength than
          a human, but still able to go out
          in sunlight. You learn from a full
          vampire. Do you understand?

                         DARREN
          I think so...

                         CREPSLEY
          But your friend has bad blood.
          He's no good. There's no telling
          what he'll become as he matures.

                         DARREN
          I don't believe that someone can
          have bad blood.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          37.

                         CREPSLEY
          And yesterday you didn't believe in
          vampires. Regardless, I've left
          the Cirque. Left my protection. I
          need someone to protect me while I
          sleep. I need an apprentice.

                         DARREN

                         (SUDDENLY REALIZES)
          Me?
          Crepsley nods.

                         DARREN
          You're crazy. There's no way.

                         CREPSLEY
          Then your friend will die.
          The words hang in the air. Crepsley smiles.

                         CREPSLEY
          You hardly have a choice. It's
          your destiny.

                         DARREN
          Destiny? That doesn't make sense.

                         CREPSLEY
          Try this then. You're reckless
          enough to steal, responsible enough
          to come back for a friend. That's
          enough for me.

                         DARREN
          Not for me.

                         CREPSLEY
          Yes, well, destiny can't be
          explained. It must be lived. Now,
          you're wasting my time.

                         DARREN
          There's gotta be another way.

                         CREPSLEY
          There isn't.

                         DARREN
          Please... He's my friend.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          38.

                         CREPSLEY
          And he slips away while we argue.
          Life or death? Yes or no?

                         DARREN
          You'd never be able to trust me.
          If I got a chance for payback I'd
          take it.

                         CREPSLEY
          Yes or no?
          Thoughts rush, then stop. Darren finally just nods.
          Crepsley raises his right hand. The nails are not especially
          long, but they look thick and sharp.
          Crepsley takes Darren's hand, jabs at his forefinger, draws
          blood. He dabs off a drop, smells it, then tastes it.

                         CREPSLEY
          You have good blood.
          Crepsley lifts his own left hand. He presses the nails of
          his right into the fleshy tips of his left hand fingers.
          Then he uses the left nails to mark the right fingers in the
          same way. Blood drips down all ten fingers.

                         CREPSLEY
          Lift your hands.
          Darren does as he's told. Crepsley digs all ten nails into
          all ten of Darren's fingertips. Darren jerks back in pain.

                         CREPSLEY
          Get used to pain. More lies ahead.
          He motions to his hands. Darren raises them, fingers spread.
          Crepsley presses his fingertips to Darren's. Blood brothers.
          As their eyes lock, Darren frowns at an alien sensation.

                         CREPSLEY
          The blood flows into your left arm
          and out of your right. Do you feel
          it? Getting near your heart?
          Darren nods, shivers.

                         CREPSLEY
          Almost there.
          A force arcs through Darren's body. He screams, falls down.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          39.
          Crepsley turns away, starts to lick the blood from his
          fingertips. Tries to block out Darren's soft whimpering.
          Tries to block out any sympathy he feels.

                         CREPSLEY
          The world will start to slow down.
          You'll become a witness of time.
          (snaps out of it)
          Your friend's time is running out.
          He pulls Darren to his feet.

                         CUT TO:

          EXT. ZEITERION THEATER - NIGHT

          They step out into the moonlight. Darren a little wobbly.

                         CREPSLEY
          Take my arm. Don't let go.
          Darren takes hold. Crepsley starts to move. Only it seems
          more like he's still and the ground is moving under his feet.
          Darren looks about as the building begin to streak past, the
          road a blurred ribbon. The night has a weird chromatic look.
          The world moving faster, Crepsley and Darren slipping past.
          A moment later and they're in the...

          HOSPITAL PARKING LOT
          Crepsley pulls loose Darren's hand. They're still bleeding.

                         CREPSLEY
          Lick your fingers. Vampire spit
          will stop wounds from bleeding.
          Darren looks at his fingers, then around the lot.

                         DARREN
          How'd we get here?

                         CREPSLEY
          It's called flitting. Which room
          is your friend in?

                         CUT TO:

          INT. HOSPITAL - STEVE'S ROOM - NIGHT

          Tubes run in and out of Steve. His breathing is labored.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          40.
          Crepsley leans over him, rolls up one of Steve's eyelids.
          Darren watches as Crespley looks into Steve's eye.

                         CREPSLEY
          We're in time. He still has a few
          minutes left.
          Crepsley takes a small AMBER VIAL from his pocket. He breaks
          a wax seal then pinches out a small blackened cork.
          He pulls the drip line out of the IV CATHETER and empties a
          drop of the vial's dark, viscous contents inside. It swirls
          murkily, coloring the liquid on its way into Steve's arm.
          A beat and then Steve seems to convulse, his arms and legs
          twitching. Is he dying?

                         DARREN
          What's happening?

                         CREPSLEY
          He was near death. The journey
          back is not pleasant. What do you
          know about him, this boy with bad
          blood?

                         DARREN
          He's my friend.

                         CREPSLEY
          Hmm... Who's his father?

                         DARREN
          Never met him. I don't think Steve
          ever did either. Why do you want
          to know?
          And then Steve comes around. He opens his eyes, focuses on
          Darren for a moment. He looks puzzled.

                         STEVE
          Darren?
          And then he drifts off, asleep. His breathing growing
          deeper, steadier. Darren realizing he's going to be okay.

                         CREPSLEY
          Will you come with me now or do you
          have things to set in order first?
          That's when it really hits home. He's agreed to leave every-
          thing and go off with a vampire. Without really thinking,
          Darren starts backing toward the door, his eyes on Crepsley.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          41.

                         CREPSLEY
          I see...
          Darren's almost to the door. Crepsley stays where he is.

                         CREPSLEY
          Run if you want. It won't help.
          You're a creature of the night now,
          Darren Shan.
          Darren turns and bolts leaving Crepsley alone. Chuckling,
          the vampire tucks Steve's covers up under his chin.

                         CUT TO:

          EXT. HOSPITAL DOORS - NIGHT

          BURSTING OPEN as Darren charges out. Running for his life.

                         CUT TO:

          INT. DARREN'S ROOM - MORNING

          Darren asleep in his bed. The door opens and his mom enters.

                         MOM
          Darren... Wake up, honey.
          Darren wakes with a start as she gives him a little shake.
          As he looks about, wonders what reality he's in.

                         MOM
          I just got off the phone. Great
          news. Steve's going to be okay.

                         DARREN
          What?

                         MOM
          The hospital says it's a miracle.
          Was it a dream? Darren looks down at his hands. On the tip
          of each finger and two thumbs are small round WHITE SCARS.
          Darren instinctively hugs his mom. She thinks he's
          overjoyed, can't see his look of terror. She hugs him back.

                         MOM
          Yeah, it's great news. I know how
          you feel.

                         CUT TO:

                         

                         

                         

                         

          42.

          EXT. THE SHAN HOUSE - DAY

          The door opens and Darren steps out. He takes a long look up
          and down the street. Nervous. Then he see the sun up in the
          sky. Relaxes a little. Right... Vampires... Sun.
          He takes a step down the stairs when... From out of the
          bushes... SOMEONE LEAPS!

                         ANNIE
          Boo!
          Darren nearly jumps out of his skin. Annie laughs.

                         ANNIE
          Got you! I finally got you! -
          Darren turns on her, looks like he could kill her.

                         DARREN
          Don't ever do that again.
          Annie's smile drops away. As Darren continues on...

                         CUT TO:

          INT. HALLWAY - SCHOOL - DAY

          Darren walking along, feeling isolated as he moves past the
          other students. Everything seems weird, off.
          A couple of KIDS RUSH past him going into a classroom. Then
          a COUPLE more coming the other way.

                         KID
          Hey, Shan, you gotta see this.
          They duck into the classroom. Darren follows.

                         SCIENCE LAB
          TWENTY or so KIDS all pressed around the Boa Constrictor
          tank. Steve holds court.

                         STEVE
          .Doctor said it was a miracle.
          They say I'm unique --
          Steve spots Darren as he steps up in the back.

                         STEVE
          Hey, Darren. I've been looking for
          you. We got a lot to talk about.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          43.

                         DARREN
          Yeah?

                         STEVE
          But first...
          Steve holds out a fist. A MOUSE pokes its head out through
          an opening in the hand. Its whiskers twitch. As Darren
          looks from the mouse to the snake...
          Steve addresses the kids does his best 'Mr. Tall'. He tries
          to be entertaining, but he comes off creepy.

                         STEVE
          Welcome to Cirque du Steve. What
          happens to us all can happen to any
          of us. If you watch, it's by your
          own free will. Say farewell...

                         HEFTS MOUSE
          .to Crepsley the mouse.
          Darren reacts to the name. Steve lowers his hand into the
          terrarium. Some kids already look away, others are intent.

                         DARREN

                         STOP --
          Steve hesitates. Darren pushes to the front.

                         DARREN
          It's cruel.

                         STEVE
          It's nature. Anyhow don't watch.

                         (TO KIDS)
          And don't blink; you might miss it.
          Steve sets the mouse in the terrarium.
          The MOUSE takes a few tentative steps. Moves toward a corner
          away from the... SNAKE who's suddenly alert. It raises its
          head, flicks its tongue. Coils back on itself.
          ZAP! The snake STRIKES...
          And Darren darts down his hand! CATCHES the snake just below
          its head, out of mid-air, out of mid-strike. Impossible!
          The snake twists in Darren's hand. The students are blown
          away. Steve's eyes narrow, his wheels are turning.
          The BELL RINGS. Moment over. Kids hurry out to class.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          44.
          Darren scoops up the mouse, drops the snake back in. As he
          starts out, Steve cuts him off.

                         STEVE
          What happened to the spider?

                         DARREN
          I killed it.
          Steve hesitates, processes, looks Darren over.

                         STEVE
          I had a dream. You and Crepsley
          were in my hospital room...

                         DARREN
          Tell me about it later.
          Darren starts away. Steve grabs him hard, spins him around.

                         STEVE
          I'll tell you now.
          Darren reacts instinctively, grabs Steve with his free hand
          and SLAMS him against the wall. Steve's nearly off the
          ground, only his left toe touching.

                         DARREN
          I said later.
          Darren lets go, heads off. Steve watches, wonders.

                         CUT TO:

          EXT. STREETS - DARREN'S NEIGHBORHOOD - DAY

          Darren walks home, hands in pockets. Annie comes up behind.

                         ANNIE
          Darren! Wait up!
          He looks over his shoulder, keep going.

                         ANNIE
          Can I walk home with you?
          He softens, slows down. After a few silent steps.

                         DARREN
          Got you something.
          Darren pulls the MOUSE from his pocket. Annie loves it, cups
          it in her hand.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          45.

                         ANNIE
          He's adorable.

          ANNIE & DARREN - A CREATURE'S POV
          Coming in low and fast.

                         STREET
          Annie SCREAMS as a GERMAN SHEPHERD charges, stops just short
          of them. GROWLING like it was rabid. Like it hates Darren.
          Darren steps between it and Annie. Darren's pupils dilate
          oddly; he curls his lip to show his own teeth. The dog
          starts to back off..

                         ANNIE
          Hey. That's King.

                         DARREN
          No it's not. King's my buddy.

                         ANNIE
          That's King, Darren. It is.
          Darren realizes it is King. As Darren realizes something's
          wrong with Darren.. Another growl. From down the street.
          Darren looks back as a black 1966 LINCOLN prowls through the
          intersection. The one seen at school. It slows, windows
          blacked out. As it continues, disappears from view...

                         DARREN
          Come on.
          As Darren hurries Annie along down the street...

                         CUT TO:

          INT. KITCHEN - SHAN HOUSE - NIGHT

          Darren at the kitchen table doing his math homework. His Mom
          makes dinner, chopping vegetables at the sink.

                         MOM
          How was school today?

                         DARREN
          The usual. Sometimes it was
          boring, sometimes really boring.
          Darren's mom laughs. Then...

                         

                         

                         

                         

          46.

                         MOM
          Ouch!
          She drops the knife on the cutting board. A thick drop of
          BLOOD runs down her finger.
          Darren flinches at the sight and in that moment we PUNCH INTO
          his eyes. The PUPILS swirl red; the IRISES flatten and
          narrow. A dark, ravenous look.

          MOM - DARREN'S POV
          Holding up her finger. Her skin tone receding back into
          gray, the blood pulsing with red vibrancy. Alive. A target.

                         DARREN
          Standing at the blood's seeming siren call. But as he
          suddenly moves forward, she turns away.
          Darren stops as she wraps her finger in a paper towel. She
          looks back at him: misunderstands his hunger for concern.

                         MOM
          It's okay, honey. I just need a
          band-aid.
          Darren looks at his mom's neck. His eyes zero in on a little
          blue VEIN PULSING away. She leaves the room to get a band-
          aid. As Darren's horror sinks in...

                         CUT TO:

          INT. BATHROOM - SHAN HOUSE - NIGHT

          Darren looks at his reflection in the MIRROR. Looking for
          reassurance. He curls his lip, checks his teeth. They look
          normal. He reaches out. Trying to reach himself.
          His hand comes to a stop against the glass. His nails CLICK
          hard against the surface. He scrapes the nail of his
          forefinger along the glass. It leaves a deep scratch.
          Darren starts to freak a little. His breath getting ragged.
          He tries to get a hold of himself, looks back in the mirror.

                         DARREN
          You're different...

                         CUT TO:

                         

                         

                         

                         

          47.

          INT. ZEITERION THEATER - STAGE - NIGHT

          Darren walks down an aisle, climbs up onto the empty stage.
          Dark, but Darren moves calmly, like it was noon.

                         DARREN
          Hello? Hey!
          Crepsley appears. Darren turns, sees him. A beat. Crepsley
          raises his hands to the gloom around them.

                         CREPSLEY
          The darkness isn't so scary
          anymore, is it?

                         DARREN
          I'm starting to think it's me
          that's scary.
          Crepsley waits to hear more.

                         DARREN
          It's only gonna get worse, isn't
          it? There's no way back, is there?
          No magic potion to make me human
          again?
          Crepsley shakes his head. Darren nods that he understands.

                         DARREN
          We made a deal. I won't run away
          again.

                         CREPSLEY
          It's neither here nor there, but, I
          do feel sorry for you.
          Darren waves it off, doesn't want to hear it.

                         CREPSLEY
          Are you ready then? The night is
          young. We can make many miles.

                         DARREN
          I can't just -- My family, I can't
          let them think I just left them.
          Or that something happened to me.
          My mother would... She couldn't...
          As Darren trails off, Crepsley really does look sympathetic.

                         CREPSLEY
          There's only one thing for it.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          48.

                         DARREN
          What?

                         CREPSLEY
          We'll have to kill you.

                         CUT TO:

          EXT. LIVING ROOM - SHAN HOUSE - NIGHT

          Darren's parents watching CNN. Darren comes in.

                         DARREN
          I'm going to bed.
          They say 'good night' to him. Impulsively, Darren kisses his
          dad on the cheek, then does the same to his mom.

                         DARREN
          I love you both. I don't say it
          that much, but I do.
          Darren's Mom is caught off guard, but happy to hear it.

                         MOM
          We love you, too. Don't we, Tommy?

                         DAD
          Of course we do.
          Darren looks at them a beat, then smiles, satisfied.

                         DARREN
          Good night.
          They watch him go, then exchange looks.

                         DAD

                         (SHRUGS)
          Kids. Who knows how they think?

                         CUT TO:

          INT. ANNIE'S ROOM - NIGHT

          Annie asleep already. Darren enters, pulls his sister's
          blanket up, tucks it under her chin. He whispers:

                         DARREN
          Goodbye, knucklehead. If I can
          ever help you, I will.

          49.

          INT. DARREN'S ROOM - NIGHT

          Darren enters to find Crepsley sitting at his desk. He holds
          a small dark bottle between his fingers (different than the
          one he gave to Steve). As Crepsley's about to speak...

                         DARREN
          Shut up.
          Off Crepsley's reaction...

                         DARREN
          This is my home and I'm never gonna
          see it again, so don't rush me.
          Crepsley makes a motion to zip his lips. All the same, he
          stands, unscrews the bottle as Darren takes a last look
          around. He takes a PHOTO of his family off the dresser.

                         DARREN
          Hold onto this for me, okay?
          Crepsley takes the photo, offers Darren the bottle in return.
          Darren sniffs, recoils at the foul smell.

                         DARREN
          You're sure it will work?
          Crepsley opens the window.

                         CREPSLEY
          Your heart will slow down so
          drastically they won't find a
          pulse. With the fall from the
          window, they'll think you're dead.

                         DARREN
          What if I break bones?

                         CREPSLEY
          Even better. They'll mend in a few
          days. Vampires don't stay broken
          for long and it takes a very long
          fall to kill one.

                         DARREN
          And the funeral home? Won't they
          embalm me or something?

                         CREPSLEY
          Don't worry. I have ways of making
          my thoughts become the thoughts of
          others. They'll leave you alone.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          50.
          Crepsley gestures to the window. Knowing the plan, Darren
          climbs out, his foot resting on the trellis. He looks to the
          ground, back to Crepsley as an odd thought hits him.

                         DARREN
          My dad's allergic to grass. It's
          my job to cut the lawn.

                         CREPSLEY
          You have a new job now. Drink.
          Darren steels himself, gulps it down, hands the bottle back.

                         DARREN
          So this is destiny, huh? Tastes
          like crap.
          Darren body seizes up. He lets go, but Crepsley grabs him.

                         CREPSLEY
          Your breathing is slowing, your
          heart as well. Do you feel it?
          Darren can't answer. He blinks his eyes 'yes' instead.

                         CREPSLEY
          You may be aware of what's going on
          around you. Remember, the grief
          that you hear will be a release for
          those who express it.
          Darren's eyes drift shut. Crepsley lets him go.

                         CUT TO:

          EXT. SHAN HOUSE - NIGHT

          Darren FALLS, crashes through the trellis and thumps into the
          lawn. Crepsley looks down from the window, then disappears.
          CLOSE ON Darren lying face down in the grass. CRICKETS
          chirp. Beyond, a NEIGHBOR walks his DOG. The dog suddenly
          turns in the direction of Darren, pulls on its leash.

                         NEIGHBOR
          No, no, come on --
          The Neighbor stops short as he sees the body.

                         NEIGHBOR
          Hey -- Hey, kid --
          He rolls Darren over, realizes something is very wrong.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          51.
          We stay on Darren, the dog sniffing at him as the neighbor
          disappears toward the front door. We hear his fist pound. A
          moment later, Darren's father is there. He looks at Darren,
          up to the open window, realizes he fell. An instant later,
          he's on his knees, cradling his son.

                         DAD
          Darren? Darren!
          A moment later his Mom...

                         MOM
          Darren! Oh my God!
          We're still on Darren's face, his eye open a slit.

                         DARREN'S POV
          His parents hovering over him in despair. The STARS TWINKLE.
          The neighbor leans in.

                         NEIGHBOR
          Is he dead?

          INT. MORGUE - NIGHT

          Darren's body on a stainless steel table. The MEDICAL

                         MEDICAL EXAMINER
          Cause of death is trauma from the
          impact of the fall. Poor kid.

                         ASSISTANT
          Are we doing an autopsy?

          A NEW ANGLE
          Reveals Crepsley watching from around a darkened corner.

                         (WHISPERS)
          Not on a child.
          Immediately...

                         MEDICAL EXAMINER
          I'm not going to cut open a kid.

          INT. FUNERAL HOME - EARLY EVENING

          Darren in his coffin, wearing a suit. Aware as...
          Friends and family passing by. The sounds of people crying.
          TWO CUTE GIRLS from school lean in.

                         GIRL ONE
          He's still cute.

                         GIRL TWO
          I always had a crush on him.
          The Goalie from school soccer is next. He holds a little
          SOCCER BALL in his hand. Tucks it into the coffin.

                         GOALIE
          For the next life, Shan. Top right
          corner every time.
          Annie steps up, gently strokes her brother's cheek. Then
          suddenly overwhelmed, she buries her face in their Dad's
          chest. He leans in tenderly over his son. Choked up:

                         DAD
          I love you, Darren. You said it
          the other night; I didn't say it
          back.

          DARREN IN HIS COFFIN
          A hand reaches down, a thumb opens his eyelid.

                         DARREN'S POV
          Of the ceiling for a moment, then a blinding light flashing
          back and forth. Then glimpses of Steve's face!

                         VISITING ROOM
          Steve holds Darren's eye open, shines a PENLIGHT into it.
          The pupil doesn't dilate. Footsteps approach. Steve
          switches it off, pockets it as the FUNERAL DIRECTOR enters.

          I'm sorry. I know it's difficult,
          but visiting hours are over.
          Steve nods sadly, looks to Darren. He pats one of Darren's
          hands which are folded across his chest.
          In reality Steve checks Darren's fingertips. A WHITE SCAR at
          the end of each one. Steve's crazy idea may be confirmed.

                         CUT TO:

          EXT. CEMETERY - DAY

          Darren's coffin is lowered into the ground.

                         MINISTER
          Ashes to ashes, dust to dust, in
          sure and certain hope of the
          resurrection to come...
          Darren's Dad tosses a handful of earth down onto the coffin.

                         CUT TO:

          DARREN INSIDE THE CLOSED COFFIN
          The lid an inch from his face. His eyelid twitching as we
          hear shovelfuls of dirt hit the lid. The sound growing
          duller at each turn. Then, as Darren's eye flickers open...

                         CUT TO:

          EXT. CEMETERY - NIGHT

          Moonless. The sound of digging continues. Only now, dirt is
          coming out of the hole rather than going in.
          Crepsley is digging the coffin back up. Effortlessly.
          Finally, he spreads his feet apart, pulls open the lid.
          Darren sputters as some of the dirt spills onto his face.
          Crepsley reaches down, pulls him up and out of the grave.
          Darren sits on the ground, coughing then moaning.

                         CREPSLEY
          On your feet.

                         DARREN
          My legs are asleep.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          54.
          Crepsley pulls him up anyhow. Darren stumbles a few steps,
          nearly falls before finding his balance.

                         CREPSLEY
          Walk it off. I'll fill this back
          in. Go. Breathe some air.
          Crepsley closes the coffin, begins to fill the hole as Darren
          ambles off. Not exactly the start of his best day.

          MOVE WITH DARREN
          Passing among the graves, stretching his arms, twisting.
          Really beat up. He looks about, the names and dates on the
          headstones popping into focus even from far away. Night
          vision. Suddenly he becomes aware of something:
          Steve. On the other side of a mausoleum. Ten feet away.

                         DARREN
          What are you doing here?

                         STEVE
          (smiles; closing in)
          Vampire hunting.
          Steve rushes the last step, a jagged WOODEN STAKE held high
          over his head. He knocks Darren back on the ground.
          Pouncing on top, he brings down the stake.
          Darren catches hold of Steve's wrist. Stops the point of the
          stake just over his heart. Steve puts his weight into it. A
          desperate moment of struggle, but Darren's strength is
          resurgent. He throws Steve off.
          Steve rolls to his feet, comes at him again. Darren catches
          his wrist with one hand, his throat with the other. He slams
          him up against the mausoleum, holds him there.

                         DARREN
          What do you have against vampires?
          You wanted to become one yourself.

                         STEVE
          Yeah, I wanted to, but you did.
          You stole my dream. You stole my
          destiny.

                         DARREN
          Are you crazy? I did it to save
          your life. That was the deal. Me
          for you.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          55.

                         STEVE

                         (UNHINGING)
          Liar. You told him I was evil.
          You planned this all along. And
          you'll pay! You'll pay --
          Darren jams the stake under Steve's throat. That stops him
          struggling. The points jabs him as he swallows.

                         DARREN
          I want you to leave...
          Steve is just beginning to realize how strong Darren is now.

                         DARREN
          I want you to leave and forget you
          ever saw me. Understand?
          Scared, he nods. Darren shoves him away, brakes the stake in
          two. Steve heads away, looks back over his shoulder.

                         STEVE
          I'm going to hunt you, Darren. You
          and the other one. Crepsley. I'll
          put a stake in you and burn you to
          ashes. I'll make sure you never
          come back from the grave again.
          WHAM. Steve walks right into Crepsley. He picks Steve up by
          the shoulders, pulls him close. With a voice like Death...

                         CREPSLEY
          If we ever meet again, I will show
          you loneliness you cannot imagine.
          Steve trembles in fear. Crepsley lets go. Steve takes off
          running. Crepsley looks to Darren.

                         CREPSLEY
          Do you still question his blood?
          Darrenthoughtful, doesn't know what to think.

                         DARREN
          Would a stake through the heart
          kill a vampire?

                         CREPSLEY
          Yes. But so would getting hit by a
          truck if it was going fast enough.
          Steve finally disappears from sight. Crepsley sighs.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          56.

                         CREPSLEY
          He'll be trouble before it's over.

                         DARREN
          Before what's over?

                         CREPSLEY
          This adventure we're on. Shall we
          start?
          Darren hesitates, looks to the twinkling lights of his city.

                         CREPSLEY
          You'll get used to it after awhile.
          Vampires are always saying goodbye.
          A beat, then Darren looks back at him.

                         DARREN
          Let's go.

                         CUT TO:

          INT. MOTEL ROOM - SUNRISE

          Darren jams a rolled towel along the bottom of a closed door.

                         DARREN
          How's that? Dark enough?

                         CREPLEY'S VOICE
          (on the other side)
          Better.

                         DARREN
          It's sunrise.

                         CREPLEY'S VOICE
          I know the time. I know more about
          the sunrise than anyone alive.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          57.
          Crespley sounds irritated. Darren gets mischievous.

                         DARREN
          Maybe I'll wait until noon and then
          open every door and curtain in the
          place.
          A long tense silence as Darren awaits Crepsley's reply.

                         MOTEL BEDROOM
          Crepsley is a shadow among the shadows. He climbs into bed.

                         CREPSLEY
          Yes, sunlight would kill me. My
          electrons are different than a
          human's. But it would take several
          hours of exposure. I'd have plenty
          of time to kill you before I closed
          the curtains and went back to bed.
          Crepsley pulls the blanket up over his head.

          MOTEL LIVING ROOM
          As Darren considers this...

                         CUT TO:

          DOORWAY - LATER
          Darren doing pull-ups, a hand on either side of the top jamb.

                         DARREN

          242... 243... 244...
          It's almost effortless. Bored rather than tired, Darren
          drops to his feet. (He still wears his burial suit.)

                         CUT TO:

          EXT. MOTEL COURTYARD - AFTERNOON

          Darren watching the cars go by on the highway, spots...

                         DARREN
          Minnesota...
          Darren jots this state down on a LIST he's keeping. About
          twenty state license plates so far.

                         CUT TO:

                         

                         

                         

                         

          58.

          INT. COUCH - MOTEL ROOM - SUNSET

          A TV droning. Darren asleep. Bathed in a golden glow that
          flickers out as the sun sets. The bedroom door opens.
          Crepsley steps over, looks down at his snoozing assistant.
          Crepsley CLAPS his hands together, nearly against Darren's
          ear. Crepsley smiles as Darren jolts awake.

                         CUT TO:

          EXT. SHOPPING MALL PARKING LOT - NIGHT

          Getting late, stores closing. The parking lot nearly empty.
          Darren and Crepsley are on a walk and talk.

                         CREPSLEY
          We can die violently. Accidentally
          or otherwise. But we also grow
          old. A full vampire will age one
          year for every ten human years he's
          alive. A half-vampire like you:
          one for every five.

                         DARREN
          I don't understand.

                         CREPSLEY
          I was born in 1774. I became --
          Crepsley looks back to where Darren has stopped short.

                         DARREN

          1774?

                         CREPSLEY
          Should we do the math or not?
          Darren nods. Crepsley motions him to keep up.

                         CREPSLEY
          I became a vampire when I was 20
          years old. In 1794.

                         DARREN

          1794?

                         CREPSLEY
          In Paris. The days of the Terror.
          Heads in baskets. Guillotines up
          and down all day. Really when
          humans put their minds to it, we
          vampires can hardly compete.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          59.
          Darren's stare jogs him back from the good old days.

                         CREPSLEY
          Math. 1794. So I've been a
          vampire now for 211 years. Hmm?
          Darren nods again, still with him.

                         CREPSLEY
          I age 1 year for every 10, so, 211
          divided by 10, I've aged about 21
          years in that time. That 21 plus
          my first human 20 makes me look
          about 40.

                         DARREN
          But altogether you're 211 plus 20.
          You're really 231 years old.

                         CREPSLEY
          Exactly. You're going to be a
          teenager for a very long time.
          They walk on a few steps as Darren thinks this over.

                         DARREN
          Where do you keep your car anyhow?

                         CREPSLEY
          What car?

                         DARREN
          The one you were driving around my
          town in. The old black one.

                         CREPSLEY
          I've never owned a car, Darren. I
          don't need one.

                         DARREN
          It was near school one day. It
          followed me home a few days later.

                         CREPSLEY
          And you saw me behind the wheel?

                         DARREN
          I couldn't see who was driving.

                         CREPSLEY
          It wasn't me.
          As Darren considers this, Crepsley stops suddenly.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          60.

                         CREPSLEY
          There...
          Ahead: just more parking lot. A WOMAN exiting a BOOKSTORE.

                         DARREN
          What?

                         CREPSLEY
          Dinner.

                         CUT TO:

          EXT. PARKING LOT - NIGHT

          The woman nears her car. A chirp as she unlocks it with her
          remote. She opens the back door, sets the book bag on the
          seat. Suddenly she turns, like someone called her name.

                         WOMAN
          Yes?
          Only nobody's there. She shrugs it off, closes the back
          door. But hesitates at the driver's side door. Then she
          starts walking away, toward a back area of loading docks.

                         CUT TO:

                         DARREN & CREPSLEY
          Watch from a dumpster by the loading dock. She walks right
          toward them. One look at Crepsley's face and we know he must
          be willing her over. Darren looks terrified.
          But the air shimmers and Crepsley has disappeared.
          The woman steps up, stops across from Darren. As she frowns,
          tries to figure out who he is and how she got here...

                         DARREN
          Go. Run.
          But Crepsley appears beside her. He 'breathes' into his
          hand, 'guides' the air into her face. He catches her as she
          passes out. Darren is horrified.

                         DARREN
          Did you kill her?

                         CREPSLEY
          I put her to sleep. She'll be like
          this 15 minutes. When she wakes
          up, she won't remember a thing.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          61.
          Crepsley eases her to the ground, finds a vein on her wrist.

                         DARREN
          Will she become a vampire?

                         CREPSLEY
          No. She'd have to share y blood
          for that to happen.

                         DARREN
          Don't take too much.

                         CREPSLEY
          A vampire who feeds often can
          control himself. One who drinks
          only when he must can end up
          feeding wildly.
          He uses one of his fingernails to open the vein.

                         CREPSLEY
          The hunger inside us must be fed to
          be controlled. To be civilized.
          It's what separates us from... the
          others.

                         DARREN
          What others?
          But as blood oozes, he takes the woman's wrist td his mouth.
          Darren is repulsed, but can't look away. Crepsley takes a
          few deep swallows, then holds the wrist out to Darren.

                         CREPSLEY
          Your turn.

                         DARREN
          No. I won't.

                         CREPSLEY
          Darren...

                         DARREN
          I'll never do it.
          Crepsley runs his tongue over the cut, rubs the saliva in.

                         CREPSLEY
          You can lead a vampire to blood,
          but you can't make him drink.

                         DARREN
          I'm only half-vampire.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          62.

                         CREPSLEY
          No matter, you need blood to live
          now. You'll drink eventually.
          When you're hungry enough.
          The wrist is clean, the cut gone. A barely perceptible scar.

                         DARREN
          I'll die first.

                         CREPSLEY

                         (ANGER FLASHING)
          Don't be stupid. You may abstain
          tonight, but you must feed soon.
          Crepsley stands to go, then stops short. Tense, he looks
          about, more hunted animal than man. As he shrugs it off.

                         DARREN
          What is it?
          As the woman starts to stir...

                         CREPSLEY
          Nothing. Let's go.

                         DARREN
          Something out there scares you.
          What is it?

                         CREPSLEY
          The thought of spending another
          minute with you.
          Crepsley turns and walks, but Darren's right.

                         CUT TO:

          INT. HAMBURGER JOINT - NIGHT

          The WAITRESS sets a juicy BURGER down across from Darren.
          Crepsley sits across from him.

                         CREPSLEY
          We still need to eat food, too. I
          just don't need it tonight.
          Darren just sits there. Silently as tears begin to run down
          his cheeks. Crepsley is exasperated.

                         CREPSLEY
          Now what?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          63.

                         DARREN
          The blood... I wanted it. I
          wanted to drink it.

                         CREPSLEY
          Of course you did! You're a
          Crepsley catches himself. He is not without some compassion.

                         CREPSLEY
          I'm sorry. It was wrong of me to
          blood you. You're too young. But
          it's done. Like the entire history
          of the world up to this moment.
          Darren quietly cries. Crepsley pulls two paper napkins from
          the dispenser, hands them to him.

                         DARREN
          Thank you.
          Darren turns to face the window as he wipes his eyes, nose.
          Then he sees it: parked across and down the street...
          A black 1966 Lincoln Continental.
          Darren looks back at Crepsley.

                         CREPSLEY

                         (RE: HAMBURGER)
          Eat. Let's not waste anymore food
          tonight.

                         DARREN
          The car...
          Crepsley follows the finger as Darren points.
          DING DING! The bell over the diner door rings...

          CLOSE ON DARREN
          As he looks back over his shoulder at the door.

                         DARREN'S POV
          MR. TINY comes through the front door pimpin'. Peter Lorre
          on steroids. Scary, done up like a Las Vegas high roller.

                         TABLE
          Darren knows trouble when he sees it. He looks back at
          Crepsley, but the vampire is gone! Vanished.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          64.

          MR. TINY

                         (STEPPING UP)
          Darren Shan, we meet at last.
          Darren just looks up at him. The guy is practically leaking
          nastiness no matter how avuncular he tries to be.

          MR. TINY
          You're quite a boy. Sacrificed
          everything to save a friend.

                         DARREN
          Where'd you hear that?

          MR. TINY
          A little bat told me.
          Mr. Tiny takes a french fry off Darren's plate, eats it.
          Darren looks around. Where the hell did Crepsley go at a
          time like this? Mr. Tiny knows what he's thinking.

          MR. TINY
          Oh, he's still here.

                         DARREN
          Who is?

          MR. TINY
          Crepsley. Trying to stay alive.
          It's so quiet around them Darren can hear a clock TICKING.
          It's a heart shaped POCKET WATCH Mr. Tiny holds on a chain.

          MR. TINY
          Would you like to see?

                         DARREN
          See what?
          The air seems to buzz as something 'passes'.

          MR. TINY
          Why the fight of course. Boys like
          to watch fights, don't they?
          Mr. Tiny hefts his watch. It almost seems to melt into his
          palm. As he pulls the winding knob out with a CLICK...
          As Darren and Mr. Tiny blink out, disappear from the booth...

                         CUT TO:

                         

                         

                         

                         

          65.

          INT. HAMBURGER JOINT - NIGHT (IN THE FLITTING WORLD)

          Darren and Mr. Tiny reappear in the booth, but the
          restaurant's patrons are slowed to near motionlessness.A
          battle royal going on. Crepsley fighting three VAMPANEZE.
          All three are sinewy, whipcords with blotchy purple skin.
          Crepsley stands surrounded in the middle of the restaurant.
          Whirling, hand fighting. Blocking their thrusts and blows.
          Darren moves to stand. Mr. Tiny pushes him back to his seat.
          Crepsley takes one down with a violent leg whip. He drives
          the second one back into the third knocking both back.
          A look to Darren and then he's back on LEG WHIP who's getting
          to his feet. Crepsley drives his flat hand forward, his
          nails tearing into the vampaneze's throat.
          As leg whip's hand instinctively goes to his throat to stem
          the blood, Crepsley grabs his free hand, sends him airborne.

          at full speed.
          Sinewy One pulls Crepsley's arm up behind his back. Crepsley
          HOWLING as we hear the bone BREAK.
          Mr. Tiny grabs Darren by the wrist, pulls him toward the
          door. Behind them...
          Crepsley drives the back of his head into Sinewy One's face
          at the same time as Sinewy Two swings in his open palm...
          Sinewy One releases Crepsley who disappears as Sinewy Two
          slices open Sinewy One's throat.

          Crepsley appears. Leg Whip hits the floor. Blood splashes
          the wall as Sinewy One appears, dropping to his knees.
          As Leg Whip stands, Crepsley charges, 'shoulders' him halfway
          through the wall. Patrons SCREAM, react, scatter.
          As Crepsley grabs a knife...

          Darren struggles as Mr. Tiny pulls him along. Behind,
          through the diner windows, WE SEE Patrons frozen in flight.
          Sinewy Two near frozen in fight with Crepsley who is in mid
          swing with the knife in his head.
          Mr. Tiny and Darren stop across from YOUNG MURLOUGH.
          Humanoid in shape, monstrous in visage. Bloated, his skin
          albino white with purplish mottling and red crisscrossing
          veins. He must weigh 300 pounds, but NFL nose tackle style.

                         MURLOUGH
          Smell the blood. The lovely blood.
          His eyes narrow at the sight of Crepsley, his mouth widening
          to show two rows of sharp filthy teeth.
          Darren needs to do something. He eyes the watch in Mr.
          Tiny's hand. He grabs it with his free hand, thumbs back in
          the winding knob. As Murlough disappears from view...
          The WINDOW EXPLODES as Sinewy Two hurtles out.
          Darren tosses the watch high in the air. Mr. Tiny releases
          him to move to catch it.
          Darren rushes back toward the restaurant.
          Mr. Tiny catches his watch.
          Crepsley meets Darren. Crepsley's broken arm hangs uselessly
          from his side.
          Murlough appears alongside. He grabs Crepsley by the throat,
          lifts him off the ground.
          Crepsley arcs the knife into Murlough's shoulder.
          Murlough staggers, lets go.

          Beyond the hamburger joint. The world beginning to streak
          past them. The asphalt begins to blur beneath their feet,
          passing cars like they were standing still. But Crepsley
          heaves for breath. In pain.
          Darren looks back over his shoulder...

                         DARREN'S POV
          Murlough follows. Closing ground.

          It's behind us!
          Crepsley bears down, the buildings streaking by. But...

                         MURLOUGH
          Closes regardless, relentless, death in his eyes.

                         CREPSLEY
          Almost out of gas. But looking ahead. Clocks in an instant:
          a RED LIGHT AHEAD. Cars STOPPED. A CAR FROZEN having just
          crossed the INTERSECTION. HEADLIGHTS from a blind corner.
          Crepsley slows. Just as Murlough's about to catch him from
          behind... Crepsley comes out of flit mode, disappears.
          As Murlough FADES after him.

          WHAM! The headlights Crepsley saw frozen, but coming from
          the blind corner, become a PICK-UP - broadsiding Murlough!
          He goes up over the hood, SMASHES against the windshield.
          As Darren and Murlough disappear again...

                         

                         

                         

                         

          68.
          The pick-up brakes. Murlough doesn't. He tumbles off the
          hood, sprawls hard into and skids along the street.
          A beat and he rolls to a sitting position, looks around. No
          Crepsley in sight. Blood runs out of one of his ears. As he
          wipes it, smearing it across his cheek...

                         PICK-UP DRIVER

                         (RUSHING OVER)
          Hey, man, are you okay?!
          He stops short when he sees Murlough's face. Murlough
          stands, SWATS the driver aside.
          The Lincoln screeches to a halt alongside him. Murlough
          climbs in. The Lincoln tearing away.

          sighs, settles down on the ground. Worn out.

          My arm's broken. But it should be
          fine in a day or two.

          INTERCUT THE FOLLOWING:
          Sunlight fills the kitchen. Darren sits, exhausted.

                         DARREN
          Who were they? Vampires?

                         CREPSLEY
          No. The one with the watch was Mr.
          Tiny. Very dangerous.

                         DARREN
          How dangerous can a man named Mr.
          Tiny be?

                         CREPSLEY
          Who said he was a man?

                         DARREN
          Then what is he?

                         CREPSLEY
          Mr. Tiny can't be explained. He
          needs to be experienced.

                         DARREN

                         (FRUSTRATED)
          And the purple guy. What was he?

                         CREPSLEY
          A vampaneze.

                         DARREN
          Yeah? Keep talking.

                         CREPSLEY
          Long ago humans were looked upon as
          animals by some vampires. Cattle
          to be slaughtered. Laws were
          passed to forbid needless killing.
          It made it easier to pass unnoticed
          among humans if we didn't murder
          them. Most vampires obeyed...

                         DARREN
          But some didn't?

                         CREPSLEY
          Seventy vampires broke away,
          declared themselves a separate
          race. The Vampaneze. Over time
          their appearance changed, their
          numbers grew. They believe it's
          wrong to feed from a human without
          killing it.

                         DARREN
          What? That's crazy.

                         CREPSLEY
          They believe those of us who feed
          in small amounts live like leeches.
          In shame. It led to war.
          Crepsley touches the scar on his face, remembers.

                         CREPSLEY
          The last one nearly destroyed us
          all. There's been a truce for many
          years now.

                         (A BEAT)
          Will you be alright while I sleep?
          Darren looks around at the dilapidated crap heap he's in. As
          he tries to hold his heart together...

                         DARREN
          Oh yeah... This is so much better
          than where I used to be...
          Crepsley hears the strain in his voice. Knows what's best
          for both of them..

                         CREPSLEY
          What do you think of rejoining the
          Cirque du Freak? Until you get on
          your vampire feet so to speak.

                         DARREN
          Half vampire.

                         CREPSLEY
          Yes, yes. Three-eighths if you
          want. What do you think?

          The Cirque is camped by an ABANDONED FACTORY. Neo-Gothic in

          on his jacket, shouts orders.

          MR. TALL
          Show time in twenty minutes.
          Someone tell Rhamus to get his
          stomachs in gear!
          He's surprised to see Crepsley and Darren walk up the road.
          Crepsley's arm seems much better now.

          MR. TALL
          Larten'Crepsley! As I live and
          breathe. I thought it would be
          years before I saw you again.
          Mr. Tall looks to Darren, throws a surprised look to
          Crepsley. Crepsley nods. 'Yes'.

          MR. TALL
          Darren Shan. You've come a long
          way since the last time I saw you.

                         DARREN
          I liked it better where I was.

          Do you still have my coffin?

          Of course. You're really back?

                         (CREPSLEY NODS)
          Perhaps you could do the show
          tonight? A few of us are absent or
          ill this evening.

                         CREPSLEY
          I'd be delighted.

          MR. TALL

          Evra, my industrious wonder. Here
          is Darren. Put him to work with
          you. Show him the snakey ropes.
          As the two boys consider each other...

          MR. TALL
          Off with you. Go!
          As the boys head off, Mr. Tall looks over at Crepsley.

          MR. TALL
          You blooded a child, Larten? What
          were you thinking?

          I don't matter. What will the
          vampire generals say when they hear
          about it?

                         CREPSLEY

          boy. I do a whole snake thing.
          Evra goes into a slithery snake walk for a few steps to
          illustrate. It's strange. Funny. Evra looks back over.

                         DARREN

          Pretty cool.

          Thanks. I'm not doing it tonight.
          My snake caught a cold.

                         EVRA
          Still gotta work the floor though.
          Ushers. We get the seats filled.
          They pass PEOPLE all hurriedly crossing the camp.

                         DARREN
          Who are they all?

                         EVRA
          The backbone of Cirque du Freak.
          They do the driving, the tent
          pitching, the potato peeling even.

                         DARREN
          How did they end up here?

                         EVRA
          Most wandered in. If Mr. Tall
          likes them, they stay.
          Darren's eye is caught by the WOLFMAN. He's being pushed
          toward the factory building by several of the blue-robed
          LITTLE PEOPLE. The wolfman's yellow eyes are on Darren as he
          rumbles a low, guttural growl.
          Darren is so taken that he almost walks into...
          Madam Truska. He stops short. In costume, beardless, even
          more beautiful than when we first saw her. She considers
          Darren, uses a finger to raise his chin. She shakes her
          head, smiles. As she continues...

          ominous. PATRONS take their seat around a stage. A buzz in
          the air.

                         DEBBIE & SAM
          About the same age as Darren and Evra, they're here for the
          show. Debbie is self-assured. Sam is sarcastic to cover his
          insecurities. Right now it's hard to find a seat.
          And here are Darren and Evra. Evra looking cool in his green
          sharkskin, Darren still wearing his burial suit.

                         EVRA
          Can we help you find a seat?

                         DEBBIE
          Are there any left?

                         EVRA
          Only the best seats in the house.
          He leads them a few steps over toward a column.

                         DEBBIE
          You guys are with the Cirque?
          Darren nods. Sam's a little sarcastic and skeptical.

                         SAM
          Cirque is French, right? Are you
          guys French?

                         EVRA
          Oui. Vous etes observateur. Nous
          sommes les serpents frangais.
          That slows Sam a beat. Evra points out a small platform
          eight feet up the column. You have to climb a natural re-bar
          ladder to get there. Sam looks dubious, but Debbie smiles.

                         DEBBIE
          Cool... I'm Debbie, this is Sam.

                         EVRA
          Evra Von.
          She looks at Darren, waiting.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          75.

                         DARREN
          Oh, I'm Darren.

                         DEBBIE
          Is the show great? Say yes. We
          had to sneak out to see it.

                         DARREN
          I snuck out to see it once, too.
          And I'm still here.
          An odd, almost spooky moment. Is he serious?

                         SAM
          Good one, Darren. Hey. Debbie and
          Darren. Like Bonnie and Clyde.
          And their friend Evra Von what?
          That breaks the moment. Debbie starts climbing the re-bar.
          Sam looks Darren over a beat, picks a thread off his lapel.

                         SAM
          Dude, it looks like the kind of
          suit you'd wear to a funeral.

                         DARREN
          You have no idea...
          Evra smiles, sticks out his tongue. Pointy, narrow, Evra
          sends it up his own nostril. Sam tries to smile, then starts
          up after Debbie. Freaked out. As Darren and Evra laugh...

                         CUT TO:

          INT. THE STAGE - NIGHT

          Mr. Tall under a spotlight. Back in his red hat and gloves.

          MR. TALL
          Welcome to the Cirque du Freak. We
          are an ancient circus. Bringing
          the remarkable to generations...

                         BACK ROW
          Darren and Evra watch from the back, whisper to each other.

                         DARREN
          How long have you known Mr. Tall?

                         EVRA
          Five years.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          76.

                         DARREN
          How do you meet someone like him?

                         EVRA
          I was raised in a circus, but not a
          nice one like this. The owner used
          to beat me and keep me in a glass
          cage. I felt like a useless freak.
          One night I looked out of my cage
          and saw Mr. Tall just standing
          there. He watched me until the
          owner came over and asked if he
          could help him. Mr. Tall grabbed
          him by the throat and strangled him
          to death. Then he opened the cage
          and said, "Let's go, Evra." He
          named me that. I added the Von.
          I've been with him ever since.
          Darren looks back at Mr. Tall with a new set of eyes.

                         CREPSLEY'S VOICE
          Darren...
          Darren turns. Crepsley's back there in the shadows.

                         CREPSLEY
          How do you feel about show
          business?

                         CUT TO:

          INT. THE STAGE - NIGHT

          The audience reacts as Crepsley 'appears' on the empty stage.

                         CREPSLEY
          To be poisoned by a spider may be
          my fate.
          It's Darren's cue. Looking appropriate in his burial suit,
          he walks out carrying Madam Octa's cage at arm's length.

                         DEBBIE & SAM
          As she realizes it's Darren. Cool.

                         STAGE
          Darren sees Debbie who gives a little wave. As he smiles...

                         CREPSLEY
          Look glum... Miserable...

                         

                         

                         

                         

          77.
          Darren loses the grin. Crepsley opens the cage. Madam Octa
          steps to the opening. Crespley raises the flute, plays.
          Madam Octa walks out and up to Darren's shoulder where she
          attaches a web thread. The audience react as she leaps to
          Crepsley's shoulder and attaches the other end. She dances
          across to the music, spinning a web as she goes.
          Darren looks out, sees how much Debbie enjoys it.

                         CUT TO:

          EXT. THE MOON - NIGHT

          Set against the black sky. Sparks rise up, their source
          unknown. All very mysterious until... LAUGHTER. Lots of
          it. Borderline raucous. We follow the sparks DOWN to...

                         A BONFIRE
          Blazing in the Cirque campgrounds. The freaks are eating,
          drinking wine, relaxing after the show. Like a gypsy camp.
          Mr. Tall sits with his long legs up on a box, really enjoying
          watching everyone else enjoy themselves.
          Evra munches on a sausage he grills on the end of a stick.
          Darren is all ears and eyes. He likes these people. And
          he's certainly never experienced anything like this.
          Someone starts to play a guitar, someone else beats a drum.
          Madam Truska starts to dance, the fire flickering against her
          as are all eyes. Then she reaches out, takes Crepsley by the
          hand. A few moments later, the two of them are engaged in a
          mad TANGO. It takes the camp's collective breath away.
          Even Darren can't help but enjoy it. Crepsley's arm gives
          him a twinge or two, but only Truska notices.

                         CUT TO:

          EXT. AN OLD VAN - NIGHT

          A mattress on the floor inside. Using tape and cardboard,
          Darren 'blacks out' the windows. Crepsley steps over.

                         DARREN
          Almost done.
          Crepsley looks to the sky. Still dark. The moon setting.

                         CREPSLEY
          Darren...
          (Darren looks over)

                         (MORE)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          78.

                         CREPSLEY (CONT'D)
          I'm not going to sleep here. We'll
          find a nook in the factory.
          Crepsley starts off. Darren starts to follow.

                         CRESPLEY
          Mattress.
          Darren sighs, goes back to the van to retrieve the mattress.
          He starts to pull it out, then stops, nearly doubled over.
          Concerned, Crepsley steps over. Darren waves him off,
          straightens as whatever it was passes.

                         DARREN
          I just felt sick for a second.

                         CREPSLEY
          You need blood.
          Darren gives him a dirty look, grabs the mattress. They
          start walking toward the factory.

                         CUT TO:

          EXT. FACTORY - NIGHT

          The SHADOWS of a loading dock. Crepsley and Darren approach.

                         DARREN
          You think Mr. Tiny might come?
          Crepsley shrugs, doesn't answer.

                         DARREN
          Who is he? What does he want?

                         CREPSLEY
          What we want is who we are, don't
          you think?

                         DARREN
          Can't you give me a straight answer
          just once?!

                         CREPSLEY
          You won't learn by me telling you.
          You must live some things to know
          what they are.
          Darren sighs in deep frustration. Crepsley has a thought.

                         CREPSLEY
          Okay. Why do you like spiders?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          79.
          Darren tires to figure what he's getting at? Implying?

                         CREPSLEY
          Did you ever think there was a
          particular reason?
          It seems Crepsley knows the answer even if Darren doesn't.

                         DARREN
          No. I never thought about it.

                         CREPSLEY
          That's the trouble with children.
          They don't think about things.

                         DARREN
          I'm not a child.
          Theystop by the shadows.

                         CREPSLEY
          Are you a man? If you're not a
          man, you're a child.

                         DARREN
          I'm in between.

                         CREPSLEY
          In between does not exist!
          The words echo a moment. Darren no closer to understanding.

                         CREPSLEY
          I'll sleep in here tonight. But
          sit outside the van tomorrow and
          make it look like I'm there. It's
          just caution. Old habits die hard.

                         VOICE
          And old vampires?
          Without a sound, someone has reached around the two of them
          from behind, a RAZOR-KNIFE held to each of their throats.
          They stand dead still. We can make out the shape of a head
          as whoever it is leans in ever so slightly from the dark.

                         CREPSLEY
          Gavner Purl, as always I heard you
          coming from a mile away.
          CLICK! In his hand by his side, Mr. Crepsley holds a thin
          SWITCHBLADE. He presses the steel back ever so slightly.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          80.

                         VOICE
          We'll call it a draw then.
          The 'voice' pulls back his knives, steps out. It's GAVNER
          PURL. He was once handsome, but those days are long gone.
          His face is crossed with scars. They vary in size, thickness
          and color. Gavner is a warrior, carries himself so.

                         GAVNER PURL
          It's been too long, Larten.

                         CREPSLEY
          Decades now.
          They embrace. Darren's trying to catch up.

                         DARREN
          You guys are friends?

                         GAVNER PURL
          I suppose. We once shared a coffin
          together. For six months.

                         DARREN

                         (SARCASTIC)
          Like roommates? To save money?

                         GAVNER PURL
          We were being hunted.

                         DARREN
          Who was hunting you?

                         CREPSLEY
          Never mind. Darren, Gavner Purl.
          Gavner extends his hand to shake. Darren sees'the scars on
          Gavner Purl's fingertips. Darren raises his own hand so
          Gavner can see his scars. Gavner looks at Crepsley.

                         GAVNER PURL
          A half-vampire?

                         CREPSLEY
          Of course. We don't make full
          vampires of our assistants.
          Gavner Purl looks at Crepsley, stunned.

                         GAVNER PURL
          Nor do we make assistants of
          children.

          GAVNER PURL (cont'd)

                         (LOSING IT)
          A child, Larten? Why?!

                         CREPSLEY
          I have my reasons.

                         GAVNER PURL
          And they are?

                         CREPSLEY
          I don't owe answers to vampires
          anymore. I'm exiled from our kind

                         GAVNER PURL
          Self-exiled. And I at least am
          owed an answer.
          There's a personal history being called upon here. Crepsley
          is well aware. Darren again is left out.

                         CREPSLEY
          All I care to say is a boy sought
          me out, knew who I was. He asked
          me to make him my assistant.
          Gavner looks to Darren, suspicious.

                         GAVNER PURL
          And how did you know --

                         CREPSLEY

                         (INTERRUPTS)
          It wasn't Darren. Another boy.
          His blood was bad. I should have
          killed him, but I didn't.
          Darren reacts. Gavner considers it all.

                         CREPSLEY
          I met Darren shortly after. His
          blood was good or I certainly would
          have killed him.
          Darren reacts again.

                         GAVNER PURL
          How could a boy find you?
          Crepsley shrugs. Of course he had help.

                         GAVNER PURL
          Tiny?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          82.

                         DARREN
          He tried to kill us.

                         CREPSLEY
          He tried to kill me. What he
          wanted with you wasn't determined.

                         GAVNER PURL
          Perhaps you chose the wrong boy.
          In Mr. Tiny's eyes.
          A moment as they consider the unspoken implications.

                         DARREN
          What are you guys talking about!?
          No answer as Crepsley and Gavner lock each other in a look.

                         CREPSLEY
          What's important enough to track
          down an exile? What is your news?

                         GAVNER PURL
          War.

                         CREPSLEY
          I'm not interested in your wars.

                         GAVNER PURL
          Well the other side is interested
          or they wouldn't be trying to get
          rid of you.
          Crepsley gets suddenly very angry.

                         CREPSLEY
          I've had enough killing! No more!
          You've come to the wrong place. I
          am the wrong place...
          Gavner raises his hands in surrender.

                         GAVNER PURL
          Even so, I'm glad you're alive.

                         CREPSLEY

                         (RELENTING)
          The sun is coming. Will you stay?

                         GAVNER PURL
          I can still make miles. The war
          won't wait. And neither will bad
          news. I have to go.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          83.

                         CREPSLEY
          Then travel safely.

                         GAVNER PURL
          Would you mind if I walk a bit with
          your assistant?

                         CREPSLEY
          Take him with you if you want.
          He's of little use to me.

                         CUT TO:

          EXT. FIELD - NOT FAR OFF - NIGHT

          Darren and Gavner Purl walk. Gavner looks him over.

                         GAVNER PURL
          You look sick. Doesn't Larten feed
          you?

                         DARREN
          I won't drink blood if that's what
          you mean. I promised myself.

                         GAVNER PURL
          Why?

                         DARREN
          You'll get insulted.
          As Gavner waits for Darren to tell him...

                         DARREN
          I'm afraid if I drink blood, I'll
          become evil.
          Gavner LAUGHS out loud, catches himself.

                         GAVNER PURL
          The only thing drinking blood will
          do to you is keep you alive.

                         DARREN
          That's how it would start. I would
          swear it was just to stay alive.
          But what'll I turn into? You're on
          one side of the fence or the other.
          My father used to say that and now
          I know what he meant.
          The 'father part' chokes Darren up a bit.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          84.

                         GAVNER PURL
          You've already turned, Darren. You
          need to accept what you've already
          become. There's no going back.
          They walk in silence a moment. Then:

                         DARREN
          Why did Crepsley make himself an
          exile anyhow?

                         GAVNER PURL
          He was tired of all the killing.
          We were at war.

                         DARREN
          With the vampaneze?

                         GAVNER PURL
          Crepsley was once a Vampire
          General. One of our great leaders.
          He may seem reluctant, but I assure
          you, no one is as skilled at
          killing vampaneze than Crepsley is.
          I think that's why they'd like to
          get him out of the way. Kill him
          off before the new war starts.

                         DARREN
          You've known him a long time?

                         GAVNER PURL
          I was his assistant. He blooded
          me, as he blooded you.
          There's almost something comforting in this news. Gavner
          Purl so proud and strong looking. Darren wants to know...

                         DARREN
          Why'd he choose you?

                         GAVNER PURL
          To teach me to kill vampaneze. Up
          until now, it's the only reason he
          ever chooses anyone.

                         DARREN
          Is it why he chose me?
          Gavner hesitates, not sure.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          85.

                         GAVNER PURL
          That's for Crepsley to say. Not
          me.
          Another brick wall, but Darren accepts it.

                         GAVNER PURL
          Do you know what the biggest danger
          is to a vampire, Darren?

                         DARREN
          The vampaneze? Mr. Tiny?

                         GAVNER PURL
          No. It's that they live so long
          they no longer care. Everything
          they love is left behind until they
          finally have nothing left to live
          for. Except death. The fact that
          he's taken an apprentice seems, to
          me, a good sign. A sign that he's
          thinking of living not dying.

                         DARREN
          Lucky for me. Glad I could help.
          All the same Darren considers what he's heard. Gavner,
          meanwhile, considers the open countryside ahead.

                         GAVNER PURL
          A clear run. Good.
          Gavner gives Darren one last appraising look.

                         GAVNER PURL
          Stay by him, Darren. Stay by him.
          Gavner takes a deep breath. The air around him shimmers, his
          image bouncing in and out of phase like an electron heating
          up. And then he's gone.

                         DARREN
          That part is definitely cool.

                         CUT TO:

          EXT. THE SUN - DAY

          High in the noon sky. PAN DOWN to where Darren stands under
          a tree by the old van. He concentrates, looks himself over.
          Nothing. He concentrates again. He's trying to flit.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          86.
          Very briefly -- the air shimmers around him -- then stops.
          He looks at his arms. Little WISPS of smoke come off them.

                         EVRA

                         (ARRIVING)
          What's up?

                         DARREN
          Nothing.

                         EVRA

                         (SNIFFS AIR)
          It's smells like burnt hair.

                         DARREN
          Don't know. I'm congested.

                         (SEES SOMETHING)
          Hey...
          Evra follows his gaze, turns just in time to see:

                         THEIR POV
          Debbie and Sam ducking inside the factory.

                         DARREN & EVRA
          Exchange a look. Start after them.

                         CUT TO:

          INT. FACTORY FLOOR - DAY

          Where the show was the night before. Light streams down from
          gaps in the decrepit roof. No sight of Debbie and Sam as
          Darren and Evra make their way in.- They pause at a CREAKING
          coming from somewhere overhead. As they move...

                         CUT TO:

          INT. UPPER FLOOR - FACTORY - DAY

          Darren and Evra come off a rickety staircase, pass through a
          half-rotted door. There are holes in the roof overhead and
          huge gaps on the floor where the boards have fallen through.
          They see Sam, his back to them, staring out a smashed window.

                         EVRA
          Let's scare the crap out of him...
          They begin to creep in, flanking the unsuspecting Sam. But
          as they get close, a SHAPE drops down behind them!

                         

                         

                         

                         

          87.

                         SHAPE

          ARRRGGGH!
          Darren and Evra are the ones who jump. The shape is Debbie!
          She almost falls over laughing. So does Sam.

                         DEBBIE
          You should see the look on your
          faces.
          But Evra and Darren are not laughing.

                         EVRA
          What're you doing here?

                         DEBBIE
          We could ask you the same thing.
          We come here all the time. My
          grandfather used to work here.

                         DARREN
          Must've been a long time ago.

                         DEBBIE
          He says now it's like one of those
          bombed out World War II cathedrals.
          Empty of what is used to be.
          An odd little moment till Sam breaks it.

                         SAM
          Hey, we loved the show, man. It
          was off the hook.

                         EVRA
          (messing with him)
          Off the hook, huh? I'll tell all
          the freaks you said so.

                         SAM
          Are you guys on your own? Just
          traveling. No parents or nothing?

                         DARREN
          No. No parents.
          He says it with a little twinge that Debbie picks up on.

                         SAM
          School?

                         EVRA
          No school either.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          88.

                         SAM
          You're the luckiest guys on earth.
          Wanna switch places?

                         DARREN
          You have to be different to be
          here.

                         DEBBIE
          Different how?
          Evra steps into a slash of sunlight and his skin flashes to
          life, the green of his scales catching the rays. Debbie's
          mouth drops. They couldn't see it in the dark last night.

                         EVRA
          Everyone has a place they belong.
          The Cirque du Freak is ours.

                         DEBBIE
          I think your skin is beautiful.
          That wins Evra over.

                         DEBBIE
          Can I touch it?
          Evra holds out his arm. Debbie traces a finger across it.

                         DEBBIE
          Wow. Has it always been this way?

                         DARREN
          He's a snake-boy.

                         DEBBIE
          You shouldn't call him names
          because he looks different.

                         EVRA
          It's okay. I am a snake boy.

                         SAM
          You could say you're
          dermatologically challenged.
          They all LAUGH. Debbie considers Evra a beat, then Darren.

                         DEBBIE
          What about you, Darren? How are
          you different?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          89.

                         DARREN
          I get scared easy.
          Darren looks up toward the rafters. From where she dropped.

                         DARREN
          How'd you get up there anyhow?

                         DEBBIE
          You mean, how did a girl get up
          there?

                         CUT TO:

          EXT. FACTORY ROOF - DAY

          A spot where the roofing is gone, several long RAFTERS
          stretch out. Darren, Evra and Sam watch Debbie walk out on
          one. Like a balance beam. The factory floor 70 feet below.

                         EVRA
          Hey, be careful.

                         SAM
          Don't worry. She's like a gymnast.
          Debbie moves slowly at first, her arms stretched out for
          balance. Then she does a hop, a skip. Darren and Evra gasp.
          She gets to the other side, turns and bows.

                         DARREN
          You're crazy!

                         DEBBIE
          How about you?

                         DARREN
          I got nothing to prove.

                         DEBBIE
          But it'd be easier for you than me.

                         DARREN
          Why's that?

                         DEBBIE
          Because chickens have wings.
          She starts chicken CLUCKING. Mad, Darren steps onto a
          rafter, starts across. He stops in the middle, spins around.
          Aided immeasurably by his half-vampire skills.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          90.
          Debbie is impressed.

                         ANGLE OVERHEAD
          The vertigo angle as Debbie walks back out on her rafter.
          Stops about 4-feet across from Darren.

                         DARREN & DEBBIE
          Darren crosses his arms across his chest. No big deal.

                         DEBBIE
          Let's play mirrors.

                         DARREN
          What's that?

                         DEBBIE
          I do something and you have to copy
          me. Like this.
          Debbie crosses her arms the same way Darren has. He
          uncrosses them as he realizes.
          Debbie reaches down, touches her toes. Darren sighs, then
          does the same, gets a good look at the floor below.
          Debbie takes one foot off the rafter, takes hold of the top
          of it with one hand, raising the other arm out for balance.
          Looks like a ballerina.
          Evra doesn't like this daredevil stuff.

                         EVRA
          Come on, guys...
          Darren hesitates. Not because he won't do it, but because
          maybe for the first time in his life, he's really fascinated
          by a girl. Debbie misreads, starts CLUCKING again.
          Darren smiles, repeats her move effortlessly.
          Without warning, Debbie leaps the gap, lands on the rafter
          alongside Darren. As she struggles a bit for balance, Darren
          reaches out and steadies her. As they come face to face.

                         DEBBIE
          There definitely something
          different about you. I just can't
          figure it out.

                         DARREN
          Is Sam your boyfriend?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          91.

                         DEBBIE
          He's my cousin.

                         DARREN
          Oh...
          A funny, awkward beat out on the rafter. Finally...

                         DARREN
          We should get off this.
          She nods, a bit smitten. Darren turns. As they start off...

                         DARREN
          Chalk it up to lack of blood, but everything starts spinning.

                         DARREN'S POV
          The area is like a big drain and he's whirling down it.

                         RAFTER
          Darren legs go out and he falls off. As Debbie screams...
          Darren CATCHES HOLD of the rafter just as he drops past it.

                         DEBBIE
          Hold on.
          Debbie grabs his arm. Evra starts out to help, but the
          rafter CREAKS OMINOUSLY. He stops. Sam states the obvious.

                         SAM
          I don't think it'll hold you, dude.

                         EVRA
          Thanks for the heads up... Bro.

                         DARREN
          (shakes it off)
          It's okay. I'm okay.
          Darren swings up a leg, hooks it over the rafter. A beat and
          he's back on top. Debbie relieved. Evra backs up the way he
          came and in a few seconds they're all safely off the rafter.

                         DEBBIE
          I don't know how you hung on. I
          couldn't have.

                         DARREN
          You wouldn't have fallen in the
          first place... I just got dizzy.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          92.

                         DEBBIE
          Maybe you need to eat something.
          Darren looks at her. She has no idea.

                         EVRA
          Well, the food's down on ground
          level. Let's get out of here.
          Sam and Debbie start off, Darren and Evra following. As Sam
          and Debbie start down a ladder, Darren hangs back a beat.

                         DARREN
          She's kind'of cool, huh? I mean,
          for a girl.

                         EVRA
          I like her. She asks a lot of
          questions though.

                         DARREN
          She's just curious.

                         EVRA
          There's no such thing as 'just'
          with a girl.

                         DARREN
          What makes you such an expert?

                         EVRA
          My snake's a girl.

                         CUT TO:

          EXT. FACTORY - SUNSET

          The sun peeps below the horizon.

                         CUT TO:

          INT. FACTORY PASSAGE - NIGHT

          Darren walks along, flashlight in hand. Going somewhere. He
          suddenly stops, listens, not sure if he heard something. A
          following FOOTSTEP?
          MOVE WITH Darren as he continues. As he passes through a
          doorway, he ducks around the corner. Waits a few beats.
          Then he leaps out to see who's following. No one's there.
          Shaking his head, he continues on.

                         CUT TO:

                         

                         

                         

                         

          93.

          INT. BOILER ROOM - FACTORY - NIGHT

          Darren knocks on a door, waits a beat before it opens and
          Crepsley emerges from his sleeping place.

                         CREPSLEY
          Good morning, Darren.

                         DARREN
          What's good about it?
          Crepsley looks him over, doesn't like what he sees.

                         CUT TO:

          EXT. CIRQUE CAMP - NIGHT

          Bustling with activity. Nearly show time. Crepsley stands
          by an open tent flap watching Darren cross camp. Not well.

                         DARREN
          He stops as Sam and Debbie catch up with him.

                         SAM DEBBIE
          Hey, Darren. Hi...
          Darren's happy to see them.

                         DARREN
          You guys are coming to the show
          again tonight?

                         DEBBIE
          Of course. Evra's doing his snake
          act tonight.

                         DARREN
          Oh, you came to see Evra.

                         DEBBIE
          And you...
          Darren smiles shyly at that.

                         SAM
          I was hoping for Amanda Bynes.
          Darren sees Crepsley watching him from the tent.

                         DARREN
          Hey, I'll catch up with you later.
          I got some stuff I gotta finish up.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          94.
          They watch as Darren heads off.

                         SAM
          He's gonna be gone in another day
          or two. Tonight's the last show.

                         DEBBIE
          I know that. So?

                         SAM
          So stop looking at him like you
          love him.

                         DEBBIE
          You're such an idiot, Sam.

                         TENT OPENING
          Darren joins Crepsley, a little unsteady.

                         CREPSLEY
          Look at you. You can barely stand.

                         DARREN
          I'm fine.

                         CREPSLEY
          You need to feed. You need blood..

                         DARREN
          No! I won't let you hunt some poor
          person down for me. I --
          Crepsley grabs hold of Darren, hauls him into...

                         THE TENT
          Dark, the inside walls richly embroidered. Medieval.

                         CREPSLEY
          No need to hunt. There's someone
          here willing to save you.
          From the shadows: Madam Truska. Startlingly beautiful. She
          steps up. Eyes on Darren, she offers Crepsley her wrist.

                         MADAM TRUSKA
          By my own free will, Darren Shan.
          As Crepsley's fingernail hovers, ready to open a vein.
          Darren shakes his head. 'No'.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          95.

                         CREPSLEY
          Drink or you'll die.

                         DARREN
          No. I can't. I'm human.
          Crepsley releases Truska's arm.

                         CREPSLEY
          You're not! And you'll be nothing!
          Darren stands there as noble and sad as a boy could be.

                         DARREN
          I am human. In my heart I am.
          A great big TEAR rolls down Truska's cheek. That's the last
          thing Crepsley needed to see. He's defeated.

                         CUT TO:

          INT. FACTORY SPACE - NIGHT

          People in their seats or taking them. Darren is back in his
          role as usher. He seats two people, wipes at the sweat
          beading on his forehead. He's getting sicker.
          He sees Debbie. She and Sam are already seated across the
          way. She smiles, waves. Darren forces a smile,, waves back.
          Looking for more patrons, Darren nearly walks into... A
          FIGURE. A hat pulled down obscures his face.

                         VOICE
          An usher in the house of usher.
          And I can't seem to find a seat.
          Darren frowns at the odd voice, but leads down the aisle.

                         DARREN
          This way.
          Darren brings him down to a handful of seats. The figure
          looks up from under the brim of his hat. It's Mr. Tiny.

          MR. TINY
          Join me.

                         DARREN
          I don't think so.
          As Darren moves to go, Mr. Tiny clamps a hand around his
          wrist. Like iron. He sits, pulling Darren down beside him.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          96.

          MR. TINY
          It's time we had a few moments.
          Folks involved in epic struggles
          should get to know each other.
          Darren doesn't answer.

          MR. TINY
          Has Crepsley told you about me?
          Explained me?

                         DARREN
          He said you can't be explained.
          You need to be experienced.

          MR. TINY
          He gives me too much credit.

                         DEBBIE
          Hey, Darren.
          Darren looks up to see Debbie and Sam. Oh no...

                         DEBBIE
          We're gonna sit on this side.

                         SAM
          Cuz we miss you so much.
          She digs Sam with her elbow. They sit just a row in front.

          MR. TINY

                         (WHISPERS)
          Choosing sides can only lead to
          trouble. Never, ever choose sides
          unless it's your own.

                         DARREN
          You've chosen the vampaneze.
          Mr. Tiny laughs, slaps his knee even.

          MR. TINY
          Is that really what you think? A
          smart boy like you?
          And the lights drop. A trumpet blasts and all is silent.

          ON THE STAGE
          The little people wheel out a CAGE. There's a gurgled GROWL.
          The little people retreat. Several audience members lean in,
          then SCREAM as the wolfman CRASHES to the front of the cage.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          97.
          A white spot shines down on Mr. Tall.

          MR. TALL
          Ladies and Gentlemen...

          DARREN & MR. TINY

          MR. TINY
          .subjugators and saps...

          MR. TALL
          Welcome to the Cirque du Freak. We
          are an ancient circus...
          As Mr. Tall drones on...

          MR. TINY
          Oh, his speeches are impossible.
          Mr. Tiny opens his free hand. His pocket watch melts up into
          view from his palm. Time begins to speed up around them.
          Mr. Tall's voice speeds to a BUZZ as he 'keystone cops' off
          the stage and Rhamus 'keystones' on. The audience's small
          movements become rattles and shakes.
          Only Darren and Mr. Tiny are at normal speed.

          MR. TINY
          I'm not so complicated, Darren.
          During war there are those who
          profit. A war between vampires and
          vampaneze would have terrible
          consequences. Therefore...

                         DARREN
          Terrible profits.

          MR. TINY
          Excellent. I am a profiteer. I
          exact fees and gains. I'm simple.
          On stage, Madam Truska exits and Evra 'keystones' through his
          performance with his snake.

          MR. TINY
          Did Crepsley tell you of the
          prophesy?

                         DARREN
          What prophesy?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          98.

          MR. TINY
          They say the final battle between
          vampires and vampaneze will be
          decided by a child. That's why the
          vampires won't blood children. To
          avoid the end of the world.
          As these words are pondered by Darren...

          MR. TINY
          I think I underestimated you. I
          think you could be wonderful.

                         DARREN
          I think you're a creep. I think
          you suck.

          MR. TINY
          Too bad.
          Mr. Tiny closes his hand around the watch. Time returns to
          normal. The applause for Evra slowing down to normal speed.
          As he walks off the stage, Debbie looks back at Darren.

                         DEBBIE
          He was great!
          As she looks back to the stage someone sits on Darren's other
          side. Collar pulled up, head wrapped in a scarf. Murlough!

                         MURLOUGH
          (low; re: Debbie)
          Is it Dar-wren's girlfriend?

                         DARREN
          Forget about her --
          Murlough takes hold of Darren's other wrist. Still low:

                         MURLOUGH
          She has plenty of lovely blood
          inside. Inside, outside, hmmm?
          Darren struggles. Murlough pulls him close, HISSES in his
          ear, flashing those filthy teeth.

                         MURLOUGH
          I don't care about humans. I don't
          care about you. But the vampire -
          Larten Crepsley - him I care about.

                         (ALMOST SHY)
          Murlough is a vampire killer.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          99.
          On stage: the spotlight hits Crepsley.

                         DARREN
          You guys are in trouble. There's
          more than one vampire now. Gavner
          Purl is here.
          Murlough reacts to the name. Does not like it.

                         MURLOUGH
          Have you seen Purl Gavner's face?
          Young Murlough sliced it for him.

          MR. TINY
          Darren, you're a liar. He's a
          thousand miles gone by now. And
          master Crepsley is right there.
          As he points at Crepsley...

                         CREPSLEY
          Holding Madam Octa's cage. Aware something's 'in the air'.

                         MURLOUGH
          Shimmers, phases into flit mode. Disappears.

                         DARREN
          Crepsley! Look out!
          The audience LAUGHS. Like Darren's worried about Madam Octa.
          Debbie looks back, knows something is wrong. Sees Mr. Tiny's
          hand around Darren's wrist.

                         STAGE
          As Murlough 'appears' alongside Crepsley.
          Madam Octa's cage drops to the stage as Murlough knocks
          Crepsley fifteen feet through the air. He lands flat on his
          back. The audience CHEER! Think it's part of the show.
          Murlough reaches into his jacket, produces a razor-sharp LONG
          KNIFE in either hand.
          Crepsley pops to his feet. As his own single BLADE
          'switches' to life in his hand...

          DARREN & MR. TINY
          As Darren struggles, Mr. Tiny switches his grip to the back
          of the boy's neck. That holds him.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          100.

                         STAGE
          CHEERS as Murlough charges forward, the long knives
          pinwheeling in his hands. His attack is brutal and blunt.
          Crepsley is driven back, parrying each thrust and attack as
          it comes. Sparks fly as the blades connect.
          From out of nowhere, Crepsley adds a BACKHAND to the mix. It
          catches Murlough hard across the chops.

                         OFF STAGE
          Mr. Tall and Evra watch. Not knowing what to do.

                         STAGE
          Murlough swings back wildly. Crepsley catches the blade in
          Murlough's left hand with the one in his right.
          Crepsley catches Murlough's left wrist, the second blade
          dangerously close to retracing the scar on Crepsley's face.
          Crepsley throws himself back, sending Murlough head over
          heels across the stage and SLAMMING into a concrete wall.

                         DARREN
          Concentrating. Trying to flit.

                         STAGE
          Murlough rolls to his feet, charges. It's brute force versus
          style. But as Crepsley moves to sidestep, Murlough's not so
          brutish after all. He matches the move --
          Buries one of his knives into Crepsley's stomach. Crepsley
          reacts, frozen in shock.

          DARREN & MR. TINY
          The audience around them unsure. Many shocked. It's part of
          the show, right? Darren sees Murlough raise the other knife
          to finish Crepsley off. Darren trembling, phasing.
          And Mr. Tiny's holding nothing but air. Darren is gone.

          DARREN (FLIT WORLD)
          Speeding down to the stage. The dagger descends in slo-
          motion, but it's only a centimeter or two from it's target.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          101.

                         STAGE
          Darren reappears, leaps onto Murlough's back, knocks him off
          target. As Murlough staggers right, Crepsley staggers left.
          Murlough regroups, charges after him. Badly hurt, stumbling,
          Crepsley falls off the edge of the stage. Disappears.
          ROARING, Murlough grabs Darren. They disappear as well.

          MR. TINY
          Sighs. This is not how it's supposed to go. Sam and Debbie
          leave their seats, head for the stage.

                         CUT TO:

          INT. FACTORY - NIGHT (FLIT WORLD)

          Murlough with Darren in tow, looking high and low for
          Crepsley. Moving past the barely moving Mr. Tall and Evra.

          CREPSLEY (FLIT WORLD)
          His back to a wall. Trying to hold it together. Frozen
          PATRONS facing the exit beyond. As he'loses his flit power,
          the patrons suddenly resume real speed for the exits.

                         CUT TO:

          INT. BOILER ROOM - NIGHT

          The old power plant. Pipes and catwalks. Murlough and
          Darren here. A chain hangs from the ceiling. Murlough lifts
          Darren, wraps it around his ankle. Hangs Darren upside down!

                         MURLOUGH

          CREPSLEY!

                         CUT TO:

                         CREPSLEY
          Reacting to Murlough's voice.

                         CUT TO:

          BOILER ROOM - FACTORY
          Murlough twists Darren's arm. Darren SCREAMS out in pain.

                         CUT TO:

                         EVRA
          Reacting as Debbie and Sam arrive. They move toward it.

                         CUT TO:

                         CREPSLEY
          Listening as the scream fades off. Clutching his stomach,
          Crepsley moves.

                         CUT TO:

          BOILER ROOM - FACTORY
          Murlough pulls Darren a little higher. They're face-to-face,
          though Darren is upsidedown.

                         MURLOUGH
          Crepsley will come for his
          assistant.

                         DARREN
          He doesn't care about me.

                         MURLOUGH
          Murlough has an assistant, too. A
          smart one, smarter than you.
          As Murlough says this, Darren looks past as stepping up,
          grinning, is Murlough's assistant.

                         DARREN
          Steve?
          Steve! Steve holds up his hands so Darren can see the WHITE
          SCAR on the tip of each finger. He gets closer.

                         STEVE
          Mr. Tiny made my dream come true.
          Only better. I'm half vampaneze
          instead of a stupid half vampire.
          Mr. Tiny says I have a destiny. He
          says he's gonna make sure of it.

                         DARREN
          Is that who you talked to? Was
          that the internet guy? Mr. Tiny?

                         STEVE

                         (LAUGHS)
          Pretty funny, huh? He introduced
          himself after you left town.

                         (MORE)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          103.

                         STEVE (CONT'D)
          But, I think I've known him a long
          time in my head. In my bad, bad
          blood.
          Chilling. Maybe Steve is evil. He leans in even closer.

                         STEVE
          He gave me back the dream you
          stole.
          Murlough motions Steve quiet, slaps a hand over Darren's
          mouth. Listens. Smiles. Whispers.

                         MURLOUGH
          Crepsley comes.

                         CUT TO:

          INT. APPROACH PASSAGE - FACTORY - NIGHT

          Crepsley moving forward. Hurting. He slows, stops. As he
          looks back over his shoulder. Something's behind him.

          EVRA, DEBBIE & SAM
          Freeze as Crepsley looks back in the direction from which
          they follow. From their POV, Crepsley suddenly disappears.

                         SAM
          Where'd he go?
          They jump as Crepsley appears right in front of them.

                         CREPSLEY
          Evra... Get them out of here.

                         EVRA

                         BUT --
          Evra knows it's useless. As he nods, Crepsley turns and
          strides back toward where he had been.
          Sam and Debbie exchange a look. What the Hell?

                         EVRA
          You guys better go back.

                         SAM
          What are you gonna do?

                         EVRA
          Darren's my friend.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          104.

                         DEBBIE
          Ours too.
          Sam's not so sure, but he nods in agreement.

                         CUT TO:

          INT. BOILER ROOM - FACTORY - NIGHT

          Darren swings back and forth in long strokes like a pendulum,
          a rag stuffed in his mouth to silence him.

                         DARREN'S POV
          Sweeping the room. Wait! It fixes on a doorway. There's
          Crepsley. Looking about, everywhere but at Darren.

                         BOILER ROOM
          Crepsley speaks to 'the room'.

                         CREPSLEY
          I can smell it. Why does it hide?

                         (STEPPING UP)
          The vampire is here.
          WHUMP! Murlough drops from above. Lands ten feet in front
          of Crepsley. As they begin to arc around each other.

                         MURLOUGH
          The vampire will die.

                         STEVE'S VOICE

                         (FROM ABOVE)
          Let's get readyyyyy to rumble!
          Crepsley looks up, reacts.

                         CREPSLEY
          Even the creatures of the night
          watch too much TV.
          Darren swings past through the middle of it all.
          Murlough charges.
          Crepsley sidesteps Darren, decides to take the fight higher.
          He leaps up, swings himself up onto one of the catwalks.
          Murlough follows. They use the room steel as monkey bars as
          they climb, clash. Violent, quick attacks. Crepsley gaining
          a position, abandoning it as Murlough SLAMS in.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          105.

                         DARREN
          Has lost sight of them, he can only hear the battle now. He
          reacts as Evra, Debbie and Sam rush out. Evra takes hold,
          lifts, tries to lessen the load on the chain.

                         EVRA
          Sam, unhook his legs.
          As Sam struggles, Debbie pulls the rag from Darren's mouth.

                         DARREN
          Are you guys nuts? Get outta here!

                         EVRA
          It's against our code.
          Suddenly unhooked, Darren hits the ground. He looks up at
          Evra who grins down at him.

                         EVRA
          Never leave a freak behind.

                         CUT TO:

                         CEILING SUPERSTRUCTURE
          On the catwalks Murlough draws his knives. Crepsley jumps
          to the space he wants to defend, draws his own. Murlough
          counters. Two very serious predators'-at work. The animal
          kingdom at its killing best.
          A charge. Murlough a bull, Crepsley a matador. He redirects
          one of Murlough's arcing arms, smashing it against a metal
          housing. One of the vampaneze's knives clatters away.
          It's not graphic or bloody, but several times Crepsley's
          knife finds its way into Murlough's body. It enrages him,
          but Crepsley continues dealing out punishment.
          He's now like a brilliant counter-puncher, even as he
          inadvertently backs his way into a corner.
          But as quarters close in, Murlough's rage works to his
          advantage. He charges into Crepsley, his lowered shoulder
          sending Crepsley through the air and into...
          And through a BRICK WALL. Into the thin air outside! Still
          raging, Murlough nearly falls through himself. Instead, he
          slips, drops about twenty feet down inside the building!

          EXT. ASPHALT - NIGHT

          Crepsley falls sixty feet, lands flat on his back, as brick
          and concrete rain on top of him...

                         CUT TO:

          INT. FACTORY - NIGHT

          As Evra pulls Darren along. Debbie and Sam riding shotgun.

                         EVRA
          Come on!

                         DARREN
          Evra. I think I'm dying.
          He looks horrible.

                         DEBBIE
          Let's carry him if we have to.
          Evra and Sam support him on either side. They continue,
          start across part of a darkened backstage area.
          A dark rectangular shape looms ahead. We hear a GUTTURAL
          GROWL, sees eyes glow in the gloom. They freeze.

                         EVRA
          It's okay. It's the wolfman. He's
          in his cage.
          They move forward again, the cage becomes visible. But
          another SHAPE beside it. Steve. He sets his hand on the
          cage's heavy latch. He's going to open it.

                         EVRA
          No don't!

                         STEVE
          Ooops...
          Steve lifts the latch. Even he doesn't expect the force the
          wolfman hits the door with. Whaanngg! It's out.
          Evra steps bravely forward. The wolfman sends him flying.
          Sam can't hold Darren up by himself. He doesn't even see the
          Wolfman leap over. As Darren sinks to the floor...
          The wolfman tears into Sam...

                         

                         

                         

                         

          107.

                         DEBBIE
          Reacts in horror.

                         STEVE
          He's more surprised than shocked. Until the wolfman looks
          his way. Then he heads for the hills, disappears into the
          dark. The wolfman turns back toward Debbie.
          She backs away, takes off up a rickety stairway. The wolfman
          HOWLS, then follows.
          Darren's too weak to follow, near tears in frustration and
          regret. He watches after them, then he looks over at Sam.
          Sam who is dying. Just a few feet away. His eyes flicker to
          Darren's. He tries to say something, but can't.

                         DARREN
          Oh Sam. Oh no...
          Darren crawls over, takes Sam's bloody hand.

                         SAM
          Go save Debbie, Darren...
          Sam manages the smallest smile. As his eyes drift shut...

                         SAM
          I think she loves you...
          From above, we hear Debbie SCREAM. Darren considers Sam's
          blood, knows what he has to do. Leave his humanity behind
          and cross the line. He needs to drink Sam's blood.

                         DARREN
          Forgive me, Sam, but I need
          strength. I need blood.
          As Darren extends his nails over Sam's wrist...

                         DARREN
          We're going to save her together.

                         CUT TO:

          INT. UPPER FLOOR - FACTORY - NIGHT

          Debbie backing into a corner. The wolfman almost on her...

                         

                         

                         

                         

          108.
          Murlough arrives! Pure animal action as he tears into
          wolfie, sends him retreating, licking his wounds into the
          darkness. Murlough heaves for breath, pretty beat up
          himself. And here comes Steve. Cautiously.

                         STEVE
          Is Crepsley dead?

                         MURLOUGH
          Who knows? Young Murlough lives,
          but he's hurt.

                         STEVE
          What can I do?

                         MURLOUGH
          What can Dar-wren's girlfriend do?
          We need to get the blood inside
          outside. Don't we?
          Then we hear it: a blood-curdling scream filters up. It's:

          DARREN! - BACKSTAGE AREA
          He's drunk Sam's blood. He rises. His sickness wicking off
          him. Strength descending. Empowered. Furious. He screams
          again, the sound taking shape into words.

                         DARREN

          FORGIVE ME!!!

          FACTORY STAGE SPACE
          The audience who haven't left react as the chilling sound
          reaches them.

          BACKSTAGE AREA - FACTORY
          Fully 1/2 vampire powered, he takes the stairs two at a time.

                         UPPER FLOOR
          Murlough, looming over Debbie, smiles as Darren arrives.

                         DARREN
          Let her go.

                         STEVE
          Stop being a big shot. This isn't
          like stopping some fight at school.

                         DARREN
          Shut up, Steve.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          109.
          Murlough's eyes go very, very dark. He attacks.
          Darren tries to meet the onslaught, but he's bowled over.
          Knocked in a heap.
          Debbie moves to go after Murlough from behind. She's going
          to go down fighting as well. But Steve intercepts her. He's
          pretty powerful himself.
          Murlough pulls Darren to his feet, stands him up. He swings
          his fist in a vicious arc.
          Darren just ducks it and Murlough's fist SMASHES right
          through the wall (an inside wall) alongside Darren's head.
          Murlough's getting tired of Darren.

                         MURLOUGH
          You need to stand still so you can
          die.
          But as he attempts to pull his arm back through, he can't.
          He frowns. Then his eyes widen in pain.
          Murlough jerks his arm back as hard as he can. The wall
          smashes open as Murlough brings his arm back through with
          Crepsley hanging onto the end of it.

                         FACTORY SPACE
          The audience who remain chanting: "Refund! Refund!" They
          react as debris falls from above, smashes to the stage.

          UPPER FLOOR - FACTORY
          Crepsley brings up his knife.
          Murlough catches him by the wrist with one hand.
          With the other he grips Crepsley by the throat, SLAMS him
          hard into an I-beam pillar. Again. Then he squeezes. We
          can hear the cartilage crunching in Crepsley's throat.
          But Crepsley covers his own right hand with his left. He
          drives the knife blade INTO MURLOUGH'S HEART!
          Murlough looks down at the handle of the knife, then back at
          Crepsley whose throat he still holds.
          Murlough gives him a lopsided grin and then pitches back,
          falling through one of the holes in the floor. Taking
          Crepsley with him.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          110.

                         FACTORY SPACE
          SCREAMS from the audience as Murlough descends. Somewhere in
          mid-fall, Crepsley FLITS, disappears. When Murlough hits the
          center of the stage, he hits it alone. Dead.
          As people start for the exits, we see Mr. Tiny'is among them.

                         UPPER FLOOR
          But as Darren stands, it's not over. Steve grabs Debbie,
          pushes her to the edge where the rafters are.

                         STEVE
          Stay back! Or I'll throw her off!
          I mean it!
          It sounds like he does. Darren looks intently at Debbie.
          She looks back. Then, Darren makes CHICKEN CLUCK SOUNDS.
          Understanding, Debbie tears herself away. To the precipice.
          But instead of falling, she continues out on a rafter.
          Steve slides out after her. But as he reaches for her, she
          deftly skips across the rafters, jumps back to the floor.
          Before Steve can follow, Darren cuts him off. Below them:
          rows of jagged, rusty pipes. The remains of a pumping
          station. Shredded now, broken. Waiting to impale.

                         DARREN
          It's over, Steve.

                         STEVE
          Is it?
          Steve lunges. They come together, trading shots, stumbling
          but still having to make the rafters. A missed footfall will
          be their last. They separate, try to gain position.

                         STEVE
          You wanna hear something funny?
          After your funeral, I went to see
          your parents.
          They continue circling.

                         STEVE
          And they were fine. They acted
          like they barely remembered you.

                         DARREN
          Liar.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          Darren lunges, but Steve's ready. He CUFFS Darren in the
          head. Darren falls, ends up hanging. Steve looms, smiling.

                         STEVE

                         (SMILES)
          And your sister. She was moving
          into your room. They had a yard
          sale. I bought some of your stuff.
          Steve's foot on his hand. Darren about to die. Oddly:

                         DARREN
          Did you steal money from my mom's
          purse?

                         STEVE
          What?

                         DARREN
          Did you?
          Darren hanging there, dead grim. Steve's curious.

                         STEVE
          Why do you ask? Is knowing that
          gonna help you rest in peace?

                         DARREN
          No. It's just practically the last
          thing that ever happened between me
          and my dad was I was arguing with
          him.

                         STEVE

                         (FLIP)
          Least you had a dad to argue with.
          A fury building in Darren.

                         DARREN
          I was telling him he was wrong
          about you. That's the last time we
          had together. Fighting about you.

                         STEVE
          Hate to tell ya. Your dad was
          right. How do you think we got the
          money for the dumb tickets? I took
          it. Just like I'm gonna take you.
          Steve jams his foot down into Darren's face, but Darren hangs
          on. In fact, with a superhuman surge, he hauls himself up,
          no matter how many times Steve hits him.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          112.
          WHAM! Darren lets Steve have it.

                         DARREN
          I miss him.

          WHAM!

                         DARREN
          Do you understand?

          WHAM!

                         DARREN
          I miss him so much.
          WHAM! Steve's arm pinwheel for balance. He's going over.
          But just as he pitches off the end rafter...
          Darren catches him by his belt. Nearly bent backward, he
          hangs back over the abyss. If Darren lets go, Steve will
          fall into the spikes below.
          Crespley steps up beside Debbie, knows what Darren should do.

                         CREPSLEY
          Kill him, Darren. Do it now so you
          won't have to do it later.
          Darren looks at Steve. A moment they'll remember forever.

                         DARREN

                         (SOFTLY; SADLY)
          No. He used to be my friend.
          Darren flings Steve back the other way. To safety.

                         DARREN
          Start running. Don't ever stop.
          Steve hesitates. It wasn't supposed to be like this. Darren
          starts off the rafter toward him. One last look of hate.

                         STEVE
          Next time...
          And he's gone. Disappearing into the dark.
          Darren joins Debbie. Nothing left to hide.

                         DEBBIE
          Sam?
          Darren shakes his head. Sam didn't make it.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          113.
          She understands. Darren looks at Crepsley. He's a mess.

                         DARREN
          Are you gonna be okay?

                         CREPSLEY
          I just need to catch my breath.
          For a few days. Maybe a week.

                         DARREN
          You think I made a mistake, don't
          you?

                         CREPSLEY
          No. I think that you proved
          yourself human after all.
          Human. As Darren absorbs this kindness, smiles.

                         DARREN
          Half human. What now?

                         CREPSLEY
          What do you mean?

                         DARREN
          There's a war on, isn't there?
          Crepsley shrugs.

                         DARREN
          This world is crossed by fences.
          You have to decide which side you
          stand on.

                         CREPSLEY
          Yes, yes. Black and white fences
          crossing very gray fields.

                         DARREN
          It's not gray. I've met the bad
          guys. They need to be stopped.

                         CREPSLEY
          I'm not sure it's my fight.

                         DARREN
          But you said it. There's no in
          between. And the power of being
          alone is never going to be greater
          than the weakness. It's our fight.

                         CUT TO:

                         

                         

                         

                         

          114.

          EXT. FACTORY - NIGHT

          As PATRONS try to get as far as they can as quick as they
          can. We see Steve duck out, blending in.
          Mr. Tiny's Lincoln Continental pulls up. As Steve gets in...

                         CUT TO:

          EXT. FIELD - NEAR THE CAMPSITE - NIGHT

          Mr. Tall, Evra, Debbie, Darren and Crepsley. Crepsley sets
          Sam's body down in the grass. It's covered with one of Madam
          Truska's tent silks. As Crepsley's eyes meet Darren's...

                         DARREN

                         (A WHISPER)
          He was a good kid. It's weird, but
          I remember things about him even
          though I wasn't there when they
          happened. Even though it's
          impossible.
          A moment as Crepsley nods sadly at this most singular boy.

                         CREPSLEY
          His blood is in you.

          MR. TALL
          I'll deal with the police when they
          come. What I'll say, I don't know.

                         DEBBIE
          Say what happened. Some crazy guy
          showed up. Sam was in the wrong
          place at the wrong time.
          They're all quiet a moment.

                         EVRA
          He was brave.

                         DEBBIE

                         (SADLY)
          For the only time in his life.

                         DARREN
          He didn't die in vain.
          A beat.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          115.

          MR. TALL
          Time to fly or flit or whatever you
          call it. The sun won't wait all
          night.

                         CREPSLEY
          Actually, that's exactly what it
          does.
          Mr. Tall manages a smile, considers the sky a moment.

          MR. TALL
          Time will tell what this night has
          brought us.

                         CREPSLEY
          Yes. Keep my coffin ready, would
          you?

          MR. TALL
          Always.
          As they exchange farewells, Debbie turns to Darren.

                         DEBBIE
          Do you think we'll meet again?

                         DARREN
          You never know.
          As she hugs him tight, she whispers in his ear:

                         DEBBIE
          I hope so...

                         DARREN

                         (WHISPERS BACK)
          Hope is a good word. I hope so,
          too.
          And so goodbye. Darren and Crepsley start down the road.

                         DARREN
          Where are we going?

                         CREPSLEY
          To meet the Vampire Generals. War
          clouds are forming. A storm is
          coming. And I have a feeling
          you're needed much more than I am.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          116.

                         DARREN
          So what are we waiting for? Let's
          go.
          Crepsley offers his hand.

                         CREPSLEY
          Take my arm.
          Darren shakes his head, doesn't need it.
          He shimmers, flits into the night.
          Crepsley laughs to himself. As he follows...

          FADE TO BLACK.

                         FADE IN:

          EXT. ALLEYWAY (VILLAGE) - DUSK

          Gloomy, last light. From out of the shadows comes            --
          A DOG. A dog of war. Big, mangy, muscular, scary. As
          he moves down the alley, the way becomes increasingly
          choked with fallen structures. and signs of tumult.

          EXT. BATTLEFIELD - DUSK

          TRACKING WITH THE DOG as he comes onto a battlefield.
          The hellish scene is REVEALED TO US SLOWLY --                

          SERIES OF SHOTS
          as the Dog traverses a landscape of --
          BODIES, frozen in contorted death poses. This was
          furious, hand-to-hand fighting between human SOLDIERS and
          nightmare CREATURES, their corpses now in piles to the
          horizon.
          The Dog climbs a mound of casualties. At the top, the
          Dog looks back across the battlefield. The Dog's eyes
          are sad, his expression weary and disgusted.

                         DISSOLVE TO:

          EXT. THE PALACE OF ACRISIUS - NIGHT

          The entrance is patrolled by a dozen PALACE GUARDS. They     
          don't see the Dog pad silently to a fissure in the palace    
          wall and disappear inside.                                   

          INT. THE PALACE OF ACRISIUS - GREAT HALL - NIGHT             

          Bloodied and battered, the King's GENERALS are               
          disagreeing loudly about strategy. A loud BANGING sound
          pierces the hubbub, and the officers quiet, turning to --    
          KING ACRISIUS, a striking man in his prime, his handsome     
          face marked by one crooked scar on his jaw. He commands      
          the room --                                                  

                         KING ACRISIUS
          Now we end the debate about
          tactics... and begin to plan for
          victory.

          AT THE BACK OF THE HALL
          The Dog stares at the King. Then slips away.

          INT. THE PALACE OF ACRISIUS - GREAT STAIRS - NIGHT

          Unseen by exhausted Guards, the Dog bounds up the stairs.     

          INT. THE PALACE OF ACRISIUS - ROYAL APARTMENT - CORRIDOR -


                         NIGHT
          The Dog approaches a doorway; stops to watch from the         
          shadows.

          INT. THE PALACE OF ACRISIUS - BEDCHAMBER - DOG'S POV -


                         NIGHT
          In the dim bedchamber, the SILHOUETTE of QUEEN DANAE as a     
          LADY-IN-WAITING removes her gown, revealing the Queen's       
          perfect body as she slips into bed. The Lady-in-Waiting
          leaves.
          The Dog's eyes. He moves forward.

                         FLOOR-LEVEL
          TRACKING WITH the Dog's legs as they MORPH INTO HUMAN
          LEGS. The CAMERA RISES BEHIND a towering male figure,
          who roughly pulls a curtain aside.                            
          In the bed, the Queen is startled, then pleased.

                         QUEEN DANAE
          My King! Has the strategy been
          set so quickly?

                         REVERSE ANGLE
          The looming figure looks exactly like King Acrisius,          
          including the distinctive scar. He regards her hungrily.      

                         QUEEN DANAE
          Come to your Queen, my King.

          INT. THE PALACE OF ACRISIUS - GREAT STAIRS - SUNRISE          

          The real King Acrisius wearily climbs the stairs with         
          AIDES and Guards. Suddenly, the King stops.

                         CONTINUED:
          On the wall above is the huge shadow of a four-legged
          creature -- and now it appears:
          The Dog stops at the top of the stairs and regards the
          men without fear -- its eyes blaze with a God's power.
          Even Acrisius, who fears nothing, steps back. The others
          raise their weapons.
          The Dog comes down the steps, eyes upon them, and passes     
          close by. No one dare move. The Dog disappears into the      
          shadows below.

          EXT. THE SEA - ROCKY PROMONTORY - CLOSE ON KING ACRISIUS'    


          HARDENED COUNTENANCE - DAY
          staring at --

                         ANOTHER ANGLE
          Queen Danae, PREGNANT NOW, and weeping. Her arms are
          bound.
          A ROYAL ENTOURAGE is gathered. The women weep, the men       
          agonize.                                                     
          Palace Guards lift the Queen into a chest and chain it       
          closed. On the King's signal, the Guards carry the chest     
          to the edge and drop it into the rough sea. We HEAR a
          SCREAM from within.
          Some members of the Royal Entourage look with scorn at
          their King, outraged by this double murder. Acrisius
          registers their disapproving looks and angrily turns to
          leave the promontory.
          WE SEE in his face what the others do not -- shame and
          doubt.                                                       
          IN THE WATER BELOW, the chest rights itself and rides out    
          on the tide.                                                 

          EXT. SAND DUNES OF A LONELY BEACH - NIGHT                    

          Two HORSEMEN gallop in the moonlight. The first Rider
          sways in the saddle and falls from his mount. He
          staggers to his feet, a skin of ale in his hands. It is
          King Acrisius, very drunk.
          The second Rider, the King's STEWARD, dismounts to give      
          aid, though he's also drunk.

                         (RAGING)
          My own subjects condemn me! They
          dare judge me? And what emboldens
          this treachery?...

                      STEWARD          
          You are mistaken, my King. None                                           
          would risk your anger --                                                  

                      KING ACRISIUS    
          (oblivious to him)                                                        
          It is Zeus who warps my                                                   
          kinadom!... Zeus the ungodly, Zeus                                        
          the defiler...                                                            
          This talk sobers the Steward instantly; he looks about                    
          fearlessly.                                                               

                      STEWARD          
          Please, speak not these things                           --               
          Acrisius spins on him, out of control --                  

                         KING ACRISIUS
          He cuckolds me in my castle, rapes
          my precious Queen! This is a low,
          conniving God... But I have bested
          him on this day and humbled the
          great Prime.

                         (SWIGS ALE)
          Tell me, Panos, who rivals Zeus on
          Olympos? Who does the Fearless
          One fear?

                         STEWARD                                                   
          I beg you, Your Highness --                               
          Acrisius pulls a dagger and holds it to the Steward's
          throat.

                         KING ACRISIUS
          Tell me what the Priests say!

                         STEWARD

          Tiamat... Tiamat, Queen of the
          Deep.

                         (WHISPERING)
          Those who dare, whisper she covets
          Zeus' throne and schemes to
          achieve it, the ambitious Goddess
          of the Dark Oceans...

                         KING ACRISIUS
          Yes, Tiamat! And today I have
          honored her.
          The King whirls and staggers up the crest of the dune.        

                         KING ACRISIUS
          I've taken Zeus' whore and the
          bastard she grows in her belly and
          thrown them to Tiamat in her rough
          sea!
          (toward the moonlit

                         OCEAN)
          I honor Zeus' rival with all that
          was dear to me --
          (falters, ashamed)
          -- and commit double murder in her
          honor...
          About to go to pieces, rage seizes him again --               

                         KING ACRISIUS
          so that Zeus will know I
          despise and disdain him and spit
          on his foul name!
          The Steward shrinks from this blasphemy, eyes darting in      
          fear.                                                         
          ON THE CREST the King is silhouetted in the moonlight,        
          arms raised defiantly toward the heavens, when suddenly --    
          -- his figure is seized by some violent force, shaking
          his being. A HORRIBLE SOUND                                  (MUSCLE TEARS, BONES CRACK)
          and THE KING'S BODY GROWS LARGER AS IT DISTORTS IN

          MISSHAPEN DISFIGUREMENT.
          And thus, KING ACRISIUS BECOMES... KALIBOS!
          The Steward SEES what we now cannot. An INHUMAN ROAR and
          the shadow of this new being falls upon the Steward. He
          SCREAMS, but it's too late -- the huge CREATURE grabs him
          by the neck and LIFTS HIM OUT OF FRAME. From the empty,
          moonlit dunes, we...

          A LITTLE BOY leads a blind OLD MAN along a road.             
          Abruptly, the Old Man halts. Puzzled, the Boy scans
          ahead, SEES --
          -- a SPRAY OF DUST, moving fast, behind a blurred BLACK

                         FORM --

          Olympos.
          The rushing Black Form crosses a field, leaving a            
          violent wave in the long grass and suddenly --

          WE ARE IN THAT RUSHING POV: the landscape is just a          
          blur. But up ahead is a mountain: OLYMPOS. WE ZOOM UP        
          TO the summit --                                             
          -- INTO the clouds above the peak. THROUGH the mist --
          villas, classical facades: THE ABODE OF THE GODS. The
          polished stone of the grandest villa reflects THOTH'S
          dark form touching down.

          THOTH THE QUICK enters the wide courtyard, his cape
          billowing. He strides past the reflecting pool in the
          center of the courtyard, gravely acknowledging --
          -- each of the TEN FIGURES seated around the perimeter...
          THE OLYMPIANS. APOLLO is here, and bronze-helmeted
          ATHENA; APHRODITE and muscular VULCAN -- we are dazzled
          and lose count.
          Thoth bows deeply before the throne of ZEUS, majestic,       
          bearded, awe-inspiring. An EAGLE is perched on his arm.      

                         THOTH

          We have debated, we have voted,

          Humans peace. Thoth, you will
          take them the terms of a treaty --

          A treaty!
          Zeus and his eagle turn their heads. The God's eyes are
          familiar -- the blazing orbs we saw in The Dog.
          In the shadowed corner of the atrium stand TWO MORE
          Olympians: SET THE VOID, whose countenance is death made

          We don't negotiate with them! We
          dictate to them. Their place is
          to beg. They have forgotten their
          role and have denied us the
          sustenance of their prayers.

                         APHRODITE
          Our mercy will give them reason to
          be grateful. They will bow down
          and whisper our names with more
          passion than before.

                         TIAMAT
          They will bow down when we snap
          their backs! Mercy? We are Gods!
          Some of us remember that and are
          not afraid --
          Zeus has had enough: furious ARCS OF LIGHTNING jump to
          the walls, the eagle beats its wings in rage.               

                         ZEUS
          Silence! Or learn what it is to
          be afraid! The debate is over,
          the votes cast...
          Zeus points to a golden tray; it bears TEN chips of
          alabaster versus TWO shards of obsidian.

          Soon enough, Set. Zeus has grown                           
          weaker than I knew.
          Set gestures at the white chips on the tray as he picks
          up the two black shards representing their votes. He
          hands one to Tiamat.

          So have they all. They no longer

          Set agrees, his eyes searching her face.                   

                         TIAMAT
          We will manage these thick-witted
          Humans to our own ends.
          (off his look)
          Yes, we will be bound by great
          Zeus' rules... until their fragile
          membranes tear. We dare not
          interfere with these insects...

          I'm not cowed. If these arrogant

          A truce would benefit all...

                         KEPHEUS
          In my palace, I decide how the                             
          discourse proceeds, not some
          messenger sent on errands by Zeus.

          THOTH (O.S.)
          You are correct, Your Highness, I
          do the bidding of Zeus...
          To their astonishment, the emissary is already in the
          Throne Room, behind them. Startled, they turn to see      --    
          Thoth the Quick, Messenger of the Gods, float forward.          

                         THOTH
          ... as do all Gods... and all men.
          Thoth removes his hood, revealing his crystal skull.       

                         THOTH
          (with an edge)
          King Kepheus, as humble messenger
          of Zeus, I've come to talk of
          peace.

                         AMOUN

                         (DEFERENTIAL)
          Thoth the Quick, I am Amoun, the
          King's Magi Strategos. We welcome                          
          you with humility, honored by your                         
          visit from the realm of the Gods.                          
          The King shoots Amoun a look, but he is still shaken by
          Thoth's sudden appearance. Cassiopeia tries to recover
          her composure.

                         KEPHEUS
          I am a reasonable man. Everyone
          wishes for the conflict to cease.

          Zeus above all. He has so long
          desired the tragedy end, he made a

          Amoun winces at her tone. Thoth sends a scary glance her
          way. Icy --

          the crowd watches the Basilica, worried by the God's        
          presence.

          INT. THRONE ROOM - DAY

          Kepheus and Cassiopeia sit stunned. Amoun watches
          without surprise.

                         KEPHEUS
          A treaty marriage?

                         THOTH
          You have a daughter of age.

                         (GASPS)
          Andromeda!

                         KEPHEUS
          Surely Zeus does not ask a mortal
          father to give his daughter to a
          God.

                         THOTH
          No. Such a union would be
          unclean. Years ago Zeus created a                           
          scion of mixed blood. Half-man,
          half-God. Bred for just this
          union. That is how important Zeus
          considers this truce.

          Is my only daughter to marry a
          demigod, not of this earth?

          Majesty, if I may -- the young man

          Kepheus turns, surprised at Amoun's foreknowledge.

          You knew about this and said
          nothing?

          My Queen, I serve only the great
          order of things. I was the boy's
          tutor years ago.

                         KEPHEUS
          How haughty this boy must be, who                      
          knows he is half-God.

                         AMOUN
          He knows nothing and believes
          himself an ordinary man. He has
          never left his village. He can be                      
          overconfident, but it is from                          
          inexperience, not arrogance.

          The golden marbles on a tabletop roll from their pits and
          pile up in defiance of gravity. Wine goblets tilt toward

          Thoth's demeanor changes. The marbles spill off the          
          table, rolling across the floor to Kepheus' feet. TILT       
          UP TO his intimidated face:

          Perfectly blue, sunlight shafting from the surface.                                                            
          A GREAT WHITE SHARK appears, ensnared in a fisherman's       
          net. Panicked, the shark is diving as fast as it can.        
          As the net passes we see --
          ANTEROS, a hapless young fisherman, his legs entangled in    
          the net, desperately trying to hold his breath. When
          they have disappeared, we see a FIGURE appear through the
          blue in pursuit. As he passes, we get our first look

                         AT --
          PERSEUS,                                                    25, wiry, bronzed from the sun, a stubbled jaw,
          a knife in his teeth. He swims with the power and grace
          of a porpoise -- beyond the ability of any normal man.

          EXT. SEA FLOOR - DAY

          The shark thrashes about, jaws snapping close to Anteros.

          14.

                         CONTINUED:
          Perseus swims INTO VIEW and uses his knife to cut the net
          near the shark's snout. The shark tries to swim through
          the hole, but instead drags the net upwards. Perseus
          hangs on.
          One more slice and the shark zooms out of the net,
          bumping the young hero as it swims away. Perseus pulls
          Anteros toward the surface.

          EXT. FISHING TRAWLER - DAY

          A CREW of FISHERMEN wait desperately at the rail.
          SPYROS, the oldest and toughest, watches in agony.
          Perseus breaks the surface, gasping, his lifeless friend
          in his arms. Five crewmen dive in to help, but Perseus
          is mad with despair. They have to pull him away.
          Spyros watches sadly. But also, relieved to see the one
          survivor.

          EXT. FISHING TRAWLER - DAY

          Spyros makes his way to the bow, where Perseus sits
          alone, downcast, in pain. Spyros watches in silence.
          Then, gruffly --

                         SPYROS
          Your grieving does Anteros no
          good. It comforts only you.

                         PERSEUS
          It's my fault he's gone.

                         SPYROS
          He was careless with the net.
          Perseus gives him a hard look.

                         PERSEUS
          So it's his fault. Not mine, not
          fate, not the Gods?

                         SPYROS

                         (DISDAINFULLY)
          The Gods delude themselves about
          their power and watch in envy
          while we act. We make our own
          history.

                         PERSEUS
          (breaks down, crying)
          Now my history is I let my friend
          die in my arms. I made it back,
          why couldn't he?

                         SPYROS
          What you do, no other man can do.
          Have you not noticed?

                         PERSEUS
          To what purpose? I failed him.

                         SPYROS

                         (SCOFFS)
          Purpose! Looking for purpose is
          what ensnares men in the
          superstition of the Gods, as
          surely as your friend was caught
          in that net. And all the
          searching leads down to the same
          place.
          The trawler is approaching its home island, Seriphos.
          Perseus looks off at the rocky coast. Collects himself,

                         QUIETLY --

                         PERSEUS
          You always say that my abilities
          are greater than other men's. But
          they were not enough to save him.

                         SPYROS
          You are still a man, confined by
          man's limits. You are just as
          likely to fail as succeed.

                         PERSEUS
          How is that greater than other
          men?

                         SPYROS
          Ordinary men fail most of the
          time.
          The trawler rounds a point on the island.
          Perseus spies a beautiful girl on the cliff. A closer

                         LOOK --
          A huntress; a pagan leather bandeau hugs her lithe         
          figure. Flowers in her golden hair -- wilted dahlias.      
          Young yet ancient. THE WILTING GIRL.

                         CONTINUED:
          She watches Perseus intently as the boat passes. He
          turns to see if Spyros or his friends have seen her, but
          no one has. When he looks back, she's gone.

           EXT. PROMONTORY NEAR THE HOME OF SPYROS - MAGIC HOUR     

           Perseus sits looking sadly at the sea that killed his
          friend. TEKLA,                                             14, Perseus' adoptive sister, runs up                    
           from the modest stone dwelling. She sees his mood and    
          touches his arm gently.                                 

                         TEKLA
          Mother wants you to come in for
          supper.
          (as he is

                         UNRESPONSIVE)
          Perseus, why are you so sad?
          This breaks his spell. He looks at Tekla warmly, gets up    
          and puts a reassuring arm around her shoulders as they      
          head inside.                                                

          INT. HOME OF SPYROS - KITCHEN - NIGHT

          Perseus eats with his adoptive family: Spyros, his wife
          MARMARA, and Tekla. Spyros is patient and twinkly with      
          his wife though he disagrees with her beliefs.

                         TEKLA
          I still don't understand.

                         SPYROS
          Your mother can explain. She
          believes everything has an
          explanation, even if we have to
          make it up.

          It's one of the reasons I love
          you, Marmara.

                         TEKLA
          Tell me! Why is there war between
          Man and the Gods?
          Marmara and Tekla continue to bring out the food.

                         MARMARA
          At the beginning of time, when Man
          was young, he prayed to the Gods.
          His belief in the Gods gave his
          life meaning. It was a good
          thing.

                         (IGNORING HIM)
          But Man grew, as children do, and
          he turned away from the Gods. Be
          began to put his faith in other
          things.
          Perseus watches the debate with fiery eyes.

                         TEKLA
          What things?

                         SPYROS
          Learning, science... love.

                         PERSEUS

                         (PASSIONATE)
          self-determination! Those
          things that give Man dignity and
          independence.

                         MARMARA
          But what of the Gods, who had
          protected and guided us so long?
          They must breathe our prayers to
          survive. They hunger for

          Spyros!

                         (TO TEKLA)
          Your father's mind is closed on
          these matters.

                         SPYROS
          The Gods were desperate to claim
          our awe again.

                         TEKLA
          Desperate... the Gods?

                         SPYROS
          Yes, even the Gods. If they could
          not earn our faith with love, they
          would demand it with fear.
          Whatever was necessary to ensure              L

          Middle of the night. Perseus lies wide awake in his tiny    
          space. He stares, thinking about his friend. Suddenly,      
          a KNOCK at the door.                                        

          INT. HOME OF SPYROS - DOORWAY - NIGHT

          Perseus opens the door to the Wilting Girl. Her beauty      
          electrifies him. She glows from within, but her color is    
          oddly faded, washed-out.                                    

                         PERSEUS
          You... I saw you watching our boat
          at the cliff.

                         WILTING GIRL
          It was not the boat I was
          watching.

                         PERSEUS
          Can I be of service?

          Yes, of service. I need you to
          come with me on a journey.
          Perseus gives her a look.

                         PERSEUS
          Right now?
          (as she nods)
          It wouldn't take much persuading
          to get me to leave this village,
          but tonight is impossible. My
          family can't wake and find me
          gone. Where do you want me to go?

                         WILTING GIRL

          For what?
          Perseus doesn't notice the black widow spider scurry
          between her feet. Then a centipede, a scorpion. Then a
          swarm, racing toward him.
          He feels the first spider and looks down. The creatures
          climb his legs, biting. Weakening from the venom, he
          stumbles back into the table, loses his balance and
          falls.

          A white sail, swollen with wind, draws the small boat
          swiftly across the sea. The Wilting Girl, alone, sits
          quietly at the stern, effortlessly steering.

                         CLOSER
          We SEE that she is also watching Perseus, who is sleeping
          in a makeshift bed in the bottom of the boat. Her eyes
          slowly travel over his bronzed, muscled frame. There are
          bite marks on his legs and arms, but they seem to be
          healing as we look at them.
          Perseus stirs and wakes, squinting up at the Wilting

          And it sounds as though it matches
          the beating of your heart?
          He doesn't have to answer; it's written on his face.

                         WILTING GIRL
          How long can you hold your breath?
          Longer than the others? Are there
          times when you know you should
          feel pain, but you don't?

                         PERSEUS
          None of that means anything.

                         WILTING GIRL
          Look at your arms, Perseus.
          Perseus watches the bites on his arm heal visibly.

                         PERSEUS
          A good trick. You must be the
          demigod, not me.

                         ("NO")
          I'm a Chthonian.

                         PERSEUS
          A Chthonian?

                         WILTING GIRL
          An Earth Goddess.

          The Gods have a caste system just
          as men do. The Olympians are our
          nobility -- few but cosmic. The
          Chthonians are the peasants. Our
          abode is this earth, and we exist
          as long as men worship us.

                         PERSEUS
          And when none worship you?
          Sadness flickers through her extraordinary eyes.

          If demigods rank so low, why do
          you need me?

                         WILTING GIRL
          For a marriage.

                         PERSEUS
          What!

                         WILTING GIRL
          Zeus, God of Gods, has proposed a
          treaty to end the war. At the
          center is the marriage of a mortal
          with a demigod.

                         PERSEUS
          Who, me?

                         WILTING GIRL
          Zeus himself has chosen you. A
          demigod may be less than a God,
          but he's more than a Man. One
          foot in Humanity, the other in
          Divinity. Your marriage will be a
          symbol of accord between our
          races.

                         PERSEUS
          Forget it.

                         WILTING GIRL
          Such a union could save millions
          of souls.
          Perseus is struck by that. He looks off across the sea.

                         PERSEUS
          And just who exactly am I supposed
          to marry?

          Perseus and Vidalia round a corner and see the regal
          Basilica. WORKMEN hang banners and decorations,
          preparing for a big event.

                         PERSEUS
          What are they celebrating?

          INT. BASILICA - ROYAL PARLOR -.DAY

          Cassiopeia hurries down a corridor to the parlor. WE
          FOLLOW to find:
          Kepheus speaking sternly to Perseus, before him.

                         KEPHEUS
          . before I am a king or a
          peacemaker, I am a father. Do you
          know what that means?

                         PERSEUS
          I'm not sure, Your Highness. I
          did not know my father.

                         KEPHEUS

                         (THROWN)
          Yes, well... it means I had no
          desire for my little girl's
          carefree springtime to be cut

                         SHORT --
          (to Cassiopeia,

                         IRRITABLY)
          What is she?

                         CASSIOPEIA

                         (EMBARRASSED)
          I'm sure she's preparing herself
          to make the best possible
          impression.
          Perseus suppresses a smile, amused by the royal couple.
          Kepheus paces with mounting impatience.

          -- and all so she could be thrust
          into a momentous conflict... of
          which she knows nothing at all.

          She's not the only one, sir. I
          don't know much about the events
          for which I've been drafted.

                         KEPHEUS
          (disarmed, but tough

                         GUY)
          I take no comfort in that, young
          man. In fact, I find little to
          take comfort in here. You are a
          stranger from a distant place, and
          I am asked to entrust the welfare
          of my daughter to you.

                         (LEANING INTO

                         PERSEUS)
          If you are not kind and patient
          with her, if any harm of any kind
          should come her way, I will have
          your head on a stake.
          Kepheus thinks he sees a smirk on Perseus' face. He puts    
          his hand on the hilt of his sword.

                         KEPHEUS
          Is this amusing to you?

                         PERSEUS
          Not even a little, my lord. It's
          just that I myself was waylaid --
          snatched also, as you say, from my
          happy springtime...
          Kepheus studies him to see if he's making jest of him.

                         PERSEUS
          I've been told I'm to play a                                
          part in events which serve a                                
          higher purpose... of which I'm not                          
          at all convinced.

                         KEPHEUS
          Does a truce in the war between
          Men and Gods not strike you as a
          higher purpose?

                         PERSEUS
          With all respect, I have never                              
          seen a God. On my island, they're                           
          no more than a story.

                         

                         KEPHEUS
          You will learn there is more to

          have experienced, not on a faith I
          do not possess.

                         KEPHEUS
          Where does a young person get such
          ideas?

                         PERSEUS
          Perhaps from my adopted father,
          sir. I admire him greatly, and he
          believes in little he cannot hold
          in his hand.

          The Wilting Girl steals down the dark, narrow alley,        
          headed toward the outskirts of town.
          Suddenly, a heavy wall shoots up from the cobblestones,     
          blocking her way. She startles, but does not stop. She
          goes up to the wall, turns at an angle and slides right
          through the stone, like a ghost.
          On the other side, she emerges from the stone, breathing    
          hard. She looks around and hurries down an intersecting
          passageway.
          She's gone only a few steps, when just ahead of her,        
          thick vines shoot out and form a dense barrier. She
          takes a breath and dives into the surging growth.
          She almost makes it through, but at the last moment,        
          vines wrap her arms and legs, holding her prisoner. She
          gives up, with a sigh. We HEAR the LAUGHTER of a God.

                         WILTING GIRL
          Zeus?
          Zeus' rumbling voice is held low, talking to her in an

          crush.

                         ANDROMEDA                                                    
          Do you think just anyone can make                            
          intimate judgements on the royal
          family?

                         PERSEUS                                                      
          I meant the sunset.
          She regards Perseus over her glistening bare shoulder.       

                         ANDROMEDA
          Do you always start a seduction
          with an insult?
          Perseus moves to the rail, very close to her, and looks
          at the sea.

                         PERSEUS
          I know nothing of seduction. I'm
          a simple fisherman. My home is
          across that water.

          What brings you here?

                         PERSEUS
          To Joppa? I was kidnapped.

                          

                         ANDROMEDA
          I mean here, tonight.
          He looks over at her a long moment.

                         PERSEUS
          I've come to see my future wife.
          Startled, Andromeda suddenly realizes who he is. A mad
          mix of emotions crosses her face.

          EXT. GARDENS OF THE BASILICA - NIGHT

          Perseus and Andromeda walk in moonlit gardens. She stays
          close, attracted to him.

                         ANDROMEDA
          It's not personal. You're not a
          bad-looking boy.
          (as Perseus laughs)
          I'm too young. I don't want to be
          married.

                         PERSEUS
          Me either.

                         ANDROMEDA
          Then why are you doing it?

                         PERSEUS
          No one asked me. And now that
          I've met you, I don't know if I
          can go through with it.
          (off her look)                                              
          It's not personal. Seeing you
          makes it real. I think a man
          should make his own decisions. I
          won't be the pawn of a King or a                            
          God.
          She looks at him with new interest.

                         ANDROMEDA
          Since we agree, it's settled. No                            
          marriage.

                         PERSEUS
          I don't think it's going to be
          that simple.
          Ignoring that, she takes his arm, moving even closer.

                         ANDROMEDA
          That doesn't mean we can't be
          friends. Get to know each other.
          I want to show you something.
          She leads him into a tall, hedged garden maze.

          EXT. THE BASILICA - GARDEN MAZE - NIGHT

          Beautiful in the moonlight. She hurries him quickly         
          around one turn, then another, and another. He laughs at
          her excitement.

                         PERSEUS
          I'm already lost.                                           

                         ANDROMEDA
          I'll take care of you.
          They take two more jogs and find themselves in an odd
          sylvan chamber. Soft plants have been stacked in what
          could be mistaken for a bed.

                         ANDROMEDA
          This is my special place. No one
          can see or hear or even find us
          now.

                         PERSEUS
          (looks around the

                         CHAMBER)
          I don't suppose I could escape
          without your aid.

                         ANDROMEDA
          Do you want to?
          When he turns back to her, she melts into his arms and
          gives him a long deep kiss. He's surprised, but handles
          it well. When she tries to continue, he slows things
          down, holding her at bay.

                         ANDROMEDA
          Do you not find me attractive?

                         PERSEUS
          One of the most beautiful women
          I've ever seen.

                         ANDROMEDA
          Of course, you haven't been much
          in the world.

                         PERSEUS
          True. Maybe a lot of girls look
          like you.

                         ANDROMEDA
          Don't you want to make love to
          your almost-wife? Maybe we'll
          find we're not compatible.

                         PERSEUS
          What if we find we're very compat--
          She stops him with another kiss. He starts to surrender
          to his desire, but again, he stops. Her voice is a low

                         PURR --

                         ANDROMEDA
          Is it true you're a demigod?

                         PERSEUS
          (makes a face)
          It seems what everyone wants to
          believe.
          Her face is inches from his. She looks into his eyes.

                         SEXY --

                         ANDROMEDA
          I don't see it.
          (as Perseus laughs)
          But let's find out for sure...
          She kisses him yet again, pulling him toward the bed of    
          foliage. He can no longer resist. Together they fall
          into the softness. He kisses her passionately as their
          bodies begin to move together. She breaks the kiss for
          only a moment, her voice husky --

                         ANDROMEDA
          I think I'm becoming a believer...
          They start to make love.

          The chamber, deserted for 25 years, is in decay, dead

          still he dwells in rancid
          hate, having killed his generals
          and sucked their bones. We cannot
          break the rules of Zeus and
          interfere with the humans. But

          Perseus wakes on the bed of foliage, looks around.
          Andromeda is gone. He thinks, smiles. Then he remembers
          his situation. The smile fades.

          INT. THE BASILICA - GREAT HALL - EVENING

          Perseus, in a white tunic and polished ceremonial armor,
          moves through the crowd of REVELERS. The grandiose room
          is hemmed by columns and statues. The royal family sits
          on the dais. Andromeda motions Perseus up beside her.

          You're late.

                         PERSEUS

          ROYAL HERALD (0.5.)
          The Queen will speak!
          The room QUIETS as Cassiopeia moves front-and-center of     
          the dais with a cup of wine, not her first.

                         CASSIOPEIA
          I won't be long-winded. You all
          know I am a modest person, no
          matter my rank.
          Some of the crowd react silently. Andromeda watches her
          mother with trepidation, but not as much as Kepheus,
          watching from his throne.

          (as Kepheus is on

                         ALERT)
          not the celebration of the
          happiness of two parents, or of
          our good people.
          Mild confusion in the hall, concern from the Royal          
          Entourage.

          This union represents new hope for
          a lasting peace! That is the only
          cause for celebration.
          The crowd reacts with exclamations and applause. Amoun      
          wills her to stop. Cassiopeia takes another drink, looks    
          over at the Princess.

          beautiful?
          Her subjects agree loudly. Andromeda wishes this would    
          end. Cassiopeia raises her glass.

          Kepheus is about to pull her away. She throws him a

          drops. The statues lining the hall shut their eyes and    
          the doors burst open.                                     
          TIAMAT, QUEEN OF THE DEEP, floats forward, parting the
          terrified celebrants. Perseus sees his first Olympian.
          Tiamat arrives at the dais. Cassiopeia drops to her
          knees.

                         TIAMAT
          You have blasphemed powers beyond
          understanding... You, a stupid

          Tiamat tears off her cloak and STANDS NAKED. Her body,
          made from the elements of the sea, is magnificent -- sexy
          and terrifying.
          Fantasos, the priest who proselytizes for Tiamat in the      
          streets, is in the throng. His reaction is a mix of          
          religious ecstasy and outright lust.                         
          The celebrants shield their eyes, but Cassiopeia can't.
          She crumples, aging before our eyes. Every word shakes
          her frame --

          No one dare look long at the Goddess. No one but             
          Perseus. Tiamat notices Perseus... and his boldness.

          sacrilege of this arrogant
          creature, I will loose Leviathan
          upon you.
          The people react in terror. Cassiopeia starts to faint,           
          but Tiamat snaps her back to consciousness                  --

          Clouds of black sea ink swirl and swallow Tiamat, then
          implode. Tiamat is gone. Cassiopeia, palsied and
          withered, collapses. Kepheus and Royal Aides rush to
          her.

          EXT. OCEAN FLOOR - NIGHT

          An immense school of fish is SUDDENLY SPOOKED. An EERIE
          GLOW swells in the gloom -- Tiamat glides TOWARD us,        
          stops and raises her palm. The silt SWIRLS and RIPPLES.
          A VAST PRIMORDIAL SHAPE SLOWLY RISES in clouds of ocean     
          mud. It's impossible to see what this creature looks        
          like, but it is big. We hear a deafening ROAR, which        
          drives a SHOCKWAVE across the silt.                         

          EXT. OCEAN SURFACE - NIGHT

          The sea bulges and a TSUNAMI rolls toward the shores of     
          Joppa.

          EXT. JOPPA'S LOWER WHARF - NIGHT                            

          Dark docks and shanties under the cliffs, populace
          asleep.
          A lone FISHERMAN unloads nets from his boat. Suddenly,      
          the water under his boat is sucked out to sea. A deep       
          RUMBLE shakes the ground.                                   
          The fisherman is mesmerized as the horizon CLIMBS higher    
          and higher, a WALL OF WATER. In seconds, the colossal       
          wave breaks and falls, obliterating the boat, the docks     
          and the low-lying shanties.                                 

          INT. ROYAL CHAMBERS - NIGHT

          Cassiopeia lies blank and wan. A LOW DRONE grows.           
          Kepheus rushes to the window. And then, a deep, EARTH-      
          SHATTERING BELLOW from the creature. The room SHUDDERS.

          A figure passes by a window in silhouette -- Andromeda
          steals through the shadows toward the Throne Room.

          INT. BALCONY ABOVE THRONE ROOM - NIGHT

          Andromeda edges into position to see the room below.

          A council of VICEROYS and MINISTERS gathered before
          Kepheus, who seems lost in thought, head down. Perseus    
          stands off to the side.

          INT. THRONE ROOM - NIGHT

          Amoun reads from a scroll.

          nigh indestructible.
          The men turn to Kepheus; when he raises his face, he      
          looks exhausted.

          Andromeda, my only child?                                 
          Amoun watches Perseus, at the fringe of the group,
          expectantly. But Perseus looks only perplexed, an
          observer.

          Yes. Give us a map.                                   
          Amoun laughs. When some of the others join in, the   King
          gives them a look that stops them dead.

                         AMOUN
          My King, with your permission...
          The King assents, seemingly lost. Amoun speaks to
          Perseus.

          I'll give you a map and much more.
          I'll go with you and bring a small
          band of comrades to help you on                              
          your mission. We can leave at

          Diokles, the map.
          The men move to the work area, where the Aide selects a      
          map from dozens. Something catches Perseus' eye.             

                         PERSEUS' POV
          Andromeda, up in the balcony, has made herself visible
          only to him. She silently mouths these words --              
          "Thank... you."

          AT THE MAP
          which has been hung for all to see, Amoun uses a pointer.

                         AMOUN
          We head north on the Via Dahlia.                             
          If we can make it to the Disputed

          . we'll join the Cleon desert                                
          legion, the most formidable unit
          in all the army... With their
          escort, we can safely reach our
          destination in Skolothia, which
          lies to the east...
          We DISSOLVE THROUGH the map and pointer, which remain
          LIGHTLY SUPERIMPOSED over the following:

          EXT. VIA DAHLIA - DAY

          MUSIC SWELLS as we see THE FULL EXPEDITION on horseback,     
          on the main road north. As they come over a rise, Amoun      

                         IDENTIFIES THEM:                                             
          First, two fearsome Mongols, MONGKE and TAMBURLANE.

          AMOUN (V.0.)
          Our guides will be Mongke and
          Tamburlane, father and son monster
          hunters from the Kingdom of the
          Iron Horde.
          Next, THE PRAETORIAN GUARD, commanded by a square-jawed    
          old soldier, DRACO. His men, in heavy armor: KOSMO,        
          Draco's lieutenant, and the soldiers ABAS, ICOS, THAD,     
          BOREAS, KRIKOR, and POLLUC.

          security force in Joppa.                                   
          Next, on a stunning pale horse, a pale rider -- the        
          Wilting Girl.

          PERSEUS                                                   (V.0.)
          Why do we bring the Earth Goddess                          
          into this danger?                                          

          AMOUN (V.0.)
          I thank the stars we have her.                             
          Besides, she takes her orders from
          an authority much greater than I.
          Next, Spyros; horseback riding is not one of his many      
          skills. Behind him, Perseus and Amoun ride talking --      

                         PERSEUS
          Amoun, it seems an odd coincidence
          you came into my life as tutor, so
          long ago, and now, once again you
          instruct me.

                         AMOUN

          No matter what you believe,
          Porpoise, some things are fated.
          I've been looking forward to this
          journey for a long, long time.
          He spurs his horse, riding ahead. Spyros drops back
          beside Perseus.

                         SPYROS
          Who would have thought we'd be on
          a journey like this? Two simple
          fishermen.

          I'm afraid I've dragged you into
          real danger, Father, when I have
          little idea of what I'm doing.

                         SPYROS
          Living at the mercy of the sea so
          long has convinced me some
          adventures are unexpected and some
          dangers unavoidable. It's all in
          your attitude.

                         PERSEUS
          What's our attitude about                                   
          destroying Leviathan?

          The Kraken is just another big

          Tiamat's Palace-Galleon is bigger than anything man can
          construct. Tiamat is at the prow of the vessel, using
          all her godly power to STIR THE ELEMENTS. With great
          effort, she sends a hurricane down on Joppa.
          Set the Void approaches the prow.

          Tiamat's storm is pounding Joppa. LIGHTNING stabs          
          through the dark clouds. RAIN POUNDS the tiles outside
          Andromeda's lavish bedroom.
          Peshet glides to Andromeda, who's wide awake, red-eyed,    
          distressed.

          A CRACK OF THUNDER. Andromeda looks over at her,           
          thinking.

          me to the monster.

          I'm sure that is not so.

                         ANDROMEDA
          I saw it. I heard the words. My                            
          loving father, his beloved child.                          
          Only Perseus stayed his decision.

          And do you know the worst part,
          Peshet? He was right.
          Peshet's feline eyes widen. More LIGHTNING.

          The city is besieged, the people

          The sound of that same DISTANT THUNDER as the Expedition
          follows the road. To the south behind them, LIGHTNING                   
          FLASHES over faraway Joppa.

          The moonlight illuminates a crumbling, limestone arch on
          which time-worn letters read: "VIA DAHLIA."

          By what name may mortals call you?

          defensive.

                         PERSEUS
          That's a pretty name. Wait,
          better yet -- 'Vidalia'? How's
          that... 'Vidalia'? That's more
          than pretty, beautiful really,
          just as you are.
          She is pleased, self-conscious, concentrating on the road
          ahead.

          Commander, I'll get some, too.                               
          Perseus and Abas head off into the woods in different        
          directions.                                                  

          EXT. VIA DAHLIA WOODS - NIGHT

          Perseus hacks branches and picks up deadwood. He slashes
          at a tree -- TING! Under the vines is a stone column.
          He climbs mossy steps.

          EXT. ABANDONED BATH (THERMAE) - NIGHT    

          The ruins of a public bath, its marble pool fed by a                
          stream.                                                             
          Perseus sees Vidalia on the far side, her back turned.              
          Perseus freezes as she drops her garment. He peers                  
          through the vines.                                                  

                         HIS POV
          The leaves offer tantalizing cover to her naked body.               
          She dives in with a quiet SPLASH.                                   

          BACK TO SCENE

                         PERSEUS
          Now is when an honorable man would

          . but they say I am not really a
          man.
          Vidalia surfaces and drifts on her back, looking sadly       
          into the sky.
          Perseus fixates on the sadness in her eyes. His
          expression changes, and the tenor of this stolen vigil is
          altered.
          RAINDROPS fall as the SKY OPENS and a CLOUDBURST pelts
          the pool. Vidalia opens her lips to taste the rain and
          smiles. LIGHTNING.

          Vidalia instantly knows he is nearby. She looks around
          quickly and huddles in the water.
          Perseus retreats. After a few yards, he stops, face         
          flushed with the awareness of a whole new dilemma.

           Abas uses his sword to HACK at dried wood. He bends to      
           pick up a branch when he HEARS the CRACK of wood. He        
           whirls, sword at ready. But there is nothing there.         
           Embarrassed, he picks up the firewood. Now he HEARS
           something unidentifiable -- is that BREATHING? Spooked,
           he turns to head back to camp --
           A DARK FIGURE is standing behind him, larger than a man,    
           grotesquely misshapen. Abas raises his sword, but a         
           twisted PAW swats it away with a ROAR. Abas tries to        
           raise the sword again and realizes his arm is gone. He      
           looks up in horror as the Creature envelops him --

           Only a few streaks of sunlight penetrate the canopy of      
          tall cedars.                                               

           SUPERIMPOSE: THE CEDAR FOREST OF THE ILLYRIAN BORDER...
           24 DAYS REMAINING

           Here slumbers an enormous hybrid creature with human        
           features and a leathery, scaled hide -- HUMBABA.            
          Suddenly, Set the Void appears. The evil God strokes the    
          sleeping monster's head, then reaches inside Humbaba's      
          skull. The animal goes stiff; its leg twitches.

                         SET
          Hear me, my pet. Let my
          instructions be seared to your
          primal mind as natural law.

                        L
          The monster's eyes shoot open; its pupils shrink to
          pinpoints.

          Nearby, the Expedition (minus Abas) rests. Not here:
          Perseus, Draco, Icos, and Boreas.

          EXT. CEDAR FOREST CLEARING - DAY

          A herd of winged horses, PEGASSI, graze.
          Draco, Boreas, Icos and Perseus  -- thrilled -- hide in a
          thicket.

                         DRACO
          Pegassi, stallions of the Gods.

                         ICOS
          Perseus. How long do you think
          you could stay on one of those?
          Icos and Boreas exchange a sly look.        

                         BOREAS
          Don't goad the boy, Icos. No Man
          can ride a Pegasus.

                         ICOS
          Did not Bellerophon tame the Great
          White Pegasus?

                         BOREAS
          You're right. But he was a                  
          demigod...

          Stop it, rogues. One of our own
          has disappeared without a trace
          and all you can think is to cause
          mischief. What if Perseus is
          bucked to his death from a
          thousand feet up?

          Don't worry, Commander, the boy
          won't even get on its back.
          With a "watch this" grin, Perseus rises. Draco pulls him     
          back down.

          Don't do this. If we go back to
          camp right now, we can avoid
          trouble and keep our goal in
          sight. A true leader will not be
          distracted.

                         PERSEUS
          I'm not the leader, Draco, Amoun
          is. I'm too young to start
          avoiding trouble.
          Perseus jumps up and approaches a roan Pegasus, speaking     
          soothingly. It WHINNIES and threshes its wings,              
          buffeting Perseus with gusts.
          The Pegasus rears up, and leaps over Perseus' head. It       
          lands behind him, bucks its hind legs, and kicks Perseus     
          face-first into the dirt.
          Icos and Boreas are laughing, but when Draco gives them a
          dark look, Boreas jumps up, sobered, and heads into the
          clearing.

                         BOREAS
          I'll collect him right now,
          Commander.
          Suddenly, Humbaba erupts from the thicket with a HOWL.       
          The Pegassi take flight, but the Humbaba grabs one and       
          swallows it whole. Humbaba turns and SNIFFS the air,         
          homing in on Perseus.

          Icos bolts. Draco and Boreas leap into the clearing with     
          swords drawn to draw the monster's attention. Perseus        
          does the same.                                               

                         DRACO

          arrives.

          Mongke and Tamburlane fly into the woods; the others        
          follow.

          EXT. CEDAR FOREST CLEARING - DAY

          The reinforcements arrive to see Humbaba pin Boreas with    
          its talons.

          Draco hacks at the monster's leg, to no avail. it rips      
          off Boreas' head and swallows his body.                     
          Perseus CRIES OUT and leaps at the creature, sword          
          swinging.

          Get back!                                                   
          Vidalia spins her shepherd's sling to pitch lead sling-
          bullets. Spyros leaps between Perseus and the monster
          and thrusts his weapon -- a VICIOUS-LOOKING HARPOON/BOAT

          HOOK.
          Tamburlane hoists an ancient BAZOOKA. Mongke lights the     
          fuse and backs away. KA-BOOM! The weapon belches fire       
          and metal.                                                  
          The Humbaba staggers from the shot, but lunges and          
          swallows Mongke whole. Spyros sinks his harpoon in one      
          leg, but has it ripped from his hands.                      

                         VIDALIA
          A delusion is planted in its mind.
          It thinks it's starving and it
          wants to feed on --

          The Humbaba's eyes bulge with surprise as a saber pierces    
          its nose. From inside, Mongke pries open the beast's
          mouth with his saber.

                         VIDALIA
          I can't reverse the powerful
          curse. But if the monster's
          hungry, I can feed it.
          Vidalia raises her arms and shuts her eyes. A cyclone of
          CAWING RAVENS descends from the sky and dives straight       
          into the monster's mouth. As the Humbaba tries to shake      
          them away, Mongke is thrown clear.                           

                         VIDALIA

                         (TO DRACO)
          Now! The belly! Slash the belly!
          Draco moves to do that when Perseus leaps forward, lunges
          and sweeps his blade up Humbaba's belly at the same
          moment Draco sweeps down. The two blades barely miss
          each other, opening a huge X in the belly. The others
          are shocked and impressed by Perseus. Steaming purple
          entrails spill over Perseus and Draco. HUMBABA CRASHES

          TO THE GROUND.
          The flock of ravens, liberated from Humbaba's gut, shake
          the viscera from their feathers and take flight.

          EXT. THE CEDAR FOREST - STREAM - DAY

          Perseus, somber, washes the creature's guts from his arms
          and legs. He turns to find Vidalia standing above him,
          furious.

                         L-

          I should cast a spell upon you and

          this stream.

                         PERSEUS
          I didn't beckon the Humbaba.

                         VIDALIA
          You did, with your childish
          recklessness, and Boreas has paid
          the price!
          Perseus, already rife with guilt, is stung by the truth.

          The monster killed my friend. I

          Yes, a tyrannical Goddess, who
          dares question your mad rush to
          annihilation.

          INT. SECRET SANCTUARY OF TIAMAT (JOPPA)   - NIGHT

          A CADRE of REVOLUTIONARIES led by Fantasos is gathered.
          Agenor, the handsome scullion who made love to Andromeda,
          leads Peshet in from the rain. She is frightened; Agenor
          has misled her.

                         PESHET
          Where have you brought me?

                         AGENOR                                                       
          It's okay...                                                 
          Peshet tries to leave, but Agenor stops her.                 

                         AGENOR
          Just listen to this good man. He
          needs your help.
          Fantasos comes forward. He fixes her with a hypnotic         
          gaze.

          Peshet comes into the dark room and looks at the lump on
          Andromeda's bed. On instinct, she hurries to the bed and
          throws off the covers -- a pile of cushions, no

          Revolutionary leader, exhorts the mob, surrounded by         
          BODYGUARDS, including Agenor. As before, Fantasos seems

          The angry crowd responds, fists shaking. Peshet moves
          through the throng, desperately looking for Andromeda.
          She passes close to the rostrum and Fantasos registers
          her presence.

          still, the Kraken comes! Does the
          King build his defenses at the
          water's edge?
          "NO!" cries the crowd. Peshet is shocked to find herself
          replying with them -- "NO1" Fantasos motions for Agenor
          to continue the harangue, while Fantasos hurries off the
          stage.

                         AGENOR
          No! He makes his stand at his
          daughter's chamber door!... We
          will show Kepheus we're not
          sacrificial fodder. We will
          tremble the walls of his Basilica!
          RABID SUPPORT from the mob. Peshet stops suddenly,
          peering ahead.

          at the fringe of the crowd, Andromeda herself watches        
          from the anonymity of a hooded cloak, terrified.

          Andromeda is the one Tiamat wants!
          We die so she may live...
          As the crowd EXPLODES, Andromeda hurries away in tears.    
          Peshet fights through the crush to follow her.

          Peshet rounds a corner, frustrated. Andromeda is gone.     
          A hand grabs Peshet's shoulder, startling her. It is       
          Fantasos.

          Peshet, you've come at the right                           
          time.                                                      
          Fantasos engages her with hypnotic power. Peshet nods,     
          trance-like.                                               

                         FANTASOS
          One night soon, a gong will sound
          three times. When you hear it,
          unlock the back gate of the
          Basilica. Then go to Andromeda's
          chambers...
          (hands her a dagger)
          . and bring the Princess out.
          My men will take her to Leviathan.
          Peshet just stares at the dagger, hands trembling.         

                         FANTASOS
          Do you understand me?
          (harshly, off her non-

                         RESPONSE)
          Peshet, do you understand how
          important your part is?
          She nods, horrified by her predicament.

          FIGURES in the boulders.

          The Alkali Lotus...
          She stops, spotting something in the distance. Kosmo

          weapon ready.

          INT. TENT - DAY

          Spyros looks inside. A cauldron BUBBLES over a fresh
          fire. ALKALI LOTUS blossoms bob on the boiling broth.
          Spyros, uneasy, backs out.

          Draco, tell me what this --
          Everyone is standing perfectly still.                       
          DARK FIGURES surround them. The transformed Cleon Legion    
          lurches INTO VIEW. The only resemblance to the soldiers     
          they were is their armor.. Now they're monstrous            
          creatures: LOTOPHAGI.

          CLOSE ON A DEFORMED FOOT                                    
          as it plants in the dust. The companion foot lands          
          beside it -- completely different. TILT UP TO: Kalibos.     
          Perseus stands by Vidalia, watching the monsters.           
          Kalibos immediately focuses on the demigod. He sniffs       
          the air around Perseus.

           Mongke and Tamburlane BLAST the swarm with HANDGONNES.      
           Spyros lobotomizes one with his harpoon. Amoun opens a      
          leather sack of sand.

          Thad, Krikor and Perseus are the first there. Amoun
          tosses an arc of the black sand around them all. The
          ring of sand transforms into a dense, swirling swarm of     
          insects. Amoun shouts to the others, still fighting.

                         AMOUN
          Come on! You can pass through!
          Draco bolts for the barrier. A Lotophagi spears Kosmo,      
          killing him. Draco slides inside the swarm. He looks        
          back at Kosmo in horror.
          Polluc slashes zombies and runs toward the swarm. He's      
          almost there when one of the Lotophagi lands on him,        
          sinking fangs into his skull. Polluc sticks his sword
          into the creature; they both fall over dead. Icos and
          Spyros fight their way to the swarm and jump inside.
          Mongke and Tamburlane kill a Lotus-eater and leap over
          the corpse into the protected circle.                       
          The tide of HOWLING and SHRIEKING Lotophagi claw at the     
          barrier of insects to no avail.                             

                         AMOUN
          Only humans can penetrate the
          shield!
          Perseus takes quick stock of the group inside the swarm,    
          thinking.

                         PERSEUS
          Only humans...
          He looks over the Lotophagi and sees Vidalia out there,
          alone, flinging sling-bullets as she fights her way
          toward the barrier.

                         PERSEUS
          Drop the barrier!                                          r

                         PERSEUS
          Drop it, Amoun!
          At that moment, Kalibos grabs Vidalia and drags her to
          the top of an outcrop. At the top, he turns, LOOKS
          DIRECTLY AT PERSEUS and HOWLS, his message clear: "If
          you want to save her, come and get her." He hungrily
          rips her leather bandeau. Perseus turns to Amoun.

          Have you learned nothing? If you
          break out now, we're all at risk.
          On the boulder, Kalibos grabs Vidalia's white flesh.         
          Perseus is anguished; he knows he's in love.

          Perseus shouts at Thad, the massive Praetorian.              

                         PERSEUS
          Get down!
          Perseus backs away three steps. To the others               --    

                         PERSEUS
          Get ready to defend yourselves!
          Perseus runs, plants a foot on Thad's back and leaps out
          through the swarm, which immediately dissipates around
          the humans. They have only a moment to react as the
          stunned Lotophagi come to their senses.

                         DRACO
          Let's kill these freks!
          Perseus runs over the backs of the Lotophagi. Hurtling
          off them, he scrambles up and knocks Kalibos off Vidalia.
          Ralibos rolls, flips onto his feet and gives Perseus a
          look: "You're the one that I want."
          They face off, looking for an opening. Perseus lunges,
          thrusting his sword. Kalibos dodges, springing up the
          rocks and then down toward Perseus, acrobatic as an ape.
          Perseus rolls out of the way.
          Perseus sweeps his sword at Kalibos' head. The monster       
          catches the blade in his jaws and SNAPS IT IN TWO!           
          Bloody spittle flies from his tongue.                        
          Kalibos pounces, pins Perseus. He opens his jaw and
          sinks his teeth into Perseus' shoulder. Vidalia cracks a
          rock into Kalibos' head. The creature whirls on Vidalia
          and careens toward her, head bloody.
          Perseus leaps in the air and catches Kalibos in the back     
          with both feet, knocking him over the edge.

          Kalibos slams down on the jagged boulders and ricochets
          off, pinwheeling through the air. The grotesque figure
          hits the lower rocks head-first and his neck CRUNCHES.
          He slams into the dust, dead.
          Perseus lands on his back, weak from the bite. When he       
          tries to rise, his legs are rubbery. Vidalia catches him
          as he falls forward and lowers him gently, looking at the
          bloody puncture wounds.

          A THUNDEROUS SOUND SURGES in the distance. Vidalia scans
          the horizon.

          Draco, Spyros, Amoun and the others hack away, fending
          off the Lotophagi. Outnumbered, they won't last long.
          The earth VIBRATES. The Lotophagi are distracted,
          looking around nervously.
          Over a rise stampede SCORPIOCHS, rhino-sized scorpions.      
          Riding them, DJINN RAIDERS, flowing black silk masking       
          all but their blue eyes.                                     
          They lay into the Lotophagi. The Scorpiochs skewer the
          beasts with HUGE PINCERS. The Djinn use flashing

          in Vidalia's arms, the fading Perseus watches as the
          Djinn turn and surround the Expedition members, closing
          in.

                         PERSEUS
          Vidalia... we need to help them...
          He blacks out. Vidalia cranes to look over the edge of       
          the cliff where Kalibos fell. She is mystified by what       

                         SHE SEES:                                                    
          The deformed monster Kalibos is gone. In his place, neck     
          broken, lies a handsome, aging noble, finally at peace --    
          King Acrisius.

          EXT. SIROQUE MOUNTAINS - DJINN CARAVAN - NIGHT

          A STRING OF LIGHTS, each a lantern hanging from a
          Scorpioch's tail. The Expedition members ride on the
          Scorpioch with the Djinn. Some of the huge scorpions
          carry small box/rooms (palanquins) on their backs.

          INT. PALANQUIN - NIGHT

          Perseus lies sprawled on cushions, unconscious. Vidalia                                    
          replaces the dressing on his bite wound. Knowing he                                        
          cannot hear her --

                         VIDALIA
          To save me, you risked everything
          -- your mission, your friends...
          the fate of multitudes. Men need
          better judgment in the one who is
          meant to lead them...                                       
          No longer able to lecture, she regards him with love.       

                         TENDERLY --                                                 

                         VIDALIA
          You shouldn't have risked your
          life for me. It is a waste to                               
          save me when I'll be gone so soon.
          She strokes his hair and kisses his forehead.               

                         VIDALIA
          Thank you for your reckless
          disregard. Thank you, Perseus...
          Vidalia holds her palm above the floor and mutters a
          quick incantation. A small shoot APPEARS and SPROUTS FAT    
          PODS. Vidalia squeezes the salve from a pod and covers      
          Perseus' wound.                                             
          The wound bulges, then squirms deeper into Perseus.         
          Perseus shoots up, clutching his chest. Vidalia gently      
          lays him down.                                              
          Perseus gags. A VIPER WRIGGLES from his throat and          
          slithers away with the fat lump of infection in its         
          stomach.                                                    

                         VIDALIA

          Surviving Lotophagi chew on the bones of the fallen. One
          reaches hungrily for an Alkali Lotus in the sand, but
          suddenly the petals blacken and curl. The creature,
          spooked, sniffs the air.
          All at once, the Lotophagi age years in seconds and keel
          over, dead. The cause: Set the Void glides over,
          surveying the battlefield.

          stucco and thatch. DOORS and SHUTTERS CREAK shut as they

          The Skolothians have suffered more

          It's no wonder they shy away from

          Perseus looks ahead, where the Expedition is parting        
          company with the Djinn Raiders. only one of the Djinn is    
          staying -- SHAIKH SULEIMAN, a veiled priest.

          granite pinnacles, one towering above the others.

          They're witches in the form of
          Strix. Not a pleasant sight, a                              
          Strix. They have powerful magic                             
          and dreadful habits. Baby-eaters,
          among other things.
          (off Perseus' shock)
          But they owe me a favor. When the
          war broke out, they lent their
          power to men against the Gods in                            
          exchange for infant sacrifice.
          Tiamat struck them blind for their
          treachery. When they came for                               
          help, I fashioned them an
          artificial eye, for their Second                            
          Sight.

                         PERSEUS

          The Expedition sleeps in a drizzle.              
          WHISPERS. Shaikh Suleiman moves toward Perseus. The
          WHISPERING comes from behind his veil. He pulls a
          GLEAMING BRONZE SICKLE from his cloak. The priest, blade
          poised, stands over the sleeping Perseus.
          OUT OF THE DARKNESS runs Spyros, his harpoon raised for a
          strike.

                         SPYROS
          Stay away from my boy!
          Without touching him, the Shaikh throws the fisherman        
          over his head, where he lands hard with an "UMPH!"           
          Perseus jolts awake. He reaches for his sword, but has       
          none. Spyros struggles to his feet to start another          
          charge.
          Suleiman raises his hand and freezes Spyros in his           
          position. The Shaikh's veil has fallen, revealing his        
          frightening countenance: scaled skin of charred wood;        
          eyes like slots in a furnace. Perseus listens to the         

          WHISPERING.

                         PERSEUS
          Spyros, he means me no harm.                                 
          The Shaikh lowers his hand: Spyros falls into the dirt.
          The Shaikh pulls his veil over his face. He kneels
          before Perseus, head bowed.

                         PERSEUS
          I hear you and I understand you.
          But I don't know how.

          The Shaikh proffers the gleaming bronze sickle which has
          a zig-zag, LIGHTNING BOLT PATTERN engraved on the blade,
          honoring Zeus.

                         PERSEUS
          An offering'? I thank you and
          take it humbly, as agift from a
          friend, not an offering.
          He takes the weapon and bows his head, surprising the
          Shaikh.

                         SHAIKH SULEIMAN
          Tuj patir esti ho theos kosmosr.

          You honor my father? You honor
          Spyros?

                         SHAIKH SULEIMAN
          Ho Zeus Patir... Zeus...
          Perseus reacts, taken aback to hear it from this             
          mysterious stranger.

          stairs and GROANING ROPE BRIDGES.

          In a morning fog, the Expedition enters a circle of FREE-
          STANDING MONOLITHS white with bird crap. All around:
          regurgitated food, shredded garments and tiny human baby
          bones.
          A FLAP of WINGS and suddenly perched atop the stones are                
          the NORN SISTERS: URD, VERDANDI, and SKULD -- human-                    
          sized owls with the gray faces of old crones                (Strix).    
          Each has one central EYE SOCKET; they share one              
          ARTIFICIAL ORB. The Strix toss the Eye between them and      
          pop it in to study the arrivals.

          You've wasted a journey. I trust
          it was not a taxing one.
          The Sisters CACKLE HORRIBLY. Skuld SWOOSHES down. Icos
          and Krikor, terrified, hit the deck. Skuld tosses the
          Eye back to Urd. Perseus watches with growing
          irritation.

                         AMOUN
          Surely the beast from the sea has
          some weakness. You owe me this

          The Sisters owe nothing to you or
          any Man!
          She tosses the Eye to Verdandi, who focuses her attention
          on Perseus.

                         VERDANDI
          There's something wrong with that
          one. I don't like having him
          here.

                         SKULD
          Let me take a look.
          Verdandi tosses the Eye to Skuld. Perseus leaps and          
          snags the Eye out of mid-air. The Strix SCREECH.             
          Perseus goes to the precipice.

          No, good Sisters... the son of
          Zeus.
          The Strix react in horror and all land on the same
          monolith.

                         PERSEUS
          Since you cannot see, let me tell
          you what's about to happen. I'm
          about to throw this evil Eye to
          the rocks far below. I fear its
          journey will be a taxing one.
          The members of the Expedition are impressed; Vidalia,
          too: the young demigod shows growing leadership. The
          Strix are panicked --

          We can't tell you. We don't dare

          The stare of Medusa. No creature

          They're lying, Perseus.
          Perseus studies the Sisters, weighing his response.

          Verdandi launches and catches it in her beak, pops it in

          A round edge catches his eye. He pulls it free -- A
          SHIELD, TARNISHED AND DENTED. Unsure why it attracted
          him, he shoulders it and leaves.

          The STORM RAGES around a FLEET OF SHIPS, manned by

          mountains of water.

          The FIRST MATE shouts to the stalwart CAPTAIN.

                         FIRST MATE

          Something huge breaches the surface. The captain squints
          through the rain... and sees the GIGANTIC SCUTED TAIL of
          Leviathan. IT GOES RIGHT PAST THEM, miraculously leaving
          the fleet untouched.
          But then -- they HEAR a sound BIGGER than the typhoon.
          The dark sky gets darker as an ENORMOUS BLACK SHAPE
          appears behind the Fleet, bearing down on them at
          impossible speed --
          TIAMAT'S PALACE-GALLEON so dwarfs the Fleet that it PLOWS    
          THROUGH the other ships without noticing, obliterating

          Medusa was a tender young woman
          once -- a mortal creature of such
          rare beauty as to tempt even the
          Gods. One night, on the road
          home, she caught the eye of the
          God of Deserts and Entropy -- Set
          the Void.

          A stunning beauty, YOUNG MEDUSA, carries a water pitcher.    
          Suddenly, frightened, she turns, sees something, drops       
          the pitcher and runs.

          A SHADOW passes swiftly over the shattered pitcher, in

          But the Goddess of the Deep
          regarded Medusa with disdain. The
          prayers of such a frail and filthy
          mortal angered Tiamat.

          twist and snap and become a slithering tail. Snake heads

          Keep your eyes shut! Open them
          with Medusa and it will be your
          last look.

          He can't see her smile. Or that she regards him with
          something hotter than amusement. She tries to punch him,

          Good!
          Pleased, he doesn't sense her right cross, which knocks

          A landscape of volcanic rock. Lava pouring into the sea

          In the distance, dark ruins -- an ominous tilted facade,                                 
          half-sunk in the dried lava flow.

          Perseus, Spyros, and Draco split off toward the temple.     
          Suddenly, the two "statues," Nessus and Ixion, shake off
          their dusty skins and COME TO LIFE. They GALLOP down the
          ridge, hooves shaking the ground. They raise fearsome
          spiky maces of jagged iron.
          Vidalia readies her sling. The Shaikh draws his
          scimitar. Mongke and Tamburlane load their handgonnes,
          the others draw swords.

          Nessus and Ixion arrive. Ixion's mace catches Krikor,       
          flinging him to his death in an open lava vent. Icos
          CRIES OUT for his friend and charges in. Ixion smashes
          him to oblivion.
          Thad, enraged, races at Nessus, but the Centaur dodges      
          the massive Praetorian and kicks him in the chest,

          Nessus charges Amoun. Amoun throws a handful of sand,
          which becomes a hail of STEEL-BARBED DARTS in midair,      C
          which lash the Centaur's flesh.
          Tamburlane rolls under the beast and fires his weapon.      
          Nessus hurls the monster-hunter against a boulder and

          HIS HEAD.
          Nessus' mace shatters Shaikh Suleiman's head of charred     
          wood. BLUE FIRE shoots out his neck, ENVELOPING THE         
          CENTAUR. The burning Centaur crumples, dead.                
          Ixion SLAMS his mace down, just missing Amoun. Suddenly,    
          Vidalia's sling-bullets slice his flesh. Ixion turns and

          In the subterranean temple, we HEAR Ixion landing above;    
          dust rains into the cavern. SUNLIGHT angles through

          The men can't see it, but one wall suddenly frames a
          silhouette of MEDUSA: HAIR OF HISSING SNAKES atop a
          woman's torso, the body of a mammoth reptile.
          WE SEE only GLIMPSES of Medusa as she slides through the
          shadows. Her forked tongue tastes the air.
          CUTTING BETWEEN Spyros, Perseus and Draco, moving
          silently on opposite sides of the sanctuary.
          OUR VIEW of Draco is suddenly BLOCKED by Medusa -- she      
          coils around Draco without touching him. He HEARS the       
          RASP of SCALES ON STONE.

          I hear her, Perseus. She's near!
          Her torso behind him, she RATTLES her tail in front.
          Draco spins and slices the air. The RATTLE stops. Draco
          waits, confused.

          Medusa gingerly tugs Draco's blindfold free. Draco sees               
          the tail before him. Unthinking, he instinctively spins               
          and looks.
          Medusa's face is inches from Draco's. His muscles lock                
          and his flesh hardens to scabrous stone, emanating SMOKY              
          GAS. Medusa breathes in the vapors ecstatically.

          the VOICES of the two men, deciding which to attack.
          Perseus tries to control his shakes, jumping at every                 
          sound, head swiveling blindly. From a distance --                     

          SPYROS                                                      (O.S.)
          Perseus... I don't hear her near
          me!
          Perseus steps back and BUMPS into a column.

          Medusa is coiled around the column, harpoon stuck in her     
          bloody side. She CRAWLS DOWN toward Perseus.                 
          Perseus against the column. FROM THE TOP OF FRAME,           
          Medusa's fingers reach for his blindfold. She pulls the      
          knot and the blindfold falls.                                
          Eyes closed, Perseus slashes the air, sweeping the sickle    
          about until it SMASHES into the column -- BRINNNGI The       
          SOUND ECHOES, then FADES.                                    
          Perseus waits and listens. Then, PING!, one drop of
          Medusa's blood lands on his shield.                          
          Perseus opens his eyes and peers into his shield. In the     
          reflection on the bronze, he SEES: Movement. Snakes.         
          Searing eyes... Medusa!
          Eyes shut, he windmills his weapon above him. Medusa's       
          talons DEFLECT the blade and the sickle flies from his
          grip.                                                        
          Perseus scrambles for it on his hands and knees. Behind
          him, Medusa SLITHERS down the column and heads for           
          Perseus.
          Perseus reaches the sickle. He lifts his shield up in
          front of him and sees Medusa's reflection growing closer
          behind him.
          He shuts his eyes and wheels around, blade sweeping. A       
          soft F-THMMP as the blade slices through something...
          SILENCE. Perseus turns away and opens his eyes, looking
          into the shield. Still, Medusa looms behind him!             
          But suddenly, Medusa's head THUDS and rolls on the
          ground. The headless reflection topples over, dead.         r-

          THE AFTERMATH: the survivors -- Vidalia, Amoun, Mongke,
          and Tamburlane -- take mournful stock of their losses.
          Mongke sees something, smiles and SWEARS in his language.
          They all turn to see:
          Perseus and Spyros, spent and saddened, stand at the top
          of the Temple steps. Perseus grasps the canvas sack.
          Now it holds Medusa's head, which bloodies the whole bag
          and sends a crimson drip to the stones. There is still       
          movement in there -- squirming serpents.

                         KEPHEUS
          The relief fleet is lost.
          Monsters gather outside our walls.
          Soon I won't be able to keep my
          own people at bay. And still, no
          word from the Expedition.
          Kepheus raises a spyglass to survey the view beyond the    
          city walls.

          Andromeda has appeared. All are shocked to see her. She

          The King's men exchange looks, then bow discreetly away,    
          leaving father and daughter alone. Andromeda looks down

          Mother so...
          (turns to him)
          It's time I shared this burden
          you've carried so long.

          ignorant of this.

                         AMOUN
          Jove the Father is another name by

                         PERSEUS
          Father, we've seen much on this
          journey we cannot hold in our
          hands. Yet these things are real
          enough. At each turn, we find
          monsters and Gods.

                         SPYROS
          Yes, the evidence is everywhere
          once we leave our island. That's

          Riding behind them, Vidalia (paler and more ephemeral
          than ever) is suddenly alert. She peers into the woods,
          agitated. Then she EXCLAIMS SOFTLY, dismounts and runs
          into the woods.

          Vidalia darts through the trees. She stops, closes her

          her.

          I know this place...
          Suddenly, she hurries to the trunk of an ancient tree.

          motionless before a bare altar.

                         (UNCERTAIN)
          I know they were humans. They
          seemed so fragile. I sheltered
          them because I thought the harsh
          world would break them. Now I

          Beautiful, yes, but not fragile.
          Resilient. Fearless.

                         PERSEUS
          I was mad with fear. I was no

          A marble tablet sits on the altar, its surface defaced.
          Vidalia runs her fingers along the scoring.

          When the war began, Men ranged
          through the hills, stamping out
          any trace of God-worship they
          found.
          (touching the tablet)
          My true name was carved here.
          When it was obliterated, my
          worshippers lost faith and my last
          season began.

          How long do you have?

          Only days.

          I want no reward.                                           

                         AMOUN
          Are you so selfish? Would you                               
          risk everything for the foolish
          love of --
          A BLAST of HOT DESERT WIND blows into the Shrine. The       
          berries turn brown and shrivel.                             
          Amoun grabs his chest. Perseus and Vidalia crumple in       
          agony.
          SET THE VOID COMES INTO THE SHRINE. Amoun tries to          
          invoke a spell, but Set touches his chest and Amoun         
          splits open.                                                
          Set points at Vidalia, slamming her into the earthen        
          wall. The God is there in an instant, strangling her.       
          Perseus staggers up and swings his sickle, but Set          
          points, ripping the weapon from Perseus' hand. It flies     
          across the shrine and sinks with a CLANG into the tablet    
          that once held Vidalia's true name.                         
          Still choking Vidalia, Set grabs Perseus' arm. Perseus      
          doubles over, paralyzed by the God's touch. Suffocating,    
          Vidalia FADES MORE.                                         
          Immobilized, Perseus watches her struggle and searches      

                         HIS BEING:                                                  

                         PERSEUS                                                     
          (low, rasping)                                              
          I am half God... and now is the                             
          time...                                                     
          Perseus rises. He cocks his arm and clobbers Set with an
          ear-splitting CRACK OF THUNDER and a sparking BURST OF
          WHITE ENERGY. Set drops Vidalia and lurches back,
          aghast. BLACK BLOOD shoots from his mouth.
          Perseus, his face contorted in rage, chokes Set. The        
          God's body SPASMS and deforms in DEATH THROES.

          Perseus slams the God down in a ghastly heap, which
          liquefies into thick black blood. It seeps into the
          sandy floor, leaving an ugly stain.                          
          Perseus rushes to embrace Vidalia, who is more evanescent
          than ever. They look with pain at the remains of Amoun.      

                         VIDALIA
          I'm so sorry, Perseus.
          A look of brutal, determined resolve grows in Perseus'       
          face.

                         (IN AWE)
          You faced a God in lethal
          combat... and vanquished him.
          Never have I heard of such a
          thing.
          He looks at her, mind racing, then lifts her as he           
          stands.

                         PERSEUS
          We must go quickly now.
          He pulls the sickle from the marble with a BRINNG! The
          light flashes off Zeus' LIGHTNING BOLT PATTERN on the
          blade.

                         PERSEUS
          The combat has just begun.

          INT. HIDDEN SANCTUARY OF TIAMAT (JOPPA)   - NIGHT

          Fantasos and the LEADERS of the Revolution are gathered
          around a SACRIFICIAL FIRE. They fill the room with their

          CHANTING.

          Fantasos moves through smoke to an altar, on which is a      
          fearsome IDOL OF TIAMAT, unlike any representation we've     
          seen.

          Loyal servants...
          it may be an illusion, but the Idol seems to have taken      
          on the most subtle of life. It does not move, but it         
          breathes.

          Now comes the harvest. My legions
          stand ready at the gates. Only
          one rite of consecration remains
          before the Ascension.
          Fantasos, closest to the Idol, flinches, buffeted by an
          unseen draft.

          INT. THE BASILICA - ROYAL CHAMBERS - NIGHT

          A GONG sounds ONCE in the night. Repheus sleeps fitfully
          on a divan by the bed of the desiccated Cassiopeia.

          INT. ANDROMEDA'S CHAMBERS - NIGHT

          The GONG sounds again. CLOSE ON Andromeda's tortured
          face staring down at the city -- too CLOSE to see exactly
          where she is.

          EXT. THE BASILICA - BACK GATE - NIGHT

          The GONG sounds a THIRD TIME. Peshet opens a lock and
          sets the heavy gate ajar. She looks at the dagger in her
          palm and hurries inside.
          After a moment, four CLOAKED REBELS slip through the open    
          gate.

          Peshet enters, dagger held at her back. No sign of
          Andromeda.

                         PESHET
          My lady? Princess Andromeda?
          She goes deeper into the rooms, then GASPS, looking off,

                         ALARMED --
          Andromeda stands on the balustrade of her balcony,
          preparing to jump to her death. She turns at the sound,      
          teetering.                                                   
          Peshet rushes to her but stops when Andromeda raises a       
          knife of her own. Peshet is shocked, not afraid.             

                         ANDROMEDA
          Peshet, stop! I know what I am                               
          meant to do.

          My lady, please --

                         ANDROMEDA
          I was afraid, Peshet. Afraid to                              
          understand that the fate of so                               
          many could rest with me.                                     

                         PESHET
          Princessa, give me your hand.
          Andromeda, please. Please.

          I'm not afraid anymore. I will do                            
          what I must. I will die so that                              
          they may live.

          She turns, but Peshet leaps and grabs her, pulling her to    
          safety. They fall to the floor, both daggers CLATTERING      
          on the marble.                                               

                         PESHET
          I won't allow it, my lady. Today,                            
          you are only a Princess. One day
          your people may need a Queen ready                           
          to die for them.
          Peshet snatches up the dagger from where she dropped it.

                         PESHET                                                      C

          She stops, picks up Andromeda's knife and hands it to       s
          her. Andromeda accepts it with resolve.

          Good.

          EXT. CORRIDOR OUTSIDE ANDROMEDA'S CHAMBERS - NIGHT

          Peshet leads Andromeda out.

                         ANDROMEDA
          We must get to my mother and
          father.
          A VOICE from the darkness:

          AGENOR (O.S.)
          Your father is dead and your
          mother has been relieved of her                              
          suffering.                                                   
          The four Cloaked Rebels step into the light. Agenor          
          wipes his bloody dagger on his cloak as all four advance.

                         AGENOR
          The Princessa is coming with us.
          She has a rendezvous to keep.
          Peshet WHIPS HER DAGGER through the air; it THUDS into
          the neck of the First Rebel, killing him on his feet.
          Before he can fall, Peshet leaps to him and pulls out her    
          knife. She plants herself in front of Andromeda.             

                         PESHET
          Come and get her.                                            
          Agenor and the other two circle Peshet. She moves with       
          feline agility, but is separated from the Princess. To       
          the Second Rebel --

          Take the Princess -- alive!                                  
          The Second Rebel circles around Peshet toward Andromeda.

          Run, Princess! Save yourself.                                
          Peshet leaps on the Third Rebel.                             
          Andromeda runs away from the Second Rebel, who easily        
          closes the gap.

          He grabs her in a bear hug from behind. She spins, tiny
          within his massive arms, and is suddenly facing him. He
          JOLTS in surprise, Andromeda's knife in his belly. He
          falls on her, dead.
          Peshet wins her struggle with the Third Rebel, sinking
          her dagger in him. She GASPS. Agenor has thrust his
          blade into her ribs. She totters and COUGHS -- deep and
          bloody. Peshet falls against the wall.
          Andromeda WAILS at the sight. She is pinned beneath the      
          dead weight of the Second Rebel, unable to move. Agenor      
          finishes off Peshet and turns to the Princess.

          Vidalia is almost transparent. The Expedition reacts in      
          shock to what they see.

          FROM BEHIND THE GROUP
          They're on a shelf above the wide, flat basin that lies      
          outside Joppa. A limitless INHUMAN ARMY -- Centaurs,         
          Minotaurs, Monsters of every stripe -- fills the plain,      
          right up to the city walls.

          Among the regiments of Joppans waiting nervously for the     
          battle are ranks of fifteen-foot AUTOMATA (CLOCKWORK         
          SOLDIERS). OPERATORS feverishly work the mechanisms of       
          the steel soldiers, which flex their artificial limbs and
          weigh their massive weapons.

          Mongke and Tamburlane exchange words. For the first
          time, they look impressed -- but also delighted. This is

          You'll have to tell them yourself.
          Vidalia's voice has become weaker.

          The people are frightened. But                              
          they can triumph.. They need only
          one thing.
          Perseus turns to her, a question on his face -- "Tell
          me...                                                       11

          A hero. They're waiting for you,
          Perseus.
          Perseus looks back toward the city. At last, there is no    
          uncertainty in Perseus --

          He turns toward the Goddess, but Vidalia is gone.

          Agenor's thugs chain her to the winch at the precipice,     
          hundreds of feet above the raging sea. As the winch is      
          cranked, the chain lifts Andromeda upside down from the     
          ground.
          Agenor pulls Andromeda close and flashes a cruel grin.      
          She spits in his eye. He wipes his eyes and lets go of

          A mile offshore, a BULGE OF WATER SWELLS and plows toward
          the coast.
          The Onlookers watch in terrified awe as the swell races

          Andromeda manages to get herself swinging back and forth
          until she builds enough momentum to reach up and grasp
          the links above her. With effort, she climbs the very
          chain she dangles from, leaving a slack loop beneath.
          Leviathan's eyes break the surface below, watching          
          Andromeda. With a HOWL, Leviathan HURTLES UPWARDS, jaws
          wide.

          FROM ABOVE - ANDROMEDA
          Leviathan grows huge as it leaps for her. UP, UP, UP.
          The JAWS SNAP CLOSED... just below her climbing feet. So
          close, it BITES ON THE DROOPING SLACK OF CHAIN!
          The monster slides back down, clutching the chain in its    
          jaws. The Princessa plummets with it.                       

          UP ON THE PLATFORM
          The chain unreels wildly, pulls tight... and rips the       
          platform from its anchors. It careens over the edge,
          taking Fantasos, Agenor and their Thugs to their
          screaming death.
          A SHADOW glides over the shocked onlookers. One by one,
          they tear their gaze from the sea and look up, GASPING

          ahead of the winch and goes under.

          Leviathan hurtles downward. Andromeda flails, bound to
          the chain.

                         FAR ABOVE
          Perseus grips both the chain and the bag in his hand.        
          Leviathan spirals on, but THE WINCH CATCHES ON A REEF and    
          the chain SNAPS! Andromeda, suddenly separated from the      
          monster, sinks, weighted by her shackles.                    
          Perseus, swimming with the raw power of a porpoise, dives    
          after her, but loses his grip on the bag. Desperate, he      
          looks back and forth: Andromeda, the sack -- both
          sinking. Perseus goes after the sack.                        
          Leviathan realizes it has lost the Princess. Huge eyes
          darting, it spots Andromeda and surges down after her.
          Andromeda, drowning, passes out. Tiny bubbles leak from      
          her nose. Leviathan swims down to her, eye as big as her     
          entire body.
          The wreck of a SUNKEN WHALER rests on the ocean floor.
          The Medusa sack FALLS INTO VIEW and catches on a harpoon
          wedged in the deck. Perseus appears, snags the sack and
          is about to kick upward. On impulse, he grabs the
          harpoon.
          Leviathan opens its huge jaws. Andromeda is sucked           
          toward the maw.
          Perseus swims upward toward Leviathan's tail. Perseus        
          concentrates -- a sparking BURST OF WHITE ENERGY shoots      
          through his forearm to the harpoon in his grip.
          LIGHTNING CRACKLES and BOILS the water. He plunges the
          harpoon in the Kraken's tail --
          -- at the same moment Leviathan inhales the unconscious
          Andromeda.
          Contact -- an ELECTRIC FLASH-POINT FLARES and a charge       
          races up Leviathan's spine. Jolted, the monster spits        
          Andromeda out.                                               
          The Kraken twists to lock its enraged gaze on Perseus.       
          Perseus shuts his eyes and yanks Medusa's head from the
          sack. Medusa's hellish eyes ignite channels of boiling
          energy into Leviathan's enormous eyeballs -- hardening
          them to boiled eggs, then rocky spheres.

          The monster thrashes, tries to turn -- but unbending
          stone races its length, freezing the gargantuan curves --
          the scuted tail locks mid-flail into a final, permanent
          hook.
          Dead in the water, the grotesque mass sinks like a           
          mountain range, picking up speed as it plunges into the

          Perseus must swim like a God to snatch Andromeda from the    
          downward tug. The stone Kraken barely misses them as it      

                         DROPS --                                                     
          -- and CRASHES in a cloud of silt, SHAKING THE OCEAN
          FLOOR like an earthquake. A CRACK opens in the seabed
          and sucks back the silt. The trench deepens and streaks
          away across the seabed, swallowing all the water above
          it, creating a giant opening to the sky.

          Tiamat's face contorts, sensing her beloved Leviathan is
          dead. She turns at the sound of GHASTLY CREAKING -- the
          immense length of the galleon buckles into a hole in the
          ocean. As the towering masts drop below wave-level,
          Tiamat raises her arms to the sky --

          mud, exhausted.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          114.

          EXT. OCEAN SURFACE - DAY

          The water stills. The sea calms. No sign of Perseus or
          Andromeda. WIND and QUIET...
          CHOOM! Perseus surfaces with Andromeda in his arms,          

          GASPING FOR AIR.

          EXT. CLIFFS OF JOPPA - DAY

          The onlookers rejoice.

          EXT. OCEAN SURFACE - DAY

          BACK WITH Perseus and Andromeda. He looks at her             
          lifeless countenance in agony -- has he failed again as      
          he did with Anteros the fisherman??                          
          Distraught, his muscles go taut around Andromeda, and a      
          short powerful burst of electric energy shoots from his
          arms into her still body -- SHE JOLTS TO LIFE!               
          Movement! Breath! Color returns to her face. Perseus,
          too, breathes again, relieved.
          For the first time since the start of the adventure, they
          find themselves alone, holding each other.

                         PERSEUS
          Hello.
          (as she smiles,

                         RELIEVED)
          Are you all right?
          She takes a moment, doing an inventory. Finally, she
          nods.

                         ANDROMEDA
          I think I am.
          He smiles. She'll never know how close they came to          
          oblivion.

                         ANDROMEDA
          Are you ready to become a king?
          His expression is kind, but unmistakable. "No." She          
          accepts that, rueful.

                          

                         PERSEUS
          Are you ready to become a queen?

                         (CONTINUED)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          115.

                         CONTINUED:
          She thinks about it, her face beginning to light with
          confidence.

                         ANDROMEDA
          Yes. Yes, I am.

                         PERSEUS
          Then you're ready to go home.
          Perseus raises one arm. The-AIR reverberates to a LOUD      
          BEATING OF WINGS. Andromeda looks up in wonder.
          Pegasus appears out of the sun's glare, gracefully          
          alighting on the water. Perseus helps Andromeda up and
          then climbs on behind her.
          Pegasus takes off. TILT UP WITH them until they are lost    
          from sight.

                         DISSOLVE TO:

          EXT. BLUE SKY AND WHITE CLOUDS - DAY

          Black smoke RISES to dirty the perfect sky. TILT DOWN

                         TO:

          EXT. SACRED GROUND - DAY

          The Sacred Ground of Joppa in the verdant hills, above      
          the sea, is so beautiful it might be mistaken for           
          Olympos.
          TWO FUNERAL PYRES burn. The citizens of Joppa, by the       
          thousands, commend King Kepheus and Queen Cassiopeia to     
          the afterlife.                                              
          MOVING OVER THE CROWD, WE PUSH THROUGH the flame to find    
          the new ruler of Joppa. Mournful, but cloaked in regal      
          dignity and strength -- QUEEN ANDROMEDA.                    

                         CUT TO:

          A DISTANT POV OF THE QUEEN
          The ceremony and the heavenly setting.

                         PERSEUS
          Perseus views the scene from a nearby hill. Behind him,
          Pegasus waits patiently, grazing the grass. Until --        

                         (CONTINUED)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          116.

                         CONTINUED:
          -- the equine suddenly WHINNIES and REARS UP. Just as
          quickly, Pegasus goes silent and BOWS DOWN. Perseus          
          looks in that direction, to find --
          ZEUS the Prime, God of Gods, an eagle perched on his arm.
          He couldn't look more imposing.

                         ZEUS
          Am I to understand you do not
          intend to make this union with the
          Queen Andromeda?

                         PERSEUS
          Yes.

                         ZEUS
          Despite my will and intention that
          you do so?

                         PERSEUS
          Yes.

                         ZEUS
          Would you choose to condemn Men,
          your own people, to suffer more of
          this devastating War?

                         PERSEUS
          I have no people. You have
          stranded me between realms,
          neither man nor God.

                         ZEUS

                         (STERNLY)
          Do you reproach Zeus?

                         PERSEUS
          No. I thank you... Father.
          Zeus, mighty God, reacts to the word. His expression
          softens and he looks on Perseus with growing pride.

                         PERSEUS
          You have freed me. I will not be
          a pawn for Men or Gods.

                         ZEUS
          Does that absolve you suddenly of
          your responsibilities?

                         PERSEUS
          You've made me understand that my
          responsibility is to myself. So
          it is with us all.

          117.

                         CONTINUED:

                         PERSEUS

                         (INTIMATELY)
          You've put me to a great test. In
          the midst of it, I found the
          courage in my heart to defy Gods.
          I do not know how much of that
          comes from you, Father... and how
          much from my Mother, who I never
          knew.
          Zeus starts, subtly, at the mention of Queen Danae.

                         PERSEUS
          It matters not. Whatever the
          source, I are only grateful.
          He looks off toward the funeral pyres and the human
          throng.

                         PERSEUS
          This war will end the moment you
          choose for it to end... and Men
          agree. I think, perhaps, that is
          the free will that all realms
          share.
          Zeus looks at him, proud, yet wistful -- what an
          offspring, what a creation!

                         ZEUS
          What will you do, Man of free
          will?
          Perseus motions Pegasus forward, and swings up onto his
          back.

                         PERSEUS
          I'm going to find Vidalia.

                         ZEUS
          So... my Son, you will be a pawn
          for love?

                         PERSEUS

                         (LAUGHS)
          Yes, Father, gladly.
          Perseus spurs Pegasus and launches into the sky. And
          soars away.

          FADE OUT.

        EXT. MOUNTAIN RANGE - HELICOPTER SHOT - DAY

        An unparalleled set of sheer mountains -- part of the Colorado
        Rockies. The peaks rise a challenging half mile and more out
        of the valley -- wind-whipped snow mists over the mountains
        like a low fog. The tranquility is broken as a helicopter
        BLASTS into view, fighting the wind as it heads for the center
        of it all.

        Our CREDITS fly us past and through this magnificent range.
        There are sky-piercing peaks that slope up to a narrow, high
        pinnacle -- and others that are steel, straight-up approaches
        to large plateaus. One of the mountains has a crystal lake on
        top -- with a waterfall that drains from it and exits from the
        middle of a mountain wall. Nearby, an abandoned cable ladder
        is bolted into the same wall, leading to the top.

        BACK IN THE HELICOPTER

        We can see a man sitting in its doorway, looking out --

        INT/EXT HELICOPTER - BINOCULAR POV

        The glasses scan systematically, slowly -- to us, it looks
        like nothing more than a field of gray and white.

                                        FRANK (O.S.)
                      Nothing yet.

        EXT. THE MOUNTAINS - LONG SHOT

        The helicopter now circles this tallest mountain -- "The
        Tower", separated from a lower but equally formidable peak by
        a chasm of two hundred feet -- that drops 3,500 feet below.

        INSIDE HELICOPTER - FRANK AND MAGGIE

        Spotter FRANK NEWELL (50s) scans the mountain wall.  MAGGIE
        DEIGHAN (30s) expertly pilots the helicopter through the storm
        winds. Both wear orange jackets identifying themselves as
        members of the Rocky Mountain Park Rescue Team.

                                        FRANK
                      Wait a minute -- there's Hal.
                            (beat)
                      And his date.

        BINOCULAR POV - A LEDGE

        that's part of the smaller peak. HAL TUCKER (30s) and his 
        "date", SUSAN COLLINS (20s), are decked out in climbing gear.  
        Hal's aplomb suggests he's a veteran climber -- Susan's
        worried look shows she isn't. Hal and Susan huddle together,
        both cold, but okay. Hal has a makeshift splint wrapped
        around his lower leg, and a slow burning flare in one hand.

        INSIDE HELICOPTER

        Frank lowers his glasses -- Maggie struggles with the wind.

                                        MAGGIE
                      How do they look?

        BINOCULAR POV - HAL AND SUSAN

        Hal, now aware of the copter, looks towards it, smiling -- and
        starts jerking off the flare.

                                        FRANK (O.S.)
                      He's signalling "okay."

                                        MAGGIE (O.S.)
                      Where's Gabe?

        The POV dips down -- there's somebody climbing below, in an
        orange rescue jacket.

                                        FRANK (O.S.)
                      Right where he's supposed to be.

        CLOSER ON THE CLIMBER

        This is GABE WALKER (30s). In spite of the cold and the snow,
        he's fearlessly, swiftly scaling the tower without safety
        lines, as if he's done it a hundred times. That's because he
        has done it a hundred times. This is what Gabe lives for.

        ON THE LEDGE

        Gabe, almost there, finds a fingertip-width handhold at arm's
        length -- grabbing it, he pulls himself up on the ledge with a
        move that's just a little tougher than chinning yourself on a
        doorjamb. Winded, Gabe slumps down next to the couple, and
        tries to light a cigarette. The lighter only sparks.

                                        HAL
                      Excuse me -- I know you're my
                      salvation, and all -- do you think you
                      could rescue us before your smoke
                      break?

        Hal pulls out a box of wooden matches and lights one Bogart
        style, one-handed with a thumbnail, cupping a hand to shield
        it against the wind. Gabe bends down for it -- a familiar
        routine. We know in a glance they've been friends for years.

                                        GABE
                      Maybe you could tell me why I am
                      rescuing you.

                                        HAL
                      Basically -- I've fallen down, and I
                      can't get up...

                                        GABE
                            (into radio)
                      Rescue One -- have located helpless
                      climber, please prepare idiot line
                      for transport, over --

        THE HELICOPTER dips down towards the ledge -- no way can it
        land there. Frank lowers a rescue wire to

        GABE

        who precariously swings out from the ledge to grab it -- the
        wire is just out of reach. Hal grabs the radio.

                                        HAL
                      Rescue One -- please remind me to tell
                      you about the time I hauled your hero
                      here down Mt. Huntington on my back,
                      over --

                                        MAGGIE (O.S.)
                            (through radio)
                      Hal, if I hear that story one more
                      time, I'm making you limp down the
                      entire three thousand feet, over --

        Gabe finally grabs the line, secures it to a heavy piton, and
        hammers it into the wall.

                                        GABE
                            (to Susan)
                      This guy showing you a good time?

        THE HELICOPTER

        swings over across to the facing mountain -- Maggie lands the
        copter, in spite of the winds, on a small plateau. Frank gets
        out to secure the wire -- there's now a lifeline spanning the
        chasm.

        ON THE LEDGE

        Gabe finishes anchoring the line in the rock -- he
        extinguishes his cigarette in the snow, and naturally, pockets
        the butt. Hal, propped up against the wall, expertly rigs a
        seat harness around his legs -- Susan helps him get part of it
        around his splint, and Gabe clips it to the line.

                                        GABE
                      Now, remember -- keep your arms and
                      legs within the vehicle at all
                      times --

                                        HAL
                            (laughing)
                      Fuck you --

        With that, Hal pulls himself hand-over-hand across the sloping
        line -- Hal makes a point of looking down --

        HAL'S POV -- THE DROP

        is vertigo defined. Thirty five hundred feet straight down.
        You could stack the World Trade Center towers on top of each
        other and they'd still be shorter than this mountain is high.
        However --

        HAL

        lets go of the overhead line and claps his hands to his face
        in mock horror -- he quickly whizzes down the last thirty feet
        of the line, where Frank catches him and pulls him out. Hal
        gets out of the harness, checks every stitch of it, signals
        thumbs-up, and sends it back.

        THE LEDGE

        Gabe, retrieves the harness on a small attachment line, and
        gives Susan a reassuring smile, but she's still, sensibly,
        very scared. Gabe recovers the harness, rigs Susan into it,
        and meticulously re-checks it.

                                        GABE
                      Ready?
                            (sees she's afraid)
                      Did he tell you about the time he
                      almost made it up Everest?

                                        SUSAN
                      He said you gave him a bad oxygen mask
                      --

                                        GABE
                      Well, if he's bored you with that
                      bullshit, then this has to be the best
                      part of a bad date. Right?

        Susan nervously laughs.

                                        GABE
                      Ready?

                                        SUSAN
                            (scared but tough)
                      Okay --

        Gabe starts to push her out on the line, but she grabs his arm
        in a panic.

                                        SUSAN
                      I can't --

        Susan starts to tilt her head down -- Gabe gently takes hold
        of her chin, turning her view up to face him.

                                        GABE
                      Yes you can.
                            (reassuring)
                      You can do it. Don't look down.  The
                      whole way across, don't look down.
                      Look at me. Just keep looking at me --
                      and you'll be okay.

        Susan looks at Gabe -- trying to be confident -- nods.

                                        GABE
                      Sure?

                                        SUSAN
                      Yeah.
                            (beat)
                      I have always depended on the kindness
                      of Rangers.

        Gabe grins and gently pushes her out. Susan tentatively pulls
        herself across -- then develops a rhythm, building speed --

        GABE'S POV - SUSAN

        inching away in the harness, looking more confident now --

        SUSAN'S POV - GABE

        signalling "OK" -- "you're doing fine" --

        SUSAN - ANOTHER ANGLE

        thirty feet out, going fine --

        INSERT -- A HARNESS CLIP

        holding the strap under Susan's left leg breaks --

        GABE'S POV - SUSAN

        The harness completely unravels all at once, its strands
        shoot through the clips -- what was a seat has become a trap
        door in half a second -- as the harness shoots out from under
        her, Susan falls but grabs the harness strand --

        HAL

        is helpless, and can only watch as

        SUSAN

        too scared to breathe, dangles on the remaining strand of what
        used to be the harness -- she sways from the wind and the jerk
        of her own weight, her grip loosens --

        INSERT - THE TOP CLIP

        that is supporting all of Susan's weight is being seriously
        tested -- a single knot in the harness has caught there, but
        it clearly won't last long --

        GABE

        moves back from the ledge.

                                        GABE
                            (loud, in control)
                      Hold on. I'm coming out to get you.

        Gabe gently pulls himself up on the line, crosses his ankles
        on it, and clips himself on with a three foot safety line.
        Gabe starts smoothly, quickly pulling himself out, but --

        SUSAN

        is in trouble -- the bobbing of the line from Gabe's weight
        and the winds are making her lose her grip even more --

        GABE

        urgently pulls himself along the line faster, trying not to
        shake the line. As he gets closer and closer to a terrified
        Susan, his eyes lock on hers --

                                        GABE
                      Keep looking at me. Hold on --

        WIDER ANGLE

        Gabe is only ten feet away from --

        SUSAN

        who stares at Gabe, petrified -- this focus is helping, but
        her strength is just about gone --

        INSERT - THE CLIP

        The knot has worked itself halfway through -- it doesn't make
        any difference how tight she holds on to the harness, the
        harness itself is letting go --

        ON GABE

        who knows it and pulls himself the rest of the way, a little
        faster, almost bridging the gap --

        ON SUSAN

        staring desperately at Gabe, holding on --

        INSERT - THE TOP CLIP

        that's keeping Susan alive surrenders the knot -- it passes
        through, and

        SUSAN

        falls --

        GABE

        deliberately lets go of the main line and launches himself
        at Susan --

        THEIR HANDS

        miss --

        ANGLE ON BOTH

        Gabe's three foot safety line pulls taut, testing the limits
        of the line above as it yanks him back --

        GABE'S POV - SUSAN

        is just out of reach -- her hand is still stretched out, her
        eyes still locked on

        GABE

        who can only look down, swaying helplessly on the wire as
        Susan's SCREAM starts --

        ON THE OPPOSITE SIDE

        Frank and Maggie look down in horror, but neither look as
        anguished as Hal --

        LONG SHOT - SUSAN

        falling -- falling -- falling -- looking very small against
        the vast mountain range --

        SUSAN'S POV - FALLING

        from this height takes the longest nineteen seconds you can
        imagine --

        GABE

        twists from his safety line, spinning helplessly -- he wants
        to, but can't, shut his eyes --

        GABE'S POV - THE CHASM

        Susan is gone. Her SCREAM, cut short, echoes -- the "safety"
        harness spirals down after her like a carefree bird --

                                                          SMASH CUT TO:

        INT/EXT SMALL AIRLINER - GABE'S POV OUT WINDOW - DAY

        As the plane dips to land, Gabe can see a bird circling far
        below, over the same mountainous terrain.

        INT. SMALL AIRLINER - GABE

        sweating, panting, awake. It hasn't been that long since the
        accident -- a year, to be exact -- but he looks older. He
        looks as if he's watched Susan Collins drop at least one
        hundred times. Gabe reels himself in as a STEWARDESS hands him
        a glass of water.

                                        STEWARDESS
                      Take this.
                            (Gabe does)
                      Afraid of flying?

        Gabe shakes his head.

                                        GABE
                      Falling.

        INT. TERMINAL - DAY

        Gabe, with no luggage, is at the small airport's only car
        rental counter, doing the paperwork for a RENTAL AGENT.

                                        RENTAL AGENT
                      Midsize?

                                        GABE
                      Any size, any color, any model.

                                        RENTAL AGENT
                      How long will you be needing it?

                                        GABE
                            (flat)
                      Just under six hours.

                                        MAGGIE (O.S.)
                      You aren't wasting any time, are you?

        Gabe turns and looks at

        MAGGIE

        who is standing off to the side.

                                        MAGGIE
                      I knew you'd be coming by. Today.

        Gabe's happy to see her -- but at the same time, he isn't.
        She looks too good -- and she brings up quite a mixed bag of
        memories. Maggie carves on a smile.

                                        MAGGIE
                      If you're in that much of a hurry, why
                      don't you ride with me?

        INT. RESCUE HELICOPTER - DAY

        Maggie pilots the copter, heading out toward the mountain
        range. Gabe fiddles with some of the equipment inside. Both
        grope for a way to start the conversation.

                                        GABE
                      This is new...

                                        MAGGIE
                      It's a thermal scope -- picks up body
                      heat of lost hikers --

        Gabe flicks it on, looks at the total absence of heat as they
        fly over the snow.

                                        GABE
                      Still find the dead ones the old
                      fashioned way, I guess.

        So much for small talk. Gabe is clearly uneasy watching these
        mountains go by. Maggie breaks an awkward silence --

                                        MAGGIE
                      You could have said goodbye.

                                        GABE
                            (shakes head)
                      If I did, I'd have to listen to you
                      tell me one more time that it wasn't
                      my fault.

                                        MAGGIE
                            (angry)
                      Today -- especially today -- you get
                      to hear it again. The harness clip
                      broke.  Cold stress -- one in a
                      million equipment failure. You and
                      Hal could have checked it from then
                      till now and it still would have
                      happened.
                            (beat)
                      You did everything right --

                                        GABE
                      -- If I did everything right, Susan
                      Collins would still be alive.

        THE HELICOPTER

        whizzes on to the Ranger station -- a small building by an old
        country road. Not much activity outside of some ROOKIE
        CLIMBERS working out on a CLIMBING PRACTICE WALL. Maggie
        starts to land the copter, and as she does --

        INSIDE THE COPTER

                                        GABE
                      Do you really believe all that?  That
                      it wasn't our fault?

        Maggie slows the rotor, her eyes on the controls. Gabe's eyes
        are locked on her.

                                        MAGGIE
                            (turns to Gabe)
                      Yes. Yes, I do.

        But she answered a half beat too slow. The helicopter touches
        ground.

                                        GABE
                      I'm not sure what I wish more, Maggie.
                      That you meant what you said, just now
                      -- or that it were really true then.

        EXT. RANGER STATION

        Hal, wearing Sheriff's garb, storms towards Maggie's side of
        the copter as the engine shuts off and the rotor dies.

                                        HAL
                      Maggie, where the hell have you been?
                      I've got two climbers out --

        Gabe gets out of the copter, and Hal sees him for the first
        time. Unlike the last time we saw them, neither man is glad to
        see the other. Hal turns on Maggie.

                                        HAL
                      Brett and Evan are up there again to
                      jump off the spur. Their wives called
                      twice. I want you in the air and I
                      want them found before the storm
                      system moves in.
                            (Maggie hesitates)
                      Now.

        Maggie takes off as Gabe and Hal step away from the copter.
        Gabe eyes Hal's uniform and almost -- not quite but almost --
        laughs.

                                        GABE
                      Christ. You're in charge of Rescue
                      now?

                                        HAL
                      There was a vacancy. Maybe you heard
                      about it. The last guy lost his nerve
                      and lit out of town.

                                        GABE
                      Well, you're a better man than I am,
                      Hal. Nothing rattles you.

        The rookie climbers get off the practice wall to watch this
        faceoff. Gabe and Hal are one crack away from beating hell out
        of each other. Frank heads over to defuse the confrontation.

                                        FRANK
                            (steering Gabe away)
                      Gabe! Long time, son -- why don't you
                      come meet some of the new guys --

                                        GABE
                      Good idea. Say, Hal?
                            (beat)
                      Why don't you come with me so we can
                      show these rookies how to death-rig a
                      woman properly?

        That tears it -- Hal rushes Gabe and they pummel each other
        until Frank and the others pull them apart, panting and
        bleeding.  Hal throws off the men holding him back -- but
        instead of going at Gabe again, Hal throws Gabe a set of car
        keys.

                                        HAL
                      Take the Bronco to where you're going.
                      I've already been. Then go back to
                      wherever it is you like to hide. And
                      stay there.

        Hal heads back into the office -- Gabe heads for the Bronco.

                                                           CUT TO:

        EXT. DENVER MINT - HIGH ANGLE - DAY

        The Southwest regional center for printing and distributing
        currency. Hundreds of troops stand guard over the impressive
        U.S. Treasury complex.

        INT. TREASURY COMPOUND - A HUGE PRINTING PRESS

        is at work -- the ROAR of its parts is deafening as it stamps
        out a plate design on huge sheets of paper -- we move in on

        THE PAPER

        which is moved by mechanical arm to a SLICER that razors the
        bills apart -- it's moving too fast for us to see the
        denomination -- the cut bills are separated by --

        FOUR SEPARATION CHUTES

        that fire the bills down to a mechanical COUNTER that
        serializes, counts, bands and stacks them faster than any
        human could -- a HAND reaches to pick up a band --

        THE BILLS

        are something a banker could work a lifetime without seeing,
        but are real nonetheless --  $5,000 bills, banded here in
        hundreds. The band is put back in the growing stack by

        RICHARD TRAVERS

        mid-thirties, a tough, imposing Treasury agent -- he regards
        the fortune piling up in front of him with only cold,
        professional interest. Travers is flanked by a trio of equally
        tough TREASURY AGENTS -- he turns to flunky DAVIS (20s). It's
        clear who's in charge of protecting the money here, and who's
        in charge of counting it.

                                        TRAVERS
                      Tell Wright the San Francisco shipment
                      is ready.

                                        DAVID
                            (phone already out)
                      Right away, Mr. Travers.

        As Davis dials we move to --

        THE OFFICE

        of WALTER WRIGHT (50s), comptroller of currency -- his
        demeanor suggests he's in control, and used to keeping it that
        way.

                                        WRIGHT
                            (into phone)
                      Good -- good. I'll be right down.

        As Wright gets up from his desk, though, we hear in the outer
        office --

                                        SECRETARY (O.S.)
                      You can't go in there --

                                        MATHESON (O.S.)
                      Watch me.

        KURT MATHESON (30s) bursts into the office, trailed by
        Wright's flustered SECRETARY.

                                        MATHESON
                      Walter Wright?
                            (flashes badge)
                      Matheson. FBI. We need to talk.

        PRINTING COMPOUND - THE MONEY

        has now been packed into a trio of metal briefcases -- ten 
        thousand $5,000 bills. Travers shuts the cases in turn, and
        locks each with an electronic key card, triggering a FLASHING
        RED LIGHT on the locks as he does. A uniformed PILOT shows up
        behind Travers as he cuffs the cases to the hands of the three
        other agents.

                                        PILOT
                      We'll be fueled and ready in ten
                      minutes, Mr. Travers.

                                        TRAVERS
                            (an order)
                      Be ready in five.

                                        MATHESON (O.S.)
                      Go ahead and take ten. We'll need the
                      time.

        Travers looks up at Matheson, who has just arrived with
        Wright. Travers is instantly furious at the challenge to his
        authority.

                                        MATHESON
                            (flashes badge)
                      Matheson. FBI.

                                        TRAVERS
                            (looking down at it)
                      Your parents must be proud.
                            (to Wright)
                      What the fuck is this about?

                                        WRIGHT
                      Small problem with the shipment,
                      Travers.
                            (to Matheson)
                      Tell him what you just told me.

        Matheson draws out a file and hands it to Travers.

                                        MATHESON
                      We got word that somebody's been
                      observing your currency shipments --
                      this load, the $5,000s -- over the
                      last three deliveries.

                                        TRAVERS
                            (laughs)
                      There isn't a hell of a lot anyone can
                      do but observe.
                            (beat)
                      This is the most protected shipment
                      we've got -- and the most useless for
                      a thief. Those bills aren't in
                      circulation. You think five thousand
                      dollar bills are easy to pass? Who the
                      fuck would try?

        Matheson hands Travers a folder.

                                        MATHESON
                      This guy might.

        We look over Travers' shoulder at the photos, which are all
        blurry, all blown up from different surveillance pictures --
        and all of them show ERIC QUALEN.

                                        TRAVERS
                      Who is he?

                                        MATHERS
                            (patient)
                      His name's Eric Qualen. One of the
                      East German spies who got shut out by
                      the reunification. The CIA issued an
                      inter-agency warning about him right
                      after the wall came down. He's got
                      nowhere to go and nothing to lose.
                      He's also got the international
                      connections to get rid of bills like
                      these -- and he's probably desperate
                      enough to try for them. Fifty million
                      bucks buys a lot of sanctuary.

                                        TRAVERS
                      Could you get to the part where I'm
                      supposed to care?

                                        MATHESON
                            (shows him more photos)
                      We had two agents monitoring him.
                      These two -- Gleason and Quinones.
                      Their last report said he was going to
                      try to take this shipment.

                                        TRAVERS
                            (turning away)
                      Thanks for the tip. But I've got work
                      to do.

                                        MATHESON
                            (stopping him)
                      Did I say "last" report? I think I
                      did. I mean last fucking report.
                      These guys have vanished.

                                        TRAVERS
                      You have my sympathy, but --
                            (exasperated)
                      There's a reason we do things this
                      way, all right? Armored cars can be
                      hijacked. Trains can be derailed. But
                      nobody can get to us in flight. The
                      only time this is on the ground is at
                      the mint, or on the Presidio runway in
                      San Francisco. Either way, someone
                      would have to shoot his way past a
                      couple of thousand guards.

        Matheson still isn't convinced.

                                        TRAVERS
                      If you're worried about an inside job,
                      forget it. I checked the plane from
                      top to bottom an hour ago. And these
                      three are my best against. Even if one
                      of them did go skydiving, they
                      wouldn't get far. Each case has an
                      electronic tracer with a range of one
                      hundred miles.

        Travers pulls a tracking device about the size of a watchman
        out of his jacket pocket. The small screen shows three red
        blips at rest -- matching the three currency cases.

                                        TRAVERS
                            (facing down Matheson)
                      I haven't lost a bill in eight years.
                      And I'm not scrubbing this shipment
                      because you scare easily.

                                        MATHESON
                            (an easy smile)
                      Who said anything about stopping the
                      shipment?
                            (beat)
                      I've been tracking Qualen for almost a
                      year. If he pulls something, I want to
                      be in on the party.

        Travers, angry, turns to Wright. Wright clearly doesn't like
        this either, but is resigned to it.

                                        WRIGHT
                      This is cleared from the top, Travers.
                      Matheson will accompany you on the
                      flight to San Francisco.
                            (beat)
                      Show him every professional courtesy.

        Travers turns back to a smiling Matheson, looking like he'd
        rather kill him instead, as we --

        EXT. MOUNTAIN RANGE - MAGGIE'S HELICOPTER

        is being buffeted by storm winds and a light snow -- Maggie
        struggles hard with the controls, but --

        INSIDE HELICOPTER

        Visibility is near zero. Maggie keys the radio.

                      Negative, Hal -- storm's already
                      moving in -- I can't see them, and
                      winds are too strong to stay up
                      here -- over --

                      Rescue One -- abort. They'll be all
                      right. Brett and Evan are dumb enough
                      not to log in, but they're smart
                      enough to have storm gear. Head back
                      to base.
                            (not unkindly)
                      Maybe you can catch Gabe before he
                      leaves. Over.

                                        MAGGIE
                      I don't think he's planning a long
                      visit, Hal.
                            (back to business)
                      Rescue One heading back to base, over
                      and out.

        THE HELICOPTER

        banks a 180 to fly back -- we can see over the horizon that
        the storm is moving in fast.

        INT. CAVE - DAY

        We can hear Maggie's helicopter flying off overhead -- camped
        inside the cave are BRETT and EVAN, both 20s, both shivering,
        amid their gear -- backpacks, cooking stuff -- and parachutes.
        These are Colorado rock jocks -- thrillseekers who'll try
        anything if the odds are strong enough they'll die in the
        process.

                                        EVAN
                            (freezing)
                      Way to check the weather, Brett.

                                        BRETT
                            (shivering yet macho)
                      Hey. If it were easy, it wouldn't be
                      worth d-doing.

                                                           CUT TO:

        EXT. TREASURY JET (DC-9) - DAY

        The DC-9 cruises over increasingly mountainous, remote
        terrain.

        INT. JET - CLOSE ON TRAVERS

        who looks tense -- we MOVE AROUND the cabin and find two more
        relaxed Treasury agents are dozing on the opposite side of the
        plane, their arms chained to the currency cases. Matheson is
        edgy. Another AGENT offers some condescending reassurance.

                                        AGENT
                      Just enjoy the view, huh?
                            (Matheson says nothing)
                      Relax. I mean, what could happen in
                      the air?

        Matheson turns back to his window and looks down --

        WINDOW POV - THE GROUND BELOW

        is covered with snow -- the jet's shadow moves sleekly and
        plainly over it. But after a moment we see -- -- another
        jet's shadow on the ground, coming up fast!

        INSIDE THE DC-9 - MATHESON

        reacts this and shifts his look upward to --

        WINDOW POV - ANOTHER PLANE (GULFSTREAM)

        is flying a parallel course to the Treasury jet, and is just
        one hundred yards away. Close enough to see Eric Qualen's face
        in one of the windows.

        INSIDE THE PLANE

        Matheson stands -- Travers has noticed the plane by now too,
        and gets out of his seat as the other agents react.

                                        TRAVERS
                            (to other agents)
                      Stay put! Don't panic, goddammit!

        Travers moves into

        THE COCKPIT

        where the pilot seems nervous, but oddly, not frightened.

                                        PILOT
                      He's coming in too slow.

                                        TRAVERS
                            (cool)
                      No -- we're going too fast, and we're
                      too high up. Push flaps forward twenty
                      degrees and drop to five thousand
                      feet.

        THE CABIN

        Matheson is out of his seat, pistol drawn. Seems a little puny
        under the circumstances.

                                        MATHESON
                            (to agent)
                      You got any rifles?

                                        AGENT
                      Forward compartment -- left side --

        Matheson rushes through a curtain to the area between the
        cabin and the cockpit and pulls open a closet door. To his
        horror, he finds inside not rifles, but

        TWO DEAD BODIES

        who we'll recognize as the missing FBI agents from the photos
        Matheson showed Travers.

        MATHESON

        backs up in horror -- and he sees Travers calmly coming out of
        the cockpit. Rattled, Matheson pulls his gun on Travers.
        Travers looks dumbfounded -- then angry.

                                        TRAVERS
                      What the hell are you doing --

                                        MATHESON
                      Checked the plane from top to bottom,
                      huh? You fucker --
                            (clicks hammer back)
                      Put your hands behind your head! It's
                      over!

        Travers puts his hands out and walks forward -- slowly,
        backing Matheson into the cabin. Not in surrender, but as if
        he's calming a nutcase. The other agents see this and don't
        know which way to jump.

                                        TRAVERS
                      Calm down -- give the gun to me --

                                        MATHESON
                            (to other agents)
                      There's a couple of dead bodies in the
                      front compartment -- they're FBI
                      agents --

                                        TRAVERS
                      He's losing it --

        They now think Matheson is crazy too -- he looks nuts -- the
        other agents move behind him. Matheson gets even more frantic
        and point his gun at them.

                                        MATHESON
                      Goddamn it! Don't you see what he's
                      doing! He's hijacking the fucking
                      shipment!
                            (back to Travers)
                      Don't make me shoot you!

        The other two agents get behind Matheson and rapidly disarm
        him. Travers pulls out his gun with a slow, leisurely move.

                                        TRAVERS
                      Don't make me laugh.

        Travers FIRES his gun three times, one for each agent's
        chest -- the agents are cut down, realizing too late what's
        happened. A fourth SHOT knocks Matheson over a seat as if he'd
        been kicked. Travers puts his gun away and puts on a radio
        headset as he goes to a window.

                                        TRAVERS
                            (to mouthpiece)
                      Move into position.

        EXT. QUALEN'S JET - GULFSTREAM

        maneuvers over the DC-9 -- and holds steady above it.

                                                           CUT TO:

        EXT. CEMETERY MARKER - COLORADO - DAY

        The stone reads "Susan Collins -- 1965 - 1991". It's
        surrounded by wreaths -- one of which has an old snapshot of
        her attached to it. Mementos sent on the first anniversary of
        her death.

        GABE

        brushes some of the falling snow away from the marker. He lays
        down his flowers and pauses for a moment -- then gets into the
        Bronco and drives away.

        INT. FORD BRONCO - DAY

        Gabe looks out the window at the countryside he used to belong
        in. He's wondering if he still does.

                                                           CUT TO:

        EXT. TREASURY JET/QUALEN'S JET - FLYING

        Qualen's jet is now flying parallel to, and slightly above,
        the Treasury jet. The door in Qualen's jet is open, and we get
        our first good look at --

        INT/EXT. QUALEN'S JET

        -- Qualen, who is also wearing a headset radio and is wired
        to a safety line in the jet. He's lowering a thick steel cable
        down to the Treasury jet.

        Qualen is as deadly as advertised -- 150 mph winds are tearing
        at him through the open door, but he is unfazed and
        unfrightened.

        TRAVERS

        is also wired to a safety line by his own jet's open door.

                                        TRAVERS
                            (into radio)
                      More -- more -- keep it coming --

        THE TWO PLANES

        Qualen's jet lowers the cable into the Treasury jet -- it
        looks like an Air Force midair refuelling -- difficult and
        dangerous. After about thirty feet of line is lowered --

        TRAVERS

        -- takes it in and clips it to a ring at the top of the jet's
        doorway.

                                        TRAVERS
                            (into radio)
                      Locked on. Move into lateral position.

        INSIDE QUALEN'S PLANE

        The pilot, KRISTEL, is a woman. Her skill, like her hard
        beauty, can be measured in a glance: she's a lot calmer than
        her counterpart in the Treasury plane.

                                        KRISTEL
                      Moving into lateral position.

        ON THE TWO PLANES

        Qualen's jet lowers itself, banking to the side -- the
        Treasury jet raises itself. Both are now flying side by side,
        with the cable serving as a thirty foot bridge.

        TREASURY JET CABIN

        Travers, unclipped from his safety line, cautiously goes to
        the cockpit. The pilot, nervous, struggles with the controls.

                                        PILOT
                      We're right on the edge of the
                      storm -- let's move it.

        Travers pulls the two dead FBI agents out of the
        compartment -- one is dressed in a flying suit like the pilot,
        one in a suit like Travers.

                                        PILOT
                      This isn't going to work -- Wright
                      will suspect something.

                                        TRAVERS
                      So what. He'll sift though a plane
                      that went down in a storm --
                            (gestures to bodies)
                      -- find enough pulverized bone for six
                      men heroically killed in the line of
                      duty --
                            (finds three suitcases)
                      -- and just enough of the right kind
                      of ash.

        Travers opens one of the cases, which is identical to the
        others -- except that it's full of one dollar bills. He's
        thought of everything.

                                        TRAVERS
                      We get twenty-one gun funerals and
                      they write off fifty million. It's
                      perfect, as long as you hold the plane
                      steady -- so concentrate.

        Travers moves back into the cabin.

        INSIDE QUALEN'S JET

        We can now see four other passengers. All are fit and armed --
        HELDON and RYAN are seated, while KYNETTE and DELMER, ready to
        help with the transfer, are on the opposite side of the door
        from a very impatient Qualen.

                                        QUALEN
                            (into radio)
                      Travers -- hurry it up.

        INSIDE TREASURY JET

        Travers, now in a harness like the one seen earlier -- uncuffs
        the money cases from the agents.

                                        TRAVERS
                            (into radio)
                      On my way.

        Travers steps back into the cockpit and flips a toggle switch
        over and LED --

        THE LED

        starts counting down from 2:00 -- 1:59 -- 1:58 --

        IN THE COCKPIT

        Even in the last minute, the storm's gotten worse -- the plane
        is flying right into the blackest center of it. The pilot
        looks more panicked than ever.

                                        TRAVERS
                      That charge is going to blow both
                      engines -- the plane'll go down like a
                      rock, so clip yourself on to the end
                      of the cable with the money as soon as
                      I get over.
                            (an afterthought)
                      And make sure you bring the right
                      cases.

        Travers heads back into the cabin and hooks his harness to the
        cable between the planes.

                                        TRAVERS
                            (into the headset)
                      Dip the plane. I'm coming over.

        THE JETS - LONG SHOT

        Qualen's jet dips down so there's a sharp incline -- Travers
        starts the slide down, zipping in seconds across into

        QUALEN'S JET

        where he's pulled in and unclipped by Qualen.

                                        QUALEN
                            (shouting over the wind)
                      Why didn't you send the money over?

                                        TRAVERS
                            (shouting too)
                      Somehow, I didn't think you'd have
                      waited for me if I'd sent it first.

        Qualen smiles in reply. No. Maybe he wouldn't.

        IN THE TREASURY PLANE COCKPIT

        The pilot locks the controls and rushes back to the cabin.

        THE LED

        counts down -- 0:38 -- 0:37 -- 0:38 --

        IN THE TREASURY PLANE CABIN

        The pilot gathers the cases and uses their cuffs to attach
        them to the cable -- but as he steps past the bodies of --

        THE AGENTS

        Matheson's eyes open -- he's not dead yet.

        IN THE CABIN

        The pilot clicks the last of the three cases onto the cable
        and is about to put his harness on -- but behind him, Matheson
        shakily crawls to his feet, draws his gun, and SHOOTS the
        pilot in the back twice.

        THE PILOT

        drops out of the plane, flailing -- if he's screaming, we
        can't hear it over the HOWLING of the storm --

        IN QUALEN'S JET

        Qualen and Travers are watching the whole plan unravel --

                                        TRAVERS
                            (shouting to cockpit)
                      Get underneath the jet! The cases will
                      slide over!

        THE JETS - LONG SHOT

        Qualen's jet sharply dips down and the cases start to slide
        over -- but at the same time --

        INSIDE THE TREASURY JET

        Matheson, groggy, holds onto the doorway and FIRES a full clip
        from his automatic at Qualen's jet -- and

        THE LED

        counts down -- 0:02 -- 0:01 -- 0:00 -- and

        THE TREASURY JET'S ENGINES

        are destroyed as the charge DETONATES --

        THE JETS - LONG SHOT

        As promised, the Treasury jet is now plummetting as if it had
        no wings at all, levelling the angle between the planes -- the
        cases dangle precariously on the wire --

        INSIDE QUALEN'S JET

                                        TRAVERS
                            (shouting)
                      Lower! Get underneath it!

        INSIDE TREASURY JET

        Matheson struggles to the cockpit and gets behind the controls
        -- as if that's going to do any good --

        THE JETS - LONG SHOT

        Qualen's jet is deliberately racing the disabled Treasury jet
        down, but it's hopeless -- there's no way to get underneath
        the falling jet long enough for the cases to slide over.

        INSIDE QUALEN'S JET - KRISTEL

        isn't quite panicked. Yet.

                                        KRISTEL
                      It's dragging us down! Disconnect the
                      cable!

        INT. QUALEN'S JET - CABIN

        Heldon and Ryan try to do just that, but the cable is
        taut -- there's no way to loosen the clip on the door --

        BOTH JETS

        dive down faster at an ever steeper angle, over the edge of
        the Colorado mountain range --

        INSIDE THE TREASURY JET

        -- the clip on the door finally breaks --

        BOTH JETS - LONG SHOT

        -- the Treasury jet drops as Qualen's jet, trailing the cable
        and the money, sharply shoots upward --

        THE TREASURY JET

        makes a one point landing nose first into the wilderness,
        cartwheeling into a FIREBALL!

        INT./EXT. RANGER STATION

        The sound of the EXPLOSION, muffled in the wind, far-off, but
        audible, drives Hal outside -- he's alert, but can't see
        anything in the murk of the storm --

        INT. QUALEN'S JET - THE COCKPIT - KRISTEL

        levels off the plane, but it's still in trouble --

        CABIN - QUALEN AND TRAVERS

        struggle to reel in the cable, because --

        CLOSE ON THE CABLE

        The money cases are still, barely, holding on, the cuffs
        caught on the broken clip at the end --

        QUALEN AND TRAVERS

        aren't even bothering with the electric winch, they're
        dragging it in hand over hand -- but --

        CLOSE ON THE CABLE

        -- the cases, torn by the wind, work their way loose one at a
        time and drop -- one -- two -- three -- into the snowy
        mountains below!

        IN THE CABIN

        Heldon and Ryan clamp the door shut as Qualen angrily attacks
        Travers --

        THE COCKPIT - KRISTEL

        tries to bring the plane up, but can't -- the fuel guage
        needle is dropping fast --

        INSERT - THE WING

        is pouring out fuel through a dozen bullet holes -- one of two
        engines sputters to a stop.

        THE COCKPIT - KRISTEL POV

        The plane is now just skirting the mountain tops, and is still
        being battered by storm winds -- Kristel aims it for what
        looks like the flattest, longest mountain top --

        THE CABIN

        Kynette and Ryan grab Qualen and Travers to separate them --
        all strap in, because

        THE PLANE

        is going down -- it just tops the edge of a precipice and hits
        the ground level --

        THE MOUNTAIN TOP - LONG SHOT

        -- the problem is, the ground itself isn't level, it tilts
        down towards another edge five hundred yards distant -- if the
        plane keeps skidding, it'll go over the edge --

        THE PLANE

        sleds down at an angle, skipping over rocks -- -- through
        trees --

        -- tearing off a wing --

        THE COCKPIT

        Kristel rides the stick only out of habit -- nothing she does
        is going to matter now --

        INSIDE THE CABIN

        The men are jolted around -- windows IMPLODE as Kynette tries
        to protect a bag of what is obviously explosives --

        THE PLANE

        rips downhill through a wooded area like a runaway train --

        -- the second wing is sheared off by trees --

        COCKPIT POV - THE OPPOSITE EDGE

        is coming up fast -- but

        THE PLANE

        wrenches to a sudden halt, the fuselage intact.

        WIDER VIEW - THE PLANE

        or what's left of it has stopped several feet short of the
        edge -- we can see why: the steel cable, trailing from the
        cargo door, has lashed itself around a half dozen trees,
        acting as a tripwire to stop the plane.

        INSIDE THE PLANE

        Quiet. All are dazed but, outside of superficial cuts,
        unhurt. Kristel moves out of the cockpit, looking around.

                                        KRISTEL
                      So much for phase one.
                            (to Travers)
                      Now what?

        She speaks for all of them -- especially a still-seething
        Qualen. Travers pulls out the tracer monitor for the cases.
        The tracer screen shows three distinct blips -- the tracers
        have survived the fall.

                                        TRAVERS
                      Now -- we call the police.

        INT. RANGER STATION - DAY

        Hal, agitated, paces in the main office -- Frank, unconcerned,
        puts a coat hanger and some aluminum foil on a little TV to
        drag in the fading signal of a Broncos game.

                      Look -- I know there's a storm, but

        Kristel is on the radio, as Travers and Qualen hang back.
        Kristel's voice is panicked but she can't suppress a grin.

                      Acknowledged, mayday. Winds are too
                      strong for us to get a copter up there

                      through the storm? Over --

       INT. COCKPIT

       Kristel hangs up the radio and smiles, Travers and Qualen
       standing behind her. Qualen lightly applauds.

                                        QUALEN
                      Not bad. The insulin was a nice touch.

       EXT. COUNTRY ROAD - DAY

       The Bronco wends through a winding country road, coming
       finally to a cabin settled in a clearing.

       GABE

       pulls into the driveway and puts the Bronco in park. He
       doesn't cut the engine, because he's not sure whether he's
       going in or not. Finally -- he cuts the ignition.

       INT. CABIN - DAY

       A knock on the door brings no response -- no one inside. Gabe
       opens the unlocked door -- and steps inside.

                                        GABE
                      Maggie?

       No answer. Gabe takes a look around the living room. His face
       tells us, without a doubt, this used to be his home. Gabe
       moves inside, pausing at a mantle. Two framed photos -- Gabe
       and Maggie sleeping together in a hammock, bolted to a sheer
       wall over a 2,000 foot drop. Gabe, Hal and Maggie, all
       younger, all sporting drunken grins, in a mountain cave.  Gabe
       smiles for the first time today at this memory -- a BANGING at
       the back of the cabin shakes him out of it.

       EXT. CABIN - DAY - THE BACK DOOR

       has come open and swings in the wind. Gabe steps outside and
       pulls it shut. Gabe looks down and sees tracks that lead to a
       small but sturdy shed a few yards away. Gabe heads over to it.

       INT. SHED - DAY

       Not a storage shed at all -- it's a small workspace that
       offers solid protection from the elements, is well-lit, and
       whistle-clean. Maggie, in front of a table, pulls a cover off.

       A LARGE PLASTIC CAGE

       -- inside is a bald eagle. One of maybe 2,000 left in the
       country. Its uneven feathering and small, gawky size tells us
       it isn't nearly full grown. A bandage on its side tells us
       it's been injured. Maggie's smile tells us it's healing.

                                        MAGGIE
                      Hey there --

       The door to the shed opens -- Gabe steps in, and shuts the
       door behind him. Maggie looks surprised to see him. Gabe just
       looks awkward.

                                        GABE
                      Hi.
                           (beat)
                      Could you introduce us?

                                        MAGGIE
                      Sure. Gabe Walker -- this is A27.
                      A27 -- Gabe.

                                        GABE
                      Not the tag -- what do you call
                      him?

                                        MAGGIE
                      Her. I call her Lucky.

                                        GABE
                           (bends down, eyes wound)
                      Poachers?
                           (Maggie nods)
                      Bastards...

                                        MAGGIE
                      They got the mother -- and left this
                      one behind. Too small to make a decent
                      trophy, I guess.

                                        GABE
                      About four months, right?
                           (Maggie nods)
                      Christ -- it must have been just about
                      his -- I mean her -- first flight --

                                        MAGGIE
                      Time to change the dressing.

       Maggie pulls on a pair of pair of cowhide gloves.

                                        GABE
                      You can't do that alone --

                                        MAGGIE
                      I've had to learn. She trust me --

       Maggie reaches into the cage, but the eagle starts thrashing.

                                        GABE
                      I'm making her nervous --
                           (beat)
                      You hold her, I'll do the dressing.

       Gabe finds another pair of gloves, sterile cotton pads and
       alcohol in a drawer -- Maggie reaches in and grabs the eagle's
       beak and talons quickly but gently, and takes it out of the
       cage, holding it firm. This is clearly something they've done
       many times before. They move together, tight -- Gabe and
       Maggie both react to this bit of close contact as they bandage
       the eagle. It's getting warmer in here. Gabe reaches down and
       yanks off the patch. The eagle thrashes as Gabe cleans the
       wound.

                                        GABE
                      Got some fight in her -- that's good.
                           (beat)
                      What happened to Dave?

                                        MAGGIE
                      The usual. Flew off -- never calls,
                      never writes --

       Gabe winces at this one as he carefully tapes the small patch
       and sticks it on the eagle's side. Maggie puts the eagle back
       in the cage and closes the top door. Gabe and Maggie don't
       move any further apart as they pull their gloves off. Gabe
       tentatively reaches for Maggie's face -- but she pushes him
       hand away.

                                        MAGGIE
                      I'm glad to see you, Gabe. But I kind
                      of wish you hadn't come. I was almost
                      used to you being gone.
                           (beat, quiet)
                      Why are you here?

                                        GABE
                           (pauses)
                      I thought I came back to see if I'd
                      learned to live with it. Well, big
                      surprise. Coming back just tore me
                      open all over again, like it all
                      happened yesterday instead of a year
                      ago. Nothing's changed. Including the
                      way I feel about you.
                           (beat)
                      I didn't realize it till I saw you at
                      the airport. But I came back for you,
                      Maggie.

                                        MAGGIE
                      Does that mean you're going to stay?

                                        GABE
                      No. Not here.
                           (beat)
                      I want you come with me. Start over,
                      somewhere else.

                                        MAGGIE
                           (incredulous)
                      You come back after being gone a year,
                      and you expect me to --
                           (beat)
                      You don't live here any more, Gabe.
                      Your choice, remember? But this is
                      my home. I'm not leaving. You can
                      stay with me, or you can go alone.
                      It's still your choice.

                                        HAL (O.S.)
                      Now there's an easy call.

       Standing in the shed's doorway is Hal. Stone faced. Grim.

       OUTSIDE SHED

       Furious, Gabe heads out after Hal.

                                        GABE
                      What the hell do you want?

                                        HAL
                           (beat)
                      I need your help. A plane's gone down
                      on Comb Bluff. This storm would blow
                      a copter all over the place -- but we
                      can climb up to it.

                                        GABE
                      "We"?
                           (beat)
                      Talk to somebody who's still on the
                      payroll. You've got a half dozen new
                      guys --

                                        HAL
                      -- who couldn't climb that wall now if
                      there were stairs cut into it. But
                      you've soloed it.

                                        GABE
                      During the summer. On a bet.

                                        HAL
                      This is a little more important than a
                      bet. Just a few injured people with
                      no first aid or shelter, camping in a
                      zero degree blizzard. They'll be ice
                      sculptures by tomorrow morning.

                                        GABE
                            (shakes his head)
                      Maybe you missed the headlines -- but
                      I don't do rescues any more. They're
                      bad for my conscience.
                            (beat)
                      Fuck this one up on your own.

        Gabe walks past Hal. Furious, Hal spins Gabe around.

                                        HAL
                      Play it again, Gabe, about how we
                      killed her. I was there too, remember?

                                        GABE
                            (hot)
                      Not like I was, pal -- her fingers
                      brushed mine on the way down --

                                        HAL
                            (right back)
                      -- and I was the one who had to deal
                      with her family when you fucking tore
                      out of town.
                            (takes a breath)
                      We lost her. Whatever anybody says
                      about cold stress and the clip, you
                      and I have to live with that. But
                      right now, there are some more people
                      who need our help, and they shouldn't
                      die too just because you've got a
                      problem keeping the past in the past.

        Gabe knows he's right. But he's hesitant. And scared.

                                        GABE
                      I don't want the responsibility.

                                        HAL
                      Walk away and you are responsible.
                      They'll die. I can't do this alone.
                            (Gabe slows but doesn't
                             stop)
                      You know what else, Gabe? You can go
                      anywhere you want, but if you don't do
                      this, now, you're going to be stuck on
                      that goddamn ledge for the rest of
                      your life.

        Gabe turns. Sees Maggie in the doorway. She's heard every
        word. Gabe turns to Hal -- hesitates -- and nods.

        EXT. COMB BLUFF TRAILHEAD - WIDE SHOT - DAY

        Relative to the other mountains, Comb Bluff is smaller --
        about 2,500 feet high. But that's like saying the Empire State
        Building is smaller than the Sears Tower. It's still a long
        way up if you're climbing the stairs.

        ON THE GROUND - GABE AND HAL

        with full packs of mountaineering gear on. They've got to
        climb up this beast. Gabe -- now back in his orange Sheriff's
        jacket -- scrambles with Hal up the base of the mountain, the
        last few yards before it turns into a sloping wall. Gabe
        takes a bolt gun -- which fires rope-fastened bolts into
        rock -- and hangs it from a strap on his chest.

                                        HAL
                            (indicating gun)
                      That thing's dead weight. Completely
                      useless for an ice climb.

                                        GABE
                      Just backup.

        Gabe readies a coil of rope and starts up the wall.

                                        GABE
                            (not a challenge)
                      I'll lead. I left a few bolts last
                      time I climbed this -- I think I can
                      find some of them.

        Hal starts up after Gabe, easily keeping pace with him.

                                        HAL
                      Save the rope for when it gets tough.
                            (beat, realizing)
                      That bet was for you to free climb
                      the wall.

                                        GABE
                            (further up)
                      Tell you what, Hal -- if we're still
                      alive tomorrow morning, I'll give you
                      the twenty bucks back, okay?

        COMB BLUFF - LONG SHOT

        Two orange specks move their way up the mountain -- it's
        definitely going to be a long trip.

                                                           DISSOLVE TO:

        EXT. COMB BLUFF - LONG SHOT - DAY - GABE AND HAL

        are now visibly two-thirds of the way up.

        CLOSER ON GABE AND HAL - THE MOUNTAIN FACE

        is not only higher, it's a lot tougher to climb. Instead of
        being angular, the wall is now completely vertical -- and
        coated with ice. Rough, irregular ice ledges are all Gabe and
        Hal can grip -- it's a matter of grabbing what you can for a
        handhold, and kicking the spikes of the steel crampons on
        their boots into the ice for footholds. Gabe leads, planting
        pitons into the ice, threading the rope through them as he
        goes. Three steel pins between Gabe and Hal. Their only safety
        net. Gabe, trailing rope behind him, goes up a difficult slab
        of ice and climbs under a ledge, where he anchors the rope in
        the ice with another piton.

                                        GABE
                            (shouting down)
                      Anchored!

        HAL

        is beside and slightly below Gabe -- at the other end of the
        fifty foot rope. Hal cautiously pulls himself along the line
        to the first piton -- as is standard for a climb, he pulls out
        the piton, then moves on to the second -- but up above

        HIGHER ON THE MOUNTAIN

        Ice, building in a small crevase, builds and CRACKS the
        adjoining rock -- several ten-pound boulders fall, causing a
        chain reaction

        ROCKSLIDE

        that bounces down the wall --

        GABE

        hugs the ice wall, making himself as flat as possible --

                                        GABE
                            (shouting down)
                      Rockslide!

        HAL

        flattens too as rocks bounce past -- the second anchoring
        piton LOOSENS as it is struck by a falling rock -- Hal
        nervously eyes the last piton between him and Gabe --

        THE PITON - CLOSE

        also has been clipped by the still falling boulders and droops
        at half mast -- no way are these going to hold in the
        unreliable ice --

        HAL

        tries to stay flat, but one boulder painfully CLIPS him on the
        shoulder, knocking him from his perch -- Hal falls --

        WIDER - HAL FALLING

        In falling, Hal's weight on the rope yanks out the nearest
        anchor piton -- Hal tumbles in space, keeping pace with the
        boulders, as --

        GABE

        who's seen everything we have, quickly reaches to the piton
        he's just anchored, and removes the carabiner clip --

        HAL - FALLING

        The rope draws taut, yanking out the last piton between he and
        Gabe -- nothing but a few yards of slack rope now --

        GABE

        has the bolt gun out. He rapidly hooks the rope's carabiner
        clip to the chambered bolt, and FIRES it at a solid rock ledge
        above him --

        INSERT - THE BOLT

        imbeds solidly in the rock --

        GABE

        lashes the rope to his shoulder, bracing for the coming impact
        by lodging his feet in the ice --

        THE JOLT - WIDER SHOT

        The line pulls taut, leaving Hal suspended, the wind knocked
        out of him from the impact --

        GABE

        is almost dragged down by the jolt -- he painfully takes most
        of the impact in his shoulders -- the shock forces his feet
        through an ice ledge -- but the rope, bolted to the rock
        above, has held. Barely.

                                        GABE
                            (shaken, voice gone)
                      Anchored --
                            (shouts this time)
                      Anchored!

        HAL

        now somewhat recovered, steadies himself.

                                        HAL
                            (breathless too)
                      You're sure this time --

        Hal climbs up the rope, finally reaching another ledge
        slightly below Gabe's. Hal leans against the wall, gasping, as
        Gabe clips the gun to his pack.

                                        HAL
                            (looking up at gun)
                      Don't say it --

                                        GABE
                            (wheezing too)
                      It's kind of hard to resist --

                          GABE                         HAL
                  It's not dead                It's not dead
                  weight -- you                weight -- I am.
                  are.

        Hal and Gabe start howling -- that hysterical, giddy laugh
        that only comes from just missing a violent end.

        WIDE SHOT ON MOUNTAIN - THE TWO LEDGES

        Hal and Gabe's friendship is starting to resurface -- their
        LAUGHTER is nearly louder than the wind, as we --

                                                           DISSOLVE TO:

        EXT. PRECIPICE EDGE - DAY - BINOCULAR POV

        From the top of the bluff, someone is looking down through
        binoculars -- Gabe and Hal's orange jackets are plainly
        visible a few hundred yards below.

        RYAN

        lowers the binoculars, and keys an ear button on the headset
        radio he's wearing, sending a beep.

        INSIDE THE PLANE

        Travers is wearing another headset -- the others are just
        resting in the seats

                                        TRAVERS
                            (into mouthpiece)
                      Have they arrived?
                            (two beeps in response)
                      Good. Return to the plane and cover
                      your tracks.

                                        QUALEN
                            (to others)
                      Get ready.

        ON THE MOUNTAIN BELOW

        Hal and Gabe are tired, but get a second wind from the
        excitement of being almost on top. Gabe stops, breathless for
        a second, then goes on. Hal lags a little behind.

                                        GABE
                      Come on -- the hard part's over.

        Gabe heads up and over

        THE MOUNTAIN'S EDGE/CRASH SITE

        and helps Hal up. From here, the rest of the range looms
        large. Even in the continuing snowstorm, it's a spectacular
        sight -- but Gabe and Hal don't pause to enjoy it. This isn't
        a trip for sport. Hal looks off into the trees, and sees the
        torn tree stumps from the plane crash.

                                        HAL
                            (grim)
                      That's it.

        Hal and Gabe run into the wooded area and follow the
        wreckage -- felled trees, a smashed wing -- and reach

        THE FUSELAGE

        which sits intact by the other edge of the precipice.

                                        GABE
                      I thought the fuselage was broken.
                      That looks pretty cozy.

                                        HAL
                            (puzzled too)
                      The pilot was hysterical.

                                        GABE
                      Something's wrong here --

                                        HAL
                      Does this look like a prank to you?
                      Come on --

        Hal pulls open the passenger door and goes in -- Gabe, wary,
        takes a look around the plane.

        INSIDE THE FUSELAGE

        It's comparatively dark in here -- Hal starts in, shining a
        light -- the beam finds

        HAL'S POV - TRAVERS

        slumped down on the cabin floor, a blanket wrapped around
        him -- he's shaking and is generally giving a good impression
        of a shock victim. Hal rushes to him.

                                        HAL
                      Relax -- we're here to help --

        "Weak", Travers whispers as Hal gives him some water.

                                        HAL
                      Don't try to talk --

        Travers won't quit -- Hal leans down to hear.

                                        TRAVERS
                            (hoarse whisper)
                      Where?

                                        HAL
                      -- Where? What are you --

        A gun barrel moves INTO VIEW as it presses against Hal's neck.
        Heldon and Ryan are right behind him. Travers instantly drops
        his act.

                                        TRAVERS
                      You said "we". Where are the rest?

        GABE - OUTSIDE THE FUSELAGE

        notes footprints in the snow -- fresh ones -- and kneels down
        to look at the cable wrapped around the tree. No ordinary
        accident. But before he can think about this, he gets an
        earful of gun barrel from Qualen, who is behind him.

        INSIDE THE FUSELAGE

        Qualen hustles Gabe inside the plane -- his hands are on his
        head, and his pack has been removed. Qualen throws the pack
        to Ryan and Delmer, who rifle through it, removing anything
        that could be a weapon -- they quickly confiscate Gabe's bolt
        gun and ice axe.

                                        TRAVERS
                      What's for dinner?
                            (Kynette tosses packet)
                      Ugh. "Dried Beef Slices With Barbeque
                      Sauce."
                            (tosses it back)
                      Try and make this edible.

        Travis looks at Hal's park ranger badge.

                                        TRAVERS
                      Hal Tucker.
                            (to Gabe)
                      Where's yours?

                                        QUALEN
                      He doesn't have one. Just a wallet.

        Qualen tosses it to Travers, who glances through it.

                                        TRAVERS
                      Gabe Walker...
                            (notes photo of Maggie)
                      Very attractive.

                                        GABE
                      My ex.

                                        TRAVERS
                      Too bad. Let me tell you what's on for
                      today. We'd like you to help settle a
                      wager. You see, we lost some
                      luggage --

        Travers motions to Ryan and Qualen, who shove Gabe and Hal
        forward in the cabin. Travers takes out the tracer monitor.

                                        TRAVERS
                            (showing them the blips)
                      See these? Now I've bet the gentlemen
                      behind you that you know enough about
                      this mountain range to lead us to each
                      of these, quickly, and that you'd be
                      happy to do so. They bet me you
                      couldn't and wouldn't.
                            (guns are clicked)
                      Now tell me -- who wins?

        Gabe and Hal eye each other -- no choice. Gabe nods.

                                        TRAVERS
                      Good dog. Now let's get this
                      expedition started.

        EXT. FACING MOUNTAIN - WIDE SHOT

        Hal and Gabe lead the "expedition" down a steep, but passable,
        descent, leading to --

        A NATURAL STONE BRIDGE

        that links Comb Bluff with the next mountain. Travers stops
        Gabe and pulls out the monitor.

                                        TRAVERS
                      Okay. Connect the dots.

        Gabe pauses as he holds the monitor up against the
        mountainscape.

        MOUNTAIN AND MONITOR

        The first blip is up a thousand feet -- it's a wall, and
        obviously not something for a novice. Gabe pauses a little
        too long -- Qualen nudges him with his gun. Gabe hands the
        monitor back to Travers.

                                        GABE
                      This way.

        Gabe, with Hal right behind, leads them up the wall -- it's
        not a straight climb, but there's a series of zig-zagging
        natural ledges that cut up the wall. Wide enough even for an
        amateur. The others follow Gabe and Hal's example.

                                                           DISSOLVE TO:

        EXT. MOUNTAIN WALL - WIDE SHOT - DAY - HAL AND GABE

        have led the gang further up the wall, using pitons and
        carabiner clips to create a guide rope. It's still just a
        matter of climbing relatively easy ascending ledges. Hal and
        Gabe lead them by jumping to the next ledge.

        CLOSER ON HAL AND GABE

        As Gabe hammers in a new piton, he turns to Hal.

                                        GABE
                            (sotto)
                      We don't have to do this. We know
                      these mountains -- they don't. If we
                      can get ahead --

                                        HAL
                      Can you climb faster than they can
                      shoot?

                                        GABE
                      We've got to try something. Think
                      we'll get a finder's fee after they
                      get all their "luggage"?

                                        HAL
                      Sure. All the bullets we can eat.

                                        GABE
                      That's not what really worries me.

                                        HAL
                      There's something else to worry
                      about?

                                        GABE
                      Yeah. Once they've got what they're
                      after -- they're gonna need a copter
                      to get out of here.

                                        HAL
                            (realizing)
                      Maggie.

        Gabe nods grimly -- and keeps moving up. The rest keep pace.

        THE WALL

        The climbers have reached a point of comparative comfort on
        the wall -- the ledge is now two feet wide. Travers takes out
        the tracer monitor -- the monitor shows that the first case is
        just above them.

                                        TRAVERS
                      Hold it.
                            (beat)                      
                      It's up there.

        "UP THERE" - AN OVERHANG

        juts out of the wall fifty feet above their position. As the
        rest of the wall above is completely sheer, it's obvious that
        the case, if it is above, has landed on top of a ledge.

        But this isn't easily accessible -- we MOVE DOWN from the
        overhang and can see there are only the smallest of handholds
        to get up there, and those are slick with ice and snow. Worse,
        the rest of the mountain bulges outward in a curve, making
        climbing almost impossible.

        ON THE LEDGE

        Travers holds his gun on Gabe, and motions up

                                        TRAVERS 
                      Fetch.

                                        GABE
                      I'll need the ice axe.

                                        TRAVERS
                            (laughs)
                      You've got to be kidding.

                                        GABE
                            (sighs)
                      Okay. How about some tape?

        Travers nods -- Kynette pulls a roll of tape out of Gabe's
        confiscated pack and throws it to him.


                                        GABE         
                      Crampons too.

        Travers hesitates, but nods -- Kynette throws him the iron
        spikes. Gabe fastens them to his boots.

        Gabe looks up -- this is going to be tough, even for him. In
        spite of the cold, he takes off his gloves -- that's how small
        these holds are -- and he meticulously tapes up his hands and
        his fingers.

        HIGH ANGLE - GABE

        moves up the wall with some ease at first -- there are
        hand-sized handholds, and decent footholds -- but twenty feet
        up, there's nothing. To keep going, Gabe has to painfully
        wedge his fingers into small cracks, essentially supporting
        his weight only by several fingerholds at any given moment.
        We can see from the angle that Gabe is at least 3,000 feet
        from solid ground. We can see from his face that he's trying
        not to think about it.

        ON THE LEDGE - TRAVERS AND QUALEN

        watch Gabe's slow progress.

                                        QUALEN
                      I don't trust him.

                                        TRAVERS
                            (indicating wall)
                      Where could he go?

                                        QUALEN
                      I'd rather he didn't show us.
                            (beat)
                      We don't need two guides.

                                        TRAVERS
                            (shrugs)
                      You win. Kill him when he gets down.

        GABE ON THE WALL - CLOSE

        Make that "if he comes down". Gabe is now in one of the
        worst positions possible for a free climb. He is moving up
        the underside of the overhang and is essentially hanging
        upside down, knifing his fingers into tiny cracks for support.
        It's excruciating -- both in terms of muscular effort, and the
        abrasions that come from forcing fingers into ice and rock
        again and again. Gabe keeps his hold with one hand and slides
        the other up, hammering it into a crack wedge with ice --
        some of the ice chips whistle past and down --

        -- finally, Gabe gropes one hand over the edge, and pulls
        himself onto

        THE OVERHANG

        Exhausted, Gabe pulls himself prone across the top. Something
        hard is underneath him -- Gabe recovers and brushes the snow
        off the money case that's underneath. It's battered from the
        fall, but is still barely holding together. Gabe manages to
        force open the trashed locks -- he looks inside the case, and
        fingers a band of $5000s.

                                        GABE
                      Jesus.

        ON THE LEDGE - TRAVERS AND QUALEN

        look up. They can see Gabe has made it -- but they can't see
        him, or the case.

                                        TRAVERS
                            (impatient, shouting)
                      Lower it down -- now!

        ON THE OVERHANG - GAB

        has no intention of doing this -- he snaps the case shut and
        looks over at a ledge that moves off from it -- and at the ice
        and snow above.

        ON THE LEDGE - TRAVERS AND QUALEN'S POV

        try to look up and locate Gabe. They can't. Until -- 

                                        GABE (O.S.)
                            (shouting down)
                      I've got a better idea. Why don't you
                      come up and get it?

        With the case, Gabe moves, back against the wall, on a ledge
        that skirts off the overhand -- from Travers and Qualen's
        point of view. Gabe can hardly be seen -- since the mountain
        bulges out as it goes up. Gabe's got a slight edge of cover.

                                        TRAVERS
                            (shouts to Heldon)
                      Get him!

        Heldon runs along the lower ledge, FIRING up at --

        GABE

        who has to flatten against the upper ledge -- bullets howl
        past at twenty per second, SPARKING against the lip of the
        rock -- it's cover, but not much --

        HAL

        looks up, worried --

        HAL'S POV - ICE AND SNOW
        
        piled by the ton from the storm, lie further above -- the ice
        holding it back already, already weakened by the sun, is being
        chiselled away by bullets --

        ON THE LOWER LEDGE - QUALEN

        grabs Hal and puts the gun to his head.

                                        QUALEN
                            (shouting)
                      Bring the money down, or we kill your
                      friend!

        Travers pushes the barrel away from Hal, shaking his head.

                                        TRAVERS
                      We can't.
                            (frowning)
                      And he knows it.

        WIDER ANGLE ON MOUNTAIN - THE PARALLEL LEDGES

        Gabe moves across his thing ledge as Heldon runs across his --
        Gabe ducks back and has to flatten even more against the wall,
        because his ledge is getting smaller --

        HELDON

        smiles, seeing Gabe's cover is gone -- Heldon's ledge is
        getting wider, so it's easier for him to fire up. Heldon moves
        out to the edge --

        GABE'S POV DOWN

        There's now nothing between Heldon and Gabe -- Heldon takes
        dead aim --

        GABE

        looks up, sweating it --

                                        GABE
                      Come on --

        THE ICE AND SNOW

        above finally give way, dropping an avalanche on

        GABE

        who drops the case and hugs the wall --

        THE AVALANCHE - WIDE VIEW ON MOUNTAIN

        Only now can we see how much snow and ice had been penned up
        on the mountain top -- tons of ice and snow sweep down the
        mountainside -- it SHATTERS the case against the wall as it
        easily swipes a SCREAMING Heldon off the ledge --

        TRAVERS, QUALEN AND HAL

        are safe at their vantage, but stunned at the sight of --

        THE AVALANCHE

        Heldon's machine fun FIRES uselessly as he's swallowed in an
        explosion of white -- as well as a flurry of green as the
        bills scatter amid the snow --

        -- then: quiet. The avalanche ends as abruptly as it started.
        The rumble dies down to complete silence.

        TRAVERS

        apoplectic, stares at seventeen million dollars worth of snow
        settling far below. He takes his gun, furious, and fires at

        THE UPPER LEDGE

        where Gabe was hugging the wall -- it's now blanketed with
        snow. Travers FIRES an entire clip at where Gabe used to be.
        The snow FALLS AWAY, revealing nothing but stark rock. Gabe
        has been swept away.

        HAL

        reacts and attacks Travers.

                                        HAL
                      You son of a bitch --

        Travers turns and pins Hal against the wall with the gun,
        ready to kill him too. But he's stopped by Qualen.

                                        QUALEN
                      No. We need him to get the rest of the
                      money.
                            (he isn't backing down)
                      If he dies we lose everything

        Travers, furious, takes the gun out of Hal's face.

                                        TRAVERS
                            (to Hal)
                      Get us out of here.

        Hal stares at Travers with absolute fury -- but he leads the
        gang back along the ledge in retreat.

        EXT. FURTHER DOWN THE MOUNTAIN - DAY

        Powdery snow is settling from the avalanche. From a cave in
        the rocks, Brett and Evan crawl out a little timidly.

                                        EVAN
                      What the hell --

        Evan takes a pair of overpriced binoculars and looks up --

        BINOCULAR POV - FAR UP ON LEDGE

        The figures are small, but it's clear that one is pointing a
        gun at an orange-jacketed figure.

        EVAN

        lowers the binoculars.

                                        EVAN
                      Brett -- you're not going to believe
                      this -- but a couple of guys are
                      holding a gun on Hal and forcing him
                      up the bluff --

                                        BRETT (O.S.)
                      I believe it.

        Evan turns to

        BRETT

        who has found both Heldon's broken body, and his gun, half
        buried in snow. Evan walks over, amazed.

                                        EVAN
                      What the fuck is going on here?

        Brett picks up the gun -- this is more an adventure than he
        ever dreamed of.

                                        BRETT
                      Let's catch up and find out.

        Brett and Evan grab their packs, and hurry onto a trail, as we
        return to --

        THE UPPER LEDGE

        where Gabe was. Nothing is stirring. Until, there's some
        movement ten feet from where Gabe was hugging the wall.

        It's a crevice in the mountain, about two feet wide -- a
        climber would call this a "chimney" -- and it's packed with
        ice and snow. It's also packed with

        GABE

        -- his hand gropes out -- and with some difficulty, he digs
        himself out, gasping and coughing. Gabe, coated with snow,
        leans against the wall and rests. Alive.

        INT. RANGER STATION - DAY

        Maggie is on the phone, pacing, as Frank is slumped in front
        of the radio scanner. Suddenly, the radio comes to life.

                                        HAL (O.S.)
                      -- Come in, Rescue Unit -- over --

        Maggie bolts over to the radio before Frank can react.

                                        MAGGIE
                            (keying mike)
                      Rescue Unit -- what's going on,
                      Hall? -- over --

        EXT. MOUNTAIN - WOODED AREA - DAY

        Travers has his gun pressed to Hal's temple.

                                        TRAVERS
                      No tricks, no procedural codes, no
                      personal messages -- just tell them
                      everything's under control and you're
                      taking care of the wounded.

                                        HAL
                            (keys it)
                      We've reached the wreckage -- top of
                      Comb Bluff -- six injured, but they're
                      responding to treatment. Everything
                      A-OK. Over.

                                        MAGGIE (O.S.)
                      Everything isn't okay, Hal -- I'm
                      coming up after you -- over --

                                        HAL
                      Negative, Maggie. Winds are too
                      high, and the passengers' injuries are
                      all superficial. We're going to ride
                      out the storm here -- over --

        Travers yanks away the radio.

                                        TRAVERS
                      Have her come up.

                                        HAL
                      Forget it -- downdrafts would wipe her
                      all over the peaks --
                            (Travers starts to argue)
                      -- Not that I expect you to give a
                      shit, but it's our only copter.
                      You'll be stuck.

        Travers relents and hands the radio back.

                                        MAGGIE (O.S.)
                      I can handle the winds --

                                        HAL
                            (breaking in)
                      Forget about it, Maggie, that's an
                      order -- acknowledge --

        INT. RANGER STATION

        Maggie looks out the window. The station's windspeed gauge is
        flying around so fast it looks like it might take off.

                                        MAGGIE
                      Acknowledged. Let me talk to Gabe --
                      over --

                                        HAL (O.S.)
                            (hesitates)
                      You can't. He's taking care of
                      passengers. Just like I should be.
                      Over and out.

        Maggie leans back in the chair, looks out at the storm, and
        tries not to worry. She fails miserably.

        EXT. MOUNTAIN - WOODED AREA - TRAVERS AND HAL

                                        TRAVERS
                            (snatching radio away)
                      Good. You might live longer than your
                      friend. Now --
                            (takes out monitor)
                      -- what?

        Hal takes the monitor -- the next blip is above, almost
        straight up. Hal motions to the wooded area ahead.

                                        HAL
                      The next one's on top of the peak.
                      This'll be long, but easy -- more like
                      a hike than a climb.

                                        TRAVERS
                            (suspicious)
                      It looks like a winding route.

                                        HAL
                      There's a more direct route. The East
                      Face. But it's the wall on the other
                      side, and it's smooth as glass. Maybe
                      a dozen guys in the world could do it
                      in good weather. Only a psycho would
                      try it in a snowstorm.

        Travers digests this, and motions Hal to move on as we --

                                                           CUT TO:

        CLOSE SHOT - GABE'S FACE

        is torn in pain. In spite of the cold and wind, he's drenched
        in sweat, half exertion, half fear. We pull back to take in

        THE EAST WALL - LONG SHOT

        Envision a wall. A really big wall. A really, really big wall.
        A wall that's as wide as it is high -- five thousand feet by
        five thousand feet -- narrowing to a domed peak at the summit.

        Now picture the same wall, checkered with ice. If this were
        horizontal, you or I couldn't walk on it without falling.

        Now picture the same wall with an orange dot, two-thirds of
        the way up it. The orange dot is

        GABE

        and he barely has the strength to hold on, much less go up.
        Gabe holds himself steady with one hand, gets a foothold, and
        swings another hand up to SLAM it against the wall.

        He's improvised gear -- he's tied a crampon to one hand. But
        it's as awkward as it sounds. Gabe moves up only a foot or so
        -- then pulls out the crampon, reaches up, and SLAMS it into 
        the wall, starting the painful process over again.

                                                           CUT TO;

        INT. DENVER MINT - WRIGHT'S OFFICE - DAY

        Wright's pacing around, trying to figure out what in his
        office he should break first. Davis shows up at the door.

                                        WRIGHT

                      Okay -- I know it's not in San
                      Francisco. I know it's not here. I

                      not - we got that covered. Now, do
                      you have any ideas on where it is?

        EXT. THE EAST FACE - WIDE SHOT - DAY - GABE

        is clearly exhausted and freezing -- his lips are blue, his
        eyebrows encrusted with snow. Wind still threatens to knock
        him off the wall -- but he forces himself on.

                                        GABE
                            (teeth chattering)
                      A steambath.
                            (spikes himself up)
                      A steambath -- and a bottle of
                      whiskey.
                            (new foothold)
                      A steambath with a bottle of
                      Glenlivet. And a fire.
                            (new handhold)
                      A steambath -- with a bottle of
                      Glenlivet -- and a steak.
                            (new foothold)
                      A steak soaked with Glenlivet, cooking
                      over a steambath on fire.

        WIDER ON MOUNTAIN

        Gabe finally reaches the top of the wall, where it meets an
        enormous overhang of ice.

        GABE

        is right underneath where the ice flows over the wall. Gabe
        takes his handheld crampon and hammers it into the ice
        overhead with more force than usual. This one is going to have
        to hold.

        Gabe steels himself for a tough move -- with one hand gripping
        that crampon, he swings out, away from the wall.

        Only the crampon spikes jammed into the ice above his hand
        are keeping Gabe from falling. Gabe needs the second crampon
        to make the move up -- but that's not going to be easy to get.
        It's attached to his boot.

        As Gabe clings to the upper crampon, his body swaying, he
        reaches down with his free hand to loosen the other crampon.

        GABE'S POV - DOWN

        The ground is one slip and five thousand feet away. Gabe
        fumbles desperately with the buckles on the crampons -- but
        both his fingers, and the buckles, are frozen stiff --

        GABE'S FACE

        shows real, solid terror for the first time --

        GABE'S POV - DOWN

        Gabe gets the first buckle off -- then the second. The crampon
        is off his boot.

        GABE

        still swinging from one hand, takes the now-freed crampon and
        slams it into the ice. It doesn't hold -- but the force of
        Gabe's swing, pushing him away, has loosened the other
        crampon. Gabe only gets one more shot at this -- he swings
        the free crampon up with all his might -- it catches in the
        same split second as the other dislodges.

        But the hard part is over -- with the two crayons, Gabe
        quickly manages to climb up over the lip of

        THE ICE OVERHANG

        This is a field of ice sloping up to the top. Gabe pulls
        himself a few feet away from the edge, and puts the crampons
        back on his feet where they belong. It's now pretty simple for
        Gabe to run up the ice slope three hundred yards to

        THE SUMMIT

        which is a rocky, wooded area. Gabe seems to have a second
        wind now -- he runs to the other side of the summit. The other
        side is obviously the route Hal and the others will be
        taking -- beneath the summit is a winding, well-beaten path.
        Gabe finally arrives at a small shack with a sign nearby
        commemorating the "DOUGLAS EXPEDITION - 1933".

        INT. THE SHACK

        is just a small "point of interest" shed for hardy tourists
        who have hiked up this far -- there is a corny photo stand,
        where you stick your head through a hole, so your face is put
        on top of a cartoon climber hacking up a mountain. Gabe rushes
        past this to a glass display case on the wall.

        THE GORDON DOUGLAS DISPLAY

        has black and white photos of a square jawed 1930s climber
        with his expedition -- more important is what's beneath it.
        Douglas' original climbing equipment -- a coil of rope, some
        pitons, a hat, a cloth backpack, small binoculars, other odds
        and ends. Gabe prepares to smash the glass -- and hesitates.
        Respect.

                                        GABE
                            (sighing)
                      Sorry, Gordon -- I promise I'll have
                      it back tomorrow.

        Gabe SMASHES the glass as we move to --

        EXT. THE TRAIL - DAY

        Hal is leading Qualen, Travers and the others upward -- this
        is a comparatively easy route, but still tiring. The sun goes
        down beyond a facing, taller mountain. Ryan is huffing and
        puffing -- the altitude and exertion are getting to him. Hal
        allows himself a smile at his discomfort.

                                        HAL
                      Come on -- tourists take this trail.

        Qualen pokes Hal with the gun -- he moves on ahead.

        EXT. THE SUMMIT - DUSK

        It's getting dark rapidly -- Gabe has scaled a rock formation
        so he has a view of the rest of the summit --

        GABE'S POV - SCANNING THE TREELINE

        Gabe slowly looks along the trees of the summit -- looks
        pretty ordinary to us, but something must have caught Gabe's
        eye, because he swings back to look at one tree. With broken
        branches on top.

        GABE

        climbs down from his rock perch and rushes toward the tree.

        EXT. SUMMIT TRAIL - NIGHT

        This "expedition" reaches the top -- Hal is in the lead, with
        Qualen just inches behind. Qualen shoves Hal forward.

                                        TRAVERS
                      Is this it?

                                        HAL
                      Yeah. This is it.

                                        TRAVERS
                      Good. Get out of the way.

        Travers takes out the tracer and starts following the blip.

        ELSEWHERE ON THE SUMMIT - GABE

        frantically rushes around, looking for the case -- he spots a
        crater of snow, rushes to it and starts digging. Even below
        the snow, the tracer's blinking red light is glowing and
        visible. Gabe laughs as he digs it out.

        NEARBY ON THE SUMMIT - TRAVERS

        has his eyes glued to the tracer monitor, which shows the case
        is nearby.

                                        TRAVERS
                            (smiling)
                      This way.

        Qualen shines a light -- all of them push their way through
        the trees.

        TRAVERS

        is excited now -- he can't even wait for Qualen's flashlight,
        he intuitively races through the trees, dividing his attention
        between his surroundings and

        THE MONITOR

        which shows he's practically on top of the case -- finally

        TRAVERS

        shoves his way through some small pines -- he can see the
        blinking of the red tracer light ahead through the branches.

                                        TRAVERS
                            (calling behind)
                      It's over here!

        Travers shoves his way through the branches, and heads for the
        light -- but something's wrong -- Qualen comes up behind
        Travers and shines the light on

        A SNOWMAN

        cute, if hastily constructed, stands with a five-pebble smile,
        as well as Douglas' cap, in a clearing. The still blinking,
        still operable tracer is now the nose of the snowman. The case
        is leaned up against it.

        Travers runs over to the case, furious, and opens it. It's
        empty -- except for a single $5000 bill. Travers picks it
        up -- scrawled on the margin is "LET'S TRADE."

                                        TRAVERS
                            (incredulous)
                      He's still alive.
                            (furious)
                      He's still alive!
                            (to Qualen and the
                             others)
                      He can't be far away -- spread out!

        Qualen, Kynette, Delmer and Krystel fan out into the woods,
        each with a flashlight and a fun. Ryan, however, straps on
        nightfinder goggles and runs out without a flashlight.

                                        TRAVERS
                            (to Hal, brandishing gun)
                      Put your hands on your head.

        ELSEWHERE ON THE SUMMIT - GABE

        watches the chaos with a grin from a slightly elevated vantage
        point -- he can see the flashlight beams, all headed in the
        wrong direction. But he doesn't see

        RYAN - "NIGHTFINDER" POV

        With these goggles, light is amplified a thousandfold -- this
        isn't one of those infra-red, thermo-blob jobs -- it looks
        more like day for night photography. Even starlight is enough
        for Ryan to run easily through the thick woods -- and he's
        going in the right direction.

        GABE

        begins climbing down to level ground so he can circle closer
        to where Travers is holding Hal -- before he can get far --

        "NIGHTFINDER" POV - RYAN

        looks up, and can clearly see Gabe climbing down the small
        rock, twenty yards distant --

        RYAN

        smiles, looking macabre under the goggles, and opens fire --

        GABE

        is startled as the bullets impact inches over his head -- he
        jumps the last ten feet to the ground and is running even as
        he hits the ground -- more bullets hit where Gabe was a
        split second ago --

        RYAN

        chases Gabe, easily maneuvering through the trees --

        GABE

        runs too, trying to dodge Ryan's continuing fusillades -- Gabe
        knows this territory, but to him, it's still pitch dark -- he
        stumbles, and rams against trees --

        RYAN

        keeps coming up behind, closing the hap, Gabe's bright form
        just ahead --

        GABE

        comes out of the trees and finds he is on another part of the
        summit. All that's beneath him is

        GABE'S POV

        -- a sudden, sloping plunge down a field of ice. No escape
        route here -- anything that goes down this slide is going all
        the way to the ground far below.

        GABE

        is driven forward by a fresh burst of bullets -- he dives to
        the edge of the ice field and ducks behind a boulder -- the
        sole source of cover.

        ELSEWHERE ON THE SUMMIT

        Kristel, Qualen and Kynette, having heard the gunshots, are
        now rushing to Gabe's position --

        RYAN

        almost casually emerges from the woods. He can see there is
        nowhere for Gabe to have gone -- except behind the boulder. He
        walks toward it as if he had all the time in the world.

        GABE

        fumbles in his backpack and pulls out something from the
        Douglas exhibit -- an ancient flare that looks like a can of
        sterno. Gabe pulls out his lighter and tries to light it -- it
        resists and looks like a dud, but finally it catches, and as
        it ignites Gabe heaves it over the boulder at Ryan --

        RYAN - "NIGHTFINDER" POV - THE FLARE

        arcs over the boulder to fully ignite, turning everything
        into a blinding, agonizing flash of white --

        RYAN

        SCREAMS, putting one hand over the goggles, trying to rip them
        off --

        GABE

        bolts out from behind the boulder to rush him --

        RYAN

        instantly aware of what Gabe's doing, blindly shoots, fanning
        out in a semi-circle as he gets the goggles off --

        GABE

        just runs straight ahead to Ryan, getting to him before the
        machine gun field of fire can intersect his path -- Gabe
        tackles Ryan as he manages to get the goggles off -- both men
        fall to the ground, and --

        The machine gun CLATTERS away, landing on the edge of the ice,
        just out of reach -- Ryan, now recovered from the blinding
        flash, pulls an ice axe out of a pack sheath and swings it at
        Gabe -- Gabe rolls away in time, and gets to the machine gun,
        grabbing it -- But Ryan dives for Gabe, slamming into him --
        the force of it knocks the machine gun loose -- it skips down
        the ice slope -- but the momentum of Ryan's hit also carries
        both Gabe and Ryan over the edge, onto --

        THE ICE SLOPE

        Gabe and Ryan both tumble over the edge and start sliding
        down, Ryan face first on his stomach, Gabe head first and on
        his back -- both are in immediate agony, because

        CLOSE ON THE ICE

        -- it's covered with razor sharp, irregular ridges, both large
        and small, that slice through clothing and shred skin as they
        pick up speed --

        GABE'S UPSIDE-DOWN POV - THE ICE FIELD

        The edge and a five thousand foot drop are less than a hundred
        yards away --

        GABE AND RYAN SLIDING

        Ryan flails and SCREAMS as the ice gashes him from
        underneath -- Gabe, however, manages to flip over and to the
        side -- he lunges on top of Ryan and rides him down like a
        bobsled --

        GABE'S POV - END OF THE ICE SLOPS

        is coming up too fast --

        GABE

        tries to maintain his perch on Ryan, who is SCREAMING and not
        yet used to the idea of being a human sled -- he isn't
        remaining still enough to provide a smooth ride -- Gabe
        frantically reaches behind to Ryan's wrist to get the ice axe,
        trailing from a wrist strap, but Ryan's arm is thrashing away,
        threatening to toss off the axe --

        ON SUMMIT

        Qualen, Kristel and Kynette arrive at the lip, and look down,
        incredulous --

        QUALEN POV - GABE RIDING RYAN

        Gabe and Ryan, accelerating, have almost reached the edge --

        GABE

        finally grabs the ice axe, pulling it off Ryan's wrist -- just
        as they reach the precipice edge, Gabe loops the axe to his
        wrist and swings toward the ice with everything he's got --

        The axe's scythe-like blade catches on the ice, right at the
        lip of the precipice -- Gabe is wrenched to a painful halt,
        suspended over the drop, as what's left of Ryan, still
        SCREAMING, shoots over the edge --

        Gabe unhooks the axe, and gets another handhold. Gabe uses the
        axe to climb further down the ice to some rock -- finding
        easier hand holds, he quickly disappears into the darkness.

        QUALEN, KRISTEL AND KYNETTE

        look down -- Ryan's death scream is still echoing. Qualen is
        furious -- Gabe has escaped with the second case.

                                        QUALEN
                            (to Kynette)
                      Follow him!

        Kynette shines his flashlight below, illuminating the long,
        frozen streak of blood on the ice.

                                        KYNETTE
                            (gestures with light)
                      After you.

        INT. DOUGLAS TOURIST SHACK - NIGHT

        The expedition has holed up here for the night -- Travers and
        Qualen look upset. Things aren't going as well as they'd
        hoped. Kristel tries to get some candy out of a vending
        machine that's obviously empty. Kynette saws at some camp food
        with a distinctive knife -- the handle is a set of brass
        knuckles. Delmer guards Hal, who is bound, and seated by the
        souvenir photo stand.

                                        HAL
                      Well -- look at the bright side.
                            (beat)
                      At least you've only got to make the
                      split five ways now.

        EXT. MOUNTAIN LEDGE - NIGHT

        Gabe confidently drops down onto a large ledge that juts out
        from the wall -- obviously familiar territory for him. The
        ledge leads to a small, enclosed cave. Gabe takes out his
        penlight and shines it -- but the light looks dim. Batteries
        are low. Gabe pockets it, flicks his lighter and goes in --

        THE CAVE

        in the flickering light, we can see that no one has been in
        here for a while -- snow, dust, rocks -- but we should also
        recognize this from the photo seen earlier as Gabe, Maggie and
        Hal's hangout.

        GABE

        smiles with the memories -- then his face brightens with one
        memory in particular. Gabe rushes to a corner of the cave and
        opens a rock-lid to a hiding place.

                                        GABE
                      Please still be there -- oh,
                      please --

        Gabe reaches in the stash and finds an ancient half-full pint
        of Jack Daniels. The first thing to go right all day. Gabe
        uncaps it and gratefully gulps down a double shot. Peace, at
        last. Gabe smiles and leans against the wall, closing his eyes
        -- but he's startled instantly by a SCREECH -- Gabe's eyes
        shoot open --

        An aggressive rat scurries toward him on the floor.

        Gabe grabs a rock and CLOBBERS the rat off-screen, ending the
        screeches with one blow. Gabe's face first registers
        disgust -- then an idea. Then real disgust. Sighing, Gabe
        pulls out a pocket knife and opens the blade.

                                                           CUT TO:

        INT. THE CAVE - A LITTLE LATER - CLOSE ON GABE

        Gabe takes the now cooked rat carcass -- properly skinned and
        butchered -- off his knife blade. We can see from flickering
        shadows that a small fire is now burning in a cave -- we
        pull back to see

        THE FIRE

        which is built out of small bundles of $5,000 bills. It's safe
        to say that something like $500,000 is going up in smoke, and
        the fire's dying down. Gabe tosses a fresh band of bills on
        the flame. Gabe cools the knife in some snow, saws off a rat
        leg, and chews unhappily.

                                        GABE
                            (mouth full)
                      Mmm. Just like -- chicken.

        Gabe sparingly washes the bite down with a taste of Jack
        Daniel. It's going to have to last him. He has an entire rat
        to get through.

                                                          DISSOLVE TO:

        EXT. WIDE MOUNTAIN VIEW - DAWN

        The first rays of the sun start to poke through the mountains.
        It's stopped snowing -- the storm seems to be letting up.

        INT. RANGER STATION

        Very quiet in here. Frank is snoring, slumped over the radio.
        Maggie is wide awake and obviously hasn't slept -- her
        attention is fixed out the window.

        MAGGIE'S POV - WINDSPEED GAUGE

        The gauge is still flying around, but clearly shows that the
        winds are slowing.

        INT. DENVER MINT - WRIGHT'S OFFICE

        Wright is coiled at his desk, tense. Ten empty styrofoam
        coffee cups -- and dark rings under Wright's eyes -- make
        clear he hasn't slept. Wright's assistant bursts in.

                                        DAVIS
                      We've got a fix on the plane, sir --
                      we're getting a reading on the flight
                      recorder tracer --

                                        WRIGHT
                      Any visual? Any radio contact?

                                        DAVIS
                      Not yet --

                                        WRIGHT
                            (heading to the door)
                      Get the copters ready. We take off in
                      three minutes.

                                        DAVIS
                      The winds are still too strong --

                                        WRIGHT
                      Sorry to hear it. We're still going.
                      The plane might be intact.

        Wright drags the protesting Davis out the door.

                                        DAVIS
                      Sir --

                                        WRIGHT
                      Shut up. That fifty million isn't
                      coming out of my pension.

        EXT. MOUNTAIN TOP - DOUGLAS TOURIST SHACK - DAY

        Travers, Qualen and the rest of the expedition head out of the
        shack, a little groggy. Odds are no one got much sleep.

        Travers shoves Hal toward a sketchy "YOU ARE HERE" map of the
        mountain range, and hands him the tracer monitor.

                                        TRAVERS
                      Still interested in staying alive?

        Hal matches the monitor to the map -- the blip is higher up.

                                        HAL
                            (pointing to map)
                      It's up here. Somewhere on the Tower.
                      There's a way to cross over to the top
                      in about half a day.

                                        TRAVERS
                      Show me.

        Travers shoves Hal forward -- the others follow.

        ELSEWHERE ON THE MOUNTAIN/SUMMIT - BINOCULAR POV

        From about fifty yards off, someone watches Hal lead the gang
        away from the shack.

                                        BRETT (O.S.)
                      They're heading toward the opposite
                      edge. An easy way down.

        BRETT AND EVAN

        are crouched in the woods. Brett, gun in hand, has no idea how
        far out of his league he is. Evan looks like he's having
        second thoughts, but he can't hack down now.

                                        BRETT
                      I'll cut around this side, and wind up
                      in front. You come up behind them --
                      quietly. And we've got 'em.

                                        EVAN
                      Brett -- they've got five guns --

                                        BRETT
                      And you can collect them all after I
                      get the drop on 'em. Let's get moving.

        Brett, automatic held high, circles off through the woods.
        Evan reluctantly lopes off toward his assignment.

        BELOW - GABE'S CAVE

        Gabe pulls his jacket on -- reversed, with the grey lining
        out, so the orange won't make him so easy to spot -- and
        starts out towards the facing Tower -- his route, clearly, is
        going to be along the rock wall. It's relatively sheer, but
        there are shelves cut into it to make walking easy.

        MOUNTAIN TOP/SUMMIT - BRETT

        races quietly through the woods in a parallel path with Hal,
        who's guiding the hang. Brett circles around ahead of them,
        waiting. Before he can jump out --

        HAL'S POV - ON BRETT

        hiding ahead in the trees and rocks.

        HAL

        makes eye contact with Brett, realizes what he's doing, and
        shakes his head as violently as he dares -- no, don't --

        BRETT

        gives Hal a confident wink in response, then pounces in front
        of the gang, gun held high.

                                        BRETT
                      End of the line!

        Travers, Delmer, Kristel and Kynette are startled, but don't
        immediately comply. This throws Brett off his stride.

                                        BRETT
                            (nervous now)
                      You heard me! Drop the guns!

        Travers smiles and steps closer to Brett. The others walk up
        in front of Hal. Travers actually laughs.

                                        TRAVERS
                      "End of the line"? That's classic.
                            (beat)
                      You've got style. So, I'm going to
                      give you a three-count to figure out
                      how to turn the safety off.

        Brett doesn't even look down -- he responds by FIRING a short
        burst over Travers' head.

                                        BRETT
                      Nice try. I've got one of these at
                      home. Now drop 'em.

        All drop their guns -- Brett, unfortunately, realizes at the
        same time we do --

                                        BRETT
                      Hey -- where's the other guy --

                                        HAL
                            (shouting)
                      Brett, behind you!

        Too late -- Brett can only twist around half way before --

        QUALEN

        easily mows down Brett with his machine gun, riddling him with
        at least thirty rounds at close range. Brett falls dead into
        the snow. Qualen walks up to Brett's corpse, blood steaming in
        the reddening snow, and kicks it over.

        BELOW ON THE WALLSIDE

        Gabe, reacting to the sound of the machine gun fire, climbs
        up, but there's nothing he can do --

        TRAVERS AND QUALEN

        and the others pick up their guns.

                                        TRAVERS
                            (turning to face Hal)
                      Time to --

        Travers sees that Hal is gone -- he's escaped in the
        confusion.

        IN THE WOODS - HAL

        runs like his ass is on fire and practically collides with
        Evan, who is more panicked than ever.

                                        EVAN
                      What are we going to do --

                                        HAL
                      You came up here to jump the spur --
                            (pulls Evan's chute out
                             of his pack)
                      This'd be a great time to do it.

                                        EVAN
                            (panicked)
                      But --

                                        HAL
                            (quick)
                      Listen -- they don't know you're up
                      here -- I'll draw their fire, you've
                      got to make the jump and get help.

                                        EVAN
                      I don't -- I -- uh --

                                        HAL
                            (exasperated, grabs
                             chute)
                      Unless you want to do it the other way
                      around?

        Evan snatches the parachute and runs off. Hal, wasting no
        time, runs in the opposite direction, deliberately making as
        much noise as he can, slapping branches, stomping on rocks.

        EXT. WOODS - THE BANG

        runs into the woods -- Qualen and Kristel, hearing Hal's noisy
        retreat, run after him.  But Travers stops for a second -- he
        has spotted

        EVAN'S FOOTPRINTS

        in the snow -- not unlike a neon arrow.

        TRAVERS

        runs in the direction of the footprints and quickly closes the
        gap between him and

        EVAN

        who tries to pull on the chute and run at the same time --
        it's not easy. Evan closes one of the three buckles -- but

        TRAVERS

        bursts out of the woods and runs up right behind him --

        QUALEN AND KRISTEL

        in the meantime, get behind Hal in a clearing -- Kristel FIRES
        over his head.

                                        KRISTEL
                      Stop!

        Hal, caught again, freezes in his tracks.

        EVAN

        is still up and running -- he dodges Travers' fire, weaving
        through trees, getting the second buckle closed -- he sees the
        edge, just ahead, and puts on an extra burst of speed --

        TRAVERS

        does likewise, still firing -- his clip runs out, but this
        only buys Evan an extra few seconds --

        THE SPUR

        is a rock formation that just out like a diving board -- Evan
        runs like hell to the edge of it --

        TRAVERS

        is right behind him, and has slapped a fresh clip in place,
        but before he can shoot --

        EVAN

        dives off the edge and clasps the third buckle --

        ON THE LEDGE - GABE

        is directly below a few hundred feet -- looking up, he thinks
        Evan has made it -- but

        ON THE SPUR EDGE - TRAVERS

        throws himself down, aims quickly but carefully, and FIRES
        twenty rounds towards Evan's falling figure --

        EVAN - FALLING

        Evan LAUGHS -- he hasn't been hit --

        GABE - WATCHING

                                        GABE
                      Come on -- wait till you're out of
                      range -- don't pull it yet --

        LONG SHOT - EVAN FALLING

        Several seconds pass -- Evan is now several hundred feet down
        and apparently out of firing range --

        TRAVERS

        stops firing -- but doesn't seem unhappy at all.

        EVAN

        LAUGHS more and pulls the D-ring -- the parachute billows
        open, inflating --

        CLOSE ON THE PARACHUTE

        which has been shredded by bullets that hit the pack -- as
        quickly as it inflates, it deflates through dozens of
        holes -- whatever resistance is left vanishes as the canopy
        collapses.

        EVAN'S

        exhilaration turns to panic as he frantically pulls on the
        chute's guide lines -- but the more he does this, the faster
        the chute caves in -- he SCREAMS as the chute finally gives
        way and plummets right past

        GABE ON THE LEDGE

        who is powerless to do anything but watch --

        EVAN

        falls the long, full five thousand feet, desperately,
        uselessly, pulling in the lines of the tattered chute until
        he's tangled in it like a shroud --

        GABE

        turns away -- he can't watch Evan hit bottom -- he grimaces
        and looks up with absolute hate at

        TRAVERS

        who doesn't see Gabe -- he's laughing at Evan's desperation,
        which ends as his death scream is cut off.

        Hal is led over to the spur, with the other gang members
        behind him. Hal looks as angry as Gabe.

                                        QUALEN
                      Was that Walker?

                                        TRAVERS
                      No such luck.
                            (to Hal, smiling)
                      Cheer up. Everyone should die in a
                      spot this beautiful.

        ON THE LEDGE BELOW - CLOSE ON GABE

        who has heard this and is shaking with fury.

                                        GABE
                            (quietly)
                      Don't worry. You will.

        LONG SHOT OF MOUNTAIN

        On top, Hal reluctantly leads the gang away -- below, we can
        see Gabe start out on a parallel path along the ledges.

        EXT. RANGER STATION - HELIPAD - DAY

        Winds or not, Maggie is untying the helicopter's rotor from
        the bolts on the helipad. Frank, who has obviously just
        awakened, rushes out of the station.

                                        FRANK
                      Maggie -- what are you doing --

                                        MAGGIE
                      I'm going to go nuts if I sit here one
                      more hour.

                                        FRANK
                      Still a little breezy out, Mag --

        Maggie gets into the helicopter and starts the rotor.

                                        MAGGIE
                            (over engine's whine)
                      You coming?

        Frank hesitates, but climbs in the other side. The helicopter
        lifts off and heads toward the mountain range.

        EXT. MOUNTAIN - AERIAL SHOT - DAY

        The next obstacle Hal is leading the gang through is a
        buttress -- a large, stark boulder formation -- that lays
        between the mountain they've just come from, and the nearest
        mountain to it: the Tower. This is lower down from the
        summit -- it's solid and treeless.

        Hal and the rest of the expedition is totally exposed as they
        climb in single file up to the top. Terrain is flat enough
        that the climb amount to an uphill run on all fours.

        CLOSER ON HAL AND GANG

        Hal leads the gang forward -- and keeps casting anxious
        glances back at them. And beyond them. Travers notices this.

                                        TRAVERS
                      Forget about it. He's smart, but he's
                      not invisible.

        Hal looks back. Travers is right. There's absolutely no way
        Gabe can come up behind them without being seen.

        LOWER DOWN ON BLUFF

        where the bluff meets a tree-lined plain. Gabe, in hiding,
        watches Hal and the others go up. No, he can't follow them up
        the bluff's side without being seen. But Gabe moves closer to
        the bluff's base -- Gabe shoves through some trees to the
        beginning of

        THE "CHIMNEY"

        A crevice runs the entire length and breadth of the bluff.

        GABE

        pulls out his ancient binoculars, and scans the crack.

        GABE'S POV - THE CHIMNEY

        Starting with an outside view, we can see that the crevice
        runs all the way up, and through, the bluff -- but it's a
        zig-zag, not a straight line.

        Picture a mine shaft designed by a madman. The crack moves
        upward, then erratically to the side, then straight up again.
        The width of the crack is uneven, ranging from six inches to
        six feet. And that's just how it looks on the outside.
        There's no telling what the interior is like.

        Gabe turns the binoculars to the inside of the crack. It's
        hard to see much -- it's very, very dark. But it looks as if
        the crack goes all the way through the bluff, as well as all
        the way up it. On this route, Gabe can tunnel through the
        mountain instead of going up the side.

        GABE

        puts away the binoculars and wedges himself into the crack,
        starting the long process of going up -- and through -- the
        mountain formation.

        EXT. COLORADO WILDERNESS - PLANE CRASH SITE - DAY

        A frenzy of activity, as several dozen Treasury agents sift
        through the snow for the wreckage of the CT-39, some taking
        photos, some taking videotapes, some putting the pieces into
        bags for analysis. Many bags. Many small bags.

        WIDER ON CRASH SITE

        The Treasury plane has been completely pulverized by the crash
        and its subsequent explosion -- there are few pieces here that
        aren't charred, and fewer still that are any larger than a
        paperback book.

        WRIGHT

        unhappily walks through the carnage and past agents gathering
        up the plane, to a harried crash specialist from the FAA --
        ROSS STUART (40s) -- who is organizing the debris.

                                        WRIGHT
                      What can you confirm?

                                        STUART
                      Well, sir -- it crashed. That, I can
                      confirm.
                            (condescending)
                      We've been here just about one hour.
                      These events take months to analyze.
                      So if you'll excuse me --

        He walks away -- but Wright, pissed, spins him around.

                                        WRIGHT
                      No, I don't think I will. The reason
                      the FAA pays you is to exercise your
                      vast, amazing knowledge of these
                      "events". So I expect you to come up
                      with some stunning insights, something
                      a slow-witted fuck like me hasn't
                      already observed.
                            (gesturing to wreckage)
                      One: it didn't blow up in mid-air,
                      because the debris isn't widely
                      dispersed. But was there a bomb on
                      board that could have disabled it? I
                      wonder.
                            (pointing back)
                      Two: There wasn't an attempted
                      landing. Otherwise, there'd be debris
                      to the east of the wreckage, where the
                      plane was coming from. Did it come
                      straight down? That's got me
                      scratching my head too.
                            (gesturing back to
                             wreckage)
                      And three: the flight recorder's
                      tracer led us here in the first place.
                      So where is the goddamn thing? That
                      one's got me all aflush with
                      curiosity.

                                        STUART
                            (a little cowed)
                      You'll be the first to know.

                                        WRIGHT
                      Oh, I believe you.

        Wright storms off as agents delicately handle debris.

        EXT. TOP OF THE BLUFF/VISTA - DAY

        A vista. From this point, you can see everything else in the
        mountain range. The only thing left that's taller is the
        Tower, a hundred yards away. Between the two mountains lies a
        drop of a mere four thousand feet.

        Hal has led the rest of the gang up to the edge. Travers
        approaches him, furious.

                                        TRAVERS
                      I thought you said there was an easy
                      way across.

                                        HAL
                      There is. You might not like it much.

        Hal points

        FURTHER DOWN

        A steep two hundred yard downhill climb leads to a wire that
        bridges the two mountains. The same wire we saw at the
        beginning -- left behind from Susan Collins' botched rescue.

        TOP OF BLUFF - HAL AND TRAVERS

                                        HAL
                      Of course -- we'll have to do it hand
                      over hand. Seems I forgot my harness.
                      Sorry.

                                        TRAVERS
                      Don't be. Lead on.

        Hal is surprised to see Kynette pull a harness out of his pack
        -- the one Travers used earlier. Disappointed, Hal leads the
        downward climb, looking several hundred yards to

        THE CRACK

        running up, and through, the bluff, coming out on this side.

        HAL'S FACE

        registers a thought -- will he? -- then dismissal. Nah. He
        couldn't.

        INT. THE CRACK/CHIMNEY - CLOSE ON GABE'S FACE

        Gabe is sweating, straining in the dark, climbing up -- this'd
        be a good spot to pull back and take in the view, except --

        THE CHIMNEY

        -- there's nowhere to pull back to. There's about two inches
        of clearance between Gabe's chest and the rock, and about the
        same between his back and the rock. To the right, there is no
        light. At all. To the left, there's no light. Even above,
        there is no light, because the crack isn't straight -- nature
        isn't that obliging -- it zig-zags up. Gabe is well within the
        mountain rock. Nothing could be closer to being buried alive
        Gabe snakes through a spot where the crack goes straight up --
        he takes out his penlight and turns it on --

        GABE'S POV - INSIDE THE CRACK AROUND HIM

        even this dim light reveals scores of bats hanging on the
        wall, surrounding him, up and down, left and right --

        GABE'S FACE

        is stuck somewhere between nausea and the realization that
        he's made a big mistake.

                                        GABE
                      I didn't need to see that. I really
                      didn't.

        Gabe cuts the light and slithers up through the dark.

        EXT. RESCUE HELICOPTER - DAY

        Maggie and Frank are flying low and fast, over treetops and
        snow -- both are intently staring down --

        THEIR VIEW

        is nothing but empty wilderness. But a BUZZER goes off --

        MAGGIE AND FRANK

        turn their attention to the helicopter's heat scope, which
        shows something alive beneath them.

                                        FRANK
                      Got 'em -- they're under the trees --

        Maggie smiles and slows the copter over a clearing --

        EXT. WOODS/THE COPTER

        touches down. Maggie is out of it before the rotor has stopped
        turning, running into the trees.

                                        MAGGIE
                      Hal! Gabe!

        Maggie runs into the trees, headlong into

        A PACK OF WOLVES

        that are preying on -- a body. A pair of legs are gruesomely
        sticking out from the feast. One wolf turns to SNARL at Maggie
        -- but Frank runs up and pulls a gun from a holster.

        Frank aims high and FIRES twice to scare the pack -- the
        wolves run off. Maggie goes to the body -- Frank holds her
        back, but she goes ahead anyway, worried it might be Gabe --

        TIGHT ON MAGGIE

        as she examines the body --

                                        MAGGIE
                      It's Evan.
                            (she stands, looks up)
                      Parachute failed.

                                        FRANK
                            (not unkindly)
                      Damn fool. Why would anybody try that
                      in the middle of a storm.

                                        MAGGIE
                      Why would anybody try at all.
                            (sighs)
                      Get the bag.

        INT. BLUFF CRACK/CHIMNEY

        Gabe has a quick climbing rhythm now. He pulls himself up with
        his hands, then braces his body with his back, and pulls
        himself up again -- he's not looking up, because he can't see
        anything yet anyway -- naturally, this leads to --

        A head and rock collision. Gabe's head crashes against a new
        part of the crack, as the passage thins out. He gropes up.
        The passage is narrowing to the point that he can't get
        through it. Dead end.

                                        GABE
                      Should've taken that left turn at
                      Albequerque.

        Gabe backs down, and starts to slide across the side. With
        his back wedged against the rear wall, he uses his feet to
        push against the forward wall.

        GABE'S POV - BLACK

        Zero visibility -- Gabe can't see what he's shoving toward.
        There has never been light of any kind in here.

        GABE

        blindly pushes to the side, rattled by the difficulty of doing
        this in the dark.

                                        GABE
                      It's just like any other side move --
                      you can't see where the fuck you're
                      going, that's all --

        Gabe stops and fishes out his penlight. Turning it on, it's
        clear those batteries haven't gotten any more potent in the
        last few hours. Gabe shines it to the side.

        GABE'S POV - THE LIGHT

        is fading fast. A match's last gasp is brighter.

        GABE

        exasperated, puts the penlight in his mouth and moves on.

                                        GABE
                            (garbled)
                      Much better.

        Gabe inches on to the side. Looks up to see if the crack has
        gotten wider. It hasn't. Gabe mumbles something phonetically
        near "motherfucker" around the flashlight, aiming it up --

        GABE'S POV - UP

        No opening larger than a mail slot --

        GABE

        still cursing, still looking up, still moving to the side --
        he gets the opening he wants, but not where he wants it --

        The crack suddenly, drastically widens as he moves to the
        side -- since he's been bracing his back against the wall,
        Gabe falls out of control, twisting around, face down --

        Gabe bounces down the walls for several yards and catches
        himself by bracing his arms and legs against the crack. It's
        now five feet wide as he painfully brakes himself --

        GABE'S POV - THE PENLIGHT

        falls out of Gabe's mouth and tumbles down, ping-ponging from
        one side of the crack to the other as it tumbles a long, long
        way down -- even after the light is gone, we can still hear
        the penlight's receding clattering against the walls --

        GABE

        is now, literally, in a jam. There are no handholds, no
        ledges, and the walls are slick. All he can do is remain
        braced against the crack's walls until his already sore arms
        and legs give out.

        EXT. RESCUE HELICOPTER - NEAR BLUFF'S BASE - DAY

        Frank is now flying the helicopter -- a body bag is stashed in
        the back, and Maggie is in the passenger seat.

                                        MAGGIE
                            (motioning down)
                      Bring it down here.

                                        FRANK
                      Maggie --

                                        MAGGIE
                      Just do it, Frank.

        EXT. BLUFF BASE

        The copter touches down -- Frank doesn't turn it off. Maggie
        jumps out with a walkie talkie. Frank makes another try.

                                        FRANK
                      Maggie, this is dumb --

                                        MAGGIE
                      No it isn't. I'm going to find
                      Brett -- I don't want to have to talk
                      to his widow too. Fly Evan's body
                      back to base -- I'll call you when
                      I've found Brett. Or Hal. Or Gabe.
                      Or anybody.

        Maggie runs off into the snow as Frank lifts off. Maggie moves
        quickly through the snow, and it isn't long before she spots
        multiple tracks in the snow -- they lead toward, and up, the
        buttress. Now she's really confused. But with nothing left to
        do, she starts climbing up the side.

        EXT. WIRE CROSSING - HAL'S POV

        As we've caught Hal in mid-crossing, he's looking from whence
        he came -- the opposite side of the buttress, where Travers
        has a gun trained on him --

        HAL

        unhappily hangs high above the ground from the harness kindly
        provided by Travers --

        HAL'S POV - ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE WIRE

        Kristel is waiting, also with a gun trained on him. Hal
        arrives and disengages -- the harness is pulled back.

        BUTTRESS SIDE OF WIRE

        Kynette pulls the harness back and hands it to Qualen, who's
        standing next to Travers.

                                        KYNETTE
                            (motioning up)
                      I'm going back.

                                        TRAVERS
                      Look -- this part is nothing,
                      believe me --

                                        KYNETTE
                      Walker should be coming up by now.

        Kynette, automatic strapped to his chest, rushes back to the
        buttress' summit.

        INT. BUTTRESS CRACK/CHIMNEY

        Gabe is just as we left him. Face down, arms and legs pressing
        against the five-foot gap of the tunnel walls.

        Carefully, Gabe takes one hand off the wall, gets out his
        lighter with the other, and ignites it for a look --

        GABE'S POV - UPWARD

        Just as the crack has widened below him -- it's wider above
        him. More important, it slants at an easy enough angle to
        allow him to walk up. If only he can get up there.

        GABE

        snaps the lighter shut, pockets it, and readies himself.

        Gabe steadily "walks" up the vertical passage by bracing
        himself with one leg and one arm -- then moving the other
        leg and arm up.

        Gabe repeats this until he has his hands on the curved edge
        where the crack snakes into a sideways passage. But there are
        no handholds that will allow Gabe to get a grip and simply
        swing over and climb up.

                                        GABE
                            (winded)
                      So much for the easy part.

        OVERHEAD ANGLE - THE CRACK

        Gabe takes a deep breath, readies himself, and shoves himself
        away from the wall with his arms, pushes himself into a squat
        against the opposite wall, hanging for a second with no
        support at all, and he springs from that all into

        THE DIAGONAL PASSAGE

        Gabe lands hard but flat on the passage and immediately starts
        backsliding into the drop, but he digs in with his boots and
        his hands. Safe at last. Gabe carefully stands in a crouch --
        and starts heading up.

        EXT. BUTTRESS TOP

        Kynette moves to the edge, lies flat, and looks down --

        KYNETTE'S POV - ON THE BUTTRESS SIDE

        Maggie is climbing up, but she's still some way down -- and
        the hood of her parka has been pulled over her head. All
        Kynette can see is what she's wearing: an orange parka.

        KYNETTE

        smiles and hits his headset radio.

                                        KYNETTE
                      He's on the way up. I could hear that
                      jacket before I could see it.

                                        TRAVERS (O.S.)
                            (over radio)
                      Then get the money, kill him and get
                      back here. Now.

                                        KYNETTE
                            (into radio)
                      I'll wait till he comes to me.

        Kynette flattens out to wait -- Maggie is coming up fast.

        INT. MOUNTAIN CRACK/CHIMNEY

        Gabe moves up through the diagonal section -- the crack is
        starting to go directly upward. Gabe looks up --

        GABE'S POV - TOP OF THE CRACK

        It's coated with snow, but not too much -- Gabe can faintly
        make out light shining through up there.

        GABE

        knows the top is twenty feet away. Gabe starts up the easy
        segment, his back braced against one wall.

        EXT. TOP OF BUTTRESS - KYNETTE

        is staring down intently at the climber below --

        KYNETTE'S POV - MAGGIE

        is now almost to the top -- sweating with exertion, she throws
        her hood back.

        KYNETTE

        keys his headset radio again.

                                        KYNETTE
                            (into radio)
                      Bulletin. The climber isn't Walker --
                      it's a woman.

        INT. MOUNTAIN CRACK/CHIMNEY

        Gabe, wedged near the top of the crack, is ready to dig
        through the snow -- but he hears the sound, muffled and
        distant, of Kynette talking. Gabe strains to hear -- a bad
        time to come up? Might be.

        EXT. BUTTRESS SIDE

        Maggie, tired, gets near the top and collapses, resting for a
        moment, her arms on the edge -- Maggie looks up and is very
        surprised to see Kynette, standing over her, smiling, his gun
        aimed down at her.

                                        KYNETTE
                      Rotten weather for a climb, huh?
                            (aims barrel)
                      I have two questions I'd like to
                      trouble you with. Ready?

        Maggie stares up, frozen -- whatever she was expecting, it
        wasn't this.

                                        KYNETTE
                      This first one's easy. Do you know a
                      man named Gabe Walker?

                                        MAGGIE
                      Yes.
                            (breathless, scared)
                      Where is he?

                                        KYNETTE
                      You don't know either? I am sorry.
                      That was question number two.
                            (lowers barrel)
                      Thanks for your time.

        As Kynette tightens his finger around the trigger --

        GABE

        appears -- he completes his run toward Kynette's back and
        kicks him over the edge --

        KYNETTE

        goes flying over Maggie, his shots going wild -- but he
        catches himself on the rock and comes to a painful but safe
        halt after skidding down ten feet --

        GABE

        yanks Maggie to her feet and onto the top. Maggie gets a good
        look at Gabe -- his clothes are slashed, he's covered with
        cuts, and coated with slime and dirt from the crack. He looks
        like he's just spent a week in Hell. Gabe doesn't react to her
        reaction -- he just grabs her hand and runs.

        QUALEN

        chooses this moment to show up at the opposite edge -- he
        fires and automatic BURST at Gabe and Maggie.

                                        GABE
                      Come on --

                                        MAGGIE
                      Where? --

                                        GABE
                      Here.

        Gabe jumps on a spot in the snow over the crack, caving it
        in -- Gabe falls two feet into

        THE CRACK - MAGGIE'S POV

        Gabe has grabbed, and is hanging from, a rope anchored to a
        piton on the edge of the rock. He's also glowering up at
        Maggie a little impatiently.

                                        GABE
                      Today, goddamit!

        Gabe rappels down the rope into the darkness.

        MAGGIE

        hesitates -- she's still getting used to the idea of being
        shot at --

        KYNETTE

        woozy but recovered, has climbed up -- he runs toward the
        opening, FIRING his gun --

        MAGGIE

        drops into the relative safety of the crack and rappels
        downward.

        Maggie reaches rope's end thirty feet down, as the vertical
        passage again becomes diagonal. Gabe is there waiting.

        KYNETTE

        reaches the edge of the crack and FIRES down into it --

        GABE AND MAGGIE - FURTHER DOWN

        -- bullets are RICOCHETING all over -- Gabe throws himself
        over Maggie to shield her.

        KYNETTE

        can't see what he's shooting at, so he mercifully stops.
        Seeing the rope, he bends down to climb after them --

        GABE AND MAGGIE - FURTHER DOWN

        Gabe reaches up and tugs gently on the rope twice --

        KYNETTE - REACHING FOR THE ROPE

        -- which is tied in a standard climber's slipknot and comes
        undone with a final tug -- the rope, freed of the piton, falls
        down, but Kynette firmly grabs hold of the end --

        GABE

        feels the rope go taut -- he yanks the rope down hard --

        KYNETTE

        gets more pull than he counted on and takes a head first fall
        into the crack, disappearing with a scream -- Qualen has just
        arrived in time to see this --

        GABE

        looks over as Kynette bounces past him, a few feet away -- the
        rope goes slack in his hand as Kynette falls below.

        UP ABOVE - QUALEN

        in frustration, FIRES a burst straight down into the crack --

        GABE AND MAGGIE - IN THE CRACK/CHIMNEY

        Gabe and Maggie move laterally through the crack -- now about
        thirty feet from where they started, so ricochets are a
        serious but decreasing problem.

        The crack narrows from five to three feet. Gabe edges Maggie
        down into it, and along a ledge moving to the side.

                                        GABE
                      This way.
                            (off Maggie's look)
                      I like the outside of the mountain
                      better too, but --

        Gabe and Maggie move along the ledge --

        QUALEN

        is still at the edge of the crack -- stymied. He's definitely
        not climbing down after them -- he pulls back from the edge.

        IN THE CRACK/CHIMNEY - GABE AND MAGGIE

        find a comparative point of comfort -- a toe-sized ledge.
        Maggie is moving ahead of Gabe.

                                        GABE
                      Stop.

                                        MAGGIE
                      We can't --

                                        GABE
                      I need to stop.

        Exhausted, Gabe braces himself against the wall.

                                        GABE
                            (looks at Maggie)
                      I'm glad to see you -- but Christ, I
                      wish you hadn't come.

        EXT. WIRE CROSSING - TOWER SIDE - DAY

        Qualen whizzes across the wire on the harness, easily making
        it to where Hal, Travers and Kristel are waiting.

                                        TRAVERS
                      Don't tell me --

                                        QUALEN
                            (disengaging)
                      He's still alive.

        Travers takes a couple of heavy swings at the connecting bolt
        with Hal's axe. Qualen grabs his arm before he can take a
        third swing -- and looks at his watch.

                                        QUALEN
                      For another two minutes.

        IN THE CRACK/CHIMNEY - GABE AND MAGGIE

        Gabe catches his breath. All this is taking its toll on him.

                                        MAGGIE
                      It hurts just looking at you.

                                        GABE
                            (still panting)
                      Try it from this side. Do you still
                      have your radio?

                                        MAGGIE
                      It's not going to work in here.

                                        GABE
                      Let's give it a try.
                            (she hands it to him)
                      I'm in bad need of a ride.
                            (keys it)
                      Come in, Rescue Unit --

        EXT. TOWER FACE - DAY

        Hal is leading the expedition upward along a ledge -- the
        radio, in Travers' pack, comes to life.

                                        GABE (O.S.)
                            (over radio)
                      -- Come in, Rescue One --

        Travers stares daggers at Qualen. Qualen looks to his watch.

                                        QUALEN
                      Patience.

        INT. RESCUE STATION

        The radio is reading Gabe loud, if not clear -- the
        interference of solid rock is garbling it. But we can see out
        the window that Frank is now between radios, carefully
        hauling Evan's body from the helicopter to the station on a
        collapsible gurney. No one else is in the station.

                                        GABE (O.S.)
                            (over radio, broken up)
                      -- Come in, Frank --

        INT. BUTTRESS CRACK/CHIMNEY

        Gabe, exasperated, stops for a moment.

                                        GABE
                      Is there anybody else on the radio?

        Maggie shakes her head no.

                                        GABE
                      I take a year off and the department
                      goes to hell.
                            (keys it)
                      -- Come in, Rescue Unit --

        TOP OF BUTTRESS - HIGH ANGLE

        We can see there are three holes punched in the snow along the
        crack's top --

        CLOSER ON ONE OF THE HOLES

        Recognizably the part of the crack Gabe and Maggie dove
        into -- but perched on the edge is a block of plastic
        explosive -- the detonator LED races down -- 0:20 -- 0:19 --

        A SECOND HOLE

        has been punched in the snow at the center point of the
        crevice's top -- another bomb has been planted there --

        A THIRD HOLE

        at the opposite end of the crevice has a third timer tied to
        a third pack of plastics --

        EXT. TOWER FACE

        Qualen is staring at his watch, but pointing the others toward
        the buttress.

                                        GABE (O.S.)
                            (via radio)
                      Come in, Frank -- over --

                                        QUALEN
                      Try to get thirty million in
                      entertainment out of this, because he
                      is definitely in for thirty million
                      worth of pain.

        Gabe's radio calls continue as Qualen extends his arm towards
        the buttress and starts a silent hand countdown, stage manager
        style -- five -- four -- three --

        INSERT - TIMER

        The LED runs down -- 0:02 -- 0:01 --

        THE BUTTRESS TOP

        is shattered by a huge blast as the first bomb detonates --

        INSIDE THE CRACK/CHIMNEY

        The walls are pulverized near the top and cave in, raining
        rocks further down towards --

        GABE AND MAGGIE

        who are hit by a blast of air booming down through the
        confined space -- Gabe drops the radio -- Maggie slips, but
        Gabe grabs her -- both slide down the crack, out of control,
        until it narrows to a three foot width -- and they stop --
        Gabe shoves Maggie against the wall and tries to protect her
        with his body as the rocks start to rain down --

        TOWER FACE

        Hal lunges at Qualen, but is held back by Travers.

                                        HAL
                      You sick fuck --

                                        QUALEN
                      Don't worry. They may still be alive.
                      That was the small one.

        RESCUE STATION

        Frank stops wheeling the gurney and looks up at the far-off
        blast, and the smoke, amazed.

                                        FRANK
                      Jesus -- that's some flare.

        INSIDE THE CRACK

        Rocks tumble down it, filling it in and sealing it off --

        FURTHER DOWN - GABE

        is braced over Maggie, protecting her from the first round of
        falling rocks, but rolling THUNDER in the crack announces that
        more is coming -- Gabe looks up as the noise gets closer --

        ABOVE IN THE CRACK

        The rockslide arrives -- the crack is filled in seconds with
        rocks and dirt, packing it in -- Gabe tries to hold on, but is
        shoved down by the falling rocks -- Maggie, however, is
        buried in the crack as it fills --

        GABE

        is knocked down to a point where the crack narrows -- he stops
        himself by jamming his body against the sides. Suddenly, it's
        quiet. A little dirt whistles through, but that's all.

        The cave-in has stopped, as it's filled in the crack above.

        And Maggie is in the middle of it.  Gabe unsheaths his ice axe
        and starts hacking up to get at Maggie. Dirt and rocks fall in
        his face as he digs --

        BOMB NUMBER TWO - INSERT

        Another LED is counting down from 3:00 -- 2:59 -- 2:58 --

        INSIDE THE CRACK

        Gabe frantically hacks at the ceiling of dirt -- rock and soil
        tumble down, but no sign of Maggie. Gabe uncovers one of
        Maggie's feet. Is it too late? Gabe digs up around her --

        Maggie realizes Gabe is there -- she starts kicking.

        Finally Maggie tumbles out of the cave-in -- gasping and
        coughing, but alive.  Gabe catches her and brushes the dirt
        off her face.

                                        GABE
                      Are you all right?

                                        MAGGIE
                            (terrified, coughing)
                      Why are they doing this?

        RESCUE STATION

        Frank, having lain Evan's body to rest, runs back to the
        helicopter, starts it up and takes off.

        INSIDE THE CRACK/CHIMNEY

        Gabe is leading Maggie horizontally through the crack, fast
        and furious --

                                        MAGGIE
                            (looks up)
                      We might be able to get up that way --
                      there's an opening --

                                        GABE
                      No -- there could be another bomb up
                      there -- even if there isn't, we could
                      get another cave-in. The only sure way
                      out is through the side.

        EXT. TREASURY PLANE CRASH SITE - DAY

        Treasury agents sift debris as Davis runs up to Stuart.

                                        DAVIS
                      I've got something here.

                                        STUART
                      Let's have it.

                                        DAVIS
                      There's an unconfirmed report of a
                      distress call made from a plane that
                      crashed.

                                        STUART
                      That's really, really interesting, but
                      --
                            (gestures around)
                      -- kind of old news, don't you think?

                                        DAVIS
                      This call was supposedly made from a
                      plane that crash landed. After it
                      landed.

                                        STUART
                            (waves it off)
                      Sounds like they got it wrong. Next
                      time you interrupt my work make sure
                      it's something I can use.

        INT. MOUNTAIN CRACK/CHIMNEY

        Gabe and Maggie cautiously move along a single ledge --
        finally, some light can be seen, thirty feet ahead, as they
        round a corner.

                                        GABE
                            (smiling)
                      Come on -- we're almost out.

        The crack narrows, and Gabe straddles it, putting his feet on
        the opposite edge to walk faster. But before he can go on --

        A HAND

        grabs one of Gabe's ankles from below and yanks him down --
        Gabe tumbles painfully, braking himself in front of

        KYNETTE

        bruised and bloody, who has survived the earlier fall and made
        his way out. His look is not a forgiving one.

                                        KYNETTE
                      Miss me?

        Kynette smashes Gabe's face with a devastating, brass-knuckled
        punch --

        GABE

        falls back, desperately grabbing at the walls to stop himself
        from going all the way down -- as he weakly tries to get up --

        KYNETTE

        calmly opens his knife, and re-laces his fingers into its
        brass-knuckle handle.

        TOWER FACE

        The gang and Hal watch the mountain top, with very different
        expectations and hopes -- their vantage point keeps them from
        seeing where the crack actually comes out.

                                        QUALEN
                            (looks to Hal)
                      You might say a few words for your
                      friends -- this is the one that will
                      bury them.

        BOMB NUMBER TWO - INSERT

        Ready to blow -- 0:10 -- 0:09 --

        IN THE CRACK - MAGGIE

        can only look down helplessly at

        GABE AND KYNETTE

        fighting -- Gabe is on his feet, but Kynette, slashing at him
        with his knife, is forcing Gabe to back up -- the crack is
        getting wider, and finding footholds while crab-walking
        backwards in the dark isn't east.

        Gabe's in a rotten fighting position -- as he has to spread
        his feet out wider as he backs up, he's always lower than
        Kynette.

        Gabe throws a punch at Kynette's stomach, but there's no power
        to it. Kynette hits Gabe with a brutal knuckle-duster punch --
        Gabe flies back several feet, somehow managing to straddle the
        crack walls -- which are now four feet apart. Kynette moves in
        for the kill.

        BOMB NUMBER TWO - INSERT

        The LED counts down -- 0:02 -- 0:01 -- 0:00 -- but doesn't
        detonate. A green light starts flashing, but the bomb hasn't
        gone off.

        IN THE CRACK/CHIMNEY

        Kynette moves in over Gabe and swings down with the knife --
        But Gabe grabs his knife hand, and adding his own force to the
        swing, imbeds the knife to the hilt in the rock wall,
        trapping Kynette's hand in the brass-knuckle handle.

        Gabe stabilizes himself on Kynette's trapped arm and gets a
        little payback -- three solid roundhouse punches to Kynette's
        face -- he then climbs up his pinned opponent, stepping up
        on Kynette's stuck hand as if it were a piton.

        TOWER FACE

        Qualen's smirk is wiped off his face. The bomb didn't work?

                                        TRAVERS
                      What happened?

                                        QUALEN
                      I'm not sure -- I set the timer --

        Qualen gestures helplessly, putting the radio in Hal's reach.
        Hal takes advantage of this, throws off Travers, and grabs the
        radio.

                                        HAL
                            (keying radio)
                      Gabe, it's a dud --

        But the second Hal transmits --

        BOMB NUMBER TWO

        detonates over the central part of the crevice, and as
        promised, it's even bigger than the first --

        INSIDE THE CRACK

        The bomb instantly blasts tons of rock down the crevice --

        GABE AND MAGGIE

        The RUMBLE of the approaching rockslide is unmistakable --
        Gabe shoves Maggie forward --

                                        GABE
                      Move!

        Maggie doesn't have to be told twice -- she and Gabe move out
        the narrowed crack quickly, but under the circumstances,
        this "running" looks damn slow --

        KYNETTE

        struggles with the stuck knife as the cave-in knocks him off
        the wall and buries him instantly --

        GABE AND MAGGIE

        cover the last ten feet, shoved forward by an airburst from
        the giant explosion -- they make it to the crack's edge at
        last, but on the

        OUTSIDE OF THE MOUNTAIN

        Gabe and Maggie still have to cling desperately to the sheer
        wall -- the airburst has turned the crack into a wind
        tunnel -- it's as if the mountain were trying to blow them
        out.

        TOWER FACE

        Hal, shocked, stares at the enormity of the explosion. Qualen
        looks serenely satisfied.

                                        QUALEN
                      When I was seventeen, I was a sentry
                      on the East Berlin boundary.
                      There was a problem, then -- too many
                      defectors were managing to sneak
                      through the wilderness to the west. A
                      man would take them through, every
                      night of every week -- a man like your
                      friend.
                            (beat)
                      He had quite a sense of humor. Every
                      time he got someone through, he'd
                      radio us at midnight to let us know
                      how many. "Five tonight." "Eight
                      more have been freed tonight." No one
                      could find the route. It made me look
                      bad.
                            (beat)
                      I looked day and night and finally I
                      found it. A tunnel. I didn't tell me
                      superiors. I put a charge there, with
                      a timer to trigger a radio receiver on
                      the detonator. At midnight. Our friend
                      made his radio report, and I heard him
                      say "seven" before the explosion.
                            (beat)
                      They pulled eight bodies out of the
                      tunnel, and I was promoted to
                      intelligence the next day.

        Hal, stunned, looks at the radio, realizing Qualen tricked
        him into detonating the bomb. Travers, grinning, takes the
        radio from Hal and pats him on the back.

                                        TRAVERS
                      Thanks. We couldn't have killed him
                      without you.

        GABE AND MAGGIE - ON THE WALL

        The force of the airburst, as brief as it is strong, is over.
        Dust slowly swirls out -- Gabe and Maggie raise their heads.
        Gabe looks back -- the crack is now sealed off. Gabe takes a
        piton and hammer from his belt and hands it to Maggie along
        with the rope.

                                        GABE
                      Knock this in the side. Make it firm.

        Maggie does as Gabe takes the binoculars out, and climbs out
        on a slim toehold so he can look up the wall.

        GABE'S POV - UP THE WALL

        Gabe whips the binoculars up to the top edge of the wall. It's
        blurry -- Gabe focuses the binoculars on -- the third
        bomb, visible on the mountain's edge. The LED counts down,
        but it's partly obscured. All Gabe can see is the seconds, not
        the minutes, that remain -- :42 -- :41 --

                                        GABE (O.S.)
                      Bad news. There's another bomb up
                      there. We've got to move quick.

        Gabe scans methodically but rapidly down the rock below. All
        smooth. Until -- Gabe swings the binoculars back. There's a
        lip ninety feet below, leading into the wall. A cave.

                                        GABE (O.S.)
                      Good news. There's a cave down there.

        GABE

        puts away the binoculars and swings back to Maggie -- she lets
        the length of rope drop. It's thirty feet long. Not even
        almost long enough to get to the shelter. Gabe leans against
        the crack wall, drained. Now what?

        HELICOPTER - MOVING OVER MOUNTAINS

        Frank is in the air, heading back out toward the range,
        frantically working the radio.

                                        FRANK
                      Maggie -- come in, Maggie, this is
                      Rescue One --

        TOWER FACE

        Frank's call is heard on the radio. Travers takes it, and
        takes charge.

                                        TRAVERS
                      There's our ride out of here. Everyone
                      out of sight -- except you, Kristel.
                            (hands her radio)
                      Make the distress call. You're so good
                      at it.

        All scramble up towards the clearing.

        INSERT - THE THIRD BOMB

        We can see what Gabe couldn't -- the timer has about two
        minutes left -- 1:59 -- 1:58 --

        GABE AND MAGGIE - AT THE CRACK'S EDGE

        Gabe looks completely defeated. Can't go up. Can't go back in.
        Can't go down.

                                        MAGGIE
                            (frantic)
                      What are we going to do?

                                        GABE
                            (defeated)
                      Die. I'm sorry, Maggie. I'm sorry you
                      got into this.

        Gabe and Maggie fuse together in a tight embrace -- a final
        embrace. But Gabe opens his eyes as the rope, still in
        Maggie's hand, brushes his cheek. The end is frayed.

        Gabe's eyes light up. Inspiration. Gabe breaks off the embrace
        and snatches the rope from her -- he pulls at the end and
        furiously starts unravelling it.

                                        MAGGIE
                      What are you doing?

        EXT. TREASURY PLANE CRASH SITE - DAY

        Davis has just filled in Wright on the "unconfirmed" distress
        call. Wright looks furious.

                                        WRIGHT
                      He didn't think a distress call from a
                      crashed plane was "important"?
                            (Davis nods)
                      Get me a fucking radio! Now!

        EXT. HELICOPTER

        flying over the mountains.

        INT. HELICOPTER

        Frank is practically there, heading toward the buttress and
        the facing Tower.

                                        FRANK
                            (over radio)
                      Come in, Maggie, over --

                                        KRISTEL (O.S.)
                            (over radio -- "weak")
                      Alpha Charlie Niner -- please --
                      help --

        Frank recognizes the pilot's voice from the "distress call".

                                        FRANK
                            (over radio)
                      I copy, Charlie Niner -- what's your
                      position -- over --

        An aerial flare fires up, leaving a clear marker.

                                        FRANK
                            (over radio)
                      Sit tight, Charlie Niner -- I'm right
                      on top of you.

        GABE AND MAGGIE - AT THE CRACK'S EDGE

        Gabe is still unravelling the rope fiber -- it's three
        different segments wound together. The helicopter flies
        overhead -- and past.

                                        MAGGIE
                            (shouting, waving)
                      Frank! Down here! Frank!
                                        
                                        GABE
                      Forget about it. He can't hear you.
                            (hands Maggie some rope)
                      Tie these together. Tight.

                                        MAGGIE
                            (realizing)
                      -- Are you out of your mind --

                                        GABE
                      This is rope from the Gordon exhibit.
                      The way guys climbed then, they'd tie
                      on three at a time -- this rope'll
                      take around nine hundred pounds.

                                        MAGGIE
                      Gabe -- this rope is sixty years old
                      --

                                        GABE
                            (misses the point)
                      Yeah, they made it pretty good then.
                      Each of these strands ought to hold
                      about 300 pounds before snapping.

        Gabe rapidly ties the rope to the piton -- Maggie works on the
        third connecting knot as she does the mental calculation of
        what she and Gabe weigh together.

                                        MAGGIE
                            (dazed)
                      Ought to. About.
                            (beat)
                      Will it hold?

        Gabe takes the line from her and lets it drop. Ninety feet of
        what looks like twine.

                                        GABE
                      Depends on how big a breakfast you
                      had. You want to go first?

        Maggie's stunned -- but there's no choice. She starts the
        rappel down, and Gabe is close behind.

        INSERT - THE THIRD BOMB

        is ready to blow -- 0:12 -- 0:11 --

        MAGGIE AND GABE - RAPPELLING DOWN

        To make this even trickier, they have to swing over to the
        side about fifteen feet to get to the cave -- meaning they
        have to move down in pendulum type swings that put even more
        pressure on

        THE ROPE

        which looks sorely tested at one knot -- it's coming undone --

        MAGGIE AND GABE - RAPPELLING

        They swing down lower -- twenty feet to the cave, four
        thousand to the ground --

        INSERT - THE BOMB

        -- 0:04 -- 0:03 --

        MAGGIE AND GABE - RAPPELLING

        They reach the end of the rope -- six feet above the cave
        and fifteen feet away laterally.

                                        GABE
                            (shouting)
                      Swing towards it -- and drop!

        Maggie nods -- they start the swing over -- as they get over
        the cave's lip --

        THE ROPE

        snaps --

        MAGGIE AND GABE

        fall, landing roughly on the cave's narrow lip -- Gabe
        starts to slip over, but Maggie pulls him back as --

        ABOVE ON THE WALL

        The bomb detonates and starts raining debris -- an instant,
        massive rockslide --

        MAGGIE AND GABE

        dive into the small cave as the rockslide tumbles past --
        exhausted, they collapse on the cave floor.

        THE HELICOPTER - OVER THE TOWER

        Frank, obviously, is surprised by the nearby explosion.

                                        FRANK
                      What the fuck --

        But he sees Kristel in a clearing. Face down in the snow.
        First things first.

        EXT. TOWER/CLEARING

        Frank lands near her, and rushes over to her. Frank turns her
        over and breaks a capsule under her nose. She "wakes up" with
        a start and looks "terrified".

                                        KRISTEL
                      What -- who are --

                                        FRANK
                      Don't worry. I'm here to help.

                                        KRISTEL
                            (recovered)
                      Glad to hear it.

        Kristel sees the snap is off Frank's holster -- she grabs it,
        spins it around, and pulls the trigger. CLICK. Frank grabs
        her wrist with a move faster than you'd expect from him, and
        he yanks the pistol back.

                                        FRANK
                      Jailhouse load. First chamber's
                      empty --
                            (aims gun)
                      -- the rest aren't. Forgive me, but
                      things have been a little strange this
                      morning.

        Nearby, the helicopter radio crackles to life. Frank backs
        toward the helicopter, keeping the gun trained on Kristel.

        But Frank only gets to the helicopter door before --

        DELMER

        comes out of hiding and empties a clip from his automatic into
        Frank. Frank is pinned to the door by the fusillade before he
        can even get a shot off. Travers runs over to Delmer and
        shoves the barrel up.

                                        TRAVER
                      Stop!
                            (explaining)
                      You'll damage the helicopter.

        As if to punctuate this, Frank -- and the now ruined pilot
        side door -- fall to the ground. The radio continues to squawk
        as Travers grabs Frank's discarded gun.

                                        TRAVERS
                            (to Kristel)
                      Answer that.

        Kristel brushes the snow off her and goes over to the radio.

                                        STUART (O.S.)

                      Rocky Mountain Rescue One, over --

        EXT. TREASURY PLANE CRASH SITE - DAY

        Wright, davis, and an irritated Stuart huddle over a radio.

                                        STUART
                      This is Ross Stuart, Federal Aviation
                      Administration -- please identify --
                      over --

        EXT. HELICOPTER - DAY

        By now, the others have come out of hiding and up to the
        helicopter. Kristel grabs some papers from a plastic packet on
        the helicopter seat -- and keys the mike.

                                        KRISTEL
                      Copy, FAA. This is Margaret Deighan,
                      Rocky Mountain Rescue. Over --

                                        STUART (O.S.)
                      We have an unconfirmed report of an
                      air crash in your area, and a distress
                      call on this frequency -- can you
                      confirm -- over --

                                        KRISTEL
                            (keying mike)
                      Copy, FAA. Distress call came at
                      approximately eleven hundred hours
                      yesterday. I investigated -- the call
                      turned out to be a false alarm. Over.

        EXT. TREASURY PLANE CRASH SITE - DAY

        Stuart gestures with exasperated triumph.

                                        STUART
                      Please repeat, Rocky Mountain
                      Rescue -- distress call was a false
                      alarm? -- over --

                                        KRISTEL (O.S.)
                            (over radio)
                      Repeat, distress call was a definite
                      false alarm -- we've had several here.
                      Somebody's sick idea of a joke. Do you
                      require further assistance -- over --

                                        STUART
                      Not from you. Thanks, Rocky Mountain
                      Rescue -- over and out --

        Stuart shuts off the radio with finality.

                                        STUART
                      I don't want to say I told you so. But
                      I did. Can I go back to work now?

        EXT. HELICOPTER/TOWER CLEARING - DAY

        Kristel smiles and puts the radio mike back into its bracket.

                                        TRAVERS
                      I almost believed you myself.

        Travers smiles and turns, looking at

        HAL

        trembling with fury and grief, bent over Frank's body as the
        last trace of vapor -- his breath -- trails from his lips.
        He's gone. Hal gently closes the eyes of his friend.

                                        HAL
                            (quiet)
                      Goodbye, Frank.

        Travers moves up behind Hal and kicks him.

                                        TRAVERS
                      Time for number three. Unless you want
                      to have a longer conversation with him
                      elsewhere.

                                        HAL
                            (low)
                      Fuck off.

        Travers kicks him in the face, knocking him into the snow.

                                        HAL
                      I think I'll wait here. You just
                      murdered three of my friends. Sooner
                      or later, whoever's chasing you is
                      going to show up and return the favor,
                      and I'd love to watch.

        Travers puts his gun at Hal's forehead and shrugs.

                                        TRAVERS
                      Suit yourself. You see, we just had a
                      little interface with several branches
                      of the federal government -- one of
                      whose members I know has zero
                      imagination -- and I can tell you, the
                      cavalry just isn't going to make it by
                      this week.
                            (beat)
                      No, you're taking us where we want to
                      go. Because you want to return that
                      favor and you want to do more than
                      watch. You want to kill me -- more
                      than anything, even more than you want
                      to keep on breathing, and with a
                      little more time you pray you'll get
                      that chance.
                            (tightens trigger)
                      Am I right?

        Hal's answer is a stony, loathing stare. He gets up. But --

        INSERT - HAL'S HAND

        -- we can see Hal has palmed something from Frank's body.

        INT. CAVE - GABE AND MAGGIE

        Dust from the rockslide is drifting past the cave opening, but
        the worst is over. Gabe rolls Maggie over carefully.

                                        GABE
                      Are you okay?

                                        MAGGIE
                      My ears are ringing -- but I'm all
                      right. Gabe, what's going on?

                                        GABE
                            (shows money in his pack)
                      This. That plane crash -- it's a half
                      dozen guys who were smart enough to
                      steal fifty million bucks, but dumb
                      enough to drop it all over the range.
                      They've got Hal as a bird dog -- and
                      right now they're heading for the rest
                      of it.

                                        MAGGIE
                      Where?

                                        GABE
                      It's close to the lake -- Hal's
                      probably leading them on the slowest
                      possible route down to it.
                           (stiffly gets up)
                      I can get there first -- all I have to
                      do is make it along the north wall to
                      the Bitker ladder --

                                        MAGGIE
                      "All?" Jesus, Gabe -- what do you
                      expect to do then?

                                        GABE
                            (aching)
                      Something -- subtle.

        Gabe lurches towards the cave opening, looking more like
        Quasimodo than a champion climber. Maggie stops him.

                                        MAGGIE
                      I'm going with you.

                                        GABE
                      No way. You're climbing back down --
                      try to get to the station or find some
                      help.

                                        MAGGIE
                      I'm just as good a climber as you
                      are -- and right now, I'm definitely
                      in better shape.

                                        GABE
                            (hard)
                      And you're definitely not going --

        Maggie stares Gabe down. Guess who won all the arguments when
        they were together. Gabe's face is a portrait of familiar
        exasperation.

                                        GABE
                      Okay. Come on --

        As they move out of the cave together, Gabe favors one foot.

                                        GABE
                      -- but the second you slow me down,
                      I'm leaving --
                            (slips on sore leg,
                             Maggie catches him)
                      -- I'm leaving you behind. Understood?

                                        MAGGIE
                            (helping Gabe out)
                      Anything you say, Gabe.

        EXT. TREASURY PLANE CRASH SITE - ON CHUNK OF WRECKAGE

        If you have a good imagination, this corner of charcoal looks
        like it could have been --

                                        WRIGHT (O.S.)
                      One of the currency cases.

        WRIGHT AND DAVIS

        are standing over some of the wreckage. One of the suits bags
        and tags the "briefcase".

                                        DAVIS
                      We've tested the ash inside -- it's
                      the right paper.

                                        WRIGHT
                      What about the men?

                                        DAVIS
                      It's -- hard to tell. But forensics
                      says yes. All of them were in the
                      plane.

                                        WRIGHT
                            (sags with the news)
                      Everything's accounted for, then --
                      time to head back and start making
                      excuses.
                            (beat)
                      Fifty million bucks up in smoke, and I
                      just don't give a shit. It's one more
                      run of the press. But we lost five
                      good men and they aren't so easily
                      replaced.
                            (beat)
                      Especially a guy like Travers.

        EXT. MOUNTAIN TOP/TOWER - HELICOPTER - DAY

        Dedicated agent Travers leans in reasonable comfort against
        the helicopter and keys his headset mike.

                                        TRAVERS
                      Qualen. How far along are you?

                                        QUALEN (O.S.)
                            (over radio)
                      Not as far as we'd be with the
                      helicopter.

        FURTHER DOWN ON MOUNTAIN/TOWER

        Qualen, Kristel and Delmer follow Hal's lead down the side --
        it's not too steep a grade, but it's solid rock and it's
        covered with ice and fresh snow -- all have to brace
        themselves with their hands to keep from slipping down.

                                        TRAVERS (O.S.)
                            (over radio)
                      We have less than half a tank of fuel,
                      Eric -- if we burn it up treasure
                      hunting we'll never get off this rock.
                      Now -- how far away are you?

                                        QUALEN
                            (keys radio)
                      It looks like two miles, but --

        Qualen's foot slides out from under him -- he catches himself.

                                        QUALEN
                      -- it'll take some time.

                                        TRAVERS (O.S.)
                            (over radio)
                      Time we have -- Walker's dead,
                      Wright's an idiot. And our guide --

                                        QUALEN
                            (keys radio)
                      What about him?

                                        TRAVERS (O.S.)
                            (over radio)
                      As soon as he becomes a convenience
                      instead of a necessity -- kill him.

                                        QUALEN
                            (keys radio)
                      Agreed.

        HAL

        can only hear Qualen's end of the conversation -- but his face
        shows he can guess what they're talking about.

                                                           CUT TO:

        GABE'S FACE - CLOSE

        Gabe's rattled too -- but for a brand new reason -- we PULL
        BACK to see Gabe at

        THE WIRE'S EDGE

        where the wire -- that wire -- links the buttress with the
        facing Tower. Whipping in the wind, it looks risky -- but
        that's not the problem.

        Gabe stares at the other edge for a moment. Immobile.
        Remembering Susan's death. Gabe shakes out of it when --

                                        MAGGIE
                      Gabe?
                            (beat)
                      I'll go first.

                                        GABE
                            (shakes his head)
                      If I don't go first, I might not go at
                      all.

        Gabe hooks his ankles over the wire and starts dragging
        himself, hand over hand, across the abyss -- no safety line
        this time. As his weight pulls the line taut, the wind rocks
        him back and forth. Gabe steadily drags himself out --

        GABE ON WIRE - LONG SHOT

        Fatigue stops Gabe in the middle -- a half mile up, strung
        between two gigantic mountains, he looks as insignificant and
        alone as a man possibly can be --

        CLOSER ON GABE

        Panting with exertion, frozen -- he can barely hold his grip
        and has an elbow crooked around the wire for support. Gabe's
        eyes are shut -- he looks near collapse --

        FLASHBACK - GABE'S POV

        Gabe is falling from the wire in slow motion, trailing
        Susan -- she spirals out of reach as his line SNAPS him
        back --

        GABE'S

        grip unconsciously relaxes -- but his eyes jolt open and he
        clamps both hands shut on the wire. Gabe, drawing on some
        inner fury, drags himself with long, sharp yanks --

        MAGGIE

        tensely watches Gabe's crossing --

        OVERVIEW - GABE

        is about ten feet away from the end --

        GABE'S UPSIDE-DOWN POV - THE END OF THE WIRE

        looks a lot further away than that --

        GABE

        pulls faster -- and reaches the other side. Gabe maintains his
        hand grip and swings his feet onto the ledge, leaning back
        against the wall to catch his breath.

                                        GABE
                            (winded, shouting across)
                      Think you can beat my time?

        MAGGIE

        smiles -- this is more like the Gabe she remembers. She gets
        on the wire and starts across in a fast, easy rhythm.

        GABE

        watches her, grinning. Admiration for Maggie is washing away
        bad memories of Susan.

                                        GABE
                            (to himself)
                      Shit -- she is in better shape.

        Maggie pulls across fearlessly -- but --

        INSERT - THE BOLT

        on Gabe's side of the wire is giving where Travers had
        hacked at it -- just a millimeter, but it's pulling loose --

        GABE

        doesn't notice and shouts across at Maggie, now half way.

                                        GABE
                            (enjoying it now)
                      Quit sandbagging it -- I haven't got
                      all day --

        INSERT - THE BOLT

        is coming looser -- Maggie's quicker crossing is thrashing the
        wire and straining the bolt's weakened anchoring --

        GABE - WATCHING MAGGIE

        who is now twenty feet away -- fifteen -- ten -- five --

        INSERT - THE BOLT

        pops out of the wall as if it were shot --

        THE WIRE

        which was tight as a bowstring fires out into the chasm --
        Maggie, stunned and without options, lets go two feet short
        of the ledge --

        GABE

        drops low just as Maggie starts to fall and swings his arm out
        towards hers in one lightning-fast motion --

        THEIR HANDS

        catch --

        GABE

        maintains his grip on Maggie's hand, but her weight nearly
        pulls him off the ledge -- Maggie drags him down, the window
        goes out of his chest when it collides with the ledge's
        bottom, but their grip holds.

        All of this in a split second. Maggie hangs from Gabe's arm,
        locked in terror -- but skill wins out over fear. She finds a
        handhold with her free arm, and climbs up to the ledge with
        Gabe's help. Maggie collapses into Gabe's arms and they fall
        back against the wall, but Gabe's the one who's really holding
        on tight.

                                        GABE
                      That -- tears it.
                            (gasping)
                      You're not coming any further.

                                        MAGGIE
                            (just as breathless)
                      Gabe -- you're going to get yourself
                      killed --

                                        GABE
                            (breath almost back)
                      Maybe. But I'm not getting you
                      killed.
                            (she starts a reply)
                      Look, Maggie. I don't know what'll
                      happen when I catch up with Hal -- but
                      I've got to know one thing for sure --
                      that you're making it off this
                      mountain. Alive.

        Gabe's eyes are pleading. Maggie hesitates. But gives in.

                                        MAGGIE
                      Okay.

        Gabe lightly kisses Maggie -- he doesn't want to turn this
        into a farewell kiss, afraid that that's really what it might
        be. They stand -- and separate. Gabe moves away.

                                        GABE
                      Get on the trail and stay out of
                      sight.
                            (beat)
                      I'll see you on the ground.

        Maggie wonders if she will as Gabe vanishes around a corner.

        EXT. TREASURY PLANE CRASH SITE - CLOSE ON BODY BAG

        as the zipper is pulled down -- before we can see anything we
        mercifully reverse POV to

        WRIGHT, DAVIS AND STUART

        near a helicopter, look down with disgust. Davis turns away.

                                        WRIGHT
                      I give up. What was it?

        A SEARCH PILOT zips the bag back up.

                                        SEARCH PILOT
                      ID says this used to be your pilot.
                            (beat)
                      And we found him seven miles east of
                      the wreck.

        Davis and Wright look at each other, drawing the same
        conclusion.

                                        WRIGHT
                      A hijack.
                            (beat)
                      The plane was hijacked. Son of a
                      bitch --

                                        STUART
                      Oh, give me a break. Your pilot lost
                      it when the flight started going
                      south, and he bailed --

                                        SEARCH PILOT
                      Excuse me -- but there's no parachute
                      there. Check it yourself.

        Before this can go on, a FORENSICS AGENT runs up to Stuart
        carrying a recorder.

                                        FORENSICS AGENT
                      Sir -- we found the flight recorder --
                      it was driven twenty feet deep into a
                      crater. It was demolished, but we
                      salvaged the recording --

                                        STUART
                            (grabbing it away)
                      I've heard a thousand of these, Wright
                      -- whoever was at the stick is going
                      to begin by screeching the Lord's
                      Prayer and wind up screaming "Oh,
                      shit" at ground zero --

        Stuart clicks the recorder on with a flourish, but his smug
        look melts as the voice of FBI agent Matheson explains --

                                        MATHESON (O.S.)
                            (shouting, rushed)
                      -- the money's been stolen -- Travers
                      and the pilot were in on it -- the
                      pilot's dead, but Travers took the
                      cash and made a mid-air transfer to a
                      jet flown by Qualen -- controls won't
                      respond --
                            (screaming)
                      shiiiiii--

        Matheson is cut off by the sound of impact, which is followed
        by silence. Wright gently turns the recorder off.

                                        WRIGHT
                      Guess we're both right, Stuart. Thanks
                      for your expertise.
                            (turns to pilot)
                      Well?
                            (jerking a thumb back)
                      You'll be waiting till Groundhog's Day
                      for him to pull his head out of his
                      ass -- let's get it in the air!

        Wright, Davis and the pilot scramble into a helicopter --
        Stuart pauses, but goes after them.

        EXT. MOUNTAIN WALL/TOWER - HIGH ANGLE - GABE MOVING ON A
        LEDGE

        that's a little narrower than your coffee table. It's got
        irregular breaks, causing it to go up or down several feet --
        and Gabe is jogging it, leaping across the ledge's gaps,
        leaning toward the wall -- and away from the four thousand
        foot drop.

        Gabe's gotten his second wind -- he keeps jumping from ledge
        to ledge with the ease that comes from skill and familiarity,
        and with renewed purpose. Gabe makes the last jump to a
        section of ledge near the bottom of

        THE "BITKER" LADDER

        which consists of metal rungs woven into loose steel cable
        bolted into the rock, running two hundred feet to the top --
        something left behind by a past expedition, now a tourist's
        toy. And the bottom rung is three feet above Gabe's
        outstretched arms.

                                        GABE
                      Hasn't gotten any lower in the last
                      year.
                            (coiling for jump)
                      Bitker, you cheap bastard. Would
                      another four feet have killed you?

        Gabe leaps up, grabbing the bottom rung instead of a half mile
        of air, and he shoots up the ladder as we PULL BACK --

        WIDER ANGLE ON MOUNTAIN WALL

        A closer look at terrain seen earlier -- fifty yards away from
        the ladder, a waterfall is spewing out of the wall, giving the
        appearance that the mountain has sprung a torrential leak.

        As we track Gabe up the ladder, we can see where the water's
        coming from -- a whirling lake on top of the mountain. Its
        constant motion keeps it from totally freezing, but the lake
        is still coated with a veneer of ice, moving in thick chunks
        through circular currents on the surface.

        ELSEWHERE ON MOUNTAIN SLOPE - HAL AND GANG

        are negotiating the grade, which is slippery, thanks to the
        fresh, thick snow -- we can see from their relative position
        to the lake that Gabe has a lead on them. A very slight one.

        TOP OF LADDER - GABE

        pulls himself over and starts running -- as he does, he
        uproots a big, 3' x 3' park service sign commemorating the
        "BITKER CLIMB" and takes it with him, moving ahead into a

        WOODED AREA

        where Gabe replants the sign near the top of another slope.
        Gabe heads down towards some rocks -- -- and spots the third
        case, which took a tough landing on one rock -- it's shattered
        into halves, and the bands of $5000s are scattered around in
        the snow.

        Gabe rushes down behind a rock and starts gathering the
        cash -- soaked by the snow, they've frozen into ice bricks. As
        Gabe stuffs them into his pack, he's startled by something
        coming over the rock -- Gabe whirls around to face

        A RABBIT

        that's landed in the snow and looks a lot more frightened than
        Gabe was. Gabe leans back, relieved. For now.

        EXT. FURTHER UP ON SLOPE - HAL AND GANG

        are closer now -- but as they move down, Hal freezes in place
        as he sees the "Bitker" sign some distance ahead. The sign is
        out of place. A signal from Gabe -- he is alive. And here.

        Qualen and the others check the monitor. Hal takes the
        opportunity to back up to a rock formation and swiftly, subtly
        wedge something into a crack behind his back --

        INSERT - THE OBJECT

        is what Hal lifted off Frank's body -- a speed load cylinder
        from a revolver, with six fresh bullets in it.

        QUALEN

        checks the monitor -- the relative position shows they're --

                                        QUALEN
                      Almost there.

        -- but Qualen's grin is wiped away as he looks down at --

        THE MONITOR

        -- the tracer blip is moving -- fast -- away from their
        position!

        QUALEN'S

        face shifts from incredulity to realization to rage.

        All eyes are on the monitor -- Hal, at the rock formation, has
        one hand behind his back.

        INSERT - HAL'S HAND

        shakes a box of matches from his sleeve -- he slides a single
        wooden match halfway out of the pack -- and ignites it with
        his thumbnail --

        HAL

        moves away from the rock, to draw their attention from what
        he's been doing --

                                        HAL
                      Oh, no -- you didn't lose another
                      one, did you?

        Delmer clicks off his safety and aims at Hal -- Qualen runs
        into the woods, guided by the monitor -- Kristel follows.
        Delmer backs Hal up at gunpoint. Hal deliberately moves in a
        semi-circle, putting Delmer's back to the rocks.

                                        DELMER
                      What about him?

                                        QUALEN
                            (over his shoulder)
                      Kill him! Now!

        Delmer grins as he aims at Hal.

                                        DELMER
                      Tell me -- where would you like the
                      first half dozen shots to go?

        INSERT - THE MATCH

        has burned more than halfway down to the rest of the box,
        which is behind the speed load cylinder --

        HAL AND DELMER

                                        HAL
                            (hands up)
                      As long as you're taking requests --
                      how about -- the base of your spine?

        Delmer smiles and starts to squeeze the trigger -- Hal tenses
        up, it's now or never --

        INSERT - THE MATCH

        burns down to the box, igniting all the matches --

        ON DELMER

        as there is the sudden sound of six distinct, consecutive
        gunshots behind him -- the fire's blasted the powder in all
        the bullets. Delmer, startled, spins around and FIRES up,
        FIRES down, FIRES across -- by the time he realizes no one's
        there and he turns back around to find --

        -- Hal is gone, vanished into the woods.

        FOLLOWING QUALEN

        through the woods -- up a slope, around a tree, down another
        slope -- his eyes fixed on the screen and the blip that's
        zig-zagging just ahead of him.

                                        QUALEN
                            (tagging headset radio)
                      Travers. Get down here. Now.

        TRAVERS

        is trying to repair the helicopter door when the call comes.

                                        TRAVERS
                      Have you found the money?

                                        QUALEN (O.S.)
                      No. Walker has.

        Travers, furious, flings the door aside, jumps into the copter
        and starts the rotor.

        QUALEN

        is running alone, following the monitor lead -- until he sees
        a band of $5000s in the snow. Sure he's on the right track,
        Qualen picks it up and picks up his pace too. But we can see
        that behind him and higher up --

        GABE

        who is on a rise behind a rock, watches Qualen's futile
        pursuit from a distance, amused. Amused, until --

                                        KRISTEL
                      You would have lived longer, if you
                      weren't such a smartass.

        Gabe spins his head around -- and his temple smacks into
        Kristel's gun barrel.

                                        KRISTEL
                      You telegraphed this kind of stunt
                      with that joke snowman. Too bad for
                      you we're not all gullible.

        Kristel starts to squeeze the trigger.

                                        GABE
                      Good thing for Qualen you are.

                                        KRISTEL
                            (pauses, wary)
                      What do you mean?

                                        GABE
                      When he comes back, he's going to
                      shoot you and the other guy, grab the
                      money, and take off with Travers.

                                        KRISTEL
                            (squeezing trigger again)
                      No sale. Say "night-night" --

                                        GABE
                            (talking fast)
                      He already blew up one of your pals in
                      that crevice. And I've been in that
                      copter. It goes a hell of a lot
                      farther with two people than with
                      four.
                            (beat)
                      Am I wrong? Give him a buzz.

        Kristel eases back with the gun.

                                        KRISTEL
                      You've got my attention.

                                        GABE
                      You've also got all the money. And I
                      can show you how to get off the
                      mountain with it. Right now.

        ELSEWHERE ON MOUNTAIN - HAL

        tears into a clearing, trying to put some distance between him
        and Delmer -- as soon as he's out in the open, though,

        THE HELICOPTER

        thunders over Hal -- Travers FIRES down at Hal through the
        doorless pilot's side. Bullets kick up tufts of snow at Hal's
        heels as he runs down into a steep, sloping wooded area. The
        tree cover is too thick for Travers to take good aim. Looks
        like temporary refuge -- but

        INSIDE THE HELICOPTER

        Travers finds a new use for the search copter's heat
        scope -- using the blip that betrays Hal's body heat as a
        guide, Travers can still fire down through the trees at

        HAL

        who's still running down the grade -- he hasn't been hit yet,
        but there's an awful lot of bad luck in the air --

        TRAVERS

        banks the helicopter around and up for another pass.

        EXT. ANOTHER PART OF THE MOUNTAIN/TOWER WOODS - QUALEN

        is slogging uphill after his own tracer blip -- which is
        turning back around and heading towards him. Qualen aims his
        gun and waits, but at the top of the hill --

        THE RABBIT

        that spooked Gabe earlier sticks its head up for a curious
        sniff. It has the tracer fastened to its neck with a currency
        band. Furious, Qualen FIRES at the rabbit -- it safely speeds
        away as Qualen smashes the useless tracer monitor and turns
        around.

        EXT. TRAVERS IN HELICOPTER - TRAVERS POV

        On the heat scope. The blip that represents Hal -- vanishes.
        Delmer, who has caught up, is at the edge of the tree-lined
        area -- he looks up at Travers.

                                        TRAVERS
                            (keying headset radio)
                      He's hiding twenty yards in -- be
                      careful.

        EXT. WOODS - DELMER

        "replies", beeping twice on the headset's ear button as he
        moves downhill into the woods, closely following Hal's
        tracks -- they lead up to the replanted "BITKER" sign. Just
        big enough to hide behind. Delmer smiles, and advances toward
        the sign --

        -- and looks behind it. Nothing but a mound of snow. Delmer
        looks again to the tracks, which lead toward

        A SMALL ROCK FORMATION

        also big enough to conceal Hal. Delmer moves toward it as --

        BEHIND THE "BITKER" SIGN

        the mound of snow shifts as Hal climbs out, silently shaking
        off the cover -- the snow hid him not only from Delmer, but
        from the heat scope as well --

        TRAVERS IN HELICOPTER

        hovers overhead, watching Delmer's blip on the heat scope --
        but Hal's blip returns, rushing ahead --

                                        TRAVERS
                            (keying headset radio)
                      He's right behind you!

        DELMER

        whirls around at the warning, his gun BLAZING, but Hal is too
        fast -- he swings the sign like a club, knocking Delmer's gun
        away into the snow. Before Hal can swing again, Delmer
        brutally punches Hal in the face -- stunned, Hal drops the
        sign --

        IN HELICOPTER - TRAVERS POV

        Travers can't do anything now but watch the heat scope as if
        it were a video game -- now it's just one big blip --

        DELMER AND HAL

        thrash around in the snow, pummelling each other -- Hal's
        getting the worst of it, as Delmer manages to get on top of
        him and deliver a series of punishing blows to his face. Ready
        to end it, Delmer tries to get the bolt gun off a clip on his
        front pack strap -- but he has trouble unfastening it. Hal
        rallies with a solid punch to Delmer's face. Hal gets Delmer
        off of him and follows with two more.

        Delmer is knocked away, landing on the sign board -- but clear
        from Hal -- another chance to get the bolt gun off --

        Hal quickly moves to the sign and grabs its post -- before
        Delmer can move off the sign's board, Hal's running forward.
        shoving the sign ahead of him with Delmer on top -- Hal lets
        go, and the sign, with Delmer, sleds downhill on the hard
        packed snow --

        TRAVERS IN HELICOPTER - TRAVERS

        can now see one blip moving quickly away from the other --

                                        TRAVERS
                            (into radio)
                      Something's moving fast down the
                      hill -- is it Tucker?

        HAL

        has found Delmer's fallen headset radio and put it on.

                                        TRAVERS (O.S.)
                            (over radio)
                      Answer me! Is it Tucker?

        Hal smiles and beeps twice -- affirmative.

        IN HELICOPTER

        Happy at last, Travers takes off after the blip, flying down
        the incline and staying just above the trees, strafing an
        intense fusillade at

        DELMER

        who's screaming as a storm of bullets rip through him and the
        sign and the surrounding snow, keeping pace with his downhill
        slide --

        TRAVERS IN HELICOPTER

        FIRES until his clip is empty -- he heads for the end of the
        tree line as his target comes out, skidding to a stop in the
        snow. Travers gleefully moves lower down for a closer look
        but is shocked to see

        DELMER - ON "SLED"

        Delmer's highly perforated body rolls off the sign as it
        finally skids to a dead halt.

        CLOSE ON TRAVERS

        who is apoplectic -- he's just shot one of his own men.

                                        HAL (O.S.)
                            (over radio)
                      Thanks loads.
                            (beat)
                      I couldn't have killed him without
                      you.

        Travers looks down at the heat scope -- blank.

        HAL

        is hiding his body "heat" under a rock formation.

        IN HELICOPTER

        Stymied, Travers furiously banks it away from the wooded area
        and circles around the mountain's other side.

        EXT. MOUNTAIN - SLOPING GRADE - GABE AND KRISTEL

        Gabe, hands on his head, moves down a slope near a mountain
        edge, ahead of Kristel, who's aiming her gun at his back.

                                        KRISTEL
                      How much further?

                                        GABE
                            (stops)
                      It's right over there.

        Gabe nods ahead, indicating what looks like a

        A SHED

        that is partially obscured by snow, about twenty feet distant
        across a snowy plateau.

        GABE AND KRISTEL

                                        GABE
                      It's a storage locker for the rangers.
                      Everything you need to get off the
                      mountain is in there -- skiis, food --
                      I'll show you --

        Gabe shows a sudden burst of enthusiasm and starts quickly
        moving ahead again -- Kristel suspiciously notices this --

                                        KRISTEL
                      Don't move.

        Kristel gets ahead of Gabe and walks backward, keeping her gun
        trained on him as she crunches through the snow.

                                        KRISTEL
                      Skiis, food -- and maybe guns too,
                      right?
                            (moves backward)
                      Keep walking. Not too close.

                                        GABE
                      We'd make better time walking straight
                      ahead. Qualen's not going to be
                      hopping down the bunny trail too much
                      longer.

                                        KRISTEL
                            (walking backward)
                      Right. So I'd better have one less
                      problem when he arrives.

                                        GABE
                            (knowing this means him)
                      Don't fuck up. You still need me to
                      show you a route off the mountain.

                                        KRISTEL
                      You've worn that one out, Walker --
                            (snaps back bolt)
                      -- I'll find my own way down.

        Kristel solidly plants her feet firmly to shoot Gabe, but her
        feet sink through the crystallized snow cover -- --
        Kristel completely disappears down through the snow as it
        collapses under her -- she's pulling the trigger and SHOTS
        go wild as she sinks and sinks --

        ON GABE

        who's had to drop flat on his stomach to avoid the same
        fate -- as he scrambles back to solid land, Kristel's SHOTS
        arc up through the snow toward him, and the snow crumbles
        around him -- but he bellies ahead as --

        ON THE SNOWDRIFT'S TOP

        Kristel's GUNSHOTS slow, and finally, stop, the very last of
        them loosening the snow around --

        THE "SHED"

        that was obscured by snow was a tall, three-sided park service
        sign shouting "WARNING -- SNOWDRIFT -- DO NOT CROSS" in eight
        different languages. The rest of the snow falls away from it,
        revealing a cautionary but cheesy illustration -- a
        stick-figure fatally sinking into the snow.

        GABE

        bellies ahead, flat on his stomach, testing the snow with the
        ice axe's staff -- only when he hits something solid with it
        does he get back up to his feet. But the sound of ice-crusted
        snow CRUNCHING above Gabe alerts him that --

        QUALEN

        has just hit the top of the slope and spotted him -- Qualen's
        gun BLAZES down --

        GABE

        is on the run, but it's that lead-footed, slow motion stuff
        that only happens in nightmares -- with every step, a foot
        breaks through the icy crust and sinks into two feet of
        snow -- Gabe stays just ahead of the barrage, making it into

        A THICK WOODED AREA

        which is very temporary refuge -- Qualen will be down in
        seconds. Gabe looks down the slope. Running is impractical. So
        he sits down.

        QUALEN

        arrives where Gabe was and looks down the slope --

        QUALEN'S POV - GABE

        is whizzing down the slope in a sitting position, using his
        back and his shoes as gliders, the ice axe as a rudder.
        Alpinists call this a "sitting glissade". Colorado climbers
        call it "butt skiing". Some psychos do this for fun.

        GABE'S POV - THE SLIDE

        is anything but fun -- Gabe can't control his speed or
        direction well at all -- Gabe barely manages to steer in and
        out of trees and boulders in his path --

        QUALEN

        starts running down the slope -- he doesn't have speed, but he
        does have the machine gun -- he FIRES short bursts at --

        GABE

        who tries to steer away from the line of fire -- Gabe is hit
        in the shoulder -- he slides out of control, and rolls down --

        -- to the slope's bottom. Gabe painfully lifts himself up and
        moves through the woods, coming out of the trees to

        THE LAKE

        The bridge that spans it is ahead of Gabe -- but there is
        nothing around but flat terrain. It's a beautiful sight, but
        no good for hiding. And Qualen is right behind him.

        EXT. MOUNTAIN SLOPE - HAL

        rushes down to Delmer's body -- in the snow, he finds the
        discarded machine gun and holds it up, but stray bullets from
        Travers' fusillade have made it inoperable. Hal tosses it
        aside and checks Delmer's bloody pockets for more weapons.
        Nothing. Just a couple of machine gun clips, and the bolt gun.

        EXT. MOUNTAIN TRAIL - MAGGIE

        is wending her way down a hiking trail on the opposite side of
        the mountain. In plain view,

        TRAVERS IN HELICOPTER

        is circling the mountain -- he spots Maggie from on high and
        moves down after her.

        MAGGIE

        hears the helicopter, and turns around -- she has no way of
        knowing it isn't Frank, so she takes off her jacket and waves
        it as a signal --

                                        MAGGIE
                      Frank! Down here!

        The helicopter moves down until Maggie can see --

        TRAVERS

        is at the controls.

        MAGGIE

        starts running, but it's useless. Nowhere to hide. Travers
        hovers over her, FIRING ahead of her, FIRING behind her, not
        to kill, just to make a point. He's in charge.

        EXT. MOUNTAIN TRAIL

        Maggie finally stops -- Travers lands the copter and opens the
        passenger door, keeping his gun trained on her.

                                        TRAVERS
                      Hop in. I know someone who'd like to
                      see you again before he dies.

        EXT. BOTTOM OF THE SLOPE - QUALEN

        moves down to the slope's edge, noting with pleasure the blood
        in the snow. Gabe is wounded, and he's left a trail as a
        bonus.

        Qualen moves out lakeside -- nothing visible but the thick,
        flat ice chunks circling in the currents. But Gabe's
        footprints and blood lead straight ahead to the bridge.

        Qualen starts to run across the bridge, but stares down --

        QUALEN'S POV - THE BRIDGE'S PLANKS

        The blood -- and slush from Gabe's boots -- end halfway
        across.

        QUALEN

        Smiles and shakes his head. Too obvious. Gabe is hiding
        underneath the bridge, in the three foot deep network of steel
        supports. Qualen slows his pace, staring down through the
        thin, but visible cracks between the planks.

        TIGHT CLOSE-UP - GABE'S FACE

        grimacing, shivering, ashen from his wound and exertion --
        lined shadows on his face confirm he is under the bridge.

                                        QUALEN (O.S.)
                      You've come a long way to die.

        QUALEN

        enjoying himself, slams a fresh clip into his machine gun.

                                        QUALEN
                      If you were smart, you'd have left
                      your friend behind. I would have.
                      There's no shame in staying alive.

        Qualen stops, staring down. Through the gaps, Gabe's parka is
        visible. Right where the blood trail ends.

                                        QUALEN
                            (aims down)
                      But you're not smart. And now you're
                      going to die from an overdose of
                      heroism.

        Qualen BLAZES the gun into the planks --

        UNDER THE BRIDGE - GABE

        is clinging to the steel supports of the small bridge,
        several feet ahead of where his empty parka is being
        shredded by the FUSILLADE -- without the parka, Gabe is
        freezing, and too many bullets are coming too close for
        comfort as they RICOCHET on the bridge's supports --

        QUALEN

        stops firing and kicks away the planks, which are a tangle of
        toothpicks at this point -- Qualen bends down --

        -- and sees there's nothing in the parka except for Gabe's
        back. Qualen's face registers anger and surprise as -- -- Gabe
        appears at the edge of the hole -- before Qualen can react,
        Gabe swings up with his ice axe, hooking it around the
        shoulder strap of Qualen's machine gun -- Gabe yanks down,
        and Qualen falls head first

        UNDER THE BRIDGE

        with Gabe -- Qualen catches himself by hooking an arm and a
        leg on one of the steel supports -- but both

        THE ICE AXE AND THE GUN

        fall, landing on separate chunks of ice floating underneath
        the bridge --

        IN THE SUPPORTS

        Gabe pulls himself through the girders to Qualen and punches
        him with his good arm, but Qualen is unfazed -- neither are in
        good position, it's like a fistfight on a jungle gym -- --
        Qualen steadies himself to savagely punch Gabe in his
        shoulder wound -- Gabe YELLS in pain and tries to block the
        next one, but Qualen punches him again, and Gabe lets go of
        the support, falling -- -- on the way down, Gabe grabs
        Qualen's leg with his good hand -- too low to grab the bridge,
        Gabe dangles just over the water, raising his legs above it as
        Qualen tries to kick him off -- -- Gabe holds onto Qualen's
        leg, and swings on it like a pendulum -- Gabe twists the leg
        -- Qualen loses his grip on the icy steel and lets go --
        both

        QUALEN AND GABE

        fall -- they land hard, not in the water, but on a
        raft-sized chunk of ice driven under the bridge by the
        current. Their weight teeter-totters the ice as they get up --
        they're in danger not just from each other, but from

        THE FAST APPROACHING WHIRLPOOL

        where the ice chunks are drawn into the fiercely swirling
        vortex that drains into the waterfall --

        ON THE ICE RAFT

        Qualen and Gabe circle each other like cautious boxers, as the
        ice itself swirls in the current -- if either makes the wrong
        move, they'll both go over. Gabe swings at Qualen, but Qualen
        throws a leg under Gabe and stiff-arms him down -- Gabe hits
        the ice hard, his chest hanging over the side -- Qualen moves
        in to shove him off -- but their combined weight on the same
        side of the ice starts to tip it over -- Gabe viciously
        kicks Qualen back, gashing his face with his boot's crampon as
        Qualen grabs the ice raft's opposite side, levelling it.

                                        QUALEN
                            (wiping the gash)
                      Stalemate, isn't it?

                                        GABE
                            (winded)
                      Not any more.

        Gabe, still prone, reaches out -- the chunk of ice with
        Qualen's machine gun is floating by. Gabe snatches up the gun
        and pulls the trigger. Nothing but an empty CLICK.

                                        QUALEN
                      Far more intimidating when it's
                      loaded.

        The chunk of ice with Gabe's ice axe floats by Gabe -- Gabe
        grabs for it, but misses -- as the ice raft spins around,
        Qualen manages to snatch it up -- Qualen scythes it down at
        Gabe, slamming the blade into the ice as Gabe rolls away --

        WIDER VIEW - THE ICE RAFT

        is nearing the center of the whirlpool -- the current is
        faster and stronger here -- if it doesn't swallow the ice
        raft, it will definitely upend it --

        QUALEN AND GABE

        stay on opposite sides of the ice raft for balance -- Qualen
        swings out at Gabe with the axe. Gabe ducks and tries to go
        low to hit Qualen with the gun, but Qualen swings the axe down
        again, whizzing right past Gabe as it sinks into --

        THE CENTER OF THE ICE RAFT

        -- a crack spiderwebs through the ice around the blade --

        GABE

        quickly reacts, jumping onto another bed-sized chunk of ice
        floating by, landing on his stomach and braking himself by
        digging his crampons in -- just as --

        QUALEN

        realizing what deep shit he's in, looks for another chunk of
        ice to make the same move -- to sees one just out of reach.
        Qualen pulls the ice axe out of the raft's center to drag the
        other chunk closer in -- -- as he does, the entire raft
        disintegrates under him -- Qualen plunges into the water, and
        tries to maintain a slippery grip on what ice is left --

        -- but now at the center of the whirlpool, Qualen is drawn
        into the vortex --

        GABE

        struggles to his feet and looks down, wincing --

        GABE'S POV - QUALEN GOING DOWN

        Qualen's inaudible scream is just a burst of rising bubbles as
        he shoots down to the bottom of the lake -- and beyond --

        QUALEN'S POV - UNDERWATER

        Qualen is shoved with incredible force and speed through the
        lake's tunnel drain --

        ON THE MOUNTAIN WALL - THE WATERFALL

        BLASTS OUT full force, hurling a still thrashing Qualen a
        half a mile to the ground below!

        GABE

        has no time to celebrate -- the chunk of ice he's on leaves
        him moments from the same fate. One more time around, and
        it's down the drain. Gabe takes a deep breath. No choice. He
        leaps --

        WIDER VIEW - THE ICE - GABE LEAPING

        -- from one chunk of ice to the other, running the way you
        would across stones in a stream, zig-zagging to catch the ones
        big enough to support him -- only his crampons keep him from
        sliding off, only his momentum keeps him from capsizing the
        ice chunks, which shoots away from him in his wake --

        GABE

        lands on an ice raft floating towards the bridge. No choice --
        Gabe lunges off the ice raft and reaches for one of the bridge
        supports -- his hand catches -- but it's slippery and he's
        weakened -- Gabe slides off, but --

        A HAND

        reaches down and grabs him --

        HAL

        pulls Gabe the rest of the way onto the bridge. Gabe's
        surprise gives way to a grin almost as big as Hal's.

                                        HAL
                            (eyeing Gabe's ruined
                             shirt)
                      Nice outfit.
                            (hands him his parka)
                      I know you never liked the orange, but
                      --

                                        GABE
                      Didn't care for the Smokey The Bear
                      hats, either. That's why I quit.
                            (pulls on parka)
                      You all right?

                                        HAL
                      I feel better than you look. I can
                      live with that.

        Gabe looks down at the parka -- it's completely full of
        bullet holes.

                                        GABE
                      Hardly seems worth zipping, huh?
                            (serious now)
                      Frank?

        Hal sobers -- shakes his head no. A cloud passes over Gabe's
        face.

                                        HAL
                      It's not over, Gabe. Travers took the
                      helicopter.

        INSIDE HELICOPTER - FLYING ELSEWHERE OVER MOUNTAIN

        Maggie's hands are cuffed to a bar on the helicopter's roof.
        Travers keys his headset radio while piloting the copter.

                                        TRAVERS
                            (into radio)
                      Qualen -- Kristel -- come in --

        HAL AND GABE ON BRIDGE

        Gabe hears Hal's borrowed headset radio crackling -- he holds
        his hand out to Hal.

                                        GABE
                      May I?
                            (dons it, keys it)
                      They can't talk right now, Travers.
                      Kristel's busy making snow angels --
                      and I'm not sure, but I think Qualen
                      is still falling.
                            (radio silence)
                      Any messages?

        A moment's silence -- then --

                                        MAGGIE (O.S.)
                            (over radio)
                      Gabe?

                                        GABE
                            (keying it)
                      Maggie --

        INSIDE COPTER - TRAVERS

        yanks the radio off Maggie and puts it back on --

                                        TRAVERS
                            (into radio)
                      You wanted to make a trade earlier,
                      Walker -- still interested?

                                        GABE (O.S.)
                            (pause)
                      I've got the money. Fly to the lake.
                      And if you touch her --

        Travers cuts off the radio, smiles, and banks the helicopter
        down around the mountain wall.

        GABE AND HAL ON BRIDGE

                                        HAL
                      Now what?

                                        GABE
                      I have no fucking idea.
                            (holds Qualen's gun)
                      Empty.

                                        HAL
                            (smiling)
                      Not for long.

        Hal fishes into his pockets and pulls out one of the ammo
        clips he took from Delmer, Gabe tries to force it into the
        gun's stock -- but it's the wrong size.

                                        GABE
                            (sagging against rail)
                      Why can't anything be easy?

        THE HELICOPTER

        thunders around the mountain wall, getting closer --

        HAL AND GABE

        have crossed the bridge, near the mountain edge -- Gabe, now
        wearing his pack again, nods over to the wooded area.

                                        GABE
                      Stay over there --

                                        HAL
                      Look -- let me --

                                        GABE
                      -- what, throw snowballs at him?
                      Just -- whatever happens -- get Maggie
                      out of here.

                                        HAL
                            (relenting)
                      Count on it.
                            (beat)
                      And Gabe? Thanks for tagging along.

                                        GABE
                            (smiles)
                      Thanks for asking. I forgot how much I
                      enjoyed rescue work.

        Gabe limps toward the mountain's edge as Hal runs into the
        woods.

        THE HELICOPTER

        blasts along the wall towards the lake -- the waterfall and
        the ladder are just ahead. The copter radio crackles --

                                        WRIGHT (O.S.)
                            (from radio)
                      Come in, Rocky Mountain Rescue --
                      urgent -- come in --

        Travers recognizes the voice -- frowning, he snaps off the
        radio and banks the helicopter up over the top --

        TRAVERS IN HELICOPTER - TRAVERS POV

        tops the precipice, revealing Gabe, standing on the end of a
        narrow spur -- it just out from the edge like a diving board.
        Gabe has his pack on one arm -- the money is visible. Gabe
        levels Qualen's emptied gun on Travers and the copter -- this
        bluff is all he has left.

                                        GABE
                            (over radio)
                      Remember that bet you made? About
                      whether I could find the money for you
                      or not?
                            (holds pack over drop)
                      You won.

        Travers helplessly flies in low, tight circles over Gabe and
        the spur -- if he shoots Gabe, the money falls too, Travers
        presses his gun at Maggie.

                                        TRAVERS
                            (into radio)
                      I'll kill her --

                                        GABE
                            (over radio)
                      You do, and the spring thaw's going to
                      be worth thirty million bucks.
                            (pause)
                      No rush. I'm sure you've got lots of
                      time.

                                        TRAVERS
                            (into radio)
                      All right. Drop the gun first.

                                        GABE
                            (into radio)
                      When she's safe on the ground.

        EXT. SPUR/COPTER

        Travers has no choice but to give in -- he gives Maggie the
        handcuff key, and she frees herself as he flies away from the
        spur, touching the copter down on the mountain top.

                                        TRAVERS
                            (to Maggie)
                      Get out.

        Maggie moves out the door and stares uncertainly at Gabe.

                                        GABE
                            (shouting)
                      Run!
                            (she doesn't)
                      Run!

        Maggie runs for the trees. When Gabe is sure she's safe, he
        throws the gun away -- but keeps the pack suspended over the
        edge.

                                        GABE
                            (into radio)
                      Now come and get it. My arm's getting
                      tired.

        EXT. HELICOPTER

        Travers flies the copter up and over, until he and it are five
        feet away from Gabe's position on the spur. Gabe is buffeted
        by the copter's wind, but stands firm. Travers levels his gun
        at Gabe through the open passenger door as Gabe heaves the
        pack in. Travers doesn't even look down -- he just stares at
        Gabe with hate as he prepares to shoot.

                                        GABE
                            (shouting)
                      Don't you want to count it?

        Puzzled, Travers takes his gun hand and rips open

        THE PACK

        The $5000s are there -- but they've been shredded by
        Qualen's earlier blast of gunfire. Few, if any, of the bills
        are passable.

        TRAVERS

        stares down, incredulous -- as he does --

        GABE

        rips open a perforated section of parka and yanks his bolt
        gun from his waist --

        Travers looks up and raises his gun at Gabe -- but Gabe fires
        first -- the bolt imbeds itself high in Travers' chest.
        Gasping, Travers drops his gun -- it falls over the pack and
        out the open door -- Travers clutches at his chest --

                                        GABE
                      Don't spend it all in one place, you
                      son of a bitch.

        Travers falls back in his seat and loses control of the
        helicopter -- it spins around, and Gabe has to instantly
        flatten to avoid the tail when it swings at him -- Gabe looks
        down as --

        THE HELICOPTER

        quickly begins to spiral down in wide, aimless circles --
        Travers has clearly lost control --

        GABE

        stares down coldly, waiting for the crash -- but --

        INSIDE THE COPTER - TRAVERS

        won't give up -- sweating, bleeding, he sits forward and
        grabs the stick, seizing control of the helicopter again --

        GABE'S POV - THE HELICOPTER

        stops its uncontrolled descent and begins to rise up and
        up -- with clear purpose --

        CLOSE ON GABE

        eyes widening with realization. Gabe gets up from the spur and
        starts running back towards the woods -- several hundred yards
        from safety -- before he can get very far --

        THE HELICOPTER

        tops the precipice edge and, sweeping low over the snow, it
        gets between Gabe and the trees, cutting him off --

        WOODED AREA - HAL AND MAGGIE

        watch, powerless --

                                        HAL
                      He's going to run Gabe down --

        TRAVERS IN HELICOPTER

        Ashen, hyperventilating, he's running on pure adrenalin and
        fury as he drives the stick forward --

        TRAVERS POV - GABE

        is stiff-legging it toward the edge of the mountain -- but
        he's too banged up to run fast through the thick snow --

        THE HELICOPTER

        with its skids skipping just over the snow overtakes --

        GABE

        as he throws himself flat into the snow -- the front of the
        skid misses Gabe by inches as it blasts over him --

        THE HELICOPTER

        moves out over the precipice edge -- Travers banks it wide to
        circle back around for another run --

        GABE

        gets back up as the helicopter swings back behind him --

        IN A WOODED AREA

        Hal rips the lining out of one of his pockets and stuffs it
        into one of the ammo clips -- Maggie stays back as he runs for
        all he's worth out into the clearing --

        THE HELICOPTER

        has circled back around, stopping at a hover far back in the
        clearing -- Travers intends to not just run Gabe over, but to
        run him off the edge as well --

        GABE

        lumbers as fast as he can towards the edge --

        TRAVERS

        knows he has Gabe nailed -- he shoves the stick forward --

        THE HELICOPTER

        flies forward, skids just inches over the snow --

        HAL

        runs out to where Travers is heading -- he lights the cloth
        in the ammo clip -- as

        THE HELICOPTER

        flies past

        IN THE CLEARING

        Hal hurls the clip, with its cloth "fuse" burning down, into
        the doorless side of the copter --

        INSIDE THE HELICOPTER

        -- the makeshift bomb bounces to the floor of the cockpit --
        Travers sees it and looks down, but --

        THE "FUSE"

        sputters out -- nothing but glowing embers in the cloth --

        TRAVERS

        smiles -- nothing to worry about -- he speeds ahead --

        CLOSE ON THE HELICOPTER'S SKIDS

        as they slice through the top of the snow towards --

        GABE

        as he runs toward the mountain's edge -- it's just a couple of
        feet ahead, but the copter is a couple of feet behind --

        -- as the copter overtakes Gabe, dipping even lower into the
        snow, he dives off the edge --

        FOLLOWING GABE - FALLING

        Gabe is at the ladder -- he falls the first twenty feet of the
        long drop, then grabs a rung on the cable ladder, very
        painfully stopping his fall -- but in the same split second --

        THE HELICOPTER

        skid meant to impale Gabe catches the top two rungs of the
        cable ladder --

        WIDE SHOT - THE HELICOPTER

        -- caught in the rungs of the cable ladder, the helicopter
        keeps flying out over the abyss, but as it pulls the cable
        ladder, it pops out the bolts that hold the ladder in place,
        rung by rung -- -- still going full tilt, the copter strains
        against the ladder -- thirty feet of it tethers the copter
        to the wall -- -- and Gabe is dangling from the center of
        it.

        ON THE LADDER - GABE

        has one arm hooked around a rung, hanging on for his life as
        the copter thrashes the ladder up and down --

        INSIDE THE COPTER

        Travers is disoriented by the jolt, and tries to maintain
        control -- he doesn't see --

        -- that the cloth fuse on the ammo clip has reignited -- it
        burns down to the clip, and fifty rounds explode like a
        string of firecrackers --

        -- Travers tries to shield himself as he is struck by airborne
        lead. Shrapnel blasts into the instrument panel --

        THE HELICOPTER

        still strains against the cable ladder but the engine goes
        dead -- the rotor blades slow --

        GABE ON LADDER

        Gabe stares in horror at the stalling rotor -- if it were
        possible for him to grip the ladder tighter, he'd do it now --

        ON THE HELICOPTER

        -- as the rotor WHOPS to a dead halt the copter arcs down
        and slams against the mountain wall -- the skids are still
        caught in the ladder, and it holds --

        GABE

        is shaken off by the massive impact -- he falls -- --
        landing on the helicopter, half in and half out of the
        cockpit! As Gabe scrambles for a solid hold --

        INT. HELICOPTER

        -- Travers, who has been shaken to the opposite side of the
        copter, reaches into his jacket and pulls out the pistol he
        took from Frank -- he aims at Gabe --

        INSERT - THE HELICOPTER SKID

        One of the two rungs holding the copter up bursts --

        THE HELICOPTER

        slips, now hanging from just a single rung -- -- and the
        impact of the slip makes Travers drop the gun -- it falls out
        the open passenger door. Travers scrambles up through the
        cabin to go after -- -- Gabe, who is trying to get off the
        helicopter and onto a solid part of the ladder before the
        whole thing goes down --           Gabe jumps for the wall as
        Travers scrambles behind him and --

        CLOSE ON THE HELICOPTER SKID

        -- as the last rung supporting the copter snaps in two --

        GABE

        grabs hold of the ladder as

        THE HELICOPTER

        plummets down -- but as it starts its fall --

        TRAVERS

        leaps from the falling copter and grabs Gabe's leg -- Gabe
        struggles to support both of them, but Travers, weakened from
        his wound, loses his grip on Gabe's leg -- he stares up in
        terror at Gabe as he clutches Gabe's snow-slick boot --

                                        GABE
                      Cheer up. It's a beautiful spot to
                      die.

        Travers slides off and away --

        THE FALL - LONG SHOT

        Travers SCREAMING as he free falls, trailing behind the
        helicopter -- we follow the entire four thousand foot drop --

        -- until the helicopter explodes when it hits the ground far
        below, and the fireball engulfs Travers just before he
        impacts into the explosion!

        GABE

        looks down at the burning wreck and clings to the ladder,
        closing his eyes for a moment in exhaustion. But the WHOPPING
        of another helicopter makes him look up --

        THE TREASURY HELICOPTER

        has shown up, a little too late to be of any help.

        INSIDE THE TREASURY COPTER

        Wright, Davis and Stuart look at the billowing flames of the
        wreck -- even from here, the burning money is visible,
        drifting up in the smoke. Wright turns to Stuart.

                                        WRIGHT
                      I'm no expert -- but what do you make
                      of that "event"?

        GABE

        is drained -- from somewhere, he finds the strength to lift
        his head up --

        GABE'S POV - THE WALL

        The section of ladder above him, of course, is gone -- he has
        to cover the fifty feet of wall above him by free climbing.
        There are holds that look easy enough for him, but --

        GABE

        leans back, gripping the ladder, too tired to move. Just the
        thought of one more climb drains him.

                                        GABE
                            (mumbling)
                      Forget it. No fucking way. I'm staying
                      right here. I've spent the night on
                      walls before -- some of the best
                      nights of my life have been spent
                      lashed to walls --

        Before Gabe can take this any farther -- a loop tied to the
        end of a rope falls to a stop next to him. Gabe looks up --

        ON THE EDGE - HAL

        has thrown the line down. Maggie is by his side.

                                        HAL
                      Remember -- keep your arms and legs in
                      the vehicle at all times --

        GABE

        puts the loop around himself and tightens it by rote -- even
        this action aches.

                                        GABE
                            (too tired to shout)
                      Fuck you --

        Hal and Maggie draw Gabe up -- Gabe pulls some of his weight
        by using hand and foot holds, but when he reaches

        THE PRECIPICE EDGE

        Hal and Maggie are both winded from the effort as they haul
        Gabe onto the top. Gabe unties himself, and collapses into
        Maggie's lap.

                                        HAL
                            (winded, coiling the
                             rope)
                      Jesus Christ -- you think you could
                      have put a little less effort into
                      that climb? I mean, what have you done
                      for me -- lately?

        Hal ends his harrangue and looks over -- Gabe has apparently
        revived, because he and Maggie are locked in the kiss of their
        lives. Hal stands, and smiles -- he walks toward the Treasury
        agents, who are scrambling out of the helicopter. Hal starts
        an explanation that's going to take a long, long time as --

        GABE AND MAGGIE

        break off their kiss.

                                        MAGGIE
                      Does this mean you're staying?

        Off Gabe's answering smile, we --

                                                            FADE OUT.
