               INT. DARKROOM - INTERVIEW 1

               In a photographic DARKROOM: old optical enlargers, porcelain 
               trays, timers, and stills hanging out to dry.

               GEORGE MATLIN, a slightly obese, nearsighted man in his 
               seventies.

                                     OLD MATLIN
                         Is he real? Oh yeah -- Absolutely.

               Super: CPL. GEORGE MATLIN, combat photographer.

                                     OLD MATLIN
                         I haven't talked about it for years, 
                         you know?
                              (looks at the camera)
                         Everyone called me crazy...

               Matlin smiles as he paws through a box of old negatives.

                                     OLD MATLIN
                         But I have the negative.

               Someone turns on the darkroom's red safety light for an eerie, 
               dramatic effect.

                                     TECHNICIAN'S VOICE
                         Get ready, 3-2-1... Roll tape.

                                     OLD MATLIN
                         It all started back in ´44. I was a 
                         Corps photographer aboard an allied 
                         submarine...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. SUBMARINE HALLWAY - NIGHT

               YOUNG MATLIN's hands again paw through a bunch of negatives, 
               again under a red light. Now, at 21, he's wedged in a 
               submarine corridor, a crowded maze of pipes and gauges.

               35mm still cameras dangle from his neck. He shrinks back as 
               a squad of MARINES hustles past him, loading weapons.

                                     OLD MATLIN'S VOICE
                         ...off the coast of Scotland. 
                         Classified mission. I was 21...

               SGT. WHITMAN, 44, tough as nails, pushes through, his uniform 
               soaked in sweat.

                                     OLD MATLIN'S VOICE
                         We had an English civilian on board. 
                         Not much older than me but already 
                         an advisor to President Roosevelt. 
                         "Paranormal" advisor, I kid you not --

               Whitman continues down the passageway until he reaches a 
               small...

               INT. SUBMARINE STATEROOM - NIGHT

               Within, an incongruously proper young Englishman "reading" 
               an ancient set of Tarot cards.

                                     OLD MATLIN'S VOICE
                         His name was Trevor. Profesor Trevor --

                         -- Broom! Topside, now.

               TREVOR "BROOM" BRUTTENHOLM is a gaunt, olive-skinned man in 
               his late twenties. In his hands, a tarot deck. He turns the 
               cards face up: THE FOOL, THE MOON...

                                     WHITMAN
                         The sooner we're done, the better.

               Broom grabs a worn-down wooden box full of books and amulets. 
               It has a leather strap that allows him to carry it, much 
               like a carpenter's tool box.

                                     BROOM
                         This is an important mission, Sgt. 
                         Whitman. I hope you realize that.

                                     WHITMAN
                         Oh -- you don't wanna know what I 
                         think. Topside, now.

               He moves away. Broom takes a small box and a few amulets.

               Before exiting, he pauses and tensely turns the last TAROT 
               CARD: THE DEVIL.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT/EXT. SCOTLAND - TUNNEL - NIGHT

               Super: OCTOBER 9, 1944, SCOTLAND.

               It's raining like hell now. Soldiers move through a short 
               tunnel carved into the mountain.

               Whitman signals his men to spread out, then comes alongside 
               Broom.

                                     BROOM
                         Sgt. Whitman!! Sgt. Whitman!! May I 
                         have a word??

                                     WHITMAN
                              (impatient)
                         What is it?

                                     BROOM
                         In private, if you don't mind...

               EXT. SCOTLAND CHAPEL REMAINS

               They enter the remains of a small chapel. Broom produces the 
               small box. It's full of rosaries.

                                     BROOM
                         Your men -- They'll need these --

               Whitman scowls and huffs. A life-sized wooden Christ 
               contemplates the scene from above.

                                     WHITMAN
                         You are a Catholic??

                                     BROOM
                         Amongst other things, yes -- but 
                         that's hardly the point.

               Whitman locks and loads an automatic.

                                     WHITMAN
                         Here. You'll need one of these.

                                     BROOM
                         I abhor violence.
                              (Whitman moves away)
                         Sergeant Whitman, I hope you don't 
                         think me mad --

                                     WHITMAN
                         Three days too late for that one, 
                         "professor."

               He moves away. Broom looks up to the wooden Christ: It has 
               no eyes.

               EXT. DITCH

               MATLIN hauls his tripod and gear and joins the troops on the 
               move. Broom catches up with Whitman.

                                     WHITMAN
                         You're wasting our time: There's 
                         nothing on this island but sheep and 
                         rocks.

                                     BROOM
                         Ruins. Not rocks. The remains of 
                         Trondham Abbey. Built on an 
                         intersection of Ley Lines, the 
                         boundaries between our world and the 
                         other --

                              (interrupts him)
                         What a load of crap. Hell, a week 
                         ago I hadn't even heard the word 
                         parabnormal --

                         But -- you read the transmission.

                                     WHITMAN
                         Half transmission. Nonsense -- German 
                         ghost stories!

                                     BROOM
                         I have seen ghosts, Whitman.

                                     WHITMAN
                         Oh, I'll bet you have.

               Reaching a slope, Matlin sets down his camera. Turning, he 
               sees lights.

                                     MATLIN
                         Sweet Jesus.

               Drenched, Broom and Whitman look down upon an impressive 
               ROMANESQUE RUIN. Under worklights, dozens of NAZI SOLDIERS 
               swarm among thick stone walls and archways.

                                     BROOM
                         They must be here for the sheep.

               OMIT

               EXT. AMONG THE RUINS - NIGHT

               A dozen German soldiers swiftly assemble a large steel 
               MACHINE. The work is monitored by a spindly Nazi in BLACK 
               LEATHER, his face covered by an odd gas mask: KROENEN.

                                     WHITMAN
                         The freak in the gas mask --

                                     BROOM
                         Karl Ruprecht Kroenen, one of the 
                         Reich's top Scientists. Head of the 
                         Thule Occult Society.

               EXT. NEARBY - BROOM - NIGHT

               He lowers a pair of binoculars and passes them to Whitman.

                                     BROOM
                         If he's here, this is worse than I 
                         thought.

                                     WHITMAN
                              (to the radio man)
                         Air and sea backup. What's closest?

               The RADIOMAN cranks a transmitter to life.

                                     RADIO MAN
                         Londonderry, sir. Forty minutes away.

                                     BROOM
                         We don't have forty minutes.

               EXT. ABBEY RUINS - ALTAR AREA - NIGHT

               Kroenen throws a switch: On the machine, dozens of gears 
               respond!

               Steam pistons thrust copper rails upright, lifting two mighty 
               metal rings, not unlike a gyroscope. Kroenen grunts and 
               signals for more floodlights to be turned on.

               EXT. BEHIND THE ALTAR - NIGHT

               The lights flood an ancient sacristy lined with eroded stone 
               saints. GRIGORY, tall and gaunt, stands naked, arms fully 
               extended.

                                     GRIGORY
                         No matter what happens to me, you 
                         must carry on with the work.

               ILSA, a severe, ageless Aryan beauty, reverentially drapes 
               an embroidered robe over his bony shoulders.

                                     ILSA
                         I will not leave you.

                                     GRIGORY
                         Yes, you will... Leave me. Deny me.

                                     ILSA
                         Never --

               He hands her a small LEATHER-BOUND BOOK. It contains hand-
               drawn notes and illustrations.

                                     GRIGORY
                         This will guide you back to me.

               He pulls her close, the clouds of their breath mingling.

                                     GRIGORY
                         I grant you everlasting life, youth 
                         and the power to serve me.

               He dips his fingers in a wooden bowl full of blood, then 
               wipes her tears away with a crimson thumb, both a consolation 
               and a ritual.

               VON KRUPT, an acrid German General, wearing dark SCARLET 
               glasses and LEATHER GLOVES, appears. Looks at his pocket 
               watch. On the gold lid: a SWASTIKA.

                                     VON KRUPT
                         It's time.

               EXT. ABBEY RUINS - ALTAR AREA - CEREMONY - NIGHT

               Grigory walks towards the machine, its colossal steel and 
               copper clockworks gleaming in the floodlights.

                                     VON KRUPT
                         Five years of research and 
                         construction, Grigory. Five years!!

               He strides alongside Grigory and Ilsa, who holds an umbrella 
               to shield her master from the pouring rain.

                                     VON KRUPT
                         The furhrer doesn't look kindly on 
                         failure.

                                     GRIGORY
                         There will be no failure, General. I 
                         promised Herr Hitler a miracle. I'll 
                         deliver one.

               Kroenen mutters excitedly as he opens a polished oak box 
               containing a massive gold and copper MECHA-GLOVE.

               Grigory extends his hand so that KROENEN may fit him with 
               the contraption, which is attached to cables and hoses.

               EXT. THE HILLTOP - ALLIED SOLDIERS - NIGHT

               The Americans fan out, unseen.

               Broom and Whitman dive into a ditch barely in time to avoid 
               a German foot patrol.

               Other GI's take up positions below a machine gun nest.

               EXT. ABBEY RUINS - ALTAR AREA - NIGHT 

               Grigory walks to the top of the altar, cables trailing behind 
               him.

                                     GRIGORI
                         Tonight, We will open a portal and 
                         awaken the OGDRU JAHAD: The seven 
                         Gods of chaos.

                         Our enemies will be destroyed. In an 
                         instant, all impurity in this world 
                         will be razed and from the ashes a 
                         new eden will arise.

               He looks down at the machine and whispers --

                                     GRIGORY
                         Ragnarok, Anung Ia Anung.

               He flexes his fingers and in response --

               -- the two metal rings swing around the machine's central 
               axis. TCHINK!!! WHIRRR!!! STEAM escapes from the ducts and 
               pipes. An invisible blast of energy forces the falling rain 
               to swerve momentarily away from Grigory's body.

               Ilsa signals TWO NAZI SCIENTISTS standing at a control panel.

                         More Power!! Don't let the level 
                         drop!!

               One of them inserts a 20 inch SOLID GOLD CYLINDER into the 
               machine. Two openings remain vacant next to it.

               A blade of light opens in the air!

               Burning symbols slash the air, like living serpents of fire.

               EXT. COSMIC SLIT - NIGHT

               The edges of the cosmic slit sizzle with color; an ALIEN 
               GALAXY sparkles on the other side. Suddenly, a work light 
               tears loose and flies in.

               EXT. COSMIC SLIT - FROM THE OTHER SIDE - NIGHT

               The six-foot work light tumbles by the massive OGDRU JAHAD: 
               seven egg-like monoliths of unholy origin.

               Within their translucent walls, horrible creatures lie 
               slumbering. As the light sweeps by, one of the giants opens 
               a filmy eye, and then another, and another, and another...

               Fleshy tentacles move lazily within their crystalline prison.

               EXT. ABBEY RUINS - ALTAR AREA - NIGHT  

               Grigory screams as his body rises. Veins swell in his neck, 
               his face distorted by ecstasy and pain.

               CLICK. Someone shoots a photograph.

               EXT. RUINS - IN THE UNDERBRUSH - NIGHT

               It's Matlin, snapping for all he's worth. Whitman pulls him 
               down and pulls out a large bayonet blade.

                                     WHITMAN
                         Listen to me, you moron: you do that 
                         again, I'll carve you a new --

               Too late. One of the NAZI SCIENTIST has heard them.

               EXT. RUINS, IN THE UNDERBRUSH - NIGHT

               The Nazi SCIENTIST approaches. Pauses next to the box with 
               the GOLD CYLINDERS.

                                     BROOM
                              (fierce whisper, to 
                              WHITMAN)
                         Listen to me!!! The portal is open!!! 
                         We have to stop them!!!

               EXT. ABBEY RUINS - ALTAR AREA - NIGHT

               Grigory dangles like a marionette in a new surge of energy.  
               Even the skeptical Von Krupt is in thrall.

               The NAZI SCIENTIST reaches for a second GOLD CYLINDER. But 
               something else lands next to him: A GRENADE!!!

               The explosion blows him to pieces. In a few seconds, the 
               squad of Allies storms the area.

               A hail of bullets cuts down a dozen Nazis. The Allies overrun 
               the machine gun nest as grenades explode everywhere.

               VON KRUPT shoots wildly, hitting Broom in the leg. But 
               Whitman's bullets rip into the old Nazi's chest.

               Leaving a trail of blood, Broom crawls to a dead G.I. and 
               grabs a grenade from his belt.

               TCHKKK!!! Kroenen extends two gleaming blades from twin steel 
               bands on his wrists and takes on an entire group of soldiers, 
               mowing through them with swords spinning like deadly rotors. 
               The steel chops clean through their weapons.

               Broom pulls the pin and throws the grenade at the generator.

               CLICK-CLACK!! It wedges itself between two moving tie rods.

               Kroenen squeals and -- retracting his blades -- lunges after 
               it. The gyrating rails slice through his leather jacket. As 
               his fingers reach the grenade, it EXPLODES!!!

               Kroenen flies through the air, hitting a stone wall, where 
               two long pieces of shrapnel pin him like an insect.

               Another rail plunges -- FFFFT!!, like a javelin -- into the 
               earth right next to MATLIN.

                                     ILSA
                         Grigory!

               EXT. ABBEY RUINS - ALTAR AREA - NIGHT

               Grigory's face is distorted, pulled like ectoplasmic taffy, 
               his body contorting and breaking. The cosmic portal suddenly 
               implodes! Nothing is left but a few burnt rails and the metal 
               glove, empty and smoking.

               As the Allies approach, the fighting rages on.

               Grigory and Ilsa are gone. And for now, so is Kroenen. 
               Embedded in the wall where he was pinned, two bloody rails, 
               nothing more.

               OMIT

               EXT. INSIDE THE CHURCH - NIGHT

               Allied SOLDIERS penetrate the ruins. Matlin helps Broom up.

                                     MATLIN
                         It's almost over!!

                         No. It's not.

               He picks up a sample of white, viscous goo from the outer 
               rings of the smoking machine. Whitman approaches.

                                     BROOM

                         From where??!!

               Broom glances at a 13th century FRESCO depicting heaven and 
               hell.

               EXT. INSIDE CHURCH RUINS - NIGHT

               Still raining. A group of soldiers spreads out, using 
               flashlights to scour through the rubble. Every one of them 
               has a rosary hanging from the bayonet.

               OMIT

               EXT. INSIDE CHAPEL RUINS - NIGHT

               Broom hastily bandages his bleeding leg. Matlin and Whitman 
               roam over the debris. Rain POURS through the broken roof.

                                     MATLIN
                         Do you believe in hell?

                         he was poisoned, shot, stabbed, 
                         clubbed, drowned and castrated.

                                     MATLIN
                         That makes him more than a hundred --

               A rustling sound reaches their ears. Matlin readies a handgun 
               as Broom scans the walls with his flashlight. Something moves, 
               accompanied by a loud scrape.

               Matlin cocks his pistol and nervously approaches a crumbling 
               statue. SCREEEECH!!!! A RED THING jumps into the air!! 
               Instinctively, Matlin shoots at it.

               The RED THING leaps from arch to arch, followed by a trail 
               of bullet hits. Whitman and other soldiers join them --

                                     MATLIN
                              (to Broom)

                                     MATLIN
                         It's got a big stone -- in its hand --

                                     BROOM
                         I think that is its hand.

               Hissing, the thing cowers between a gargoyle and a stone 
               saint.

               WHITMAN points his gun at the scarlet shape above. Broom 
               stops him from firing.

                                     BROOM
                         Wait --

               In deep shadow, the RED THING observes with bright, golden 
               eyes veined with streaks of burnt sienna.

               Broom slowly fishes a BABY RUTH candy bar from his pocket. 
               Peeling back the wrapper, he slowly waves the candy. The RED 
               THING shrinks back.

               Broom bites into the candy and chews, noisily smacking his 
               lips. Offers the candy again. This time, out of the dark 
               comes a small FACE, not very different from the stone demons 
               around it.

               The creature extends its right arm: it's solid stone with 
               tiny runes engraved around the thick, cylindrical wrist. 
               Four articulated stone fingers wiggle, reaching for the 
               chocolate.

                                     YOUNG SOLDIER

                         that whammer!

               Whitman moves closer. On the wall behind him, a shadow shows 
               the RED THING climbing into Broom's arms.

               Broom tenderly covers it with a blanket. The stubby fingers 
               snatch the candy. Broom smiles.

                                     BROOM

               EXT. CHAPEL RUINS - NIGHT

               The soldiers cluster around, curious to see it. Matlin 
               prepares his camera and directs them into a group shot. Broom 
               smiles like a proud new father and embraces the creature, 
               patting him gently. CLICK!!!

                         want to set the record straight before 
                         I go.

               Matlin finally pulls an old 8x10 from a battered portfolio. 
               He smiles, full of memories.

               FIGURE 1 stops at a symbol carved in the rocky ground and

               Before them, a thick wall of ice. Using a heavy steel hammer, 
               FIGURE 1 breaks through.

                         I will guide you no further.

               Figure 2 produces two small GOLD INGOTS. Hands one to the 
               guide. Keeps the other one.

               The Guide examines his pay greedily: engraved in it: a 
               SWASTIKA.

               INT. ICE CAVE - SMALL CORRIDOR - DAY

               The ice curtain collapses, revealing a rough-walled corridor. 
               FIGURE 1 spots a glowing firefly. They follow it into --

               INT. ICE CAVE - MAIN NAVE - DAY

               A cathedral-like vault that could easily hold a stadium. 
               From an opening somewhere above, eerie blue light streams 
               down on a magnificent labyrinth.

               A few more fireflies speckle the air, winking on and off.

               INT. ICE CAVE - LABYRINTH - DAY

               The THREE FIGURES move past cyclopean statues guarding the 
               inhuman architecture. The humans are dwarfed by the monumental 
               scale of the walkways and ramparts.

               INT. ICE CAVE - CENTRAL LABYRINTH AREA - DAY

               At the center of the labyrinth the stone floor is covered in 
               grooves radiating from a shallow stone basin.

               FIGURE 3 uncovers his face: he's a PEASANT GUIDE.

                                     PEASANT GUIDE
                              (in Romanian)
                         We shouldn't be here --

               FIGURE 1 exchanges a meaningful look with FIGURE 2. FIGURE 1 
               throws two solid gold pieces at the feet of the Sherpa. On 
               them, an embossed SWASTIKA. After a greedy moment of thought, 
               the Peasant kneels to pick up the gold.

               TCHKK!!! A long, shiny blade pierces the Peasant's chest 
               from behind. He blinks twice and slumps forward.

               FIGURE 2 steps out from behind him, a long, bloody blade in 
               his hand.

               The figures uncover their faces. ILSA has not aged and 
               KROENEN, still wears the same tight gas mask. He cleans his 
               blade in the snow and takes back the gold.

               Ilsa watches the Sherpa's blood as it runs in a steaming 
               rivulet, tracing a glyph in the grooves and filling the basin.

               A FIGURE RISES FROM THE BLOOD. A naked human shape, haloed 
               by fireflies.

                                     ILSA

               INT. DOCTOR'S OFFICE - DAY

               Mechanized rollers transport X-Ray films over a backlit 
               screen. A group of 4 DOCTORS studies the pictures and 
               exchanges somber looks. Rain spatters the windows.

               Doctor 1 glances at the others.

                                     DOCTOR 1
                         Have you told him yet?

               Doctor 2 looks through a glass partition at an aged but 
               dignified BROOM, 72, who slowly buttons his shirt. Hanging 
               from his wrist, his rosary.

                         Maybe -- six weeks.

               Broom impassively takes in the information.

                                     DOCTOR 2
                         I can arrange for hospitalization,

                         bearable --

               Broom pensively shuffles his tarot cards.

                                     BROOM
                              (shakes his head)
                         I'd rather... stay home, you know. 
                         I'll be making arrangements --

                         You can always get a second opinion.

               Broom looks down: first card off the deck: DEATH.

                                     BROOM
                         That won't be necessary.

               EXT. N.Y. - MANHATTAN STREET - DAY

               Leaves stir on the pavement. All the stores are decorated 
               for Halloween. Two kids dressed as SKELETONS run in front of 
               Broom, carrying a JACK-O-LANTERN.

               Leaning on a cane, Broom exits the building and walks toward 
               a waiting black Mercedes. The DRIVER (Agent Lime) opens the 
               door.

               Broom pauses to buy a dozen BABY RUTH candy bars from a street 
               vendor.

               In an ELECTRONICS STORE, a wall of TV's. The image of a RED, 
               BLURRY SHAPE (HELLBOY) fills the screens.

                         There-is-no-such-thing.

               Broom smiles.

               OMIT

               EXT. B.P.R.D. BUILDING COMPLEX - DAY

               On a wooded, new jersey hill, a low-slung, high-tech complex 
               rests at the edge of a bluff, its foundation fused with the 
               rock below.

               SUPER: BUREAU FOR PARANORMAL RESEARCH AND DEFENSE, NEWARK, 
               N.J.

               EXT. B.P.R.D. COMPLEX - GATE ENTRANCE - DAY

               A dolled-up MOD-STYLE moped stops at the massive gate. 
               Strapped to the luggage rack are two cheap suitcases. The 
               driver, a very wet YOUNG MAN named MYERS, touches an old 
               fashioned buzzer under a sign reading "WASTE MANAGEMENT"

               A crackling INTERCOM VOICE answers.

                                     INTERCOM VOICE
                         Yes?

                         Quantico.

               A beat, then -- WHIRRR!!! An EYEPIECE and an LCD screen 
               scanner pop out.

                         Look at the birdie, son.

               Myers looks into the eyepiece. On the screen, Myers' cornea 
               is scanned. TWO VIOLET FLASHES. His ID and badge numbers 
               appear. CLACK! The gate opens.

               EXT. UPHILL ROAD - THE MOPED - DAY

               The moped putt-putts towards the building in the distance.

               INT. B.P.R.D. LOBBY - DAY

               Seated at a dramatic circular desk is a solitary guard. Myers 
               approaches.

                                     MYERS
                         Hello, I'm --

                                     LOBBY GUARD
                         -- Late. Five minutes late.

                                     MYERS
                         Yes, I --

                                     LOBBY GUARD
                         -- Section fifty-one. Step back.

                                     MYERS
                         Pardon?

                                     LOBBY GUARD
                         Two steps back, please.

               Confused, Myers picks up his suitcases and complies. He 
               realizes he's DEAD CENTER on a giant B.P.R.D. Logo: A HAND 
               HOLDING A SWORD.

                                     LOBBY GUARD
                         Watch your hands and elbows.

               Immediately, the floor under Myers' feet starts down. He's 
               on a small elevator.

               INT./EXT. OPEN ELEVATOR - ON THE WAY DOWN - DAY

               The panel overhead slides shut. A row of safety lights comes 
               on.

               INT. OPEN ELEVATOR - DAY

               He's in a vast underground area with other elevators moving 
               up and down in the distance.

               INT. B.P.R.D. - CONCRETE CHAMBER 51 - DUSK

               The elevator stops in a narrow, dark space. Neon lights 
               flicker on, illuminating a circular chamber. PAINTED on the 
               floor is a huge number: 51.

               Right in front of Myers: a magnificent oak door.

               Myers knocks on it. No answer. Myers enters.

               INT. BROOM´S OFFICE (FULL AQUARIUM)- DUSK

               Myers looks around, fascinated: books. An office made of 
               them. The soft glow of green-shaded reading lamps bathes 
               everything in an intimate, warm light.

               One entire wall is a thick pane of glass, the wall of a huge 
               tank of water. A VOICE crackles through an intercom next to 
               the tank.

                                     VOICE
                         Turn the pages, please.

               Myers jumps, then moves closer to the glass.

                                     VOICE
                         Over here... if you don't mind?

               In the tank, ABE SAPIEN, a FISH-MAN glides in and out view.

                                     MYERS
                         Jesus Christ!

               Myers looks at four BOOK STANDS facing the glass. Each 
               supports an open volume. He leans close to the glass, peering 
               intently.

               Abe reappears. He is slender, dolphin gray, with dark patterns 
               streaking his soft skin. Bright blue eyes shine with 
               intelligence. Behind a thin wound-like mouth, gills are 
               bubbling.

                                     MYERS

                         These -- ? You're reading these -- ?

               Abe nods. Through a side door, Broom enters.

                         Sir, I'm --

               BAM! Abe presses his webbed hand against the glass, closes 
               his eyes -- all three lids.

               Abe's voice surges from the speaker.

               Broom uncovers a tray by the tank: Four greenish eggs. Myers

               INT. B.P.R.D. - FREAK CORRIDOR "A" - NIGHT

               Myers and Broom walk down a corridor. The walls are lined 
               with glass cases containing occult artifacts. Myers eyes a 
               MUMMIFIED HAND, a CLAY GOLEM, a sumptuous PAGAN ALTAR...

                         with the occult.

               He points to an ANCIENT, BROKEN LANCE.

                         invincible.

               He gestures at an ancient LANCE. Next to it: a silver and 
               gold reliquary.

                         PARANORMAL RESEARCH AND DEFENSE is 
                         born.

               Workmen are replacing two of the doors. Big dents from an 
               oversized fist have deformed the 2-inch thick metal plates. 
               Myers stares.

               They reach a FINAL DOOR. Stainless steel, like a BANK VAULT. 
               Waiting there is AGENT CLAY, a burly guy in a suit, with a 
               cartful of BEEF AND MASHED POTATOES. A dinner pile at least 
               4 feet high.

                         Agent Myers, this is Agent Clay. 
                         Follow his lead.

               Broom hands Myers two BABY RUTH bars and walks away.

                                     MYERS
                         You're not coming?

                         me proud.

               The door closes behind him.

                                     CLAY
                         They're not speaking. Professor Broom 
                         had him grounded.

                         Grounded? Who's grounded?

                         Okay. You saw the fish man, right?

               Myers nods.

                         Well, come on in and meet the rest 
                         of the family.

               Clay uses an odd-shaped ELECTRONIC KEY to unlock the door. 
               Three solenoid locks turn. Two steel vertical PISTONS open 
               up.

               INT. HELLBOY'S DEN - NIGHT

               Clay pushes the cart into a solid concrete bunker, windowless, 
               austere except for a few SAMURAI suits of ARMOR and WEAPONS. 
               Dozens of CATS wander around; others are curled up on the 
               furniture.

               There are Zippo's everywhere, from every era.

               On a sofa (made from the bed of a pickup truck) is a heap of 
               blankets and comic books. All in all, a MEGA BACHELOR PAD.

                                     CLAY

                         He gets fed six times a day. He's 
                         got a thing for cats. You'll be his 
                         nanny, his keeper, his best friend. 
                         He never goes out unsupervised --

                         Who?!

               Clay points at a torn comic book: HELLBOY, THE UNCANNY. Myers 
               picks it up, looks at the cover: it shows Hellboy -- in a 
               U.S. Uniform, fighting a monstrous ape.

               Myers watches, amazed, as a bright red TAIL waves in and out 
               of a pool of light about ten feet away. One of the cats 
               playfully paws at it.

                         eyes right.

               The voice is a deep baritone, chesty and powerful.

                         Yup. Sixty years old by our count.  
                         But he doesn't age like we do -- 
                         think dog years: He's barely out of 
                         his teens.

               Myers gasps, seeing a monumental figure in the shadows, 
               exercising with a 300 lb. Stainless steel DUMBBELL. Crimson 
               biceps like cooked hams. Chomping an unlit CIGAR stub.

                         got those implants??

               Agent Clay blushes as he hides his scalp.

                         your dinner, Red? By the couch?

               On a nearby pile of junked TV sets, a loop of Fleischer 
               cartoons and home movies cycles endlessly. One subject appears 
               over and over: an ATTRACTIVE YOUNG WOMAN with a pale face 
               and raven-black hair.

                         in the field.

               BANG!!! Hellboy lets the dumbbell drop. Instinctively, Myers 
               jumps.

                                     HELLBOY

               chiseled features, patterned red skin and deep-set golden 
               eyes. Involuntarily, Myers recoils.

               In spite of himself, Myers is staring at the horn stumps.

               An imposing four-story structure, all pillars and pediments. 
               A HALLOWEEN BANNER advertises: MAGICK: THE ANCIENT POWER.

               Super: THE MACHEN LIBRARY, MANHATTAN 

               Chaos near the entrance: policemen, TV reporters, MOUNTED 
               POLICE.

               Loud protests from the reporters as a line of black sedan 
               cars are waved through.

                                     BLONDE REPORTER
                         The NYPD has yet to issue a statement.

                              (double take)
                         -- a garbage truck?

               Trailing behind the cars, a GARBAGE TRUCK. On its side a 
               mirrored sign reads: SQUEAKY CLEAN INC. Waste Management 
               Services.

               INT./EXT. GARBAGE TRUCK - LIBRARY STREET ENTRANCE - NIGHT

               AN AGENT is driving the truck, with MYERS at his side.

               EXT. MACHEN LIBRARY - STREET ENTRANCE - NIGHT

               The crowd parts like the Red Sea for the garbage truck. Dozens 
               of faces are reflected in the truck's mirrored logo. A MOUNTED 
               POLICEMAN rides past the mirrored sides of the truck.

               INT./EXT. GARBAGE TRUCK LAB - LIBRARY CROWD - NIGHT

               The MOUNTED POLICEMAN is visible as he rides by. The mirrors 
               are see-through. The back of the truck is a fully-equipped 
               crime lab, crammed with hi-tech gear and low-tech talismans.

               ABE fits a respirator over his face. It looks like a 
               mechanized Elizabethan collar. Valves bubble and hiss as he

                         You mean, outside... with her.

               Hellboy straps on a huge utility belt heavy with amulets, 
               rosaries, horseshoes. From an ashtray he grabs a handful of 
               stogie stubs. Lights one, puts the rest in a pouch.

                                     HELLBOY
                         Don't get psychic with me.

                         Nothing psychic about it. You're

               Hellboy unlocks a STEEL BOX (STENCILED ON ITS LID: "THE GOOD 
               SAMARITAN") and extracts the meanest-looking, custom-built, 
               double-barrel, blue-finished, handgun ever made. A veritable

               EXT. COURTYARD / LOADING DOCK MACHEN LIBRARY - NIGHT

               The GARBAGE TRUCK pulls into an interior courtyard and stops.

               FBI/BPRD teams spread through the area, expelling uniformed 
               cops and securing the doors.

               THREE AGENTS -- QUARRY, STONE and MOSS -- close a gate, 
               sealing off the area.

               From a nearby roof, Agent Lime signals all clear.

                         coming in.

               The truck stops, Clay pulls a lever. Myers watches as the 
               dumpster loader hinges down like a drawbridge, revealing 
               HELLBOY and ABE.

                                     CLAY

                         locators.

               Abe, Clay and Hellboy activate lights on their belts. They 
               BEEP and blink. Hellboy starts walking.

               INT. MACHEN LIBRARY, MAIN LOBBY - NIGHT

               As BPRD agents clear the area, Clay, Myers, Abe and Hellboy 
               march through the main lobby. On view, various display cases. 
               Two BANNERS flank the marble staircase.

               Myers observes as the red Goliath sheepishly averts his gaze 
               from that of the fragile old man.

               INT. MAIN CORRIDOR / MACHEN LIBRARY (SET) - NIGHT

               They approach an oversize set of brass doors.

               Abe removes a leather glove from his hand. FWAP!! he spreads 
               his webbed fingers on the door. He closes his three eyelids 
               and concentrates.

               Two agents arrive with a rolling munitions case. Myers 
               observes as Hellboy opens it and looks over a potpourri of 
               bullets of all colors and shapes.

               Hellboy selects a clip full of bullets and a speed loader.

                         Evil, ancient and hungry.

               Abe quickly starts scanning a few leather-bound volumes of 
               ancient magic.

                                     HELLBOY
                         Oh, well. Lemme go in and say "hi".

               As HELLBOY opens the big doors, a flickering amber glow 
               illuminates him. He steps inside.

               INT. "MAGIK EXHIBITION" HALL - NIGHT

               BLUE emergency lamps are on. The exhibits are destroyed; 
               piles of debris are burning. Hellboy walks past a fallen 
               display case.

               He moves around cautiously. A couple of large carvings and 
               statues startle him.

               On the floor: boots, half chewed. Bitten belts and shreds of 
               uniforms and hats.

                                     HELLBOY

               The sickening sound of snapping bones and mastication reaches 
               his ears. Hellboy reacts to a smell, raises his eyes to 
               discover --

               A huge pale CREATURE hangs from the ceiling, chewing slowly. 
               SAMMAEL: equipped with powerful arms, a head full of tentacles 
               and two well-muscled hind legs. Most of its face is hidden, 
               but the jaws are shiny with blood.

                                     HELLBOY

               Abe has found a small, medieval engraving of Sammael in one 
               of the books.

                                     ABE
                         There's not much here: the entity's 
                         name is Sammael, the desolate one, 
                         son of Nergal --

               INT. "MAGIK EXHIBITION" HALL - NIGHT

               Sammael releases himself, lands on the floor. Part of the 
               neck is exposed: white, slimy skin, cracked like old marble 
               and criss- crossed with blue veins.

                         this out?

               Sammael stands and turns around -- CRACK-KKK!!! His waist 
               twists him 360 degrees!!

               Screeching, Sammael leaps away!!!

               Hellboy shoots. The high-caliber ammo rips a few columns 
               apart and finally catches Sammael. The bullet goes through 
               it and destroys a statue and a large window behind him. The 
               monster squeals and goes down. With a rattling cough, it 
               grows still.

               The doors bulge and crack under Hellboy's impact.

               Abe and Broom backpedal fast. Myers pulls out his gun, and 
               starts looking for another way in. Broom observes this, 
               pleased.

               by pitch-black sunglasses

                         Don't tell me, it's Zeppo.

               Hellboy catches sight of his big gun, lying on the ground. 
               He goes for it but, BAMMM!!!! SAMMAEL lands before him.

                                     GRIGORY
                         I can see that you're still young 
                         and don't know your place.

                         Teach him.

               Before Hellboy can reach the weapon --

               WSHHHP!!! A 7-foot tongue lashes out from Sammael's mouth 
               like a whip. It's arm-thick, with yellow sacs billowing from 
               its sides. It wraps around Hellboy's right arm.

               Hellboy falls to the ground, writhing, grinding his teeth. 
               The tongue squeezes and pulls. Smoke pours from Hellboy's 
               skin.

               EXT. AN ALLEY - BEHIND MACHEN LIBRARY - NIGHT

               Then -- BANG! BANG! BANG! Myers appears at the end of the 
               alley, firing round after round into Sammael's tongue. AMBER 
               BLOOD explodes in the air. The tongue recoils with an infernal 
               SQUEAL!!

               Hellboy manages to roll away.

               Myers goes for HELLBOY's gun... and grabs it! He takes cover 
               behind the trash container. HELLBOY is there.

                                     HELLBOY
                         What do you think you're doing??

               Myers proudly shows him the gun.

                                     MYERS
                         Helping you -- I just --

                                     HELLBOY
                         No one ever helps me. It's my job.

               He grabs his gun and tries to reload, but his arm hurts too 
               much.

                                     HELLBOY
                         Damn -- Okay. Here --

               He hands him the gun and a fresh clip. Reaching into his 
               belt, Hellboy extracts a vacuum-sealed packet.

                                     HELLBOY
                              (throws it at Myers)
                         -- Then load this.

               In the packet: A SINGLE BULLET.

                                     HELLBOY
                         It's a tracking bullet. Crack the 
                         pin. Load it.

               KLANG!!! The tongue punches through the steel like a ramrod. 
               Again and again... Hellboy and Myers can barely dodge it.

               Myers cracks a safety pin. The glass head on the bullet glows 
               like a chemical flare.

                                     MYERS
                         Jeez... What the hell is that?

               He's looking at Hellboy's smoking arm. Inside a bloody gash, 
               a big, black stinger is gleaming.

               Hellboy pulls it out, then steps on it. It pops like a ripe 
               grape.

                                     HELLBOY
                         Lemme go ask --

               Hellboy steps from behind the container. Sammael's tongue 
               instantly wraps around the gun's muzzle.

               BAM! BAM! Hellboy shoots repeatedly. His face lit weirdly 
               green as the tracking bullet lodges within the gun. Then -- 
               BAM!!!!

               INSIDE GUN SHOT

               The glowing bullet flies through the barrel and out towards --

               EXT. ALLEY

               -- Sammael, still in mid-air.

               It hits him square in the chest: an explosion of green goo!!

               With a shriek, the thing leaps over a wall. Hellboy scrambles 
               after it.

               EXT. LOADING ALLEY - NIGHT

               On the empty sidewalk, Hellboy sees a trail of GLOWING GOOP.

               He hits full stride, following it around a corner. Myers 
               lands a second later, cradling his arm, chasing after him.

                                     MYERS
                         Wait! No, what are you doing?

               LOADING DOCK / ALLEY

               Sammael dashes by, followed closely by Hellboy, running full 
               tilt.

               A ten-wheeler backs up, effectively blocking their way. A 
               few workers load pumpkin boxes in it.

                                     WORKER 1
                         What the hell is that??

               Without slowing down, Sammael jumps onto the trailer, denting 
               the roof then jumping off and into a CROWDED CARNIVAL area.

               A small carrousel and refreshment stand flank a pumpkin patch.

               Full of curiosity, Sammael pauses a second to inspect a Trick-
               or-treater dressed as a GOLDEN DRAGON.

               Hellboy catapults himself onto the trailer's roof.

                                     3 WORKERS
                              (chorus)
                         Whoa-whoa-whoa-

               Hellboy jumps and lands heavily on top of the driver's cab: 
               CRASH!!!

               The driver is almost crushed under the steel. He screams, 
               showered by thousands of glass shards.

               Myers is a few steps behind.

                                     MYERS
                              (into headset)
                         We'll hit the street in a minute. 
                         We're heading towards civilians...

               He squeezes between the vehicle and the alley wall. The 
               vendors are yelling at him.

                                     MYERS
                         Yeah, yeah, crazy costume, uh? Trick 
                         or treat!!

               EXT. WEST SIDE STREET - NIGHT

               Sammael runs past a group of trick-or-treaters, and jumps 
               straight into the street. Cars swerve, avoiding a collision 
               as Sammael lands on the opposite sidewalk. The TRICK OR 
               TREATERS scream.

               Hellboy appears. He too dives straight into the traffic as 
               Myers follows --

               He runs into the road... and a 4X4 speeds straight at him!

               Seeing this, Hellboy runs back, and lands next to Myers, 
               holds out his STONE HAND and stops the 4x4 dead in its tracks.

               The impact somersaults the car over them both. It lands with 
               a thud on the street, air bags exploding. Myers almost faints.

               Other cars stop, tires squealing and horns blaring. A major 
               traffic jam.

                                     HELLBOY
                         Are you okay?

               Myers opens his eyes, nods.

                                     HELLBOY
                         Good. Stay here.

               He moves after Sammael.

               OMIT

               EXT. ALLEY - NIGHT

               Hellboy follows the GLOWING GOOP into an adjacent alley. At 
               the far end he sees a metal grate has been moved. Sammael's 
               gone.

               He comes up to the opening, then jumps in.

               EXT./INT. STUNT TRACKS TUNNEL - NIGHT

               He lands on a subway track. Sammael is a few yards away. 
               Seated.

                                     HELLBOY
                         Waiting for me, Sammy?

               A train horn blares. A headlight approaches!! Hellboy smiles 
               and puts away his gun.

                                     HELLBOY
                         Uh-oh -- between a rock and a hard 
                         place --

               But Sammael sprints towards it!

                                     HELLBOY
                         Aw, crap --

               Sammael unhinges a long, scythe-like bone from his forearm, 
               then jumps at the front car --

               OMIT

               INT. STUNT TRACKS / FRONT 1/4 CAR - NIGHT

               smashing through glass and steel and raining sparks. Landing 
               inside with a ROAR!!! --

               EXT./INT. THE SUBWAY - 2 TRAIN CAR SET - NIGHT

               SAMMAEL's tongue punches through the doors as he races through 
               one -- two -- passenger cars and out the --

               STUNT TRACK REAR 1/4 CAR

               -- rear of the train, back onto the tracks.

               INT. STUNT  TRACKS - NIGHT

               Landing there safely.

               INT. THE SUBWAY TRACKS (STUNT TRACK) - NIGHT

               Now the train hurtles at Hellboy, who grimaces and does his 
               best --

               INT. STUNT TRACKS FRONT 1/4 CAR

               He leaps, but HUMPF!! He's hit! His legs rattle over the 
               tracks.

               INT. UNDERCARRIAGE - STUNT TRACKS - FRONT 1/4 CAR - NIGHT

               Inches from the wheels, he punches his stone hand through 
               the steel floor and grabs a handhold. Steam and sparks explode 
               everywhere.

               The TRAIN DRIVER grabs a fire extinguisher and starts slamming 
               it against Hellboy's head.

                                     HELLBOY
                         Hey! Hey! I'm on your side!!

               BAMMM!!! He goes under!!!

               INT. STUNT TRACKS FRONT 1/4 CAR

               The train whizzes overhead, grazing his horn stumps, making 
               sparks fly!! After the train passes, Hellboy sits up, forehead 
               smoking. Sammael is gone. A trail of GOOP is glowing. He 
               follows it, until it ends abruptly.

               He looks ahead: no trace of Sammael... Then a fat drop of 
               glowing goop hits his hand.

                                     HELLBOY
                         Aw, I forgot --

               He looks up. Sammael hangs from the ceiling, then drops. 
               Then the creature lifts Hellboy in a ferocious bear hug.

               Hellboy twists around and cracks open the jaws of the 
               creature, like King Kong and the T-Rex.

               Sammael staggers back and -- in an impossible maneuver, re-
               knits his jaws together! Then he uses his bone scythe to 
               tackle Hellboy and -- TCHAKKKK!! -- pin his shoulder down. A 
               deep wound.

               Sammael's mouth starts to open! Hellboy looks at the sparking 
               THIRD RAIL a few feet away.

               Sammael's tongue rears back, a snake ready to strike.

                                     HELLBOY
                         Screw you.

               Hellboy grabs the rail. An electrical discharge consumes 
               both creatures and burns the frame like flashpaper. Hellboy 
               lets go, his hand and body smoking. Sammael -- very crispy -- 
               is convulsing in a cloud of smoke. He grows still.

               Wreathed in smoke, Hellboy shakes off the shock and uses a 
               flame on his arm to light a cigar.

                                     HELLBOY
                         I'm fireproof.
                              (puffs smoke, kicks 
                              the body)

               A huge traffic jam clogs the highway. The totalled 4X4 is 
               being TOWED AWAY. Several TV CREWS interview witnesses.

               Myers -- his arm freshly bandaged -- signs a police form. 
               His radio beeps.

                                     HELLBOY (V.O.)

               He turns off his belt locator and moves away into the darkness 
               of the tunnel.

               In the foreground: BLACK light escapes from Sammael's charred 
               body.

               INT. MAIN ABANDONED BATHS ALCOVE - NIGHT

               An abandoned shower room. A series of sinks and stalls, lined 
               with dirty white tile. A phonograph nearby plays Wagner. 
               Kroenen stands next to it.

               ILSA is nearby, a straight razor glinting in her hand. She 
               stands over Grigory -- his back to us -- lovingly shaving 
               her master's scalp. She grabs two GLASS EYES from a table. 
               Places them in Grigory's sockets -- his back to us -- as he 
               turns, a glass eye shifts lazily into position. He opens his 
               hand: in it the pale BLACK light that escaped from Sammael's 
               body. He cradles it like a precious stone.

               Rasputin stands, his neck and shoulders rising, engorged by 
               moving flesh beneath his human skin. Ilsa stares in 
               fascination.

               Behind him, in the darkness of a tunnel: TWO SAMMAEL 
               silhouettes appear.

                         out of lies, Trevor.

                         A "phase"? What do you think this 
                         is, "The Brady Bunch?" These... freaks --

               ABE SAPIEN listens while pacing the exhibition hall, palm 
               open.

                         These freaks, Trevor, they give me 
                         the creeps. And I'm not the only 
                         one. You're up for review. You and

               Manning watches as Abe finds a sharp dagger embedded in the 
               floor.

                                     MANNING

               Abe silences him.

                         I need to touch it to "see"...

                         Don't worry about fingerprints. I 
                         never had any.

               Abe holds the dagger in his hand, turns to Broom.

                                     ABE
                         They were over here, Professor.

                         You mind sharing your mystic insights?

               Broom examines the dagger: a RAGNAROK symbol crowns the hilt. 
               The dragon and swastika.

               He solemnly extends his hand. As soon as Abe takes it, the 
               room...

                                                                 MORPHS TO:

               INT. "MAGIK EXHIBIT" HALL - FLASHBACK

               Hours earlier: the place is intact. Both ABE and BROOM witness 
               spectrally as --

               A GUARD CHECKS AN ALARM MONITORING UNIT. HEARING A ticking 
               sound, he shines his light into a dark corner: no one's there. 
               But after the guard moves on, a spidery form emerges from 
               the pool of shadows on the floor.

               It's KROENEN, encased in shiny BLACK LATEX from head to toe. 
               On his chest, a close-fitting harness comprised of softly 
               ticking gears.

               He approaches a glass case which holds an ancient WOODEN 
               STATUE of an Eastern Orthodox SAINT.

               Then, on the glass, a reflection: ILSA.

                                     ILSA
                         Move.

               She uses her hammer to destroy the glass case.

               The ALARM shrieks. Warning lights come on.

               Kroenen pulls out a double-ended BLADE. It spins, like a 
               giant bone saw, slicing across the statue.

               No apparent damage until: CRACKKKKK!!! a diagonal line appears 
               and the top half falls.

               KROENEN reaches for a small crank embedded in his chest and 
               winds himself up.

               Ilsa reaches into a hollow portion in the wooden statue and 
               removes a large reliquary jar containing Golden sand.

               Six guards hurry in. They point their flashlights and guns 
               at Kroenen.

                                     GUARD 1
                         You! Don't move! Hands up!

               Kroenen starts shaking, as if in a seizure and readies two 
               TWIN BLADES.

               bullet tears into Kroenen's arm, spewing forth an explosion 
               of dust. He turns. The guards shoot again. Kroenen maneuvers 
               the steel, deflecting the bullets which --

               -- ricochet wildly -- and finally hit three of the guards. 
               They fall silently to the floor.

               Kroenen dispatches two more in a flurry of knives.

               The last guard raises his gun.

                                     GUARD 6
                         Don't --

               Something is clearly stopping him. His hand breaks, twisted 
               by an unseen force!!

               The flesh on his neck pushes upwards, held by an invisible 
               force. He starts floating in mid-air.

               The blinking lights of arriving police cars tint the windows 
               red and amber. They outline a figure formerly submerged in 
               shadows. GRIGORY. He gestures with both hands, as if holding 
               an imaginary doll.

               His arm muscles twitch under his skin, shifting, changing, 
               gaining strength.

               With a quick gesture Grigory twists the lower and upper parts 
               of the guard's body in opposite directions.

               With a wet CRUNCH, the guard's shadow on the wall goes limp. 
               Grigory looks at Ilsa.

                                     GRIGORY
                         Ready the welcome, my love --

               Ilsa opens the reliquary jar and pours a circle of sand onto 
               the floor.

                                     GRIGORY
                         Salt. Gathered from the tears of a 
                         thousand martyrs. Restraining the 
                         essence of Sammael, the hell hound, 
                         the seed of destruction.

               Grigory slices the air with his open hand, creating fleeting 
               glyphs... and a small BLACK flame dances on his open palm. 
               He deposits it in mid-air, at the center of the circle.

               Then, the sand begins to move, like liquid mercury. Lines 
               fuse into a pile. It melts and bubbles, growing and foaming. 
               Bones are formed, tendons and ligaments join together, 
               GROWING, GROWING, INTO SAMMAEL.

               It roars!!!

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. MACHEN LIBRARY - NIGHT

               Abe snaps out of it. Broom is pale. He steps away, wincing, 
               enduring a bolt of pain in his side. Abe holds him. Motions 
               for the others to stay back.

               He extends his open palm and "feels" the air near the old 
               man's back.

                                     ABE

               Broom turns around, gently pushes Abe's hand away.

                         Sixty years ago Abe, they tried to

                         in my lifetime, they are back. To 
                         finish the job.

               EXT. CENTRAL PARK - NIGHT

               A small nighttime Halloween celebration. Lanterns hanging 
               from the trees, couples drinking and listening to Pop music 
               on picnic tables.

               On a bench, A YOUNG GUY pulls out a cold SIX PACK of beer 
               and passionately kisses his GIRLFRIEND. As he shuts his eyes, 
               a bright, red tail neatly snatches the six-pack.

               Behind the bench, HELLBOY smiles.

               EXT. BELLAMIE MENTAL HOSPITAL - NIGHT

               Dry leaves fly up in a gust of wind. A small army of EMERGENCY 
               VEHICLES roars down the deserted streets, right past a...

               ...brick 1940's HOSPITAL, behind a high wall topped with 
               barbed wire. The mesh-covered windows are decorated with 
               paper skeletons and jack-o'-lanterns. A topiary garden 
               surrounds the building.

               Watching from atop the wall is HELLBOY. One sleeve of his 
               overcoat is soaked in blood. He keeps an eye on the SECOND 
               FLOOR windows. Hanging from his tail: THE SIX PACK OF BEER.

               INT. BELLAMIE MENTAL CORRIDOR - NIGHT

               DOCTOR MARSH, a female psychiatrist, moves down a line 
               patients, distributing pills.

               Behind her, a lithe young woman in a patient's gown carries 
               the medicine tray. This is LIZ SHERMAN, age 26, her pale 
               skin contrasting with her raven-black hair and piercing dark 
               eyes. A scar mars her forehead. Three thick rubber bands 
               circle her wrist.

               Near a window, a Down's Syndrome PATIENT senses something.

                                     DOWN'S PATIENT
                              (pointing)
                         There's a big red guy down there!

                                     DOCTOR MARSH
                              (readying more pills)
                         That's fine, darling, Santa's not 
                         here for another month.

                                     DOWN'S PATIENT
                         Not Santa. Big and red. With gold 
                         eyes. And he has beer!

               Hearing this, Liz stops. She closes her eyes, tugs at one of 
               the rubber bands on her wrist and lets it snap against her 
               skin. She winces and peers out the window. The garden below 
               seems empty.

               EXT. BELLAMIE MENTAL HOSPITAL - GARDEN AREA - NIGHT

               Liz steps out a side door into the hospital garden. Hanging 
               from her neck: an old POLAROID CAMERA. She follows a trail 
               of blood to a large, thorny bush. As she circles it...

                                     LIZ
                         Back so soon?

               Visible in the branches, a leg and part of Hellboy's overcoat. 
               His tail emerges, dangling the six-pack.

                                     HELLBOY
                         Uh, I brought beer.

               Liz shoots a Polaroid.

                                     LIZ
                         To wash down my lithium pills?
                              (beat)
                         I may get a few perks, H.B. But I'm 
                         still a patient.

               Shyly, he climbs out from the bush. She sees the bloody arm.

                                     LIZ
                         You better have that looked at.

                                     HELLBOY
                         Just a scratch.
                              (shrug)
                         I wanted to see you.

               Liz sighs.

               EXT. BELLAMIE MENTAL HOSPITAL - GARDEN AREA- NIGHT

               Hellboy's sitting on a bench, next to Liz.

                                     HELLBOY
                         We miss you at the Bureau. Abe's 
                         crazier every day. And Father's still 
                         mad at me --
                              (Liz smiles)
                         Come back, Liz. Come back. I --

                                     LIZ
                         No. Not this time, H.B. It's been 
                         months since I've had an episode. 
                         And you know what? I'm learning to 
                         control it.

               Around her right hand a faint BLUE AURA of fire blooms, 
               crawling over her fingers like a velvet haze. She stares at 
               the pale flame.

                                     LIZ
                         I'm learning where it comes from.
                              (beat)
                         And for once in my life I'm not 
                         afraid.

               She clenches her fist and puts the flame out.

                                     LIZ
                         Looks like your ride is here.

               The garbage truck and the two black sedan cars have pulled 
               into the hospital grounds. A dozen agents climb out of the 
               vehicles.

               Clay starts towards Hellboy, but Myers stops him and turns

                         Then he should make it his business 
                         to change that.

               ANGLE - THE BENCH - CONTINUOUS

               Liz stands up, puts her hand on his shoulder.

                                     LIZ
                         Listen, H.B. I've got a chance out 
                         here. If you truly care about me, 
                         don't come back anymore.

               Hellboy smiles sadly. She walks away.

                                     HELLBOY
                         Goodnight, then.

                                     LIZ
                         Goodnight.

               She doesn't turn back.

                                     HELLBOY
                         Yeah, I gotta go, too. Lots to do --

               Feeling light-headed, he stands up. On the bench and at his 
               feet, a pool of his own blood.

               He sees Myers tentatively approaching.

                                     HELLBOY
                         What took you so long?

                         C'mon, time to go home. Tape you up.

                         No. I never was.

                         Could've fooled me. Go away.

               Hellboy drops to his knees. Clay, Quarry and Moss reach him. 
               Help him up.

               Liz stands at the hospital door and sees Hellboy keel over. 
               A few of the agents help him to the vehicles.

               Myers looks back at Liz. They hold each others' gaze, their 
               unfamiliar faces filled with curiosity. Eventually, she goes 
               inside.

               INT. B.P.R.D. MEDICAL BAY "A" - NIGHT

               In the depths of the B.P.R.D infirmary, Hellboy lies flat on 
               a stainless steel table. Broom sits alongside him.

               Abe peers through a magnifier at Hellboy's wounded arm.

                                     ABE
                         You were burned by some organic acid.

                         I'm lucky that way.

               Using a scalpel, Abe probes the gash. Hellboy lets out a 
               GRUNT.

                         Professor...

               Broom moves to Abe's side of the table. Abe is poking at the 
               depths of the wound.

                         Is it bad?

               Broom comes closer, eyes wide: inside the wound on Hellboy's 
               forearm, nestled like ticks, are 3 translucent EGGS.

               Hellboy jumps as Abe plucks the first one out. Abe deposits 
               it in a glass container.

               The computer beeps having finished an analysis. On a monitor, 
               an enlarged color image of one of the throbbing eggs.

                                     ABE
                         The eggs are very sensitive to heat 
                         and light. They need a humid, dark 
                         environment to breed.

               Abe picks up an egg with a pair of tweezers, passes it on to 
               Hellboy, who sports a bandage on his arm.

                         moment, when I had a train on top of 
                         my head --

               Broom frowns, worried.

                         agents, search the area, top to 
                         bottom.

               Myers observes, repelled, as inside the egg a small foetal 
               THING wiggles.

               Myers stands by Broom's desk as the old man places a new set

                         You're doing fine.

               At the last book stand, Broom glances at Abe, who is sitting 
               in the shadows near the door.

                         Sir. But I'm not qualified.

               Discouraged, Myers heads for the door.

               dressed as a human for Halloween, Broom by his side.

               Myers works at a computer workstation.

               He brings up a small photograph in an old issue of The

               Two strolling ORDERLIES shine their flashlights inside the

               INT. HOSPITAL - LIZ'S ROOM, MIN. SECURITY WARD - NIGHT

               A flashlight beam sweeps Liz's room. It illuminates a 
               CORKBOARD covered with hundreds of Polaroids depicting scenes 
               of everyday life.

               When the beam of light crosses her face, she turns slowly, 
               still asleep.

               As the light fades, the shadows in the room grow deeper. 
               Grigory emerges from a dark corner. He gazes down on the 
               bed, extending his right hand.

               He gently caresses the scar on her forehead. Under his skin, 
               a hideous movement, a writhing rearrangement of muscles. His 
               fingers start to glow.

               banners and prepare a ragged birthday party in a cement 
               courtyard.

               Sitting on some tenement steps, LIZ, age 11. Sullen, alone, 
               a gold CRUCIFIX hanging on her chest.

               A WOMAN -- Liz's MOTHER -- comes down the courtyard steps, 
               carrying a basket of apples.

               Nearby, under a balloon archway, munching candy-coated 
               apples... three KIDS giggle and point at her.

                              (to his friend)
                         See? She knows her name.

               Liz shies away from them.

                                     BLONDE KID
                         Go home, you freak. We don't want 
                         you here.

               They start throwing stones. One hits the steps. Another misses 
               her by inches. A third hits her in the shoulder.

               Scared, Liz turns but a rock catches her full on the face. 
               She falls down, blood trickling from her forehead, splattering 
               the pavement. She starts sobbing. Another rock sails across, 
               but this time, in mid-air, it catches fire and turns to ash.

               A ripple of heat starts crawling up Liz's hands. Soon a pale 
               blue flame rings her entire arm.

                                     LIZ
                              (sobbing)
                         Not again, please, not again...

               Firelight glints off the crucifix.

               EXT. TENEMENT COURTYARD - DAY

               MOTHER is dunking the apples in a pot of caramel. A 
               heartbreaking cry reaches her ears.

                                     LIZ
                         Mommy! Mommy!

               Mother sees...

               EXT. TENEMENT COURTYARD - STEPS -  DAY

               Liz: outlined by licking flames!

                                     LIZ
                              (panicked)
                         Mommy! Help me! I'm burning!

               Mother screams, horrified.

                                     LIZ
                         Help meee!!!

               She then explodes. A white-hot supernova engulfs the 
               courtyard. Her mother's body burns like flash paper. Then 
               the rest of the people are --

               THE ENTIRE TENEMENT COURTYARD

               -- devoured by an explosion of atomic proportions. Benches, 
               people, trees. Everything. The four surrounding apartment 
               blocks collapse as a shock wave hits like a wrecking ball.

               The frame whites out. And at ground zero there is but one 
               figure left standing:

               Liz... a little girl, still crying.

                                                          FLASH FORWARD TO:

               INT. BELLAMIE HOSP. - LIZ'S ROOM, MIN. SEC. WARD - NIGHT

               Liz screams, her back arching, her body now in flames. Her 
               chest glows, silhouetting organs and ribs.

               The rubber bands on her wrist vaporize.

               INT. BELLAMIE MENTAL HOSPITAL - MIN. SEC. WARD - NIGHT

               The glow from Liz's room streams into the corridor.

               INT. BELLAMIE MENTAL HOSPITAL - SECURITY ROOM - NIGHT

               In their glass kiosk, two ORDERLIES are listening to the 
               radio and sharing a pizza. A red light flashes repeatedly on 
               a panel.

               They silence the radio, grab their batons and get up. A low 
               rumble shakes the room.

               Through the VIBRATING glass window they see...

               CORRIDOR MINIATURE / COMPOSITE

               ...A BALL OF FLAME pushing inexorably through the corridor. 
               The inside of the glass booth is absolutely silent, making 
               the vision both terrifying and strangely serene.

                                     ORDERLY
                         Oh my --

               INT. BELLAMIE MENTAL HOSPITAL - SECURITY ROOM (SET)- NIGHT

               As the glass explodes, the fire ROARS, drowning everything. 
               The orderlies hit the floor, taking cover under a shelf.

               EXT. BELLAMIE MENTAL HOSPITAL (MINIATURE) - NIGHT

               The top floor blows up. Flame pours out of every window, 
               showering glass into the streets below.

               INT. B.P.R.D. - FREAK CORRIDOR "A" - DAY

               Myers pushes the breakfast cart. On it, three dozen pancakes 
               and a mound of bacon and toast.

               He opens the door to Hellboy´s den.

               INT. HELLBOY'S DEN - DAY

               Inside, Hellboy is leaning over Broom, glaring at the old 
               man.

                                     HELLBOY
                         How many buildings does she have to 
                         burn? She belongs here!

                                     BROOM
                         That's not how she feels. She may 
                         never feel it.

               Myers enters, deliberately clearing his throat. They ignore 
               him.

                                     BROOM
                         It's her choice --

               Broom grows silent.

               Hellboy stomps over to a mirror and -- using a hand-held 
               belt sander -- savagely shaves his horns. Sparks fly every 
               time he goes at the round stumps.

                                     HELLBOY

                         What landed you this job, pushing 
                         "pamcakes"? Punctuality? What was 
                         your area of expertise?

               Myers murmurs --

                                     HELLBOY
                         What was that??

               Part of the building is demolished. Repair crews and firemen 
               are still hosing down smoldering piles of debris.

               Myers arrives in a taxi cab.

               INT. BELLAMIE MENTAL HOSPITAL - MAX. SECURITY WING - DAY

               Myers looks at LIZ through a see-through mirror. She sits on 
               a bench inside a padded cell. A security CAMERA AND MONITOR 
               records her constantly.

               A worried-looking Dr. Marsh stands alongside him.

                                     DOCTOR MARSH
                         She's been like this since it 
                         happened. There were no casualties. 
                         But it's put a big dent in our 
                         Thorazine supply...

                         Are you sure you want to go in?

               Myers nods, loosens his tie and enters.

               INT. BELLAMIE MENTAL HOSPITAL - PADDED CELL - DAY

               Liz doesn't acknowledge Myers' presence. He kneels and looks 
               up at her.

                                     MYERS

               She looks at him. He offers his hand. She looks away.

               Liz turns to the 2-way mirror. Both their reflections are 
               there.

               through a dank tunnel. Then, light beams sweep the encrusted 
               walls and steel columns.

               Clay and some B.P.R.D. agents hold flashlights. Two of them -- 
               MOSS and QUARRY -- carry FLAMETHROWERS.

               Hellboy and Abe bring up the rear.

               They enter a store room piled high with filing cabinets, 
               typewriters and school desks. A turn-of-the-century mural 
               depicts happy boys doing charitable acts. A Latin phrase 
               ("VIRILITER AGE") encourages them to behave like men.

                         the sewers in '51.

               Abe removes his gloves, hyperextends his palm and senses the 
               air. Then the surface of the water.

               Makeshift living quarters tucked below a maze of furnace 
               ducts. Scores of old clocks fill the room with TICKING.

               At a desk, Kroenen calmly repairs a mechanical hand: his 
               own.

               His face is partly exposed. Under his leather mask, horrible 
               lidless eyes glitter over a skull-like grin, made of raw 
               gums and taut skin.

               As Hellboy's pounding reaches his ears, he rises, like a 
               spider whose web has twitched. The mechanical hand rattles 
               blindly on the table.

               He opens an ancient leather folder and extracts an engraving 
               depicting Sammael. Carefully places it on the table. Then he 
               opens a drawer and, from an envelope, takes two torn pieces 
               of paper. He puts them in a pouch in his belt.

               Abe studies it, senses something, and nods. With superhuman 
               effort, Hellboy lifts it. Hundreds of roaches pour out.

               Settling on the bottom they reveal the hulk of a waiting 
               SAMMAEL.

               Abe pulls off his breathing apparatus. Activates the locator 
               on his utility belt. Hellboy does likewise. BEEEP! The devices 
               synchronize.

               Hellboy extends a metal reliquary containing a small bone.

                                     HELLBOY
                         There you go, Doctor. This should 
                         cover your tailfin -- On loan from 
                         the Vatican, a bone from Saint 
                         Dionysius. Ugh. Looks like a pinky.

               Abe ties the reliquary around his hand.

                                     ABE
                         Remind me why I keep doing this.

                                     HELLBOY
                         Rotten eggs and the safety of mankind.

                                     ABE
                         Oh, right --

               As transparent nictomembrane lids cover his eyes, Abe dives.

               INT. UNDERWATER CHAMBER 2 - (LOCATION R.WAREHOUSE) - DAY

               Underwater, ABE finds an entire control room. 1940's magazines 
               float by, like paper jellyfish. The amber light of the 
               chemical flares gives the room an eerie other-worldly feel.

               INT. ABANDONED SHOWER ROOM (SET) - DAY

               Waiting above, Hellboy chews a Baby Ruth and pokes around. 
               Finds a pile of children's shoes covering some yellowing 
               albums. In the albums, a myriad of sad faces, the orphans 
               from the past.

               Some of the faces have been cut out. There's an unfinished 
               letter to Father Christmas, dated 1866.

               Clay stands below a grate, admiring his hair implants with a 
               hand mirror.

                                     CLAY
                         See? It's thicker. Isn't it? It's 
                         not that doll-hair thing --

               Suddenly, something moves. Hellboy shines his light into an 
               adjoining tunnel. Kroenen is standing there, like a deer 
               caught in headlights.

                                     HELLBOY
                         Son of a -- !

               The figure darts away. Hellboy tears after it, gun in hand.

                                     CLAY
                         Red, wait!

               Clay tries his radio. Static.

                                     CLAY
                         Red's on the move!! I'll cover him!!

               He pulls out his gun and runs after Hellboy.

               INT. TUNNEL LABYRINTH (SET) - DAY

               Clay arrives at an intersection of sewer tunnels. The glow 
               of Hellboy's flashlight is visible somewhere ahead, his 
               booming footsteps rapidly receding. A veritable labyrinth.

                                     CLAY
                         Damn it, Red.

               INT. UNDERWATER CHAMBER 2 (LOCATION R. WAREHOUSE) - DAY

               Abe nears the bottom of the cistern. As his feet touch bottom, 
               a cloud of silt fogs the water. He picks out a translucent 
               egg!

               Suddenly, something big glides by. Abe turns: sees nothing.

               He places the egg in a glass canister. Now eggs are floating 
               everywhere, undulating in the water like amber fireflies. 
               Abe swims slowly, collecting them one by one.

               Some of them are snugly wedged between two rusty machines.

               Abe's reliquary gets caught in a lever and snaps loose!! It 
               lands --

               on a grate on the floor. Abe swims down and tries to grab 
               it, but it falls through. Abe curses and stands up --

               -- only to find himself FACE TO FACE with Sammael!!

               The monster rakes Abe across the chest; dark blue blood begins 
               to flow. Abe shoves himself into a long, concrete fissure.

               Sammael can't fit through, but the tongue darts out, missing 
               Abe by inches. Sammael scratches at the walls, trying to 
               reach deeper, screaming in rage.

               Abe screams too, emitting a trail of bubbles.

               INT. ABANDONED SHOWER ROOM - DAY

               The bubbles burst on the surface. Watching them is a SECOND 
               SAMMAEL.

               INT. INTERSECTION (LOCATION /BUILT SUGAR FACTORY) - DAY

               Hellboy stops, disoriented. No trace of KROENEN. He sniffs 
               the air, then steps through a non-descript portal.

               INT. (LOCATION/BUILT SUGAR FACTORY) FURNACE ROOM - DAY

               Hellboy stands in Kroenen's quarters. An array of gas masks 
               dangle from ducts overhead. Glued next to the walls are dozens 
               of old photos of children.

               He discovers the Sammael engraving.

                                     HELLBOY
                         "Sammael: seed of destruction. Death 
                         becomes the fertile ground."

               Suddenly: drool drops from above: Sammael hangs from a beam.

                                     HELLBOY
                              (turning)
                         Didn't I kill you already?

               Sammael lunges, hurling Hellboy through an open service 
               shaft...

               ...and it's a long way down.

               When Sammael leaps, Hellboy throws him over the edge. Sammael, 
               however, grabs Hellboy's tail and pulls him over the side.

               INT. SERVICE SHAFT (NEW LOCATION SET) - DAY

               They crash through pipes, wiring and ducts and slide off

               another passage. There they bounce off of dripping water 
               pipes and jutting steel I beams, until they finally break 
               through a mesh/insulation ceiling and directly onto --

               INT. SUBWAY PLATFORM STATION - DAY

               A subway platform. Full of people.

               The two fighting creatures land on the ticket booth -- in an 
               explosion of coins, glass and steel!!! Some bold New Yorker 
               in the crowd start picking up handfuls of change.

               The dust clears, revealing a large crater in the platform 
               floor.

               Sammael hits Hellboy. The Red Giant lands on a line of 
               turnstiles, uprooting them all.

               Sammael flies through the air, unfolds its bone scythe. 
               Hellboy rolls away. Sammael misses: the tip imbeds itself in 
               the floor and then -- TCHAKKK!!! -- in a concrete column. 
               Sammael pulls, bringing down part of the ceiling. More SCREAMS 
               from the fleeing public.

               A mezzanine above Hellboy collapses, bringing the ceiling, 
               steel cables and office furniture down onto the Red Giant.

               Sammael takes a step towards the crowd and roars --

               Then, BAMMMMMM!!! A desk flies up into the air. Hellboy's 
               stone hand emerges, triumphant.

                                     HELLBOY
                         Hey, Chunk-face!

               He climbs out of the crater. Sammael growls.

                                     HELLBOY
                         You can do better than that. Big 
                         monster like you.

               Hellboy rips off one of the turnstile bars and hits Sammael 
               again and again.

                                     HELLBOY
                         See? It hurts! You shouldn't hit 
                         people!

               Sammael blocks the last hit and throws the bar away. It embeds 
               itself in the tile wall.

               Sammael punches Hellboy, a hard uppercut.

               Hellboy flies up, crashing through the plate glass of a second  
               mezzanine above the platform. He skids on the tile floor, 
               scraping a jagged line with his stone hand.

               He slides past a group of BYSTANDERS and into a row of backlit 
               subway ads. He lands in a shower of glass and debris on a 
               wooden bench, breaking it in two.

               Sammael climbs up into the mezzanine.

               Hellboy gets up -- his back bristling with glass shards -- 
               and hears a WAIL: a YOUNG GIRL is pointing at A BOX OF KITTENS 
               abandoned on a bench.

                                     YOUND GIRL
                         My kittens!! My kittens!!!

                                     HELLBOY
                         Aw, crap.

               Sammael charges!!! Hellboy scoops up the box, holds it high!! 
               Using his bone blade, Sammael pulverizes the bench.

               Next, Sammael slashes at Hellboy, scattering a dozen shrieking 
               citizens.

               Illuminated by sparks and shorting lamps, Hellboy advances, 
               blood dripping from his forehead and nose.

               Hellboy starts to reload, but -- Sammael's tongue shoots 
               out. Hellboy throws the kitten box in the air and -- traps 
               the tongue with his stone hand --

                                     HELLBOY
                         Second date. No tongue!!

               -- while catching the box with his tail. The kittens are 
               fine.

               Using the tongue, he throws Sammael out a glass window.

               Sammael dangles above the tracks, but he re-joints himself 
               and grabs a handhold on the train wall above the tunnel. 
               From here, he pulls on Hellboy, sliding him toward the jagged 
               glass.

               Sammael pulls harder, enters the tunnel.

               Hellboy fights to free himself, but his sweaty face is 
               millimeters away from being sliced by the glass. All seems 
               lost, when...

               WHAAAAA!!!!!! A train appears out of nowhere heading straight 
               for Sammael.

               It splatters the thing against the tunnel wall and plows on. 
               Sammael's body sprawls motionless at the side of the tracks.

               Hellboy approaches Sammael, whose remains are wreathed in

               Under the water, BLACK light blooms within TWO OF SAMMAEL'S 
               EGGS as a fantastic methamorphosis starts. The embryos burst 
               out, gyrating in the water, swelling and distending.

               Badly wounded, Abe peers from his hiding spot. Sammael's not 
               there.

               He quickly swims to the surface, his weird blue blood trailing 
               behind him. The water boils with energy and BLACK LIGHT.

               Back in the tunnel, Quarry and moss move filing cabinets and 
               rotten bozes full of files. One of them gives out and papers 
               spill all over.

               Suddenly -- a noise! The agents leap up and sweep their

                         Moss, what the hell was that?

               Then, TWO SILHOUETTES cast long shadows. Powerful footfalls 
               boom like thunderclaps.

               Agent Quarry raises his gun and fires at the dark shapes. 
               Useless: the things plow on.

               Moss hurriedly straps on his flame thrower. After a few 
               seconds, a green light beeps, READY.

               The muzzle of the flamethrower vomits a 30 feet long gout of  
               fire into the blackness.

               The men pause: silence!

               Quarry turns on his flashlight, hand trembling.

                         Whatever it was --

               BAM!!! SAMMAEL'S TONGUE uncurls from the shadows and lands 
               on Quarry's face, pulling him into the dark. His flashlight 
               bobbles and strobes, lighting up a nightmare:

               TWO SAMMAELS stand in the tunnel. One of them gleefully 
               squeezes Quarry. The man's screams are muffled by the 
               creature's fleshy lips wrapping around his head.

               Moss runs as fast as he can, jumping and tumbling through an 
               obstacle course of beams. Turning, he readies the 
               flamethrower. The SECOND SAMMAEL lands on Moss's back, 
               breaking his spine.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               Behind Clay, Kroenen drops down from an overhead pipe, through 
               shafts of gray light. He brings forth his customary long

               fires. Kroenen stabs.

               Twin rivulets of blood run from Clay's nostrils. 

               INT. TUNNEL LABYRINTH - CONNECTING SHOWER ROOM (SET) - DAY

               Hellboy hears the gunfire, starts running.

               INT. CENTER OF THE TUNNEL LABYRINTH (SET)

               Clay falls to the floor.

               Kroenen stands there, unfazed by Clay's bullets in his chest. 
               Dust pours from his wounds and piles up neatly at his feet. 
               He hears Hellboy coming.He places the knife on the floor, 
               then lies down and plays dead.

               Hellboy appears at the end of the tunnel. He glances at 
               Kroenen's body, then quickly checks for a pulse on Clay.

               Hellboy looks demolished.

                                                              SMASH CUT TO:

               INT. TAXI CAB (MOVING) / EXT. BPRD ADJACENT AVENUE - DAY

               An ethnic pop song blasts from the taxi radio. Liz pokes her 
               head out of the window and shoots a Polaroid snapshot. She 
               passes it to Myers:

                                     LIZ
                         It feels good to be outside!! It's 
                         been so long...

               He can't hear her over the music. Myers knocks on the 
               bulletproof acrylic divider.

                                     MYERS
                         Hey!! The music!! Turn down the 
                         music!!

                                     DRIVER
                         Yeah, yeah, music!!

               He merely changes the radio station; the music stays at the 
               same volume. Myers looks back at Liz.

               She is halfway out the window, sitting on the door.

                                     MYERS
                         Jesus! That's not -- That's not safe, 
                         Miss Sherman -- Miss Sherman?

               She takes another Polaroid and passes it down to him. Myers 
               looks at the Polaroid, then smiles. He climbs out of the 
               other window, hands her the photograph.

                                     MYERS
                         Nice view --

               He waves at her. For the first time, she smiles.

                                     MYERS
                         A smile, huh? That's good.

               She takes his picture. With the cold morning wind blowing 
               Liz's hair and the sun on her face, she looks beautiful.

                                     LIZ
                         Don't get used to it.

               Myers taps his fingers on the roof, to the beat of the music. 
               He can't take his eyes off her. They drive towards the BPRD.

               INT. B.P.R.D. MEDICAL BAY - DAY

               Unconscious, Abe floats in a special tank. LED strips read 
               water temperature, pH level, etc. He's encased in a bio-cast: 
               a cybernetic healing unit wrapped around his thorax and right 
               arm. A web of tubes and hoses keeps him in place.

               SHIRTLESS and bandaged, Hellboy sits and studies him, as if 
               in a trance.

                                     MANNING'S VOICE
                         He'll make it --

               Hellboy turns, Manning is there:

                                     MANNING
                         But not everyone was so lucky.
                              (beat)
                         Two agents died today. Clay probably 
                         won't survive the night. You're 
                         reckless.

                                     HELLBOY
                         I knew those men better than you did --

                                     MANNING
                         Ah, I see. That makes it all alright 
                         then.

               He turns to leave. Hellboy gets up.

                                     HELLBOY
                         No, it doesn't make it right, but I 
                         stopped that creature, didn't I?

                                     MANNING
                         That's what you do. That's why we 
                         need you. You have an insight.
                              (beat)
                         You know monsters.

                                     HELLBOY
                         What are you trying to say?

                                     MANNING
                         In the end, after you've killed and 
                         captured every freak out there -- 
                         there's still one left: you.

                                     HELLBOY
                              (a deep sigh)
                         I wish I could be more gracious but --

               BAMMMMM!!!! He smashes a metal LOCKER with his stone hand 
               and raises it above his head.

               Manning cowers, realizing that Hellboy's rage is a dangerous 
               thing.

               INT. B.P.R.D. - MAIN HALL AREA - DAY

               A new space. Office corridors radiate out from a brass 
               B.P.R.D. logo on the floor. A few agents monitor computer 
               stations and tactical glass boards.

               Liz and Myers walk in, carrying her suitcases. She looks 
               around and sees BROOM coming down the hall.

                                     BROOM
                         Welcome back.

                                     LIZ
                         It's only for the weekend, Professor 
                         Broom. Then I'll be on my way --

                                     BROOM
                              (impeccable courtesy)
                         Come and go as you please.
                              (beat)
                         Find your way back. We've made quite 
                         a few changes --

               CRASH!!! Liz screams and Myers draws his gun. Smashing through 
               a glass partition, the mangled steel LOCKER lands in the 
               middle of the hall in a rain of glass and aluminum studs.

               Next, Manning appears, retreating but unharmed.

                                     MANNING
                              (gasping)
                         I want that thing locked up, starting 
                         now -- Now!!! You hear me??!!

               He flees.

                                     LIZ
                              (to Broom)
                         Nothing's changed. Home, sweet home.

               Mortified, Broom hurries after Manning. Hellboy calmly steps 
               through the hole in the wall.

                                     HELLBOY
                              (seeing her)
                         Liz? Liz!!

               She spins on her heel and walks off. Hellboy turns to Myers.

                                     HELLBOY
                         You!!! You did it, buddy --

               Myers holsters his gun and follows Liz. Hellboy is all alone 
               now.

                                     HELLBOY
                              (oblivious)
                         Woo hoo!!

               INT. B.P.R.D. - LIZ'S ROOM - DAY

               A familiar cell. Fireproof insulation covers the walls. Liz 
               throws her bags on the bed. Myers lingers in the doorway.

               She reflexively pulls on one of the rubber bands on her wrist, 
               then lets it snap.

                                     LIZ
                         A little something I learned in 
                         therapy. I'm depressed --
                              (snaps a rubber band)
                         One rubber band. I'm impatient: two 
                         rubber bands...

               He sits by her side on the bed.

                                     MYERS
                         I'll get you a fresh pack.

               INT. HELLBOY'S DEN - DUSK

               A cat bats at a ball of paper. On it, two words are visible: 
               DEAR LIZ. Hellboy's tail scoops up the paper and throws it 
               in a brimming wastebasket.

               He's sitting at a stainless steel desk, deep in concentration, 
               writing with evident difficulty. The floor around him is 
               covered with more crumpled pages. In the background, the 
               projector is showing DUCK SOUP. Myers pushes in a cartload 
               of CHILI.

                                     MYERS
                         Where do you --

                                     HELLBOY
                         Shh! Just a second.

               Myers sets the tray on the table.

                                     HELLBOY
                         Myers, you're a talker. What's a 
                         good word -- a solid word for "need" --

                                     MYERS
                         "Need" is a good, solid word.

                                     HELLBOY
                         Nah, sounds too "needy."

                                     MYERS
                         Start in, you got nachos coming.

               As he goes out, Liz appears in the doorway. Hellboy quickly 
               stops writing.

                                     LIZ
                              (notices the small 
                              feline army)
                         Oh, my God... Look at them all! Who 
                         had babies? C'mere, Tiger...!

               Liz plays with a cat. Hellboy lifts the piece of paper, which 
               looks like a postage stamp in his stone hand.

                                     HELLBOY
                         Um... Liz -- I -- there's something 
                         I'd like you to -- something I need 
                         you to hear.

                                     LIZ
                         Well. Is it long?? I'm going out, 
                         but --

                                     HELLBOY
                         Out? Out out?

                                     LIZ
                         For a cup of coffee, but go ahead, 
                         read.

                                     HELLBOY
                         You're going alone?

                                     LIZ
                         No. Myers is taking me.

               Hellboy stands up, walks towards her.

                                     HELLBOY
                         Him!! Why him? Why not me?

               Myers walks back in pushing a tray of nachos.

                                     MYERS
                              (to Hellboy)
                         Hey, your chili's getting cold --

                                     HELLBOY
                              (sits back down)
                         Not hungry.

                                     LIZ
                         What did you want me to hear -- ?

               Hellboy folds the paper.

                                     HELLBOY
                         It's nothing. Just a list -- It's 
                         not finished --

                                     LIZ
                         Oh, okay then. Maybe later then.

               She leaves. Myers smiles.

                                     MYERS
                         Anything else you --

                         Not from you.

               INT. B.D.R.P. MEDICAL BAY - NIGHT

               Under a sheet, Kroenen's cold, naked body lies on a slab. 
               Broom talks into a tape recorder.

                         The subject: Karl Ruprecht Kroenen --

               The visible areas of the body make us grateful for the sheet 
               covering the rest.

                         Suffered a masochistic compulsion

               The silver hand and harness lie on a table.

                         Both eyelids were surgically removed 
                         along with his upper and lower lips, 
                         making speech impossible. The blood 
                         in his veins dried up decades ago. 
                         Only dust remains.

                         rod inserted into his pelvis held 
                         him up.

                         What horrible will power could keep 
                         a thing like this alive?

               He finds the small pieces of paper Kroenen planted in his 
               pouch.

               INT. B.P.R.D. HALLWAYS - NIGHT

               Under the gaze of high-security cameras, AGENT LIME rolls 
               Hellboy's food cart down the corridor and into the domed 
               intersection. He whistles a happy tune. Opens the high 
               security door.

               INT. HELLBOY'S DEN - NIGHT

               Lime's jaw drops.

               Across the room, one of the walls has been completely 
               demolished, revealing a SERVICE SHAFT.

               No sign of Hellboy.

               Lime peeks into the SERVICE SHAFT.

               EXT. NEWARK, N.J. - STREETS - NIGHT

               Myers and Liz leave a coffee shop, strolling down the street. 
               Myers hands Liz her coffee. They chat and laugh. He pushes 
               his Moped. She has her Polaroid with her.

               EXT. BUILDING ROOFTOP - NIGHT

                                     HELLBOY
                         What are you two talking about. What's 
                         so fascinating?? So important?? 

               EXT. NEWARK N.J. STREETS - NIGHT

               Liz and Myers pause at a corner, waiting for the light. The 
               shops are closing.

                                     MYERS
                         I admire him. He's a force of nature.

                         He's just pushy.

                         No... He's determined. Unstoppable --

                         A brute.

                         My uncle used to say... we like people 
                         for their qualities but love them 
                         for their defects.

               Liz half-smiles, sips her coffee.

                                     MYERS
                         He -- loves you.

                         I know.

                         What about you?

                                     LIZ
                         Don't know. Really. I grew up with 
                         him.
                              (beat)
                         I've missed him too, but now, every 
                         time I see him, I get confused. Hardly 
                         a day goes by he's not in my mind. 
                         Even now, I feel he's here --

               As they walk down the street. A red streak jumps over roof 
               tops.

               EXT. ROOFTOP - NIGHT

               Hellboy lands neatly on the adjacent roof. He looks down at 
               Myers and Liz --

               Myers offers her cream and sugar.

                                     HELLBOY
                         No cream and sugar, moron. She takes 
                         it black.

               She takes the coffee, waves off the half and half.

                                     HELLBOY
                         Toldya.

               Trying to feel superior, Hellboy chuckles. As they walk, Liz 
               gestures vigorously. His smile fades.

               EXT. NEWARK N.J. STREETS - NIGHT

                                     MYERS
                         It's freezing, isn't it?

                                     LIZ
                         Coffee's warming me up.

               By now, all the shops are closed. They approach a small park 
               near a train track.

                                     MYERS
                         What do we do now? Newark, New Jersey, 
                         entertainment capital of the world.

               She cleans off a wet, dirty bench, sits down.

                                     LIZ
                         You offered me a cup of coffee. I've 
                         got one, so just sit down.

               Myers is falling for her.

               EXT. BUILDING ROOFTOP - FIRE ESCAPE - NIGHT

               Hellboy leaps off a building.

               EXT. BUILDING ROOFTOP - NIGHT

               Two red hands appear over the rooftop parapet. Cursing, 
               Hellboy hauls himself up. He finds himself next to a pigeon 
               coop where a YOUNG KID is feeding the birds.

                                     HELLBOY
                         Hi...

               The kid stares at him.

                                     KID
                         You're Hellboy.

                                     HELLBOY
                         Shh. I'm... on a mission.

               He watches as Liz and Myers sit on the bench.

                                     HELLBOY
                         Don't tell anyone, huh?

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. HELLBOY'S DEN - NIGHT

               Broom examines the damage to the wall. He turns to see 
               Hellboy's locator belt hanging on the wall. Broom shakes his 
               head.

                                     LIME
                         Should we send out some scouts?

               Broom motions for him to stop. It's useless,

                                     BROOM
                         No. Enough. He will never change -- 
                         always a child. Always. 

               INT. B.P.R.D. MEDICAL BAY - NIGHT

               Kroenen's body lies on the table. Slowly, his chest starts 
               to rise and fall. He sits up.

               His arm stump docks into the prosthetic hand -- Click! He 
               flexes the shiny fingers.

               Kroenen's hideous cranium is visible for an instant before 
               he zips up his mask. He takes the sharp Ragnarok knives and 
               turns one over. It reflects a figure standing behind him: 
               Grigory.

               EXT. BUILDING ROOFTOP - NIGHT

               The pigeon kid walks towards Hellboy, carrying two glasses 
               of milk and a plate of cookies.

                                     KID
                         My Mom baked 'em.

               He sits by Hellboy's side as he watches Liz and Myers chatting 
               and laughing.

                                     HELLBOY
                         That's it: she's laughing. I'm done.

               Hellboy grabs three cookies off the plate and scarfs them 
               down.

                                     KID
                         They don't look like spies.

                                     HELLBOY
                         Come on! Look at him, those shifty 
                         eyes, that -- phony grin...!!
                              (seeing the last cookie)
                         You gonna eat that?

               Below, Myers yawns. Hellboy slaps his forehead.

                                     HELLBOY
                         Oh, the yawning trick. That's so 
                         1950's! Watch his arm --

               He looks around, picks up a pebble, hefts it.

               EXT. NEWARK N.J. STREET - LIZ AND MYERS - NIGHT

                                     MYERS
                         We all have a side that we try to 
                         hide...

               Myers stretches and places his hand and arm behind her back. 
               Something hits him in the head.

                                     MYERS
                         Hey! What the hell?

               He gets up, annoyed. No one in sight.

               EXT. BUILDING ROOFTOP - NIGHT

               Hellboy snickers, hiding and chewing a cookie. The Kid "gives 
               him five".

               INT. BROOM´S OFFICE - NIGHT

               Kroenen's two pieces of paper are joined together under a 
               MICRO-SCANNER. Broom watches as computer enhancement fills 
               out a couple of missing areas.

               Cyrillic letters are now legible.

                                     BROOM

                         SEBASTIAN PLACKBA #16... Moscow.

               Broom pulls out a few old photos. Finds one of Grigory in 
               German uniform, and in a book, another of Grigory in an 
               Orthodox priest's black cassock.

               He pulls out his old wooden box, pulls out a dusty book from 
               it. His fingers scan the text, finding Rasputin's date of 
               birth, date of death. They pause at a particular line: "His 
               mausoleum is at SEBASTIAN PLACKBA #16".

                                     BROOM
                         It's Rasputin's mausoleum.

               TCHK!! A noise -- Broom turns in time to see Kroenen 
               delicately descending a spiral staircase, blade in hand. In 
               spite of all his experience, Broom is shaken.

                                     BROOM
                         I see the puppet. But -- where is... 
                         the puppet master?

               In the dark, a voice hisses --

                                     GRIGORY
                         Very good, Professor Broom.

               Broom turns. Grigory steps from the shadows.

                         It was you: The scraps of paper,

                         Bread crumbs on the trail. Like in a 
                         fable. They both distract him and 
                         guide him exactly where I need him.

                         His destiny.

               He touches Broom's forehead, lightly --

                                     GRIGORY
                         You raised the child. Nurtured him. 
                         So, In return... Would you permit 
                         me? A brief, brief glimpse? Of the 
                         future --

               FLASH!!

               A nightmarish tableau...

               EXT. RUINS OF N.Y. - DUSK

               The ruins of New York, charred, smoldering. Human remains 
               litter the landscape. Monstrous shapes lumber in the 
               distance... an army of apocalyptic beasts outlined against 
               the blood-red sky.

               Dominating the horror is a mountain of festering skeletons 
               and skulls. At the top, a figure: HELLBOY, transformed. His 
               horns are in full bloom, his eyes and mouth stream unearthly 
               fire.

               INT. BROOM´S OFFICE - NIGHT

               Startled, Broom snaps out of it --

                                     GRIGORY
                         If only you had him destroyed sixty 
                         years ago, none of this would come 
                         to pass. But, then, how could you 
                         have known?

               Broom is speechless.

                                     GRIGORY
                         Your God chooses to remain silent. 
                         Mine lives within me.

               Rasputin stands, the flesh of his neck and shoulders heaving 
               and twitching beneath his human skin.

                                     GRIGORY
                         In the frozen waters of the Malaya 
                         Nevka, in the darkness of the void: 
                         every time I died and crossed over, 
                         a little more of the Master came 
                         back with me. He disclosed to me the 
                         child's true name... Would you like 
                         to know it??

                                     BROOM
                         I know what to call him. Nothing you 
                         can say or do will change that. I 
                         call him son.

               Discreetly, Broom removes his rosary and places it on the 
               book. Kroenen settles in behind him.

                                     BROOM
                         I am ready.

                         Good. Now, I'll add two crumbs more:
                              (Kroenen displays his 
                              knives)
                         Grief and revenge...

               Kroenen's knife goes in.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. BUILDING ROOFTOP - NIGHT

               The pigeons flutter on the rooftop.

               The pigeon kid sits by Hellboy's side.

                                     KID
                         Just go down there and tell her how 
                         you feel!
                              (Hellboy shakes his 
                              head: no)
                         My mom says --

                                     HELLBOY
                         It's not that easy, okay?
                              (beat)
                         Plus, you're nine. You're not old 
                         enough to give me advice.

                         Who are those guys??

               Hellboy turns and sees --

               TWO of the black B.P.R.D. Sedan cars rounds the corner.

               Agent Lime bounds out of one of the vehicles, grabbing Myers, 
               talking rapidly. Liz screams, covers her ears.

                                     HELLBOY
                         Something's wrong --

               OMIT

               INT. B.P.R.D. HALLWAY - NIGHT

               Agents and Bureau employees are crammed into Broom's office 
               doorway. Hellboy, face contorted by grief, pushes through.

               INT. BROOM'S OFFICE - NIGHT

               The room is full of forensics people taking pictures, picking 
               up evidence, etc. Tom Manning is there. Seeing Hellboy, he 
               respectfully steps back.

               Broom's fragile body lies slumped in his chair. At his feet, 
               a pool of blood. Liz enters, then stifles a whimper.

               With tears in his eyes, a disbelieving Hellboy looks at Liz, 
               then at his dead father. He holds Broom's body close to his 
               chest.

                                     HELLBOY
                         Father -- I'm back. I'm back. I'm 
                         back.

               Manning herds everybody out. From the door, Liz blinks back 
               tears as the red giant kneels by the body: a dog with a lost 
               master.

                                     HELLBOY
                         I wasn't here. You died alone --

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               EXT. BPRD BUILDING - DAY

               It's raining like hell.

               The PALLBEARERS, Manning and Myers among them, load Broom's 
               casket into a HEARSE. Flanking it are two rows of BPRD agents.

               The hearse doors close and the vehicle pulls away.

               Watching like a gargoyle from a distant roof: Hellboy. Rain 
               bounces off his wet overcoat.

               Liz observes him, worried.

                                     LIZ'S VOICE
                         He hasn't spoken to anyone in three 
                         days. Not a word. He doesn't eat, he 
                         doesn't sleep...

               INT. MEDICAL BAY - DAY

               Abe, conscious now, but still in the cast, floats upside 
               down, solving a RUBIK'S CUBE. Liz stands by the tank.

                                     LIZ
                         I've never seen him like this. Never.
                              (beat)
                         Should I stay? With him, I mean?

               She smiles faintly.

                                     ABE
                         Listen -- I'm not much of a problem 
                         solver...
                              (displays the cube)
                         Three decades and I've only gotten 
                         two sides.
                              (beat)
                         But I know this much: if there's 
                         trouble -- all we have is each other. 
                         And I'm stuck here.
                              (beat)
                         So -- Take care of the big monkey 
                         for me, will you?

               Their hands almost touch, separated only by the glass.

               Myers spots Liz walking past the conference room.

               INT. BROOM'S OFFICE - DUSK 

               Hellboy stands before Broom's desk, pensive, his naked chest 
               bandaged.

               Liz watches him from across the room. He finds Broom's rosary 
               on top of the book. Reads the underlined phrase on the page.

                                     LIZ
                         Hi --

               He turns to her. She slowly comes towards him.

                         I've changed my mind. I'll come to 
                         Moscow. If you -- are still going --

               Hellboy nods, then clears his throat.

               Super: TOPOCKBA STEEL MILLS, MOSCOW A wasteland of rust and 
               decay. Rotting warehouses line the street like dead steel 
               watchdogs. No one's around but a few lonely sentries.

               A limo and motorcycle caravan are waved through the security 
               gates.

               A metal door trundles back and the limo and escort motorcycles  
               enter.

               Fleshy Russian General -- LAPIKOV -- gets out of the limo. 
               Then Ilsa and Grigory.

                                     GENERAL LAPIKOV
                         I have accumulated many objects of 
                         great interest. Preserving our 
                         heritage.

               The warehouse contains a world of bric-a-brac: a towering 
               marble LENIN HEAD, Old Master paintings, tanks, warheads, 
               missiles, etc.

                                     GENERAL LAPIKOV
                         Many -- like me -- believe Mother 
                         Russia to be very close to a historic 
                         rebirth.

               They stop before a cargo container. With a butane torch, a 
               soldier melts away the lead Kremlin seal, then open the doors.

                         June 30th, 1908. It burned hundreds 
                         of square miles of forest. The 
                         Romanovs took possession of it 
                         immediately. The Czar guarded it 
                         jealously -- I have wanted it for 
                         ages.

               Grigory's fingers brush over its smooth, perfect surface. At 
               the center --

               -- TWO CIRCULAR IMPRINTS that match Hellboy's four-fingered 
               stone hand.

                         You are aware, of course, there's no 
                         way you'll get it out of Russian

                         He is aware.

               Ilsa brings out a chrome box, full of gold.

                                     GENERAL LAPIKOV
                         It's a pleasure doing business with 
                         you. Perhaps you have other interests.

               Grigory's voice drips with serene brutality.

               Hellboy wraps Broom's rosary on his wrist.

               EXT. COUNTRYSIDE - DAY

               Two gleaming black vans and a truck move through snow-covered 
               Soviet roads.

               Super:  VOLOKOLAMSK FIELDS, MOSCOW.

               EXT./INT. COUNTRYSIDE - IN THE TRUCK CAB - DAY

               Myers and LIZ struggle with a Moscow map.

                                     LIZ

                         Sparky to Big Red...

               Popping her head out of the window, Liz looks back at the 
               truck bed.

               EXT. COUNTRYSIDE - THE TRUCK BED - DAY

               Fastened to it, the crate labelled: LIVE CARGO. Small 
               breathing holes have been drilled in the sides.

                                     HELLBOY'S VOICE
                         Sparky?? Who came up with that? Myers?

               EXT./INT. COUNTRYSIDE - THE TRUCK CAB- DAY

               Liz snickers.

                         We're almost there.

               INT. INSIDE THE CARGO BOX - DAY

               Hellboy, sitting on the floor, in the dark.

                                     LIZ'S VOICE
                              (on radio)
                         We're leaving the main road, so hang 
                         on --

               They hit a series of bumps. The box rattles and shakes. 
               Hellboy bangs his head. The vehicle lurches to a halt.

                                     HELLBOY
                              (on the radio)
                         This better be the place or I'll 
                         puke.

               Motors are turned off. The crate is opened. Liz peeks in.

                         Come out and see.

               EXT. 19TH CENTURY CEMETERY - DAY

               Hellboy steps out. Takes a moment to adjust his eyes to the 
               light.

               19TH CENTURY CEMETERY (MATTE SHOT / COMPOSITE)

               Broken spiked fences succumb to rust and dead vines. Endless 
               rows of crypts and tombstones poke through wild foliage.

               Our group plus TWO AGENTS (Lime and Stone) venture into the 
               labyrinthine lanes of the dead. Each carries a backpack, a 
               flashlight and a gun.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               EXT. CEMETERY - MAUSOLEUM SECTION (LOCATION) - DAY

               Later. The group gathers in frustration in an area of baroque 
               funerary monuments. Myers -- carrying the explosive belts -- 
               looks around.

                                     MANNING
                         Forget it. This is practically a 
                         city. And it stinks, and it's muddy. 
                         We'll go back, check into a hotel, 
                         regroup after breakfast. We'll have 
                         to make a grid, go by quadrants. 
                         Maybe satellite photography.

               He gestures and all the agents head for the vans.

                                     HELLBOY
                         Let me ask for directions.

               EXT. OPEN GRAVE - DAY

               The group surrounds a grave. Hellboy raises the broken stone 
               cover and then jumps in.

               EXT. OPEN GRAVE (SET) - DAY

               -- and lands on a rotten coffin. In it, a mummified corpse 
               lies in a miserable black suit.

                                     HELLBOY
                              (whispers)
                         Animam edere, animus corpus...

               He presses the amulet on the cadaver's forehead. For a moment, 
               nothing, and then...

               ...a brutal spasm!! The corpse gasps, breathes... and mutters 
               something in tongueless Russian. SUBTITLE: WHAT DO YOU WANT?

               EXT. MOSCOW CEMETERY (LOCATION) - DAY

               The group gawks as Hellboy climbs out, carrying the CORPSE 
               on his back. With an ear-to-ear grin, he approaches the team.

                                     HELLBOY
                         Sixty feet further, comrades, and 
                         three rows in...

               The corpse fidgets on Hellboy's back. Its bony hand weakly 
               points, as if in confirmation.

                                     HELLBOY
                         This here is Ivan Klimentovich: Say 
                         "hi" Ivan.

               The corpse mutters again. SUBTITLED: GO THAT WAY, RED MONKEY.

               EXT. CEMETERY - YEFIMOVICH MAUSOLEUM (LOCATION) - DAY

               A miniature black marble castle. Using a crowbar, Myers pries 
               open the ancient steel door. Hellboy, still carrying the 
               desiccated abomination on his back, walks in.

               OMIT

               INT. YEFIMOVICH MAUSOLEUM STAIRS - LATER - DAY

               Two agents stand guard in the mausoleum, while the group 
               descends carefully. The walls are dotted with yellowed skulls.

               INT. YEFIMOVICH MAUSOLEUM - UNDERGROUND - STAIRCASE

               Myers' flashlight flickers. He shakes it back to life.

               INT. UNDERGROUND - UNDERGROUND INTERSECTION

               They reach the bottom of the staircase: three corridors branch 
               off in different directions. Hellboy deposits the CORPSE 
               attop a pile of coffins.

                                     HELLBOY
                         We'll be alright... as long as we 
                         don't separate --

               INT. UNDERGROUND CORRIDOR AND INTERSECTION - DAY

               TCHKANGGG!!!!! large spiked metal plates shoot up from below, 
               blocking both their way out, demolishing the staircase and 
               ramming Stone: he's gone.

               Wicked spikes cover the metal surface. Hellboy still bangs 
               on it, but to no avail: it's at least six inches thick. Liz 
               and Myers are on the other side.

                                     HELLBOY
                              (into his walkie-talkie)
                         Okay, someone's expecting us. Turn

                         ...Polo.

               On the other side of the panel, Myers takes the radio from 
               Liz.

                                     MYERS
                              (into radio)
                         Are you sure about this?

                                     HELLBOY
                         On a scale of one to ten: two. But --
                              (beat)
                         -- she'll take care of you, Myers. 
                         She's a tough one.

               Liz and Myers move off. Hellboy shines his light down the 
               tunnel on the left. Agent Lime picks up the corpse and 
               follows.

               INT. TUNNEL "A" / CHAMBER - DAY

               Hellboy and Manning come into a vast chamber: Slavic motifs 
               crown the rugged stone pillars and archways. Water runs down 
               the walls.

               Across a small stone bridge, light pours from a hexagonal 
               structure.

               They step onto the bridge. KLANGGG!!! two gears release a 
               steel door from above, forcing them to forge ahead.

               Somewhere, a  massive clockwork is TICKING.

                                     MANNING
                         What's that --

               Hellboy motions for silence. The CORPSE mutters: "IT'S 
               SOMETHING BIG"

               They stare into the darkness.

                                     MANNING
                         We should go back -- you -- you could 
                         tear that door apart --

                                     HELLBOY
                         Don't move. We --

                                     MANNING
                         -- should go back. Now!

                                     HELLBOY
                         No. Don't --

                                     MANNING
                         I'm in charge. We go back!

               Hellboy yanks Manning just in time. BAMMM!!!! A gigantic 
               metal pendulum swings past and demolishes one third of the 
               bridge a few feet from their feet. It takes Lime and the 
               CORPSE with it.

               Another door on the far end of the bridge shudders downward.

                                     HELLBOY
                         Son of a --

               Whoosh! The PENDULUM swings back. It destroys more of the 
               bridge. Manning sprints for all he's worth and crawls under 
               the door.

               Hellboy runs, but chunks of stone disintegrate under his 
               feet.

               The pendulum swings back taking out the final piece of the 
               bridge just as Hellboy rolls under the door --

               -- and makes it into the hexagonal building.

               INT. STONE CORRIDOR - DAY

               Hellboy and Manning find themselves in a very narrow, arched 
               stone corridor. Its walls are lined with endless rows of 
               rusty steel blades.

               Faint traces of WAGNER can be heard. They cautiously 
               proceed...

               INT. HEXAGONAL STONE LAB - DAY

               There. In yellow gaslight, Kroenen nods attentively as a 
               phonograph plays the love duet from TRISTAN UND ISOLDE.

               Above him, ropes, hooks and pulleys.

               INT. STONE CORRIDOR - DAY

               Manning rest his hand too close to a blade.

                                     MANNING
                         Ouch!!

               INT. HEXAGONAL STONE LAB - DAY

               Kroenen comes alert. He scans the room, quietly winds himself 
               up.

               INT. STONE CORRIDOR - DAY

               Hellboy shoots a dirty look at Manning and then looks back 
               into the chamber --

               -- Kroenen is gone.

                                     HELLBOY
                              (to Manning)
                         Crap. This guy moves like a cockroach --

               Hellboy readies his gun and then creeps toward the lab.

               INT.  HEXAGONAL STONE LAB - DAY

               Hellboy's footsteps elicit soft creaks from the wooden floor. 
               Manning moves along behind him.

               The record finishes playing. Silence --

               SWISH!!! Kroenen's whirling blades slice the air, ripping 
               into Manning's arm. As Kroenen goes in for the kill -- 

               -- Hellboy thrusts out his stone fist as a shield. Kroenen 
               bears down but Hellboy fends him off with powerful, deliberate 
               blocks.

               Kroenen hauls out one of his long swords.

                                     HELLBOY
                         Screw that.

               Hellboy yanks it away and bends it like a twig. BAMMMM!!!! 
               He punches Kroenen in the face, crumpling the steel mask, 
               smashing its lenses.

                                     HELLBOY
                         You killed my father --

               BAMMM!!!! another hit.

               Kroenen staggers back with each blow. Finally, the mask falls 
               off.

                                     HELLBOY
                         Give your soul to God, Your ass is 
                         mine.

               An asthmatic wheeze erupts from his scarred face. Kroenen is 
               laughing.

               INT. HEXAGONAL TRAP DOOR PIT - DAY

               BAM!!! Under his feet, a huge trapdoor falls open. He and 
               Manning drop through, along with the phonograph.

               Hellboy grabs a rope. It spins through a copper pulley, but 
               a large knot jerks him to a stop. Hellboy snatches Manning's 
               hand, but loses his backpack.

               He looks down. The phonograph hits the ground with a crash.

                                     MANNING
                              (panting, whispers)
                         Well, it's not that big a fall...

               KLANGGGG!!!!! The entire bottom bristles with six-foot, 
               sparkling steel blades.

               INT. ABOVE THE HEXAGONAL TRAP DOOR PIT - DAY

               Kroenen cautiously leans over the pit. He can't hear a sound.

               As he peeks -- SWISH!! A loop of the rope wraps around his 
               neck and yanks him forward! Before he goes over, he 
               frantically digs his blades into the floor, anchoring himself.

               INT. HEXAGONAL TRAP DOOR PIT - DAY

               Hellboy has used the rope hanging below him as a lasso. 
               MANNING clings to his powerful back as he climbs up, hand 
               over hand.

               INT. ABOVE THE HEXAGONAL TRAP DOOR PIT - DAY

               Kroenen goes to cut the rope...

               INT. HEXAGONAL TRAP DOOR PIT - DAY

                                     HELLBOY
                              (reaching the top)
                         Oh, no you don't --

               Hellboy wraps the rope around his stone fist and, with a 
               brutal stone-fist yank, pulls KROENEN into the pit!

               With a horrible scream, Kroenen drops headfirst past them 
               and onto the spikes. He wriggles like a fish caught on a 
               hook, only making it worse, as he slides further down the 
               blades.

               INT. ABOVE THE HEXAGONAL TRAP DOOR PIT - DAY

               Hellboy climbs out and sits. Sees Kroenen's blade embedded 
               in the floor. Holding it: the prosthetic hand, still ticking.

               INT. ABOVE THE HEXAGONAL TRAP DOOR PIT - DAY

               Hellboy peers down. Still alive, Kroenen frees one arm, 
               slicing through his own ropy bicep.

                                     HELLBOY
                         You like playing possum, you Nazi 
                         pinhead?
                              (beat)
                         Then try playing dead.

               INT. BOTTOM OF HEXAGONAL TRAP DOOR PIT - DAY

               Hellboy tips a massive cogwheel over the edge. Kroenen emits 
               a horrid scream as it crushes him.

               INT. ABOVE THE HEXAGONAL TRAP DOOR PIT - DAY

               Manning sits down, bandaging his injuries. Hellboy kneels 
               down.

                                     HELLBOY
                         Are you okay?

               Manning nods weakly. Hellboy brings out a cigar and fires up 
               his Zippo.

                                     HELLBOY
                         You'd better stay here. I'll find a 
                         way out. We'll come back for you.

                                     MANNING
                         You call that thing a cigar??

                                     HELLBOY
                         Yup.

                                     MANNING
                         You never, ever light a cigar that 
                         way.

               He digs out one of his fine cigars, cuts it and hands it to 
               HELLBOY.

                                     MANNING
                         Use a wooden match. It preserves the 
                         flavor.

               He lights it for him. Hellboy grins.

                                     MANNING
                         Thank you.

                                     HELLBOY

               INT. TUNNEL "B" - UNDERGROUND NARROW TUNNEL - DAY

               A narrow tunnel. Liz and Myers advance carefully.

               Just ahead, a cave-in. Pieces of ceiling, timber, coffins 
               and corpses form a chaotic barrier. As they squeeze past...

                                     MYERS
                         So, he thinks that you and I... That's 
                         why he's mad at me --

               A few bones roll by. Wet earth drops onto their shoulders. 
               They draw their arms close to their bodies, pointing their 
               flashlight beams straight down. A moment of strange intimacy.

                                     MYERS
                         But it's not true, is it?

                                     LIZ
                         What -- ?

                                     MYERS
                         That you feel that way about me.

                                     LIZ
                         You want to know -- Now -- ? Here? 
                         Red, white, whatever -- Guys are all 
                         the same.

               INT. TUNNEL "C" - UNDERGROUND TUNNEL - STEEP SLOPE - DAY

               Hellboy labors up a steep slope, using rocks and roots for 
               handholds. He reaches a dead end and collapses, out of breath.

               Light filters through a crack in the ground; he can faintly 
               hear Liz and Myers.

               INT. TUNNEL "B" - UNDERGROUND TUNNEL - CAVERN AREA - DAY

               Liz and Myers reach a wider section of Tunnel "B". They find 
               themselves calf-deep in brown water.

               Myers lights Liz's path as she steps onto a large stone.

                                     MYERS
                         Watch out. It's slippery...

               His light shorts out. She shines her light past him.

                                     LIZ
                         Oh, my God...

               Myers turns. His flashlight comes back on, revealing a complex 
               natural cavern. An entire WALL IS COVERED with translucent 
               eggs.

               SAMMAEL is there, gnawing on a dry arm bone, with the hand 
               still attached. When the light hits his face, his milky pupils 
               constrict. A snarl...

               A SECOND SAMMAEL emerges from the water. It shakes itself 
               off. A THIRD ONE raise its head.

               Myers and Liz try to back away, but a metal wall rises right 
               behind them KLANKKKKK!!! They are trapped!!

               Myers goes to grab a set of explosive belts. Tries to set up 
               the timer. Zipp! -- one Sammael snatches them away. Myers 
               falls to the ground, clothes torn, injured.

                                     LIZ
                              (into the radio)
                         Marco, Marco, Marco... Get your Big 
                         Red butt over here!

               Something stomps on the ceiling directly above them. Again 
               and again.

               INT. TUNNEL "C" - UNDERGROUND TUNNEL FLOOR - DAY

               Hellboy pounds the floor with his rock hand. Furiously.

                                     HELLBOY
                         Hang on kid, I'm coming for you!!

               The rocks below him start to crumble.

               EXT. ANTHILL VIEW OF UNDERGROUND TUNNELS AND PITS - DAY

               In an "ANT FARM" view of the complex, we see Hellboy above, 
               pummeling and -- in the cavern below -- Liz and Myers.

               INT. TUNNEL "B" - UNDERGROUND TUNNEL CAVERN AREA - DAY

               Dust and rocks fall from above. The four identical creatures 
               move in on Liz and Myers. Myers shoots one in the head three 
               times. The creature shakes off the hits as if pelted with 
               pebbles.

               One of them springs. As it flies through the air, Hellboy 
               crashes through the ceiling. He lands on top of it along 
               with a ton or two of stone. The creature is crushed.

               Two eggs glow, metamorphosing. Presto -- two new Sammaels 
               are born. The first two Sammaels growl, joined by the two 
               new ones. Liz sprints to safety.

                                     HELLBOY
                         Sorry. Just couldn't leave you two 
                         alone.

               Hellboy scoops up Myers and deposits him next to Liz.

               Lit by Myers' flashlight, two of the creatures jump. One 
               clamps onto Hellboy's back, the other onto his leg. Hellboy 
               howls. The third one joins in, like lions dragging down a 
               zebra. This time, though, the zebra fights back.

               Hellboy pulls out his gun and fires a round into the chest 
               of a Sammael. Two eggs glow -- two new Sammaels are born. 
               They're FIVE.

               Hellboy's torso is covered in blood. He falls to the ground. 
               A fourth and a fifth creature spring onto him, biting. Hellboy 
               is in trouble.

               Liz watches and shivers. A ripple of heat shimmers over her 
               body.

                                     LIZ
                              (at Myers)
                         Hit me.

                                     MYERS
                         What?

               Liz is desperate, crying.

                                     LIZ
                         Hit me --
                              (beat)
                         All of my life I've run away from 
                         it... Now I want it to happen! Do 
                         it.

               Hellboy screams. Water explodes under the fighting bodies. 
               Two of the Sammaels turn their attention to Liz and Myers.

                                     MYERS
                         I can't, I --

               Liz slaps him.

                                     LIZ
                         I know now: I love him. I've always 
                         loved him.

               A beat of silence, then Myers slaps her across the face, 
               once. Hard. The heat ripple builds. The air vibrates around 
               her. Her pupils kick back light, like an animal's.

                                     LIZ
                         Go now.

               Myers ducks behind a rock as Liz's arms blaze with fire.

               The two approaching Sammaels are ready to pounce.

               On top of Hellboy, one of them turns its head, like a lion 
               hearing the hunter's gunshots. A staggering Hellboy sees 
               Liz's body shake in a surge of white-hot energy.

                                     HELLBOY
                              (weak)
                         Liz...

               The water at her feet blows away as a concave shockwave of 
               fire expands.

               The fire engulfs the creatures. Devours them all.

               INT. TUNNEL "B" - UNDERGROUND TUNNEL CAVERN AREA -  DAY

               The screen FADES TO WHITE and then...

               Silence, then a pulse. A high ringing tone. A heartbeat.

               Hellboy pushes away the half-cooked remains of two Sammaels. 
               The other creatures are little more than blackened bones. He 
               stumbles forward. No water left. Everything is half-buried 
               in a cracked, bone-dry bed of mud. Liz lies on the ground, 
               on her side, unconscious.

               Myers is alive, but too groggy to even acknowledge it. Weakly, 
               Hellboy turns around: In the eerie silence of his deafness, 
               he sees Grigory -- LAUGHING noiselessly, witness to an absurd 
               comedy.

               Ilsa approaches. And -- in a simple, brutal move -- hits him 
               with a hammer --

               FADE OUT / FADE IN

               OMIT

               INT. THE CATACOMBS - NIGHT

               Hellboy slowly comes to. He is chained to a massive wooden 
               yoke. He takes notice of his surroundings: a large church-
               like space, surrounded by funeral niches and statues holding 
               swords. High columns flank huge mechanical gears. An SOLAR 
               SYSTEM MODEL takes the place of an altar.

               Off to one side, Ilsa uses a hammer to destroy the timers on 
               the explosive belts.

               Next to the main nave, Myers is tied to a stone pillar. Under 
               his feet, a blood channel, leading to the immense stone slab 
               bought from Lapikov.

               Liz lies at Grigory's feet. He's dressed in a ceremonial 
               robe and holds his leather book open. His back to Hellboy, 
               he faces a mural of the angel Abbadon holding a key.

                                     GRIGORY
                         "And I looked and beheld an Angel, 
                         and in his hand the key to the 
                         bottomless pit..."

               Hellboy tenses, rage building. The yoke creaks, but doesn't 
               bend.

                                     GRIGORY
                              (gestures at the stone 
                              piece)
                         These were the words I heard as a 
                         peasant boy in Tobolsk. And now, the 
                         door -- Sent by the Ogdruh Jahad so 
                         that they might at long last enter 
                         our world.

                              (to Hellboy)
                         You are the key! The right hand of 
                         doom!

               Hellboy studies the stone sculpture, its three HAND IMPRINTS --

                                     ILSA
                              (triumphant)
                         What did you think it was made for? 
                         Open the locks.

               Hellboy stares at his huge right arm, as if for the first 
               time.

                                     MYERS
                         Don't do it!! Don't do it!!

               Ilsa kicks Myers in the face.

                                     ILSA
                         Silence!!

               The open dome above reveals the moon. An eclipse is beginning. 
               The altar's clockworks monitors its progress.

                                     ILSA
                         Imagine it: An eden for you and her --

                                     HELLBOY
                         No.

               Grigory turns to Hellboy.

                                     GRIGORY
                         No?
                              (reasonable)
                         In exchange for her life then, open 
                         the door.

               In torment, Hellboy, shakes his head: no.

                                     GRIGORY
                         As you wish.

               He leans over Liz, whispers in her ear: Her body arches, her 
               mouth emits a plume of energy. Grigory greedily inhales it. 
               Then she goes limp.

                                     GRIGORY
                         She's dead.

                                     HELLBOY
                         Noooo! Noooo!!!

               He struggles again. One of the cuffs snaps. He swats Ilsa 
               with his free hand. She stumbles backwards. Now Hellboy fights 
               to free his other hand. Indifferent, Grigory watches the 
               eclipse.

                                     GRIGORY
                         Her soul awaits on the other side. 
                         If you want her back...
                              (beat)
                         Open the door and claim her.

               His head and heart racing, Hellboy struggles for an answer. 
               Can't find one... the moon is almost totally eclipsed.

               He drops his gaze. His voice a hoarse whisper.

                                     HELLBOY
                         For her.

               Grigory moves close to Hellboy. Rips the rosary off his wrist. 
               It lands near Myers.

                                     GRIGORY
                         Names hold the power and nature of 
                         things. Mine for example. Rasputin: 
                         "The crossroads."
                              (beat)
                         And crossroads I have become.
                              (beat)
                         Your true name: Anung-un-Rama. Repeat 
                         it. Become the key.

                                     HELLBOY
                              (closing his eyes)
                         Anung-un-Rama...

               INT. CATACOMBS - NIGHT

               Hellboy's stone arm glows. Ancient symbols of fire burn the 
               stone. Flames momentarily engulf his body.

               INT. CATACOMBS - NIGHT

               Hellboy roars as his HORNS majestically burst forth! Out of 
               his mouth, energy and light boil like condensing breath on a 
               winter's night.

               Inebriated with power, the new PRINCE OF HELL smiles with 
               supreme arrogance. His shadow falls on the white marble of 
               the slab and mysteriously spreads over it until the stone 
               turns black as obsidian.

                                     MYERS
                         No!! Don't do it!! Listen to me!!

               HELLBOY inserts his enormous paw into the FIRST IMPRINT on 
               the stone slab -- CLACK!! He turns it, like a lock.

               A beam of crimson light shoot upwards into the sky.

               EXT. VIEW FROM THE CITY - NIGHT

               Visible from all over Moscow, the beam blazes to the moon! 
               The same phenomenon as in the prologue, but this time it's 
               more intense, with ripples and haloes.

               INT. THE OTHER SIDE - NIGHT

               Again, the infinite, starry space. Again, the OGDRU JAHAD. 
               The ruby beam pierces the darkness.

               INT. CATACOMBS - NIGHT

               Hellboy watches as the FIRST IMPRINT disappears. In its place: 
               a burning glyph.

               Myers struggles with his bindings. The rough hemp cuts his 
               skin, but he manages to free one hand.

               EXT. ON THE OTHER SIDE - NIGHT

               OGDRU JAHAD shifts, suddenly breaking free. Gelatinous limbs 
               uncurl, expand. Its enormity puzzles the eye, obscuring the 
               frame.

               INT. CATACOMBS - NIGHT

               Hellboy thrusts his hand into the SECOND IMPRINT. CLACK! He 
               turns it.

               Myers spots the broken rosary and reaches for it --

               INT. THE SKY - NIGHT

               IN THE STORM CLOUDS, LIGHTNING ILLUMINATES GARGANTUAN 
               TENTACLES REACHING INTO THE EARTHLY PLANE.

               INT. CATACOMBS - NIGHT

               Grigory drinks in the first signs of the arrival and laughs.

                                     GRIGORY
                         The final seal. Open it!

               Hellboy puts his hand inside, CLACK!!! Before he can turn 
               it, Myers reaches the rosary. Ilsa lunges at him. He clobbers 
               her full in the face. She staggers back and down.

                                     MYERS
                              (to Hellboy)
                         Remember who you are!!!

               He throws the rosary at Hellboy. Instinctively, Hellboy 
               catches it. It smokes in his hand.

               He tosses it away. It lands next to the explosive belts.

               Hellboy opens his palm, seeing the smoking, charred imprint 
               of the cross and beads. He looks over at Grigory.

               With a blood-curdling scream, Hellboy grabs his horns with 
               both hands, brutally snaps them off. Energy spews from the 
               stumps.

               He stabs Grigory with one of them. Grigory drops to his knees, 
               holding his stomach. Hellboy drops the blood-stained horn.

               The final lock disappears into the stone. The light flickers 
               and the connection with the moon is broken.

               Ilsa, licking her bloody lips, looks up. The sky is silent. 
               The thunderclouds are parting. The eclipse has ended.

               Grigory crumples in agony.

               The burning glyphs in Hellboy's stone hand dim down, his 
               features and body resume their usual shape. All is quiet.

                                     GRIGORY
                         You will never fulfill your destiny. 
                         You will never understand the power 
                         inside you.

                                     HELLBOY
                         I can live with that.

               He breaks Myers' chains, helps him up.

               INT. CATACOMBS - NIGHT

               Hellboy painfully takes Liz's limp body in his arms. Myers 
               stands by his side.

               He kisses her forehead, caresses her hair, then walks down 
               the steps.

               Myers steps on something. He looks under his foot: A smashed 
               GLASS EYE. Then... out of the silence, a WHISPER.

                                     GRIGORY
                         Child...

               Hellboy turns. Grigory, on his knees, smiles.

                                     GRIGORY
                              (dying)
                         Look what you've done --

               He looks up. In his empty eye socket, fleshy tendrils shift 
               lazily.

                                     GRIGORY
                         You've killed me -- an insignificant 
                         man... but you have brought forth a 
                         God.

               He uncovers his abdomen. Long, fleshy pseudopods spill out 
               of the wound, like intestines.

               A large entity erupts from Grigory's torso and claws the 
               air.

                                     GRIGORY
                         Behold, my master, Behemoth. Guardian 
                         of thresholds, destroyer of worlds.

               Covered in steamy slime, a seven foot, multi-tentacled shape --
               BABY BEHEMOTH -- lands on the stone slab. The squirming flesh 
               surges up like greasy pink foam. Growing exponentially by 
               the second.

               Ilsa kneels and embraces Grigory's corpse. Kisses him on the 
               mouth. A gargantuan tentacled shadow looms above them.

                                     ILSA
                         Hell will hold no surprises for us.

               A tower of flesh disdainfully crushes them both.

               INT. CATACOMBS - ADJACENT TUNNEL - NIGHT

               In a passageway, Hellboy carefully hands Liz's body over to 
               Myers.

                                     HELLBOY
                         Keep her safe. No matter what. I'll 
                         deal with whatever's back there.

                                     MYERS
                         Alone?

                                     HELLBOY
                         How big can it be?

               As if in response, a massive tentacle fills the tunnel, 
               reaching for him. Oil lamps hanging from the ceiling smash 
               onto HELLBOY´S head as he is pulled back at breakneck speed, 
               finally confronting --

               INT. THE CATACOMBS - NIGHT

               BEHEMOTH!!! The size of a house --

               Hellboy -- head smoking -- writhes in the grip of the 
               tentacle. It suddenly throws him toward the ceiling.

               As he arcs back down, ABM!! -- he cracks the floor wide open. 
               Next to him: the rosary and the EXPLOSIVE BELTS. He tries to 
               grab them. The tentacle slams down, blocking his way.

               The vibration sends the belts down into the crack. They bounce 
               off a small ledge and land further down. Far below, grinding 
               cogwheels and gears.

               Hellboy manages to pull a steel sword from the closest marble 
               statue.

               Hellboy stands up and swings the sword for all he's worth. 
               FWAP! He cuts clean through the tentacle. The tip hits the 
               floor, rolling into the crack.

               From out of Behemoth's stump... a mass of wriggling tentacles 
               replaces the cut-off section! They squirm around Hellboy's 
               face as he slashes, again and again, fighting his way forward.

               He leans into the crack, stretches his arm, struggling to 
               grab the belts. A few inches short. He jumps into the crevice, 
               onto the first ledge. It crumbles!!

               The gears below grind a few falling bricks. The belts slide 
               away.

               A tentacle captures Hellboy, pulls him up. At the last second, 
               he grabs the belts with his tail.

               The beast raises Hellboy high. A multi-layered mouth opens 
               in the body of BEHEMOTH. The most horrible proboscis ever 
               seen.

               Hellboy's tail passes him the belts.

               The timers on them are crushed. A spark spurts: Useless.

                                     HELLBOY
                         They never work --

               He wraps them around his stone arm.

                                     HELLBOY
                         Ugh -- Now, this is gonna hurt --

               He pulls the pin on all the explosives. BEHEMOTH drops him 
               into a squid-like beak and gulps him down.

               After a moment, a weird gurgle emanates from the creature's 
               innards. Then --

               INT. CATACOMBS - NIGHT

               A surge of light roils within the thing, outlining the pulpy 
               organs. The creature starts to burn.

               OMIT

               INT. CATACOMBS - NIGHT

               A chain reaction yields a cacophony of explosions as Behemoth 
               is enveloped in a cloud of fire, goo and soft flesh.

               Hellboy lands with a sickening, bone-crunching THUD!!!

               With a bellow, Behemoth goes down, the limp tentacles missing 
               Hellboy as they vanish in a blaze of energy and light. 
               Finally, just a few cinders of flesh float in the air.

               INT. CATACOMBS - NIGHT

               Hellboy stands, covered in goo. Two final shockwaves of light 
               ripple over the ground.

                                     HELLBOY
                         Ouch -- It did hurt.

               INT. ADJACENT TUNNEL

               Hellboy lurches into the passageway and spots Myers. Painfully 
               drags himself over. Liz's body is on the floor.

               Manning limps in from an adjacent room. Hellboy cradles Liz's 
               head in his huge hand. Holds her against his powerful chest 
               and whispers in her ear.

               A beat or two, then a moan.

                                     LIZ
                         In the dark -- I heard your voice -- 
                         What -- did you say -- ?

               He looks at her, lovingly caressing her hair.

                                     HELLBOY
                         "You, on the other side: let her go. 
                         Because for her, for her -- I'll 
                         die. I'll cross over."
                              (beat)
                         "And you'll be sorry I did."

               Myers smiles. Liz looks at Hellboy for the first time as 
               what he is: the man she loves. A warm, gentle fire rims her 
               body.

               Manning watches. Agent Myers smiles a sad smile, illuminated 
               by the flames.

               Hellboy and Liz kiss. The fire haloes them and builds as Tom 
               Waits' CINNY'S WALTZ fills the air.

                                                                  FADE OUT:

          EXT. MANHATTAN STREETS - NIGHT 1


          SUPERIMPOSURE:

          MANHATTAN. 10.30 P.M.
          Park Avenue in mid-December. On the lampposts, Xmas lights
          sparkle over streets slick with slush and rain. Limousines
          line up for a public function.

          2 EXT. BLACKWOOD BUILDING - NIGHT 2


          SUPERIMPOSURE:

          BLACKWOOD'S AUCTION HOUSE
          Under black umbrellas, wealthy men and women exit the limos
          and enter a stately ten-story building. On the facade, a
          sign reads: TONIGHT - TREASURES OF PRE-CHRISTIAN EUROPE.
          A SHADOWY FIGURE lurks in an alley near the corner. His
          features are hidden by a broad-brimmed hat. He watches as-
          The guests present gleaming, golden invitations to the
          security people at the door.

          SHADOWY FIGURE
          (in Elvish, subtitled)
          I'll go up first. You'll enter from below-
          He addresses WINK, an eight-foot tall TROLL with grey skin
          and a huge scar over his left, empty, eye socket. His right
          hand is missing and he sports a heavy IRON MACE instead. A
          plume of breath escapes from his brutish mouth.

          SHADOWY FIGURE (CONT'D)
          And remember Wink-

          (BEAT)
          Don't be shy.
          He extends his arms and with a swoop, he climbs the wall,
          up, up, like a bat. Five floors up...

          AUCTIONEER
          Pre-Celtic votive sculpture is in granite
          and has been dated circa 700 B.C.
          Like the guests, the AUCTIONEER is dressed in formal wear.
          TV MONITORS display the image of the statue so the bidders
          can have a closer look.

          AUCTIONEER (CONT'D)
          We'll open the bidding at two hundred
          thousand dollars.
          A DISTINGUISHED BUYER raises his hand-

          AUCTIONEER (CONT'D)
          Two hundred and seventy-five, and... we
          have three hundred, thank you Mr. Van
          Hausen - Three hundred thousand once-
          A FEMALE BIDDER raise her hand-

          AUCTIONEER (CONT'D)
          And Three hundred and fifty thousand,
          thank you Mrs. Bernstein-
          As the auction carries on, a STEWARD leaves the room and
          heads down -

          4 INT. CORRIDOR - NIGHT 4

          -a darkened corridor where other STEWARDS wheel auction lots
          to and from the sales room.
          The STEWARD notices an open window at the end of the
          corridor. He leans out and looks down. Ten stories below - a
          snow-covered alley.
          Suddenly, he sees the SHADOWY FIGURE above the window frame,
          clinging to the smooth granite wall!!

          STEWARD
          What the h-
          Quick as lightning, the SHADOWY FIGURE covers the steward's
          mouth. When he withdraws his hand, the steward's mouth has

          VANISHED!!!

          A once-in-lifetime opportunity. For the
          first time in auction. A piece of the
          Royal Crown of Bethmoora... A precious
          artifact dating from the Atrebatean
          period. Exquisite workmanship in 24 carat
          gold.
          The lights flicker briefly, provoking MURMURS from the
          audience.

          AUCTIONEER (CONT'D)
          Please- please- ladies and gentlemen...
          may I have your attention. As I was
          saying, observe the fanciful creatures
          adorning the outer surface, figures from
          a lost mythology...
          The lights go out completely. From the sudden darkness, the
          Shadowy Figure speaks up.

          Lost- ? Not at all. Forgotten by you
          perhaps, but very much alive.

          Shall we just say that I am the rightful

          wooden branches, crushing him. They grow and grow until they
          crack the ceiling!!
          Soon the Auctioneer disappears, and in its place stands a
          compact, twisted tree. Tiny creatures emerge from its
          branches and crawl around the trunk.
          CRASH!!!!! Four SECURITY GUARDS come flying through the side
          doors and land in the aisles with a THUD!!! The spectators
          scream.
          WINK walks in. He carries two large IRON BOXES on his back.
          On the sides of the boxes A ROYAL SEAL, embossed in the
          metal.
          People cower in the corners, SCREAMING in terror and
          disbelief.
          WINK shrugs the iron boxes to the floor with a CLANG!!!!
          Inside them, little clawed THINGS are scrabbling - mewling,
          fast and hungry!!
          At the Shadowy Figure's signal, the troll opens the cages...
          and the people's SCREAMS redouble.

          warm water on a cloud of bubbles is ABE SAPIEN, lost in the
          music.
          A blurry figure approaches and raps a ring finger against
          the tank: It's TOM MANNING, chief FBI liaison to the BPRD.
          Looking dyspeptic, he presses a folder against the glass:

          Look at that- Each photo costs a fortune
          to suppress. And then, naturally, they
          pop up on the net.
          CAMERA moves in on Abe's breathing apparatus. It's sleek,
          more modern, fitting snugly to his gills and neck. His
          goggles are new, too.
          He examines a photo of Hellboy bounding down a city street,
          brandishing his mighty, high-caliber Samaritan. He's looking

          He enunciates each syllable perfectly, then turns to Abe.

          MANNING (CONT'D)

          Oh, you know. The usual. Since they moved
          in together- Good days and bad.
          On cue, the concrete wall explodes!'.! A massive BALL OF FIRE
          swings the final steel door open, almost tearing it off its
          hinges.

          ABE (CONT'D)
          Then again, there are the really bad days-
          Manning and Abe cower behind a pillar. Once the explosion
          dies away- Hellboy's revealed, lying on the floor, his back
          smoking and in flames.

          What about me? I need some space! Not
          much, but just enough to find- to find-

          The thing SNARLS, leaps and sinks its tiny teeth into
          MARBLE's finger. Then it dives under MARBLE's shirt and goes
          to work.
          MARBLE gasps and drops his gun. Dozens of creatures emerge
          from the crack on the wall and crawl into Marble's clothing.
          Gasping, he tears open his shirt as claws and teeth dig
          in.. ribs crack... blood spurts. The agent falls.

          24 INT. SALES ROOM - SAME 24

          Liz lights up both hands, illuminating a surging tidal wave
          of hungry critters that engulfs the room, gnawing at the
          wallpaper, the furniture!
          The things sweep over Agent Mudd, ripping into him like
          wriggling piranhas.

          ABE

          Oh, my-

          25 INT. CORRIDOR - SAME 25

          Hellboy protects the other agent, but he feels the things
          swarming over him, reaching for his lips and ears...
          Bellowing in disgust, he fires his shotguns, splattering
          dozens of creatures onto the walls.
          Every blast, however, reveals a buzzing, hungry mass pouring
          from the walls. HB claws at dozens more, which cling to him
          like baby monkeys.

          26 INT. SALES ROOM - CONTINUOUS 26

          The room is awash with hissing creatures, crawling over the
          iron cages. For an awful moment, no sign of Liz or Abe.

          HELLBOY
          (sudden panic)

          LIZ!!
          In reply, he hears a faint scream. He bats at the things
          with the SHOTGUN, wading further into the room.

          He sees a horde of little beasts gnawing at the metal bars
          of a cage...
          .Liz cowering inside. Hellboy just has time to look deep
          into her eyes. A quick moment of silent communion.

          HELLBOY
          Do it, Liz, do it!!!
          And Liz obeys. Closing her eyes she-

          He takes refuge as-

          It is mine-

          supernova. BAMMM!!!

          27 EXT. AUCTION HOUSE - NIGHT 27

          A ball of fire erupts from an upstairs balcony. The crowd
          and reporters look up, amazed.

          MANNING

          Evidently we have a- gas pocket-

          The reporters stampede towards the explosion, leaving
          Manning alone and fuming.

          Hellboy stomps down hard, popping some creatures, bashing
          others with the butt of his shotgun. As flames leap up, the
          things regroup and renew their attack.
          Liz and Abe run for the stairs.

          LIZ
          Red, Red, this way-
          Hellboy kicks the critters away, shooting again and again.

          HELLBOY
          No- I'll deal with them- NOW.
          He dumps his backpack and pulls out a belt full of VULCAN 66
          grenades. Holds it high.

          HELLBOY (CONT'D)
          Vulcan 66, boys! Come and get 'em-
          Liz and Abe take cover on the stairs. They see Hellboy
          luring the tooth fairies toward the windows overlooking the
          street.

          10
          As the creatures climb onto him, he pulls the pins on all
          grenades. Soon he's a mass of swarming, gnarly fairies and

          29 TNT / EXT - AUCTION HOUSE 29
          Like a cannonball, HB flies out the upper floor window.
          A ball of flame, he arcs downward, covered in fighting,
          writhing fairies.
          Below, the onlookers scatter as the massive Red Giant lands
          in their midst, cracking the pavement.

          Liz and Abe go to the window and look down. A TV CAMERA LENS

          31 EXT. SIDEWALK - NIGHT 31

          The crowd is screaming. Half a dozen smoldering fairies
          climb out of the smoking crater and snarl at the crowd.
          People shrink back in horror. One of the hungry critters
          jumps at a woman but-
          BLAM!! Hellboy shoots it in mid-air, then calmly and
          efficiently shoots its fellows.
          Finally, he plucks one last creature off his coat. He holds
          it up by the tail, like a rodent.
          Manning hurries forward, witness to his worst nightmare. A
          sea of camera flashes explodes on a grinning Hellboy.

          HELLBOY
          (looks at Manning)
          Gee whiz, Manning-

          34 INT. GUARD SHACK - NIGHT 34

          Guard 1 watches TV. HB is on the screen, surrounded by press
          and TV.

          GUARD 1
          Check it out. That guy's make-up is so
          fake. I mean, come on, solid red-
          Guard 2 is cleaning his gun.

          GUARD 2
          And what's with his forehead? Is that
          goggles?
          He looks out the window and sees the THE SHADOWY FIGURE
          standing by the gates.

           GUARD 2 (CONT'D)
           Hey, we got us a wino.
           He grabs his nightstick and steps outside.

           35

          35 EXT. RAILYARD - NIGHT

           Waving his nightstick, Guard 2 approaches the intruder.
          Their elongated shadows loom up above them on a brick wall.

          GUARD 2
          Hey- buddy- get the-
          The THE SHADOWY FIGURE whirls and drops his coat. He
          unsheathes a long, thin sword, slicing the air around the
          guard.
          The guard's shadow in the background is cut into three parts
          and collapses.

          36

          36 INT. GUARD SHACK - NIGHT

          Guard 1 tunes in a game show. Looks outside-
          -no sign of his buddy. Behind him, at the window, WINK
          appears. Its MASSIVE ARM punches through the wall and hauls
          off the GUARD and then slams his massive IRON MACE down!!!

          BAMMKM ! ! ! !
          THE SHADOWY FIGURE wipes off his sword over the crumpled
          remains of Guard 2. Screams and bone crunching can be heard.
          WINK emerges from behind the shack.

          

          

          

          

          HELLBOY 2 19
          Effortlessly, the SHADOWY FIGURE vaults the chainlink fence
          and walks into the roundhouse. WINK smashes the fence and
          follows him through.

          37 INT. ROUNDHOUSE - NIGHT 37

          A few pigeons flutter through a forest of steel pillars.
          Radiant fingers of moonlight shine on the old train tracks.
          THE SHADOWY FIGURE and WINK stop as a dozen ROYAL GUARDS in
          helmets and light armor march out from a tunnel.
          After a pause, a CHAMBERLAIN joins them. He bows low in a
          show of respect for the Shadowy Figure.

          CHAMBERLAIN
          Prince Nuada- He awaits you- Please,
          follow me, Sire.

          38 INT. TUNNEL - NIGHT 38

          The Chamberlain leads the way down a tunnel lined with more
          guards. The armed men surround the Prince as they stop at an
          intersection.
          The Prince prepares to unsheathe his sword- WINK growls.

          CHAMBERLAIN
          I beg you, your majesty. Before entering
          the chamber you surrender your sword.

          PRINCE
          I will not.

          CHAMBERLAIN
          Then, I regret to say, you may not see
          your father. It is the protocol, sire.
          For peasant and prince alike. Please- for
          the last time- surrender your sword.
          A tense beat and then the Prince relents.
          The guards accept his weapon, carefully pat him down-

          PRINCE
          Mr. Wink however- cannot dispose of his
          weapon. He will wait here-
          WINK snorts as the Prince is finally escorted through a
          huge, rusting iron door.

          39 INT. MACHINE SHOP - NIGHT 39

          An abandoned machine shop functions as a council chamber.
          High-ranking heads of outlandish MAGICK FAMILIES are there:
          goblins, trolls, dwarves and elves.
          At the center sits KING BALOR The One-armed King of Elfland
          and, behind him, the willowy, beautiful PRINCESS NUALA, the
          Prince's sister.
          Both on the King's chest and her own, a large golden piece
          dangles from a chain.
          Nuala's resemblance to the Prince is uncanny, down to the
          fine scars marring their perfect faces. They're YING and
          YANG, almost the same being.
          The Prince eyes the doors closing behind him. The armed
          guards watch his every move.
          He bows his head and kneels.

          PRINCE
          Father.
          (eyes the Princess)

          SISTER-
          The KING gestures for him to rise.

          KING
          Why have you done this??
          His voice trembles with anger.

          KING (CONT'D)
          Why? !
          The Prince looks at him, defiant.

          PRINCE
          I have returned from exile to set us
          free. All of us, Father- And to reclaim
          what has been taken from our people. The
          land and the freedom that is rightfully
          ours.

          KING
          No- You have broken a truce that has
          lasted for centuries.

          

          

          

          

          HELLBOY 2 21

          PRINCE
          A shameful truce, worth nothing. How can
          you abide it? How- ? They have no respect
          for themselves, their Gods or the earth-

          (BEAT)
          And they scorn us- every time they raise
          a dead, cold building, destroy a forest,
          or take more land-
          The PRINCESS then steps forward.

          PRINCESS
          What they do is in their nature. We must
          honor our side of the agreement-

          PRINCE
          Honor-?

          (BEAT)
          Look at this place. Is this where you
          hold court??

          (BEAT )
          Is this how we are to live?? Amidst their
          filth, in their rubble??? Picking at
          scraps from their table??? Where is the
          honor in that??

          KING
          And what would your solution be-? War?
          Why?

          (PAUSE)
          It may just be that our days are ended...

          PRINCE
          It may be- but we will not go quiet. We
          will not fade like this. Better to burn
          than fade away... And for this...
          Prince Nuada looks around, locking eyes with the heads of
          the clans.

          PRINCE
          .we'll need the help of the Good... the
          Bad... and the Worst-
          He brings out the gold artifact from the auction. Holds it
          high.
          The crowds GASPS. The King instinctively covers the
          companion piece hanging from his chest as a medallion.

          KING
          No- you cannot be that mad-

          

          

          

          

          HELLBOY 2 22

          PRINCE
          Yes. I am.

          KING
          This is the path you wish to take?
          Knowing the cost?

          PRINCE
          Yes, Father- it is.
          The King takes the Princess' hand and mournfully lowers his
          head.

          KING
          Then, I am sorry my son- you leave me no
          choice.
          (looks at his guards)
          Death.
          His two PRAETORIAN GUARDS unsheathe their swords.

          PRINCE

          (GRIM)
          I agree. Death it is-
          And the guards turn toward the king and stab him. The
          Princess screams. The Prince looks away as the old monarch
          tumbles from his throne, dead. The heads of the clans try to
          flee, but are kept at bay by the other guards.

          PRINCE
          Hear me all!!! There are some amongst you
          that have already seen the light-
          (he nears the guards)
          Seen the future...
          The PRAETORIAN GUARDS cover his back as he leans forward to
          his Father"s corpse and snatches the medallion.

          PRINCE (CONT'D)
          As for you- You may join us in our quest
          or die now-
          His gaze is fierce, inspired. He joins the pieces together,
          they fuse and interconnect through the magical equivalent of
          NANOTECHNOLOGY. Minute gears and hooks join the pieces
          seamlessly into an almost complete CROWN. The Prince raises

          IT-

          PRINCE (CONT'D)
          All of those in favor, make it known.

          

          

          

          

          HELLBOY 2 23
          All of the family heads sheepishly bow their heads, then
          kneel.

          PRINCE (CONT'D)
          Good- I see the council is as brave as
          it's always been...

          (BEAT)
          And now, my sister-
          The Prince looks around and sees that his sister is gone.
          He pushes through the mob, pulling his guards to the door.

           PRINCE (CONT'D)
           Find her- Find her-
           His minions surge into the tunnels.

          40 TNT. TUNNEL MAZE - NIGHT 40
           Clutching the medallion on her chest , the Princess runs
          down a tunnel. A CROWD gathers behind her, chasing her as
          she zig-zags from tunnel to tunnel.
          With perfect calm, she ducks into a niche, then slides down
          a chute.
          She lands in a stone chamber lined with bookshelves.

          41 INT. PRINCESS CHAMBER - DAY 41

          The Princess rushes to a small cabinet. She grabs an
          ancient, leather-bound tome.
          She turns to leave, but a horde of TROLLS rushes and quickly
          surrounds her. One of the beasts swings a heavy, rusty
          sword.
          It opens a gash in the princess' left arm-

          42 INT. TUNNEL 1 - DAY 42

          The Prince, rushing through the tunnel with the PRAETORIAN
          GUARDS, suddenly doubles over, cursing. Blood pours from a
          wound in his left arm.

          PRINCE
          No- no- you fools-

           As another troll lifts his sword high-

           PRINCESS
           (calling out)
           Yrdrig!!
          YRDRIG, a hellhound the size of a tank, jumps out from an
          alcove. He has multiple heads, all of them ferocious. In
          seconds, he's upon the TROLLS.
          Each of his many mouths tears into green flesh, lifting and
          shaking the helpless monsters like rag dolls.
          The Princess slips through a secret door.

          44 INT. TUNNEL 2 -- SAME 44

          The Prince and his guards rush through the tunnels, as troll
          screams echo off the walls.
          When they finally-

          45 INT. PRINCESS CHAMBER - SAME 45

          -reach the Princess' chamber, it's too late.
          Dead and dying TROLLS lie in a heap on the floor.
          The Prince finds no sign of his sister. He clutches his
          bleeding arm.

          46 INT. HELLBOY'S ROOM - DAY 46

          Liz sprawls on a sofa, watching the 20-odd TV monitors in
          Hellboy's room. All the news channels feature footage of
          Heliboy's "outing" the night before.
          HB is grinning at the camera. Now he's signing an autograph!

          HELLBOY ON TV
          Yes- yes- I'd say I am that strong- I've
          fought many creatures over the years but
          none as strong as me-
          He winks at camera. Liz rolls her eyes.

          

          

          

          

          HELLBOY 2 25
          Hellboy plunks himself down next to her, popping a can of
          beer.

          HELLBOY
          I think I did good. And I looked good,
          don't you think, Liz?
          Abe stands behind them, juggling a dozen remote controls.

          ABE
          Look- there's Manning...
          He raises the volume as Manning is shown, surrounded by
          microphones.

          MANNING ON TV
          Evidently we have a- gas pocket-
          somewhere in-

          HELLBOY
          A gas pocket??!! Ha-! I love it.
          The door opens. Manning is there, holding a plastic box
          overflowing with mail.

          MANNING

          PLEASE-
          Disgusted, Manning turns off the TV's.

          MANNING
          Aw- this is a disaster! A disaster- you
          hear?? Worse than Cheney with a shotgun.
          Only Liz-

          (BEAT)
          Only Liz handled herself with any
          dignity.

          LIZ
          (glancing at HB)
          No one asked me anything.
          Manning pulls a fistful of mail out and tosses it on a
          table.

          MANNING
          Don't bother starting a fan club. It's
          trending five to one against us.

          HELLBOY
          Against?

          

          

          

          

          HELLBOY 2 26

          LIZ
          (glances at some letters)
          Polls- protests- hate mail-
          Liz grabs a few letters and scans them.

          LIZ

          (READING)
          "Unwelcome species... mongrelizing...
          lower orders... ungodly freaks..."
          She glares at Hellboy.

          HELLBOY
          Ungodly freaks-? Us?

          MANNING
          You really did it this time- I'm under
          review.
          (to Hellboy)
          But so are you- As of today, there's a
          new team leader.

          HELLBOY
          New - ? What?

           MANNING
           Yes- You heard me. A new team leader.
           We're to meet him at the conference room
          at 0900-
           (looks at his watch)
          Now.

          47 INT. SECURITY POUND BPRD - SAME 47

          The SECURITY POUND is row after row of stacked cages, each
          one imprisoning a different CREATURE. BPRD AGENTS patrol the
          pens, feeding the occupants, cleaning the pans-
          HB looks at Manning, who is edgy and nervous.

          HELLBOY
          What's the matter, Manning?? Don't you
          trust me anymore?

          MANNING
          Oh- I never did- But after last night,
          Washington wants a new public face for
          the BPRD-

          

          

          

          

          HELLBOY 2 27

          HELLBOY
          What about me? What's wrong with my
          face???

          MANNING
          Or mine??? The press loves me!! But now
          you've ruined it all-

          HELLBOY
          But, who-? Who is this guy?

          MANNING
          How would I know? Evidently, he's quite
          the big shot-
          (he reads a file)
          His name is Johann Kraus-

          HELLBOY
          Akkk- Kraus??? He's German-

          MANNING

          (OVERLAPPING)
          -a physical medium, head of the European
          branch of the BPRD-

          HELLBOY

          (OVERLAPPING)
          You know I have a problem with Germans-

          MANNING

          (OVERLAPPING)
          -a Doctor in Philosophy and Occult
          Practice from the University of Munich
          and a very eloquent speaker-

          HELLBOY

          (OVERLAPPING)
          -Germans make me nervous-

          MANNING
          I guess they need a nice open face- A
          face people can trust.
          Finally, next to steel cage, they meet-
          JOHANN KRAUS: about 6' tall, dressed in a canvas containment
          suit full of tubes and taps. His hands are encased in thick
          latex gloves with exit valves at the fingertips and his
          head...

          MANNING
          . Oh, my God-

          

          

          

          

          HELLBOY 2 28
          .is a translucent glass bubble, full of gas!
          He is studying a drawing of the royal seal we saw on the
          Fairy Cages.
          Johann approaches Liz. He takes her hand and bows.

          JOHANN
          Johann Kraus, at your service.
          His unearthly voice is velvety and warm. Almost soothing.
          Liz smiles. Hellboy glowers as Kraus' fishbowl head turns
          toward them.

          HELLBOY
          (whispers to manning)
          That's an open face for you...

          48 INT. CONTAINMENT AREA - DAY 48

          Johann pulls out one of the dead, singed Fairies. Hellboy
          and the others gather around him.

          JOHANN
          Poor things, bought and sold on the black
          market. Smuggled in tight, cramped cages.
          Let's see what they can remember-

          HELLBOY
          Memory gets pretty sketchy after you die-
          (nudges Abe)
          -but maybe I can be of help-
          Nudges Abe and starts fishing for an amulet.

          JOHANN
          Oh, no, no- No amulets are required.
          He adjusts the valves at the tips of his fingers and
          approaches the lock.

          HELLBOY
          What are you doing?

          JOHANN
          I can inhabit inanimate things: organic,

          MECHANICAL-

          HELLBOY

          INHABIT-

          

          

          

          

          HELLBOY 2 29

          ABE

          TELEPLASTY-

          JOHANN
          Exactly.
          A PROTOPLASMIC emanation seeps out from his fingertips,
          slightly deflating his body. The tendrils enter the-
          -"Dead" Fairy.

          JOHANN
          I can briefly take control of entities,
          both mechanical and organic and
          reactivate their neural system-
          The "dead" Fairy snarls and bares its teeth at Hellboy. Two
          more do the same from another pen.

          JOHANN (CONT'D)
          (points at Hellboy)
          You scare him-
          The fairy blabbers furiously while glaring at HB.

          HELLBOY
          (leering at it)
          Whaddayawant??? You chewed off the tip of
          my tail- Yes, you-

          JOHANN (CONT'D)
          Rough translation: He says you are rude,
          brutish and not too bright-

          ABE
          Touche.
          More high-pitched jabbering...
          Johann replaces the little fairy in the holding pen.

          JOHANN (CONT'D)
          Enough. it seems our little friend here
          remembers a noise. A very peculiar noise
          in the last place where his cage was
          traded: market sounds-

          (BEAT)
          Troll language-

          LIZ
          The troll market- ?

          

          

          

          

          HELLBOY 2 30

          JOHANN
          Exactly, Miss Sherman.
          The Fairy starts babbling uncontrollably and grows pale and
          weak.

          HELLBOY
          Jeez- your buddy there doesn't look too
          good.

          JOHANN
          I'm losing my grip on its limbic system-
          He feels nauseous. I'm afraid he's about
          to die-

          HELLBOY
          Wow- You have that effect on me too.
          The Fairy's cheekbones hollow and it finally collapses.
          Ectoplasm escapes its body and regroups at Johan's
          fingertips.

          ABE
          How can we find the Troll market??? Its
          location has been a source of speculation
          for centuries

          JOHANN
          Yes, well- Trolls dwell under bridges-
          And Vladimir Vanya 18th century occultist-
          places it under Washington Bridge

          ABE
          We've looked there before-- Staked it out
          for weeks-

          JOHANN
          Yes, but this time I have asked for a
          very special piece of equipment-
          He moves in to a large crate marked "Lot 336"

          ABE
          "336" The schufftein glasses??

          JOHANN
          (smiles knowingly)
          On loan from the Smithsonian. Plus we
          have this clue-
          He produces the sketch of the ROYAL SEAL.

          

          

          

          

          HELLBOY 2 31

          JOHANN
          In my mind we have enough to go by- Any
          questions??
          Abe is about to ask something when, abruptly, Hellboy raises
          his hand-

          JOHANN
          Yes- what is it?

          HELLBOY
          If you're really German- how come you
          don't have a funny accent?

          JOHANN

          (SIGHS)
          Get ready. We are on the move.

          49

          49 INT. GARAGE AREA / DRESSING LOCKER ROOMS

          Hellboy is suiting up. Liz and Abe do the same.

          HELLBOY
          What a moron!! "We are on the move" He
          thinks he's so hot!! We've been looking
          for that place for years and we've never
          found it-
          (looks at Abe)
          You said so-
          Abe pulls out TWO headsets of COMPOSITE GOGGLES, made of
          copper and glass, full of buzzing and whirring pieces. He
          tries it on.

          LIZ
          Get used to it. He might be here for good-

          HELLBOY
          For good?!

          LIZ
          He has a nice voice.

          ABE
          Yes, very commanding, very soothing.

          HELLBOY
          I think he's a jerk.

          ABE
          I like him.

          

          

          

          

          HELLBOY 2 32

          HELLBOY
          Well, then you're a jerk, too. "The
          brains of the operation-" give me a
          break!

          JOHANN
          They head towards the garbage truck. Manning, Abe and
          are waiting there.

          LIZ
          I think you feel threatened...
           Hellboy stays behind- thinking- thinking real hard.

           CUT TO:

          50 EXT. WASHINGTON BRIDGE - NIGHT 50

           The Garbage truck and a few other BPRD vehicles crossthe
          Washington Bridge on the way to CHINATOWN.

          SIGN: WASHINGTON BRIDGE 21.00 HOURS

          51 INT. GARBAGE TRUCK LAB - NIGHT 51

          Hellboy rides in silence- still thinking hard- then.

          HELLBOY
          Ha! Me? Threatened??
          Glaring, at Liz:

          HELLBOY
          By whom? By him??

          LIZ
          Not just him- this whole thing you did.
          The TV- the reporters-

          HELLBOY
          I did that?

          LIZ
          Yes, Red- absolutely. 'Cause you did it
          without thinking- You just wanted to be
          in the public's eye- well- you're there-
          but so are we.

          HELLBOY
          Hey- We got some hate mail.

          (SHRUGS)
          We'll deal with it. Together.

          

          

          

          

          HELLBOY 2 33
          He comes closer to her.

          HELLBOY
          Something else bothering you-?
          Liz nods quietly.

          HELLBOY
          So- Tell me about it-

          LIZ
          I will, but not now- I'm sorry if- I-

          (BEAT)
          I don't like being watched. I never have.
          I feel like a freak only if someone's
          watching me.
          Suddenly: Angry YELLS... then fists pounding the walls and
          fenders.
          The doors open and they are inundated by reporters and TV
          CREWS and cameras and flashes. There are, literally,
          hundreds of them. This time from all over the world: Japan,
          UK, Germany...

          CUT TO:

          52 EXT. WATERFRONT, BROOKLYN BRIDGE - NIGHT 52

          Agents cordon off the street with yellow tape, holding the
          press at bay. As the truck rolls by, hordes of bystanders
          push forward, hoping for a glimpse of Hellboy.
          Some of them chase run alongside the vehicle, carrying
          support/hatred signs.

          MANNING
          May I suggest that tonight you refrain
          from signing autographs.

          HELLBOY
          It's the garbage truck. It makes the
          wrong statement. About who we are.

          MANNING
          You think that's what this is about?
          Transportation???

          

          

          

          

          HELLBOY 2 34

          53 EXT. BROOKLYN BRIDGE - DOCKS - NIGHT 53

          The truck stops near other official vehicles. Overhead, the
          soaring roadbed of the Brooklyn Bridge.
          At the sight of the BPRD team, some protestors throw eggs.
          Hellboy shields Liz from the barrage.

          REPORTER 2
          C'mon- show us your powers-

          ABE
          Oh- No, no, no, it's not a parlor trick.

          REPORTER 1
          What are you, a mermaid??

          ABE
          Oh, goodness, no- I-

          REPORTER 2
          You say you can read things- things about
          people- so read me- c'mon- read me-
          The crowd of reporters and onlookers laughs and applauds.

          REPORTER 2 (CONT'D)
          What do you see?

          ABE
          Very well, if you insist.
          (webbed hand on reporter's chest)
          You... keep... a large, battery-operated
          vibrating egg by your bedside...
          A shrieking CAMERA CREW runs up loaded with video equipment.

          REPORTER
          You! Demon-man! Will you take a DNA test?

          HELLBOY
          It's "Hellboy" not "Demon-man"-
          One of the projectiles hits him. The crowd roars. Hellboy
          gazes back at them- seething.

          JOHANN
          Let me take care of this.
          Johann bravely confronts the news teams and the crowd.

          

          

          

          

          HELLBOY 2 35

          JOHANN (CONT'D)
          Ladies and Gentlemen, my name is Johann
          Kraus and I beg you to allow us-
          (interrupted by catcalls)
          -Please, we need space to work- please-

          WE-
          The REPORTERS bombard him with questions. He signals for
          silence.

          JOHANN (CONT'D)
          In due time- very soon- we will provide
          all the answers you require, all the
          whos, whys and wherefors- But for now-
          An egg hits him in the face- hard. The crowd roars-

          HELLBOY
          Great P.R...
          He gets ready to pummel the crowd. Liz stops him.

          LIZ
          Shh! Give him a chance...

          JOHANN
          -it's been a long... long time... for
          many decades really, that the BPRD has
          served you- all of you... in silence. We
          have waged an unknown war - but a very
          real one. Heroes have died unrewarded and
          unrecognized so that you might go about
          your daily life. To work, to marry, to
          bid your children goodnight.
          Little by little, the crowd grows quiet.

          JOHANN
          In exchange, we have been consigned to
          the lies and racist innuendo of the
          tabloids. And there we have lived without
          complaint - until now.

          54

          54 MONTAGE
          Johann's speech is replayed in broadcast TV VANS, HOMES,

          JOHANN (CONT'D)
          But perhaps soon- after learning of our
          hardships and sacrifices, you may decide
          that our humble lives may, in some way,
          have a value... and a meaning-

          - DOCKS - NIGHT 55

          55 EXT. BROOKLYN BRIDGE

          The camera lights reflect off Johann's glass head.

          JOHANN
          I pray that you will allow us to defend
          your good fortune- to guarantee the
          blessing that is a peaceful night's
          sleep. A night free from monsters and
          nightmares. And if so-
          (chokes back tears)
          If so- then all we ask in return... from
          you... is a little respect and the
          chance, remote as it may be, to prove
          ourselves worthy of a tiny, tiny place in
          this- God's Earth.

          HELLBOY
          (rolls his eyes)
          This is sooo corny-
          A moment of silence ensues--
          Then, the wet-eyed reporters applaud- the crowd applauds-
          Liz applauds, Abe applauds. Hellboy is agog!!

          HELLBOY
          What-?? What-??

          ABE

          (DAZZLED)
          He has a nice voice.
          All business now, Johann steps over to the group.

          JOHANN
          Come on. We have work to do-

          56

          56 EXT. ROOFTOP - NIGHT

          Hellboy, Abe and Johann peer over the cornice of a bowling
          alley rooftop. The CROWDS are visible in the distance.
          Hellboy looks through THE SCHUFFTEN GLASSES.

          

          

          

          

          HELLBOY 2 37

          HELLBOY
          Nothing yet, Sparky, over-

          57

          57 EXT. BOWLING ALLEY PARKING LOT - NIGHT

          The BPRD truck is parked behind the bowling alley, directly
          under the bridge. Its back door is open; Liz and manning are
          at the communications center.

          LIZ
          I read you, Red. Keep looking-
          Manning is bored, looks at his watch.

          MANNING
          Looking at what, for goodness sake-?
          (looks at the Schufften glasses)
          What do these things do-?
          Liz starts locking and unlocking a series of lenses and
          prisms. Both Abe and Johan wear similar gear.

          ABE
          In 1778 Emil Schufften, a Good friend of
          Benjamin Franklin, designed these optical
          sets with the intent of photographing
          fairies in England...

          MANNING
          Let's get out of here- We're never going
          to find it-

          HELLBOY'S VOICE
          Hey- Sparky, I think we got one.
          Manning studies the image on the monitor: a bag lady pushing
          a shopping cart full of cats-

          MANNING
          That? Oh, please, she looks as sweet as
          she can-

          LIZ
          Red, turn on the "antiglamour" filter...
          (to Manning)
          Fairy folk use a spell called "glamour"
          to seem human and nice-

          (BEAT)
          These lenses allow you to see their real
          appearance...

          Bellboy turns a few knobs on the goggles, then raises them.

          59 POV GOGGLES.
          As a series filters enter the visual field, the bag lady
          transforms into an ugly, muscle-bound troll.

          60 INT. GARBAGE TRUCK - SAME


          MANNING
          Oh, dear Lord.

          (PAUSE)
          What about the cats?

          LIZ
          She eats them.

          MANNING
          "She??" That's a "she"?????

          HELLBOY
          We're moving in, Sparky-

          61 BOWLING ALLEY / BACK ALLEY/ UNDER THE BRIDGE 61
          HE, Johann and Abe follow the Bag Lady. She opens a service

          DOOR-

          / SERVICE CORRIDOR. 62

          62 INT. BOWLING ALLEY

          The bag lady goes through the rear of the bowling alley and
          through a basement door. The room RUMBLES with the sound of
          rolling balls and toppling pins.

          HELLBOY

          (WHISPERS)
          Maybe we can bowl a few frames, uh?

          ABE
          (splays his webbed fingers)
          Bowling balls- they give me trouble.

          HELLBOY
          How about a beer, then? Now that we're
          "out"- Whaddya say, Mein Herr?

          

          

          

          

          HELLBOY 2 39

          JOHANN
          Sorry. I don't drink.

          HELLBOY

          SHEESH-

          63 INT. BOWLING ALLEY BASEMENT 63

          Hellboy and Abe enter the basement: no sign of the old
          woman. Just a Warehouse-

          JOHANN'
          Adjust the prisms to "2"
          Abe moves his glasses, Hellboy fumbles his own-
          unsuccessfully.
          Now the WHOLE ROOM transforms under the new optical
          elements: Its geometry remains somewhat unchanged, but
          instead of a pile of boxes a tree trunk and a large, mossy
          rock are visible, where there were iron beams now tree
          trunks and stone columns are visible...

          ABE

          THERE-
          Where a large banner hung, now a huge, rusty mechanical
          lock.

          HELLBOY
          What the heck is that?

          ABE
          A locking mechanism-

          HELLBOY
          Mmh- I'll take care of it-
          He clenches his stone fist, rears back...

          JOHANN
          No- You destroy it. We'll never get in-
          He adjusts the valves at the tips of his fingers and
          approaches the lock.

          HELLBOY
          Ah, of course- the Fishbowl touch-

          JOHANN
          Johann's s ecto-tendrils enter the-

          65 THE LOCK
          Opens and the floor drops away, revealing a stone staircase.
          Johann withdraws his protoplasmic tendrils and closes off
          the valves.

          JOHANN
          Gentlemen: welcome to Troll Market.

          66 INT. TROLL MARKET - NIGHT 66

          Troll Market is a steamy, medieval nightmare. A labyrinth of
          narrow alleys and foetid vapour.
          Trolls scavenge the crumbling, marble shoreline, picking
          through garbage, scattering vermin.
          Muddy water trickles down from above, forming cloudy
          puddles.
          Roaming vendors hawk exotic objects from every culture and
          century.
          At kiosks and shops, Trolls peddle cats (skinned or alive)
          cadres of Lovecraftian entities stroll about: Mer-men,
          Goblins and a few select species unknown to any cosmology.
          A dogfight of sorts is taking place in a small ring. Instead
          of pitbulls, multi-limbed creatures leap at one another
          while violent bettors laugh and shout.
          At the rail, Abe watches in horror, then sees a woman in
          rags making her way through the crowd. He catches a glimpse
          of her slippered feet...
          .which flash with pearls and gold embroidery. His
          curiosity aroused, he follows her.

          67

          67 MARKET STALL
          The woman inspects a pile of ancient bric-a-brac at a market
          stall; her cowl swings aside, briefly revealing her face.
          It's the PRINCESS. In these grotesque surroundings, her
          beauty is transcendent.

          

          

          

          

          HELLBOY 2 41
          Abe is thunderstruck.
          As she turns to leave, they briefly make eye contact. On her
          bandaged arm: a bracelet adorned with the seal's coat of
          arms!

          ABE
          (into microphone)
          Brother Red!!

          HELLBOY

          (INTERCOM)
          Not now, Abe.
          As the Princess disappears into the mob, Abe hurries after
          her.

          68

          68 EXT. SHOP - SAME

          Hellboy and Johann show a picture of a tooth fairy to a
          surly SHOP OWNER.

          SHOP OWNER
          Never seen anything like it. No one sells
          `em down here - over in Jersey, maybe.
          Behind him, there's a faceless CAVE BERSERKER: a tall and
          gnarly ogre, his naked chest crisscrossed with scars, his
          feet encased in iron shoes.
          Growling, it bares its teeth at HE. HB smiles back-

          HELLBOY
          Hiya, Chuck-

           - SAME 69

          69 EXT. TROLL MARKET NARROW PASSAGES

          Abe follows the Princess down an alley - and then another
          one, narrow and dark. Panhandlers pull at his belt; he bats
          them away.

          70

          70 EXT. SHOP - SAME

          Now Johann shows a drawing of the royal seal to the shop
          owner.

          JOHANN
          What about this?? Do you recognize this
          seal?

          

          

          

          

          HELLBOY 2 42
          The shop owner's face suddenly grows pale.

          SHOP OWNER
          You'd better go. Now.

          JOHANN
          Please. We'll make it worth your while.
          The shop owner claps his hands. BERSERKER takes two steps
          forward, ROARING. Its iron shoes go CLOMP-CLOMP!!

          SHOP OWNER (CONT'D)
          He's not friendly-
          Hellboy huffs and walks up to the creature.

          HELLBOY
          Well, neither am I-
          BAMMMM!!!!! With a single uppercut, he sends it flying
          toward the ceiling, shoeless. The shop keeper watches in awe
          until it lands, about thirty feet away in the middle of the
          dogfight.
          The crowd scatters as the mongrel creatures attack the thing
          with blind instinct.
          Hellboy grabs the shop owner by the lapels and pulls him
          close. The shop owner's head rockets back and forth like a
          boxer's speed bag as HB "gently" slaps him around. Teeth fly
          everywhere.

          HELLBOY
          Feeling more chatty now??

          SHOP OWNER
          It's rumors! ... just- No- don't hit me,
          all right? There's talk of a revolt- a
          revolt against the human world-
          Hellboy releases him, then looks around.

          HELLBOY
          Where the hell is Abe??
          He pushes his belt locator-

          

          

          

          

          HELLBOY 2 43
          1.,,,d 71 INT. TROLL MARKET ALLEY MAZE - NIGHT 71
          The Princess has entered a shop selling MAPS and PRINTS. Abe
          stays outside, watching through a window as she negotiates
          to purchase a silver and crystal CYLINDER contained in a
          safety holding case.
          The SALESMAN denies it at first but after the Princess hands
          him a gold bracelet he finally acquiesces while vowing to
          her. He extracts the cylinder from its holding case and
          hands it to her.
          A red locator light flashes on Abe's utility belt.

          HELLBOY

          (INTERCOM)
          Hey, Abe, gimme me your twenty-

          ABE
          I'm following a lead, Red. Keep your
          locator -.
          A large TROLL cuts him off-

          ABE
          Excuse me- What do you think you're
          doing?

          HELLBOY

          (INTERCOM)
          Are you in trouble? Talk to me, Abe.
          Another TROLL comes up behind Abe.

          ABE (CONT'D)
          I don't think you-
          The TROLL opens a small wooden box and extracts a nasty
          looking Insect: A NARCOTIC BUG.

          ABE (CONT'D)
          Oh, my-
          The second TROLL loads the buzzing bug - like a bullet -
          into a blowpipe. Abe turns just as he blows. The bug lands
          on Abe's chest and sinks its stinger deep into his flesh. He
          groans.

          HELLBOY
          Abe? What's wrong?

          

          

          

          

          HELLBOY 2 44
          Abe tears it loose and crushes it underfoot. But his vision
          blurs, he staggers forward and falls, face first, onto the
          cobblestones.

          HELLBOY

          (INTERCOM)
          Abe? Come in - Abe? Dammit -

          72 EXT. SHOP - SAME 72

          The locator's blue light dims; concerned, Hellboy and Johann
          look at each other.
          Seeing his chance, the shop keeper melts away into the
          crowd.

          73 INT. MAP SHOP - LATER 73

          Abe opens his eyes and slowly gets up. He looks around: he's
          surrounded by racks of ancient scrolls and musty books. The
          door is locked. Instinctively he looks for his belt-
          It's not there.

          PRINCESS
          If you are looking for your weapons, my
          guards took them.
          Abe turns to face the Princess, who stands only a few feet
          away. She has cast off her dingy cloak and is radiant in
          fine silk robes.
          She is feeding slices of fruit to a cage of large,
          featherless REPTILE/BIRDS.

          ABE
          I - I carry no weapons, madam- I assure
          you...

          PRINCESS
          Why were you following me?
          Abe is ashamed to realize the real answer. He's utterly
          beguiled by her.

          PRINCESS (CONT'D)
          Are you seeking to join my brother?

          ABE
          Your brother-??

          

          

          

          

          HELLBOY 2 45

          PRINCESS
          In his revolt against the humans?

          ABE
          A revolt? No, no, no, I- You are sorely
          mistaken...
          He takes a step forward but the YRDRIG comes out of nowhere,
          barking and growling.

          PRINCESS
          Then answer me truthfully- Why were you
          following me?

          ABE
          My name is Abe Sapien -

          PRINCESS

          (LAUGHING)
          There is no such name!

          ABE
          Horrible- I know- but- Please, hear me, I
          beg you. I am an agent of the Bureau for
          Paranormal Research and Defense. If we
          can assist you-

          PRINCESS
          Give me your hand.
          Abe complies, thrilled as she runs her fingers over his
          palm.
          The Princess' face brightens. She smiles and gestures for
          the YRDRIG to yield.

          PRINCESS
          Down Yrdrig - he's a friend.
          The YRDRIG jumps on Abe and starts licking him with all
          three tongues.

          PRINCESS (CONT'D)
          Yrdrig's really just a puppy.
          The drooling beast pins Abe to the floor with one paw.

          ABE

          (WHEEZING)
          Nice puppy...

          A
          The YRDRIG lifts Abe with one of its mouths and gives him
          playful shake.

          

          

          

          

          HELLBOY 2 46

          PRINCESS
          My father gave him to me. Yrdrig, leave
          our guest alone-
          The Yrdrig drops Abe onto the floor.

          PRINCESS (CONT'D)
          Out! Out! Bad Yrdrig!
          As the animal skulks away, she helps Abe up-

          PRINCESS (CONT'D)
          (bows her head)
          My name is Princess Nuala.

          ABE
          (bows his head)
          Your highness, the honor is all mine.

          PRINCESS
          May I apologize, Mr. Sapien, for the
          manner in which we brought you here...
          couldn't be too sure.
          She offers him the locator belt.

          ABE
          Please, it was nothing. Love the puppy,

          TOO-

          PRINCESS
          And under diplomatic immunity - may I
          seek asylum??

          ABE
          We would be... honored, I'm sure. But,
          may I ask: from whom do you seek asylum?
          Suddenly, a COMMOTION outside. The door flies off its
          hinges. Hellboy and Johann burst in, leaping over a pile
          fallen guards outside.

          ABE
          Red, no! I'm all right!
          The Princess shrinks back, but Abe motions for calm.

          ABE
          Gentlemen! Some respect, please!
          The Princess looks with dismay at her vanquished bodyguards.
          The NARCOTIC BUGS buzz around HB, who swats them like
          mosquitoes.

          

          

          

          

          HELLBOY 2 47

          PRINCESS
          And that was my royal guard.

          ABE
          Red, apologize at once! We are in the
          presence of... royalty!
          Hellboy's never heard Abe sound like this- giddy as a
          schoolboy.

          JOHANN
          (to Abe)
          You're vouching for her, I take it. Mr
          Sapien?

          ABE
          Oh, most definitely. She's from an
          ancient, noble line -

          JOHANN
          - of warriors. The Children of the Earth.
          (to the Princess)
          I'm sorry, Princess Nuala. With such a
          fierce bloodline, we cannot take your
          claim of allegiance at face value.
          He produces the ANCIENT SEAL.

          74 INT. MAPMAKERS VESTIBULE - LATER 74

          Standing at a long deal table, the Princess lights a candle
          and examines the ancient seal.

          Where did you get this?

          HELLBOY
          Human side, two nights ago-
          The Princess studies their faces.

          PRINCESS
          In ancient times a seal like this was
          delivered to the enemy as a declaration
          of war. A signal from the underground
          realm to the entire world. It prefaced
          the awakening of the Golden Army-
          Johann sits down heavily.

          JOHANN
          I feared as much.

          

          

          

          

          HELLBOY 2 48

          HELLBOY
          (to Johann)
          What-? What-? A goblin army-?
          Johann shakes his glass head, overcome with worry.

          JOHANN
          Golden Army. The unstoppable tide. There
          has been nothing to substantiate such a

          TALE-

          PRINCESS
          Not a tale- At the dawn of time... Even
          before the great flood, man and the
          Children of the Earth shared this
          planet...
          (she sighs)
          But as man in his greed expanded his
          dominion, there ensued a bitter war...

          DISSOLVE:

          75 EXT. MYTHICAL BATTLEFIELD - DUSK 75

          Silhouetted against a crimson sky, the shadows of thousands
          upon thousands of goblins, elves and fairies do battle with
          hordes of men.

          PRINCESS (V.0.) (CONT'D)
          In those days, my people were led by my
          Father, King BALOR, the one-armed king of
          Elfland.
          KING BALOR fights valiantly at the side of his son, the
          tall, pale elf knight: PRINCE NUADA.

          PRINCESS (V. 0.) (CONT'D)
          The bloodshed went on year after year.
          Many lives were lost.
          An overview of the battlefield fades as the sun sinks below
          the horizon.

          76 INT. THRONE ROOM - DAY 76

          Seated in an 'opulent throne room, KING BALOR addresses a
          wretched guild of deformed goblins.

          

          

          

          

          HELLBOY 2 49

          PRINCESS (V.0.)
          It was then that the King ordered the
          Sigri to build him a new, invincible
          army.

          77 INT. BLACKSMITH FURNACES - DUSK 77

          Lit by the fires of a hundred furnaces, stoked by scores of
          goblins, a MECHANICAL ARMY is born. Metal plates and moving
          parts are hammered into shape on enormous anvils and bolted
          onto tall, ornate, golden figures.

          PRINCESS (V.0.)
          This was an army that would not eat,
          drink or grow tired. A heartless,
          ruthless force made of the purest metal,
          mined from the depths of the earth.

          78 INT. COURTYARD, CASTLE - DUSK 78

          In perfect ranks, in eerie unison, the golden soldiers line
          up, filling the entire courtyard, awaiting the King's
          command.

          PRINCESS (V.0.)
          The Sigri worked until the winter moon
          was high in the sky -
          The CHIEF GOBLIN BLACKSMITH displays three curved segments
          of gold. He fits them together and holds a completed CROWN
          directly over the King's head.

          KING
          I am King Balor, leader of the Golden
          Army. Is there anyone here who disputes
          my right???
          Silence. Prince NUADA kneels next to his father. The Goblin
          crowns the King, who lifts his sword. In response-
          TCHANKKKKK!!!! The new army raises its lances, hailing him.

          79 EXT. HUMAN ENCAMPMENT - NIGHTFALL 79

          As the humans make ready for battle, a tremor shakes the
          earth. They turn their gaze to the horizon, which bristles
          with the arms of the approaching troops.

          

          

          

          

          HELLBOY 2 50

          80 EXT. BATTLEFIELD - CONTINUOUS 80

          The fight is brutal. The mechanical soldiers mow down the
          humans by the hundreds, their swords replaced as needed by
          battle axes, bludgeons and lances.

          PRINCESS (V.0.)
          But this army knew no bounds, had no
          remorse, felt no loyalty, engaging in
          blind battle with man, woman or child.
          The horde crushes everything, with swords slicing through
          armor as if it were paper. Every blow is deadly, precise.
          The army marches ever onward, like a grinding machine
          devouring tender flesh.
          At length, there is no sign of life in the human camp.

          PRINCESS (V.0.) (CONT'D)
          And as the king gazed upon the earth
          awash in blood and at the impassive metal
          faces of the army he had created, his
          heart grew heavy. Victory was gained at
          too high a price. This war should never
          have been waged.
          The King surveys the carnage. The mechanical soldiers stand
          in symmetrical ranks awaiting further instructions.

          PRINCESS (V.0.) (CONT'D)
          And so he arranged a truce: the surviving
          men would keep to their cities and we
          children of the Earth would dwell within
          the forests. This pact, he declared,
          would be honored by our sons and the sons
          of their sons until the end of time.
          Listening to his father, Prince Nuada reacts with anguish.

          PRINCESS (V.0.) (CONT'D)
          But my brother did not believe in the
          promises of men. He marched off into
          exile, vowing to return if the Sons of
          the Earth ever needed him.
          Prince Nuada walks away towards a dying sunset.

          81

          81 INT. STORAGE CHAMBER - NIGHT

          The goblins lock the golden army into a huge cavern, under
          the light of ten thousand flickering torches.

          

          

          

          

          HELLBOY 2 51

          PRINCESS (V.0.)
          And the golden army was ordered to lie
          dormant, locked inside the earth itself -
          and there it is to this day, waiting for
          the wearer of the crown to command it
          again.

          82 INT. MAPMAKER'S SHOP - NIGHT 82

          The Princess finishes her tale. Hellboy and Johann look at
          each other.

          HELLBOY
          Where is that crown??

          PRINCESS
          My father had it destroyed. Cut into
          three pieces. One for mankind...
          She holds up her piece of the puzzle, which dangles from a
          chain around her neck.

          PRINCESS
          .Two for the sons of the Earth.

          ABE
          So, you do need our help..?

          PRINCESS
          I'm afraid it's the other way around.
          She holds the CYLINDER she purchased.

          PRINCESS
          The location of the Golden Army is
          contained within this cylinder--
          She opens it and produces a parchment hidden inside. She
          extends it: the map just shows three coordinates.

          ABE
          Just a global chart, Edo - that's the old
          name for Tokyo - Moscow, and Renvyle here-

          PRINCESS
          But nothing else-
          She rolls back the map into the cylinder.

          PRINCESS
          So far, this is a family matter. To
          intervene will bring nothing but trouble.

          

          

          

          

          HELLBOY 2 52

          HELLBOY
          Good, I like trouble.

          83 INT. TROLL MARKET NARROW PASSAGES - NIGHT 83

          The Princess leads the group through the surging, noisy
          crowd of bizarre creatures. Hellboy, Johann and Abe bring up
          the rear.

          PRINCESS
          No- not that way. Too risky-
          They're lost in unfamiliar alleys and byways. Until-

          JOHANN
          (finally, pointing)
          There. Stairs to the street...

          BUT-

          PRINCE
          Hold!
          The Prince appears at the top of the stairs, dressed in
          black. He's surrounded by his elite guard. Stepping to the
          rail, he points at his sister and addresses the crowd:

          PRINCE
          Hear me, o creatures of the forest! Can
          you recognize a traitor? She's here to
          betray her own!
          He casts a disdainful look at Hellboy.

          PRINCE
          I'm here to recruit all of you against
          the humans. Make your decision now. Those
          who join me will be rewarded. The rest...
          will be killed.
          A sudden silence falls over the throng. Then, the sound of
          CRACKING KNUCKLES. Everyone looks at Hellboy, who is
          unclenching his fists and stretching his neck.
          He starts up the stairs, but a couple of the GUARDS leap
          down to block his path.

          HELLBOY
          I'm gonna put this as delicately as I
          can.

          CUT TO:

          

          

          

          

          HELLBOY 2 53

          84

          84 INT. BOWLING ALLEY - SAME

          A crowded BOWLING ALLEY is full of serious-looking players
          in colorful shirts and shoes.
          Someone rolls a ball down the center lane, and as it speeds
          right at the pins...

          BOWLER
          Look out, Manny! Strike city..!
          CRASH! Hellboy erupts from under the floorboards, fighting
          the clawing monsters right behind him!
          As the bowlers freeze in shock, dozens of creatures pour out
          into the human world. Grunting, Hellboy punches his way
          free, only to be dragged back by the tail by WINK.
          Abe, shielding the Princess, demonstrates the way of the
          water, a fluid martial arts display. He ducks and parries
          the blows, leaping like Nureyev.
          Abe scoops up a couple of bowling balls and rolls them at
          the Prince's guards. He manages to knock a couple off their
          feet.
          As they get back up, he uses the available bowling pins as
          clubs. The screaming PATRONS rush for the doors.

          85

          85 EXT. STREET -- CONTINUOUS

          Outside, the civilians flee, but the news crews come
          is back. He
          running. As their lights blaze up, REPORTER 2
          gapes in disgust:
          Hellboy's massive hands are wrapped around the neck of a
          sweet little OLD LADY! He beats her mercilessly!

          OLD LADY
          Help me...! Please, somebody..!

          REPORTER 2
          (to his cameraman)
          Oh, my God!! Oh, my- Roll! Roll on this!

          BELLBOY
          It's not what you think -!

          

          

          

          

          HELLBOY 2 54

          REPORTER
          (pointing at HB)
          He's lost his mind! He's worse than any
          of them..!
          CUT BACK to Hellboy, revealing that the old lady is actually

          WINK.
          Liz runs over with a prism from the SCHUFFTEIN GOGGLES and
          sticks it in front of the camera lens, revealing the truth.
          The reporter checks his monitor.

          REPORTER

          OH-

          86 STREET FIGHT 86
          ALL the BPRD team, including Liz, is swept up in this fight.
          The denizens of the troll market overturn parked cars and
          knock down lamp posts, ROARING with excitement.

          LIZ

          (MUTTERING)
          The fire is not my enemy-- it is a part
          of me--
          Liz yells out a warning... and then throws a barrage of
          flaming bolts. A pair of crab-like THINGS shrivel and burn.
          Johann melds with a heavy steel dumpster, until only his
          legs are visible beneath it. Bending at the waist - SPLAT -
          he brings it down on the head of the nearest creature!
          WINK and HB duke it out for a few beats and then HB finally
          vanquishes the Troll, Ripping his Iron Mace off and throwing
          it away.
          As the other monsters retreat...
          .the PRINCE appears: in his hand a complex mechanical
          GRENADE. Immediately worried, Abe hustles the Princess over
          to the BPRD truck.
          The Prince twists a timer. His bloodied trolls disperse,
          screaming, renewing the panic.

          PRINCE
          (to Hellboy)
          I will find you, young daemon -
          (to Nuala)
          - and you, too, my sister. Meanwhile,
          here's a taste of what lies in store.

          

          

          

          

          HELLBOY 2 55
          He throws the grenade. Hellboy dives, just in time to catch
          it. He's about to throw it down a sewer, when he listens to
          its clockwork innards then: PING!!!!

          HELLBOY
          It's a dud, your royal assness - !
          The Prince has disappeared, along with his horde.

          HELLBOY
          How do you like that? Just when I was
          loosening up.
          Then... CLACKK!!!.
          Hellboy scrutinizes the grenade as it opens up like a
          beans.
          flower... and spews out a handful of Brightly colored

          ABE
          Pick them up!!

          HELLBOY
          Abe. relax- It's jumping beans...
          Abe is scrambling to retrieve them.

          ABE
          Do as I say!
          With a sigh, Hellboy scoops up a few.

          ABE
          How many do you have?

          HELLBOY
          Three, how about you?

          ABE
          Three! There's always seven! Find the
          last one!!!

          TO
          The seventh bean is next to a manhole. It hops closer
          edge...

          ABE
          Quick, it's going for water!
          Hellboy reaches for it... but it's too late. The thing hops
          into the manhole and lands somewhere below with a SPLASH.

          ABE (CONT'D)
          Oh, my God, evacuate the area!

          

          

          

          

          HELLBOY 2 56

          HELLBOY
          Abe, please, get a grip.
          A RUMBLE from below their feet. WHAMMMM!
          A HUGE TREE punches up through the pavement, overturning
          cars, knocking buildings off their foundations and ripping
          up through the Bridge overpass!!
          Picking up speed, the tree branches soar up, up, up... into
          the moonlit clouds.
          Hellboy approaches the massive, trunk, gazing up in
          fascination. Birds and creatures emerge from the inside and
          flutter around, grass overtakes pavement- and for a moment
          Chinatown looks like the Garden of Eden.

          HELLBOY (CONT'D)
          Whoa. Just like the story books.
          Manning and Liz take a few steps into it: a SQUIRREL-BEING
          climbs on Liz's shoulder and a couple of IRIDESCENT
          HUMMINGBIRDS fly around her "ala" SNOW WHITE. A small crowd
          starts wandering into this idyllic scenario.

          LIZ
          This is so beautiful-

          MANNING
          So- perfect- so peaceful-

          HELLBOY
          Hey!!!
          He spots. the prince, at the base of the tree. Knocking on it-

          HELLBOY
          Hey- Jhonny Apleseed- What are you-?? Oh-
          Jeez did you have to do that??
          Liz starts pulling Manning away and yelling at the crowd-

          LIZ
          Back- Go back- right now!!!

          MANNING
          What? What? What is he doing-?

          LIZ
          He's knocking on wood- summoning an

          ELEMENTAL-

          

          

          

          

          HELLBOY 2 57

          MANNING
          An elem-

          LIZ
          A forest spirit that lives in that tree.
          He's releasing it-

          MANNING
          Oh, and is it that bad??
          KKKRRRRCHTCH!!!!! The tree trunk rumbles and shakes under
          some enormous force. Huge LEAVES tumble to the street. Even
          the ever-present NEWS CREWS back away as a huge shape
          descends.
          BOOM!! the trunk rips in two, revealing a curled, dormant

          ELEMENTAL.
          Five stories high- Fierce as nature. THE ELEMENTAL steps out
          of the tree and stares at Hellboy.
          Uttering a weird, guttural SOUND, the Giant raises an arm
          and pulverizes a GASOLINE TRUCK!
          WHUMP- ! Flames leap up! The Elemental grins with delight,
          turning his baleful gaze on the Princess. As she shrinks
          back, her pet Yrdrig rushes at the thing, snarling. In a
          single leap, it sinks its teeth into the Elemental's heel.

          HELLBOY
          Good dog.
          (to Elemental)
          Now, Woody... You want to fight someone,
          you fight with me.
          Hellboy humorously adopts a kung fu pose, as in Bruce Lee.
          The Elemental hops forward, New branches sprout from his
          limbs, shaking the Yrdrig off.

          ABE
          (to the Princess)
          This may not be the best place for you,
          your majesty. With your permission...
          He offers the Princess his arm. She takes it and allows Abe
          to lead her away. A moment later, the Elemental smashes the
          ground where they had been standing!
          Every time the ELEMENTAL moves, he trails behind roots and
          branches. The roots connecting to its feet and leading to
          the original tree trunk, like an umbilical cord.
          Johann sees this-

          

          

          

          

          HELLBOY 2 58

          JOHANN
          I have a plan-
          He looks at Abe-

          87 STANDING AT THE GARBAGE TRUCK 87
          -as the fishman helps the Princess up into the rear of the
          BPRD garbage truck.
          Up front, behind the wheel, Liz starts the engine.

          88 ABANDONED BUILDING

          88
          Hellboy climbs a fire escape as the Elemental's arm/branches
          extend and grow over the ladder, pulling it down below his
          feet. Hellboy ducks into one of the open windows as the
          Elemental tears away the rest of the scaffolding. Growing
          and discarding branches and roots.

          89 INT. ABANDONED BUILDING - CONTINUOUS 89

          Hellboy runs like a cockroach through a dilapidated KITCHEN.
          Behind him, the Elemental's massive BRANCH/FIST crashes
          through the wall, then pursues him as he runs down a
          corridor littered with debris.
          Like a wrecking ball, the Elemental demolishes each section
          of the corridor as Hellboy runs.

          90 EXT. LEDGE - CONTINUOUS 90

          Hellboy steps out onto a ledge ten stories up, just out of
          reach of the Elemental.

          HELLBOY
          (to the Elemental)
          What now, Big Boy? You get a ladder?
          The Elemental jumps up and down, trying to reach him,
          barking in frustration.
          Hellboy's RADIO crackles:

          ABE
          (on the radio)
          HB? This is Blue. The Princess is fine.

          

          

          

          

          HELLBOY 2 59

          HELLBOY
          So what?

          JOHANN
          So, lead him to the bridge.
          Hellboy looks over the buildings and sees the Brooklyn
          Bridge in the distance.

          HELLBOY
          That's nine blocks from here, Fishbowl!

          ABE
          You'll figure it out.

          HELLBOY
          What's at the bridge? Abe - ? Liz?
          Hello???
          No answer. Muttering, Hellboy climbs higher, up a buzzing
          neon sign reading "Hotel".
          The Elemental smashes the letters "tel"... so Hellboy climbs
          the "0" to the roof.

          91 INT. GARBAGE TRUCK - SAME 91

          Liz drives the garbage truck toward the Brooklyn Bridge.
          Johann is sitting next to her.

          92 EXT. ROOFTOP - CONTINUOUS 92

          Hellboy makes a running start and leaps off the building. He
          sails over the alley, reaches for the approaching cornice...
          and almost loses his grip! He hangs on for dear life.
          Behind him, the Elemental appears, climbing onto an adjacent
          roof. As his feet smash through the skylights, the Elemental
          pulls down a WATER TOWER. A wall of water rolls toward
          Hellboy, like an ocean wave!
          Hellboy leaps to the next roof... and the water shoots over
          the edge of the building, cascading onto the street below.

          93 EXT. CONSTRUCTION SITE - SAME 93

          Liz parks the truck near the Brooklyn Bridge. Using
          binoculars, Abe peers out the back doors to see Hellboy
          bringing the Elemental closer.

          

          

          

          

          HELLBOY 2 60

          ABE
          Johann - they're almost here.
          Johann moves among massive construction machinery. He stops
          at a stack of heavy SPOOLS OF CABLE.
          Abe comes running, pointing at the cable.

          ABE
          Yes. I had the very same idea...
          He gets behind the levers and handles of a complex machine
          which holds a half mile of steel cable.

          ABE
          (gazing at the controls)
          .but how do you operate this??

          JOHANN
          If you'll permit me...
          Johann opens his fingers, and plunges both arms deep into
          the mechanism! Instantly, the diesel engine STARTS UP.

          JOHANN
          (to Abe)
          Stand back, Abe.
          A hydraulic strut lifts the spool, then pitches it through
          the air, spinning off 300 yards of cable. It splashes down
          near the far shore of the East River.

          JOHANN
          Now, tie it onto the pontoons on the
          other side.
          (seeing Hellboy coming)
          Quickly, Abe!

          94 IN THE WATER 94
          Abe races down a pier and dives smartly into the dark water.
          Then he surfaces, surging dolphin-like toward the Manhattan
          shore.

          95 BROOKLYN BRIDGE - DOCKS 95
          Hellboy makes it to the bridge... as, behind him, the
          Elemental wades into the river, pushing aside boats and
          barges.

          

          

          

          

          HELLBOY 2 61

          96

          96 IN THE RIVER
          Abe makes it to the other side, surfacing with the cable,
          towing it to a half-submerged pontoon.

          JOHANN (CONT'D)
          (on the radio)
          Macht schnell! Abe - make it fast!
          The cable is a yard short of the anchor point! Abe tugs on

          IT-

          ABE
          I need more!

          JOHANN
          No more available!
          The Elemental's feet stomp through the river; he stumbles as
          he encounters the submerged cable.

          97

          97 UNDERWATER
          Clinging to the cable, Abe is dragged down, down down...
          past rusting cars, oil drums... and a couple of rotting
          CORPSES, their feet in tubs of cement!
          Suddenly, Abe's head strikes a sunken truck, knocking him
          unconscious. Blood seeps from his wound.

          98

          98 AT THE BRIDGE
          As Hellboy climbs one of the bridge towers, he hears someone
          calling out from above:

          PRINCE
          (to Hellboy)
          Haven't you managed to kill it yet? You,
          who were so eager for a fight?
          The Prince is standing on top of the tower. He points at
          Hellboy, then yells at the Elemental.

          PRINCE
          (to the Elemental)
          Over here, dear friend...
          SNATCH! The Elemental plucks Hellboy off a parapet! Hellboy
          wriggles in the massive wooden finger-like appendages.

          

          

          

          

          HELLBOY 2 62
          The Prince walks to the edge of the tower, near a steel
          spire, his coat flapping in the night wind.

          PRINCE
          This might be a good chance for you to
          come to your senses. Help us.

          HELLBOY
          I've been all through this! The answer's
          still no!
          Far below, Johann slips his right arm into the cable,
          bringing it to life, whipping it back and forth, like a
          steel snake!
          The cable forms a huge loop, splashing down near the
          Elemental and tightening around his ankles. The cable

          TENSES-

          JOHANN
          (to Liz)
          Burn the roots!!! Burn them!!i
          He points at the roots trailing into the river. Liz
          concentrates and a bolt of fierce white-hot energy pours out
          of her hands, burning the roots at the Elemental's feet.
          Johann gyrates; the cable responds, whipping up out of the
          river! With a bellow, the Elemental loses his balance; he
          tosses Hellboy high into the air.
          On the way down, Hellboy grabs a support stay and swings
          back and forth like a red monkey. He lands atop of the
          Elemental's back, right behind his head.

          HELLBOY
          Nap time, Big guy-
          He raises his stone fist and hits him straight in the back
          of the neck.
          The cable tenses-
          -The Elemental pitches forward-
          The Prince looks up to see the Elemental falling right at
          him; his mouth opens as if to scream...
          The Elemental goes down, impaling himself on a spire atop
          the bridge... exactly where the Prince had been standing.
          Putting an end, it seems, to both of them.

          

          

          

          

          HELLBOY 2 63
          The Creature dies, but even as it does, its branches embrace
          the steel structure and grow, Ultimately, blocks and blocks
          of the city are now covered in trees and grass and mossy
          leaves... A strangely beatific and precious change.
          Liz runs up, looking out at the river as Abe emerges,
          bleeding, but alive. Abe, Liz and Johann embrace firmly,
          laughing and happy to be together.
          Abe eyes the Princess standing nearby, smiling back at
          him...
          Hellboy meanwhile observes the group from a distance,
          jealous, alone.

          CUT TO:

          99 INT. FIRING RANGE - LATER 99

          BLAM! BLAM! Deafening shots as Hellboy blasts the Samaritan
          again and again at a target in the dark firing range. Hits a
          button, brings the paper close for inspection.
          Result: a very ragged, loose pattern around the bull's eye.
          Suddenly, from the next alley, RAPID GUNFIRE. Johann leans
          over, and to address Hellboy through a cloud of gunsmoke.

          JOHANN
          You'll permit a small criticism? You take
          too much time to aim, to think. Nein.
          Just point- like afinger- as if you wish
          for something.

          HELLBOY
          Oh, I wish for something.
          Johann brings his target close: a beautiful, tight cluster
          of shots, dead center.

          JOHANN
          Speed is of the essence. You must work on
          it. I'm willing to spend some -
          Johann reaches for his loader, accidentally knocks Heliboy's
          onto the floor.

          HELLBOY
          Hey, watch it! You're winding me up, I
          don't like it.

          

          

          

          

          HELLBOY 2 64

          JOHANN
          On the contrary.

          100 INT. LOCKER ROOM - DAY 100

          Hellboy's in the shower, glaring across the room, where
          Johann stands at a mirror, polishing his glass head with a
          terry cloth towel.

          HELLBOY
          You keep wiping that thing like she's
          gonna care.

          JOHANN
          She- Who-??

          HELLBOY
          You know who- She-

          (BEAT)
          She's not gonna care.

          JOHANN
          (long beat)
          You think I'm after Liz, don't you?
          (Hellboy walks out)
          Well, I'm not.

          HELLBOY
          Why not?

          (BEAT)
          Not good enough for you?
          Hellboy wraps a towel around his waist and comes up behind
          Johann.

          HELLBOY
          Well- From now on, you don't come near
          her. You don't talk to her-

          JOHANN
          You forget. I'm part of the team now,
          such interactions are inev-

          HELLBOY
          Well- you better start making them
          "evitable"-

          JOHANN
          That's not a word-

          HELLBOY
          Yes, it is-

          

          

          

          

          HELLBOY 2 65

          JOHANN
          No, it isn't-
          Hellboy raises his stone fist.

          HELLBOY
          Now it is-

          JOHANN
          Oh, I see- you want to punch me- That's
          how you win an argument.

          HELLBOY
          I try.

          JOHANN
          Well, you're big, I'll give you that much-

          HELLBOY
          "Give me???"- You don't give me sh-

          JOHANN
          -and you're strong- but you're slow.

          HELLBOY
          Slo-??

          JOHANN
          Very- slow- I've seen your fighting
          style. Very slow-
          WHAM-! Hellboy cracks Johann over the head with his massive
          fist. To his surprise, the Johann's glass ball cranium
          shatters!

          HELLBOY
          Slow enough for ya-??
          With a loud HISSS, Johann's odd suit sags to the floor!

          HELLBOY
          Ow- Johann... buddy. Sorry- I- I- got
          carried away...
          (leaning over the empty suit)
          Johann? You still hear me?
          An ectoplasmic TENDRIL reaches out from the suit and
          penetrates the closest locker.

          HELLBOY
          It was an accident, okay? I'll get you
          some help-

          

          

          

          

          HELLBOY 2 66
          With a CLANG! -- the bank of lockers comes to life! Metal
          doors smack Hellboy's head repeatedly, like a pinball
          machine! his face imprinted in the metal.

          JOHANN
          See? Speed is the key.
          The vaporous form of Johann's body emerges from the lockers
          and wanders away. The locker room doors open and close as he
          goes by.
          Hellboy tries to stand, wobbles and sits.

          HELLBOY
          Chicken shit!

          101 INT. THE LIBRARY

          Abe floats in his tank, smiling at the Princess, who's at
          one of the book stands, reading to him.

          PRINCESS
          "I sometimes have a queer feeling -
          especially when you are near me, as
          now: it is as if I had a string somewhere
          under my left ribs, tightly and
          inextricably knotted to a similar string
          situated in the corresponding quarter of
          your little frame."

          ABE
          I love this part. Keep going.

          PRINCESS
          "I am afraid that cord of communion will
          be snapt; and then I've a nervous notion
          I should take to bleeding inwardly."
          She closes the book, looking troubled.

          ABE
          Charlotte Bronte died shortly before I
          was born. It would have been a great
          privilege to have known her...

          PRINCESS
          This "Jane Eyre"... I understand it's
          only a story, but such a tie that binds,
          it exists between me and my brother. I
          assure you: my brother, he's not dead-

          How can you know? We all saw-

          PRINCESS
          We are twins. Even now, I can sense his
          presence. This has been our way since we
          were young children, in Renvyle-

          A magical place in the West. A different
          time. Long gone. Now, he's near and he's
          looking for me. I can feel and even
          understand his. hatred for mankind.

          ABE
          Men... usually mean well, I believe that.
          But they need our help and patience.

          PRINCESS
          You were very brave, vouching for me. How
          do you know I'm not the enemy, bringing
          me here?

          ABE
          It's as you were saying, I suppose. From
          intuition, feeling. I've never met anyone
          like you... but that's my instinct.
          They gaze fondly at each other through the glass, as bubbles
          swirl out of Abe's gills.

          Liz is patching Hellboy's injured head. In the background
          the TV's are playing up: CITY LIGHTS, WHITE HEAT and some TV
          programming.

          HELLBOY
          He caught me off-guard- but I'll get him
          next time.
          He's examining a few letters, contract forms, etc.

          LIZ
          There shouldn't be a "next time" we're
          all part of the same team.

          We are- he's not- The guy's an egomaniac.
          You can see right through him.

          (PAUSE)
          That's a joke, Liz.
          Liz remains silent.

          HELLBOY
          (raises a letter)
          Look!! They wanna do a cartoon series,
          based on me? And this:
          (he holds up a box of cereal)
          Product endorsement - breakfast of
          demons. And a videogame!!!
          As CITY LIGHTS ends, Liz lifts the remote to turn the volume
          up.

          LIZ
          Gosh, that was so sweet, so sad- It
          always gets me- Red- There's something I
          need to-

          No, wait.
          (switching to Leno)
          Look that's us-
          Jay is showing some footage from the giant incident.

          LENO
          So- this "Hellboy" what is he?? Is he
          really on our side?? I mean, he's red,
          has a tail and shaves his horns- horns,
          Ladies and Gentleman. Horns are never a
          good sign.

          HELLBOY

          (CHUCKLES)
          Ha- He's funny.

          Maybe we should have him come over and
          talk to us a little, uh? Whaddayathink??

          That's a great idea, don't you think??

          

          

          

          

          HELLBOY 2 69

          LIZ
          No, I don't-

          HELLBOY
          Did you know that during the commercial
          breaks the orchestra keeps playing so the
          guest can't talk to Jay... keeps the
          conversation fresh.

          LIZ
          How do you know these things?

          HELLBOY
          I read it in TV Guide.

          LIZ
          You're really liking this, aren't you?

          HELLBOY
          We should do this-

          LIZ
          It's a bad idea. All of it- Do you really
          need everybody to like you?? What's in it
          for you?? Are we not enough???
          She leaves. Hellboy glances at Leno on TV: a dog outfitted
          in a ballerina costume is jumping around with a red ball
          balanced on its nose. Hellboy chuckles.

          HELLBOY
          That's funny.

          CUT TO:

          103 EXT. BALCONY BPRD - NIGHT 103

          Liz is looking out into Trenton NJ's light landscape. Johann
          approaches her.

          JOHANN
          Are you alright-?
          Liz nods weakly.

          JOHANN
          May I be of assistance??

          LIZ
          Maybe.

          

          

          

          

          HELLBOY 2 70

          JOHANN
          He's a big brute, isn't he??
          Liz chuckles.

          JOHANN
          But he has a good heart. I know it. He
          means well.

          LIZ
          I think I may have made a mistake.

          JOHANN
          In what way, Mein Frau??

          LIZ
          Just a mistake- nothing important.

          (SIGHS)
          But sometimes being with him is not easy-

          JOHANN
          It never is. I know.
          Lis looks at him with renewed interest.

          JOHANN
          I was married once. A long, long time
          ago... And only after I lost her- I
          realized that my life would never be
          quite the same- And my loss lead me to
          become what I am today...
          Johann's human face materializes inside his glass helmet.

          JOHANN
          I- I tried constantly to make contact
          with her-

          DISSOLVE STARTS :

           - SEANCE ROOM - NIGHT 104

          104 FLASHBACK - CIRCA 2001
          Johann's mouth opens and out of it emerges a large tendril
          of ectoplasm. His neck engorges and the substance continues
          to flow freely out of his mouth and fingertips--

          JOHANN
          It was only there- in the Ethereal plane
          that I ever gazed upon her again...
          CAMERA close in on several ceremonial candles burning in the
          room. Their flame illuminating the eerie scene.

          

          

          

          

          HELLBOY 2 71
          Out of the mouths of the other guests, emerge other, equally
          large ectoplasmic shapes.
          They cross to-

          105 THE ETHEREAL PLANE 105
          Once there- they reform into humanoid shapes, vaguely
          reminiscent of their mortal bodies.
          JOHANN floats freely, approaching another humanoid form in
          the void: That of a woman, his wife.

          JOHANN'S VOICE
          But it was there, while he was partially
          on the ethereal plane, that disaster

          STRUCK-
          He is about to embrace his wife's form when a horrible
          rumble occurs and the void bursts in flames, destroying and
          distorting everything around him-
          His wife's shape screams and evaporates.

          106 INT. SEANCE ROOM - NIGHT 106

          BPRD agents break in on the scene. Smoke and flames billow
          in the room, wax puddles stand where the CEREMONIAL CANDLES
          were and seated around the seance table, charred corpses
          hold hands in eternal contact. As the Agents move around a
          pale, vaporous shape emerges from the soot-stained darkness:
          It's Johann.

          JOHANN'S VOICE
          All the seance attendees were
          incinerated. The only survivor -and only
          to some extent- was me- Why? I'll never

          KNOW--
          The form moves towards its body and attempts to climb back
          and reanimate it, but the CHARRED CORPSE is barely amble to
          amble a few steps forward before collapsing into ash and
          bone... The shape of Ectoplasm stands there, alone and lost-
          Then, Professor TREVOR BROOM wanders into the scene and
          approaches the form-

          JOHANN'S VOICE
          It was then that Professor Broom and the
          B.P.R.D. devised a containment suit for
          me. A new body-

          

          

          

          

          HELLBOY 2 72
          CAMERA pulls back to reveal-

          107 BALCONY BPRD - NIGHT 107
          Johann, back in the balcony, talking to Liz.

          JOHANN
          I owe Professor Broom everything that
          I've become. He brought me back to life-
          He grows silent for a brief moment.

          JOHANN
          But I've never been able to see her
          again. My reach became limited- My loss,
          infinite...
          Liz puts her hand on his shoulder. Johann takes it...

          JOHANN
          Loss- the very threat of it makes us
          vulnerable... makes us care- You can see
          that, don't you?? Without her I became
          but an empty shell...
          Liz leans her head on his shoulder.

          JOHANN
          Don't give up on him. Not yet.
          Liz chuckles.

          LIZ
          No. Not yet.
          CAMERA discovers HELLBOY, watching them from behind a glass
          door, a six-pack in his hand. He steps away.

          108 INT. CORRIDOR - LATER 108

          Heliboy walks down a deserted corridor carrying his six
          pack.
          He stops, puzzled. Strains of Barry Manilow are emanating
          from the library.

          109 INT. LIBRARY - CONTINUOUS 109

          Hellboy enters the library and goes over to the tank. Abe is
          there, listening to Vivaldi.

          

          

          

          

          HELLBOY 2 73

          ABE
          Ah, hello Red. You're up late.

          HELLBOY
          Liz and I- we had a fight-

          ABE

          OH-
          Hellboy eyes the CD player.

          HELLBOY
          Did I hear Barry Manilow just now?

          ABE
          (smiles hypocritical)
          Barry M- oh, Gosh- no- no-
          (fast, stammering)
          It was er- urm- Vivaldi. Il cimento
          dell'armonia I believe I particularly
          admire the passage...
          Hellboy hits the eject button on Abe's CD player. The music
          stops and he pulls out a different CD from the changer.

          HELLBOY
          What's happening to you??

          ABE
          Ooh- Ooh-

          (SIGHS)
          All my life I thought I was alone, a made-
          up name and a random pasted on a
          cylinder. But then I saw her- She's like
          me. A creature from another world...
          Alone... Brother Red- I think I'm in
          love.

          HELLBOY
          You say that like it's a good thing.
          (looks at the CD)
          What track?

          ABE

          (ASHAMED)
          Track eight-

          HELLBOY

          (READS)
          Oh, God- you're disgusting-

          ABE
          I know-

          

          

          

          

          HELLBOY 2 74

          HELLBOY
          "Can't smile without you"

          ABE
          I'd cry, but I don't have the glands for
          it..

          (DESPERATE)
          What am I going to do, Red????
          Hellboy sighs and pops a beer, presses play and sighs
          heavily, looks around-

          ABE
          I miss him- Father- don't you??

          HELLBOY

          (NODS)
          Everyday.

          ABE
          He would tell what to do- He would tell
          what's right- what's wrong-

          HELLBOY
          He did that for all of us...
          The opening strings of "Can't Smile Without You."

          ABE
          (sips beer)
          You know? I- I never much appreciated
          Manilow's artistry that much- until now-
          Now it seems to be a grand poet and
          speaks directly to my innermost feelings.

          HELLBOY
          Jeez- You need to get out more-
          The two of them sit there, growing quiet, listening to the
          syrupy music. Then, slowly, the two of them start singing:
          low at first and then at the top of their voices, moved and
          teary-eyed.

          110 INT. PRINCESS ROOM AT BPRD - NIGHT

          The Princess hears the distant music and smiles, but then
          feels a chill down her spine. She shudders and moves to the
          panoramic window and gazes outside, to the woods and the
          distant city lights below...

          The music can be heard at a distance.
          A dark figure stands on a hill, amid the trees, listening
          and watching... CAMERA MOVES IN: the Prince gazes at the
          building.

          112 INT. BPRD CORRIDOR - DAY

          Manning strides down the corridor, followed by the BPRD
          team. All of them dressed in BLACK LEATHER OUTFITS.

          MANNING
          This is a whole new ballgame and I want
          you to take my lead.

          ABE
          I find these leather outfits very

          UNCOMFORTABLE-

          MANNING
          Maybe so, maybe so- but they look- hip.

          (BEAT)
          When it comes to dealing with reporters
          or the public, I set the tone. You all
          know the old saying: the perception is
          the reality.

          HELLBOY
          Correctamundo, chief. For one thing, we
          can ditch the garbage truck, right?

          ABE
          Wait, Red, the lab's in it-

          HELLBOY
          Screw the lab. I want new wheels.

          MANNING

          (SMIRKING)
          You got 'em-
          The round a corner and enter -

          113 INT. BPRD GARAGE - DAY 113

          Three gleaming Hummers await them.

          

          

          

          

          HELLBOY 2 76

          MANNING
          A gift from General Motors. One for each
          of you.
          Each Hummer has custom paint: Hellboy's with scenes of
          Dante's inferno, Liz's with flames and Abe's with an
          underwater vista.

          HELLBOY
          This is more like it!

          LIZ
          I'm not driving that-
          Abe has opened the hood on his Hummer.

          ABE
          This is a most unfortunate vehicle. The
          sheer waste of precious fossil fuels...

          MANNING
          An American custom, it's called product
          placement! What's the harm?

          CUT TO:

          -- DAY 114

          114 EXT. NEW YORK STREET

          A mob of SCREAMING FANS outside the TV studio. The frenzy
          intensifies when they see the Hummers pulling up.
          As the BPRD team exits the cars, autograph seekers break
          through the POLICE LINE and swarm around the heroes.

          MANNING
          Every agent on the field is on the case.
          They will solve it--
          Hellboy signs a color photo of himself with a flourish.

          HELLBOY
          There you go, pal. "To Jason, best
          wishes, Hellboy."

          FAN
          (squints at the signature)
          How am I supposed to read that?

          You don't like it?

          

          

          

          

          HELLBOY 2 77
          Irritated, he scowls at the fan. Manning takes him by the
          elbow and leads him away.

          HELLBOY
          (to the fan)
          That turns up on e-Bay, I'm gonna find
          you, "Jason"...

          115 INT. GREEN ROOM - LATER

          A row of makeup chairs. Manning sits in the first one,
          looking at himself in the mirror.

          MANNING
          Can you do anything about this... uh...
          (lowers his voice)
          -double chin?

          MAKEUP GIRL
          No, you're not being made up.

          MANNING
          Why not?

          MAKEUP GIRL
          They said, you're too normal. You don't
          need anything.

          MANNING
          But- Believe me- I'm not normal at
          all...

          CAMERA MOVES to the next makeup chair, where Makeup Girl
          holds a camelhair brush and stares dubiously at Abe.

          MAKEUP GIRL 2
          So, what color is that- green?

          ABE
          Carribbean Blue, actually.
          CAMERA MOVES to the next makeup chair, where the very sexy
          Makeup Girl 3 gingerly touches Hellboy's chest.

          MAKEUP GIRL 3
          Are these really scars?

          HELLBOY
          Well, yeah. Each one tells a story-
          His grin fades as he sees Johann talking to Liz. He abruptly
          gets up and goes to them.

          

          

          

          

          HELLBOY 2 78

          HELLBOY
          That about you, glass-man? A few squirts
          of Windex?

          JOHANN
          I'm not going on. And if I may- a word of

          ADVICE-
          (long beat, then sotto voce)
          -it's not a good idea to hint that you
          two have... a relationship.

          HELLBOY
          Thanks a bunch. I'll decide that.

          JOHANN
          You don't know how people may react.

          HELLBOY
          It's a love story. They'll lap it up.

          JOHANN
          I know you don't like me, but trust me on
          this one.

          (BEAT)
          I knew your father- he was a friend-
          Hellboy blinks, taking the information in.

          JOHANN
          Do as you may- But know this- he wouldn't
          have approved of your behaviour.
          A P.A. opens the door.

          P.A.
          You're on-!

          JOHANN
          I'll be watching from the truck lab,
          where I belong- Go, enjoy your fifteen
          minutes...

          In the distance- lights, bright lights and the train ROAR!!!
          The Puppeteer readies his merchandise bag and quickly moves
          to the edge of the platform alongside other passengers. The
          lights grow in intensity and the ROAR becomes deafening. But

          the show. The massive Yrdrig is curled up at her feet.

          Wow, So -
          He's pointing at Manning.

          LENO
          .what planet are you from?

          MANNING
          Washington, D.C., Jay. It's hot and
          inhospitable to human life.

          LEND
          Funny.
          (to Liz)
          Why are you just "Liz" and not Fire Girl?

          LIZ
          I was born in Milwaukee, so it was just
          plain old Liz ever since first grade.

          HELLBOY
          Hey, we do call her Sparky now and then.
          A chuckle from the crowd. Hellboy smiles in satisfaction.

          LEND
          (to Abe)
          And you, Abe. Is it uncomfortable at
          night with that toilet seat around your
          neck?
          The Princess smiles as the camera singles out Abe for a
          closeup.

          ABE
          Actually, Mr. Leno, my lungs are more
          like gills. I need to convert the air's
          nitrogen into oxygen, otherwise I'd
          suffocate in five minutes.

          Johann is groaning. This is turning unpleasant. Behind him,
          the map's lights are lightning up non-stop.

          So, Hellboy: what's your favorite food?
          Devil's food cake? Do you have a last
          name?
          More laughter at HB. Liz mortified. She touches HB's hand to
          restrain him. Cameras zoom in on this.

          LENO
          Whoa. What's that- Are you two an item?

          HELLBOY
          Uh... I-

          LENO
          (to Liz)
          Care to comment on that? Sounds like
          you're contemplating marriage!

          LIZ
          (after a big pause)
          You know, Jay, we are- together. We are.
          Rumble of consternation from the audience.

          JOHANN
          Uh oh. Manning, I think your polls just
          tanked.
          He turns to see the map- lit like a christmas tree.

          JOHANN
          Mein Gott-

          Leno smiles at the audience, which is buzzing.

          LENO
          Folks, this is modern America. A guy in
          Rhode Island married his motorcycle!
          What's a little inter-species romance in
          this day and age?

          LIZ:
          Scattered BOOING from the back row. Jay turns back to

          LENO
          Okay, here's what we've really been
          wondering: Is he just like every guy? In
          every respect? I mean, he looks like a
          guy...

          A layer of asbestos might be in order,
          don't you think?
          Liz tenses up in silence. Holds tight to HB's hand.
          Hellboy is ready to explode.

          LIZ
          As a matter of fact, Jay-
          Before she can finish, the production assistant runs out and
          hands a NOTE to Leno, who scans it and grows serious:

          LENO
          We we're getting pre-empted, ladies and
          gentlemen. Please, bare with us. We'll be
          right back-

          ANNOUNCER 1
          This is a news alert. Tokyo is under
          assault - repeat - this city has been
          attacked. Monstrous beings, defying
          description, have waded into the Ginza-
          The jumpy, handheld images are full of digital interference.
          The spectral BEASTS drag down power lines and hurl cars.

          ANNOUNCER I

          ANNOUNCER 2
          This is CNN in Moscow, where a Dragon has
          laid claim to Red Square. Yes- a DRAGON.

          The DRAGON heads towards the TV REPORTER and screeching, it

          CAMERA goes down, then the picture winks out.
          Black screen. The HISS of static...
          PAN off the monitor to Jay Leno, who sits in stunned
          silence, like everyone else. Finally, he looks over at
          Hellboy.

          LENO
          Friends of yours?

          HELLBOY

          (GROWL)
          No -!

          LENO
          Then, may I ask what you're doing here?
          Shouldn't you be out protecting humanity
          instead of hooking up with our women?
          At last, Hellboy explodes. Bellowing, he rips up the desk
          and throws it through the backdrop!

          The Princess snaps off the TV, looking worried.
          Alone with her thoughts, she examines the curved gold piece
          hanging from a chain around her neck. She closes her eyes
          and shudders - trouble is near.
          The Yrdgrig wakes up and whimpers.

          125 INT. BPRD CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS

          Video cameras record the journey of the Princess as she
          makes her way through the nearly-deserted corridors.

          126 TNT. LIBRARY -- CONTINUOUS 126
          A VIDEO surveillance camera in the BPRD library records the
          Princess as she crosses to Abe's tank.

          

          

          

          

          BELLBOY 2 84
          She hides the gold segment within the pages of "Jane Eyre."
          At that moment, the Yrdrig GROWLS -

          PRINCESS
          Shhh, it's all right -
          BOOM-! A jolt shakes the room. A-moment later, a wall
          collapses as warty, heavily muscled ARMS and FINGERS tear at
          the masonry!
          in seconds, a squad of TROLLS pulls itself into view! WINK
          leers at the Princess. From her waistband, she produces a
          long, thin DAGGER and wields it timidly.
          Somewhere in the building, ALARMS start clanging.
          The Yrdrig shakes himself into action and springs.
          With a SNARL, it attaches its several jaws onto the nearest
          trolls. As the fighting creatures crash into the spiral
          staircase, the Princess hears a familiar voice:

          PRINCE
          Hold.
          The Prince steps into the room, carrying a long spear.
          The trolls are on top of the Yrdrig, ready to kill him.

          PRINCE
          Come-!
          The trolls release the Yrdrig and bound over to the Prince.
          The last troll, however, grabs the Yrdrig by the neck and
          brutally twists -!
          The animal's three mouths yelp and cough, fighting for air.

          Where is your sense of shame? You mingle
          with... the liars?

          127 INT. BPRD GARAGE - SAME 127

           ALARMS are ringing as the Hummers pull into the underground
           parking garage. Manning and Hellboy jump out of their
           vehicle and see -

          

          

          

          

          HELLBOY 2 85
          - a couple of dead AGENTS sprawled on the loading dock.

          MANNING
          What in God's name- ?
          Hellboy, Abe, Liz and Johann race past him, disappearing
          into the building. The alarm bells are deafening.

          128 INT. BPRD CORRIDOR 128

          Hellboy leads the way down the corridors, which are alive
          with scrambling personnel. Several BPRD employees are lying
          on the floor, wounded and confused.

          129 INT. LOBBY 129

          The top-level human agents are clustered in the lobby, their
          guns drawn, all of them aiming at the Prince and his
          drooling bodyguards. Standoff.
          As Hellboy and the team arrive, Abe sees the Princess, her
          arms tied. Her brother holds her by the hair.

          ABE
          Princess!
          Without thinking, he darts forward. Instantly, one of the
          trolls swipes at him, its claws just missing his chest-

          HELLBOY
          Abe! No, get back!!
          Abe regains his balance and tries again, his eyes glued to
          the desperate features of the beautiful young woman. Hellboy
          manages to restrain him.

          PRINCESS
          Mr. Sapien, don't! He'll kill you!

          PRINCE
          I'll kill you all, if that's what you
          want.

          HELLBOY
          No. Why don't you just start with me?
          Hellboy strolls up to the Prince.

          PRINCE
          You challenge-me?

          

          

          

          

          HELLBOY 2 86

          HELLBOY
          You bet your ass I do-

          PRINCE
          Your weapon of choice?

          HELLBOY
          (holds up his massive hand)
          Five-fingered Mary.
          In the background, Manning arrives, wide-eyed. Just in time
          to see the Prince hand off his captive to one of the trolls.
          He drops back, flips his spear to horizontal and waits for
          Hellboy's attack.

          130

          130 FIGHT
          Hellboy feints left, goes right and whips around, swinging
          his tail at the Prince. The Prince leaps and jabs with the
          spear, poking a hole in Hellboy's coat.
          The surrounding crowd backs away as the combatants circle
          each other. The Prince is nimble. The Prince is quick. He
          thrusts the spear again and again, driving Hellboy into a
          display case full of antique weapons.
          The glass breaks and a number of swords and axes fall to the
          floor.

          JOHANN
          (to Hellboy)
          Arm yourself! Use the flail!.

          HELLBOY
          Not my style. Watch and learn, fish bowl.
          He punches the Prince, hard. The blow knocks the Prince to
          his knees; as he rises, Hellboy connects with a brutal
          combination.
          In the arms of the troll, the Princess' head rockets back
          and forth, as if struck. A moan of pain escapes from her
          lips.

          ABE
          (seeing this)
          H.B., no! Stop - you mustn't harm him!
          As the Prince totters, Hellboy turns to look at Abe,
          momentarily distracted- Then-

          

          

          

          

          HELLBOY 2 87
          Hellboy grimaces and looks down: the Prince's SPEAR TIP is
          half-buried in his chest...!
          The Prince sneers and gives the spear a savage yank,
          breaking off the blade! Hellboy's eyes roll upward; Liz
          SCREAMS. She and Johann manage to catch Hellboy as he
          collapses.
          The Prince reclaims the Princess and turns to the humans.
          His eyes seek out Abe, who has rushed to Hellboy's side.

          PRINCE
          (showing off the Princess)
          If you want to see her again, you'll give
          me what's rightfully mine. Many people
          died for that crown. Bring it to me.
          He and his trolls escape into the night.

          Stretched out on an operating table, HB is barely conscious.
          Abe, in surgical goggles, probes the wound.
          In CLOSE-UP, Abe's webbed fingers lightly touch the glinting
          metal that protrudes from Hellboy's sternum. The spear tip
          responds, as if alive; it wriggles, producing a GROAN from

          HB.
          Liz is near panic.

          LIZ
          Abe, stop studying! Pull the friggin'
          thing out, why don't you?

          ABE
          Liz, I'm sorry. It's a magical alloy.
          Every time I touch it, it moves closer to
          his heart.

          Come here, I'll show you...
          Liz backs away, shaking her head.

          I cannot reverse the magic- we have to

          help Red.

          LIZ
          Go after that son-of-a-bitch and get him
          to reverse the spell!!

          Johann looks back at a map with LED indicators signaling
          each crisis in the globe. They keep turning on a dozen a
          second.

          JOHANN

          Abe enters the dark, soaking library and surveys the ruins
          of his tank.
          He goes directly to one of the book stands, which lies in
          pieces on the floor. He comes up with his copy of "Jane
          Eyre."
          He opens it to Chapter 23 and finds the gold piece.

          LIZ
          Any luck?
          Liz has come in behind him. Abe quickly palms the precious
          thing in his webbed hand.

          ABE
          No. Sorry.

          LIZ
          It doesn't matter.

          ABE
          No -?

          LIZ
          No. Forget the gold piece. Let's us just
          find this royal asshole.

          (FIERCE)
          Fire and water, me and you, Abe. We'll
          kick his ass.
          Abe looks supremely troubled.

          LIZ
          Abe, let's do this for Red!
          Abe nods, unable to find a good answer. He manages to tuck
          the gold piece into his belt.

          Abe stands at a lectern. Behind him, a projected image of
          the Princess' map from the troll market. His finger traces
          the strange, elvish text.

          The map contained within the cylinder
          seems useless-

          (BEAT)
          Now the case itself proves very useful-
          He moistens the holding cylinder case on a rubber stamp mat
          and imprints the surface pattern on the paper map. Glyphs
          and coordinates become visible.
          A silhouette of a twisted, gnarly tree is visible too.

          ABE
          Renvyle it is- Both the Princess and her
          brother were born there. They hold it
          sacred.

          MANNING
          Even if you're right, we sit tight and
          locate the gold piece, make sure he never
          ever gets his hands on it. If there's any
          truth to this legend, the fate of the
          world depends on it.

          LIZ
          What about Red?? Don't you care about
          him???
          A moment of silence. Nobody knows what to say. Finally:

          JOHANN
          Liz. That may be his destiny. Manning is
          right: we can't take the chance.
          Liz glares at him.

          LIZ
          I see. Red was right about you. Welcome
          to the team, Johann. And goodbye.
          She leaves the room.

          CUT TO:

          137 INT. HB'S ROOM - LATER 137

          Hellboy leans weakly against the doorway to his room. His
          cats purr all around him, oblivious to his pain. He sits by
          the bed. Liz enters the room. He smiles weakly at her-

          

          

          

          

          HELLBOY 2 91

          HELLBOY
          Don't worry, Sparky- It's all going to be

          ALRIGHT-
          Abe stands nearby, in silence. Liz looks at him, teary-eyed.

          ABE
          We'll make it alright. Screw Manning- You
          are right, Liz- We should just do this
          together: the three of us.
          Liz smiles.

          CUT TO:

          138 INT. PLANE - NIGHT 138

          The BPRD airplane sits quietly in its hangar. In the
          passenger compartment, Hellboy climbs up. He looks up to see
          Liz smiling down at him.

          139 INT. COCKPIT - SAME 139

          Abe's sitting in the pilot's seat, leafing through the
          massive airplane manual.

          ABE
          Engine, starting- refer to NA-7488-BD...
          Liz climbs in behind him.

          LIZ
          We stay here much longer, we're gonna get
          caught...

          ABE
          Just a few more minutes. Here's an easy
          way to remember that "port" means "left."
          They each have four-
          A NOISE from the door: it's Johann.

          JOHANN
          Good evening, friends.

          LIZ
          Don't try to stop us, Johann.

          

          

          

          

          HELLBOY 2 92

          JOHANN
          On the contrary. I've been giving it some
          thought, and we should be able to save
          Hellboy. After all, the Prince lacks the
          gold crown. Without it, his army poses no
          threat. None at all.
          Abe is very quiet.

          ABE
          (in despair)
          Its useless- I- I- can't- I can't pilot
          this thing...
          Johann sits down in the co-pilot seat and melds with the
          controls...

          JOHANN
          I'll give it a try-
           Abe smiles at the sound of the engines starting up.

           140

          140 INT. BPRD CORRIDOR - SAME

          Manning bangs on a vending machine in one of the BPRD
          corridors. As a dribble of hot coffee splatters into his
          cup, a couple of AGENTS run up.

          AGENT
          Sir - you'd better come, fast -

          MANNING
          Got it - ow!
          He burns his fingers on the coffee as he hurries after the
          agents.

          141

          141 INT. HANGAR - MOMENTS LATER

          The BPRD airplane is ROARING, amid clouds of exhaust fumes.
          The plane spins around and around in tight circles, its wing
          tips knocking into ladders, lights and shelves.
          A bunch of agents are cowering in the doorway as Manning
          arrives.

          MANNING
          Not ALL of them, it's not possible!

          AGENT
          Isn't that Johann at the controls?

          

          

          

          

          HELLBOY 2 93
          Sure enough, they get a glimpse of the transparent head
          through the cockpit window. Abe's there, too. He raises a
          webbed hand to wave goodbye.
          The plane taxis outside onto the runway...

          142 EXT. RUNWAY - NIGHT 142

          .and takes off, barely under control, just missing the New
          Jersey treetops.

          CUT TO:

          143 UNDERGROUND 143
          The Prince pulls the Princess through fractured, roaring
          tunnels. Here and there, the walls are pierced, allowing
          light and ocean waves to enter.
          Rounding a few corners, the Prince stops near a wall
          decorated with a large, elaborate FRESCO. It shows a
          stylized family tree, hunting scenes and naive renderings of
          trolls, faeries and ogres.

          PRINCE
          Maybe this will help you remember who we
          are, who you are... What our destiny is-
          The Prince pushes his sister through a low doorway, out onto

          A-

          144 LEDGE 144
          -overlooking a vast cavern, big as a stadium, lit by a
          thousand torches. The mechanical ARMY stands knee-deep in
          heaving seawater and foam.

          PRINCE
          They - they - will be mine to command,
          whether you like it or not. Only after
          our victory will you appreciate my
          sacrifice... and yours.

          145 EXT. BPRD PLANE - DAY 145

          The BPRD plane exits a bank of clouds and starts its descent
          upon an Irish island surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean.

          

          

          

          

          HELLBOY 2 94
          Massive granite mountains encircle an impossibly green
          valley.

          146 TNT. BPRD PLANE COCKPIT - DAY 146
          Early sunlight washes over Hellboy's body, who weakly groans
          in Liz's arms.

          HELLBOY
          (to Liz)
          Where are we, Liz..?

          LIZ
          Near the ocean, Red.We'regonna make you
          well here.

          147 EXT.OPEN FIELD,IRELAND - DAY 147


          148 SIGN:REYNVILLE,IRELAND. 148
          The back doors of the cargo plane opens and out come Abe and

          JOHANN-

          149 EXT. GREEN FIELD - DAY 149

          Liz and Abe help Hellboy up to a gnarled TREE, twisted by
          eons of wind.
          Abe unfurls the map and points at a drawing of a similar,
          weird tree.

          ABE
          This should be the portal. By all rights-
          Johann reaches the tree and inspects it carefully.

          JOHANN
          Abe, bring the mapcase over here.
          He's found a roundish SLOT in the tree, where the lowest
          branch joins the trunk. Abe slips the map back into its
          crystal cylinder and holds it alongside: it looks to be a
          perfect fit.

          LIZ
          Yes! Try it, Abe-

          

          

          

          

          HELLBOY 2 95

          JOHANN
          Before you do anything... remember what
          we're in for. A world unlike anything
          we've ever known. Dangerous, deceptive...

          LIZ
          You're wasting time!
          Abe inserts and twists the cylinder.
          The tree comes to life, hauling its roots out of the ground,
          bending them into a swaying arch.

          JOHANN
          Dangerous, deceptive... and hard to
          leave.
           They walk under the tree roots, into...

           150

          150 FAIRY WORLD
          A transformed landscape. A perpetual nightland- Still
          overlooking the same ocean, but now throbbing with pale
          colors and twisted, Rackahm-esque contours.
          The men start down the hill, into a valley bordered by a
          rugged coastline.

          CUT TO:

          151 EXT. INLET - DAY 151

          The team reaches the stony shore of a mile-wide inlet. Abe
          brings out the map.

          ABE
          (pointing to the opposite shore)
          Renvyle is over there.
          They glance up and down the beach, looking for a boat.
          Hellboy blinks and sniffs the air.
          A GOBLIN speaks up from an outcropping of rocks in the
          shallows directly in front of them. By his side, sitting
          atop of a tree: A SATYR and a CROW observe the group.

          GOBLIN
          I bid you welcome, strangers. Would you
          be seeking safe passage to Renvyle?

          

          

          

          

          BELLBOY 2 96

          LIZ
          Yes! Can you help us?

          JOHANN

          (QUIET)
          Careful, Liz.

          SATYR
          I'm sure you can come to an
          understanding!
          The Goblin heaves on an oar and emerges from behind the
          rocks. He's standing in the stern of a sturdy little
          coracle. Its wooden hull is painted in Celtic patterns.

          GOBLIN
          Room enough for all of you!
          (looks at Hellboy)
          Even your weary friend.

          JOHANN
          What will it cost, boatman?
          The Goblin smiles, displaying a disconcerting row of
          triangular teeth.

          GOBLIN
          Ah, next to nothing! Make me an offer.
          Abe, Johann and Liz confer among themselves:

          LIZ
          How much?

          CROW
          He won't want money.

          JOHANN
          (to the goblin)
          I have a... belt!

          OF
          Johann removes his equipment belt, dangling it in front
          the creature's bat-like face.

          GOBLIN
          I have no use for such a thing.
          Liz shows him her binoculars.

          LIZ
          Here... is a wonderful set of eyes, magic
          eyes that will bring the world-

          

          

          

          

          HELLBOY 2 97

          GOBLIN
          I already have binoculars! No, I see
          something special.
          He points toward Hellboy's chest.

          SATYR
          Under his bandage - !
          Quick as a squirrel, the creature hops to Hellboy's side and
          brings out a KNIFE! SWISH! In one sweep of the blade, he
          reveals HB's terrible wound, and the speartip protruding
          from it.

          GOBLIN
          That!
          (points at the steel)
          That - in exchange for your crossing!

          LIZ
          Don't you touch it - !
          She rushes to Hellboy's side, pushing the Goblin back, ready
          for a fight. The Goblin shrugs.

          GOBLIN
          Is it so precious to you? Let me pull it
          out.

          ABE
          You mustn't. One touch can kill him.
          The Goblin's eyes grow wide with understanding.

          GOBLIN
          Ah. I see. We must go to the Angel of

          DEATH-

          CROW
          He'll know what to do.

          152 EXT. INLET - DAY 152

          The tiny boat is a dot on the golden waves of the inlet as
          the Goblin rows them to the opposite shore and docks near a
          cove.
          The Goblin leads the way as Liz, Abe and Johann arrive and
          help Hellboy up.

          

          

          

          

          HELLBOY 2 98
          Strange BIRDS hang upside down form the Cave's roof. A
          MASSIVE CHIMNEY has been carved out of the cave's rock at
          the other end. A Black, ancient figure is hunched there,
          warming its skeletal hands by the fire.
          A raspy voice utters something in an ancient language. The
          Goblin replies, gesturing at Hellboy, who collapses on the
          floor.
          In a deep coma, Hellboy lies on the floor, near the
          crackling fireplace. The ANGEL OF DEATH extends its FOUR
          BLACK WINGS and a thin, jagged smile appears in its pale,
          eyeless face.

          ANGEL OF DEATH
          So. This one... The boy- I remember him
          well! Anung-un-Rama!

          LIZ
          Oh, my God. She knows - ?!

          ANGEL OF DEATH
          I helped bring him into this world - in
          my fashion.
          It pulls a set of a glowing, red-hot TONGS out of the fire.
          It studies the speartip, which has buried itself deep in
          Hellboy's flesh.

          ANGEL OF DEATH (CONT'D)
          I warn you: it is his destiny to rule
          over the destruction of the Earth. Not
          now, not tomorrow - but some day. You are
          sure you want him to live?

          LIZ
          Yes, I say yes-!
          Abe and Johann exchange a silent, worried look.

          ANGEL OF DEATH
          Very well, then- but let it be said: The
          day will come when you will pay the price
          fire girl: This will bring you and the
          world much sorrow.

          LIZ
          And I'll deal with it when that time
          comes. Now save him.
          The creature cackles and then grips the spear tip with the
          tongs. A cry of pain from Hellboy as it withdraws the bloody
          point from his chest.

          

          

          

          

          HELLBOY 2 99
          The ANGEL OF DEATH holds up the speartip and looks at it
          with distaste.

          ANGEL OF DEATH
          Harmless now.
          (looking at Hellboy)
          See - ?
          Hellboy's eyes flutter open.

          ANGEL OF DEATH
          (to Hellboy)
          Sleep now, child. Your strength, it will
          return.
          A guttural HISS from the corner: the Goblin is jumping up
          and down, pointing at the speartip.

          JOHANN
          Our ferry captain - he wants his
          payment...

          ANGEL OF DEATH
          Ach, outside with you!
          She tosses the speartip to the creature, who scoops it up
          and bounds out the door.
          instantly, the goblins and birds leap down and crowd around
          him, chattering in excitement over the latest prize.
          She gazes down at Hellboy, whose yellow eyes are fixed on
          her. He smiles wanly.

          CUT TO:

          153 EXT.. HILLTOP - DAY 153

          Alone on a hilltop, Abe surveys the coastline. Through the
          binoculars, he discerns a SECOND CAVE half-hidden behind
          wild, breaking waves.
          Glancing back at ANGEL OF DEATH's cave, Johann strikes off
          on his own, headed for the cave.

          154 EXT. HUT - DAY 154

          Outside ANGEL OF DEATH's hut, a bandaged HB is sitting up,
          blinking in the sunlight. He sips some tea and gazes at Liz,
          who is happy now.

          

          

          

          

          HELLBOY 2 100

          LIZ
          I almost lost you-
          Hellboy smiles and grabs her hand-

          HELLBOY
          I thought you were mad at me.

          LIZ
          Well, no one can stay mad forever.

          HELLBOY
          I'm sorry for all the attention, I
          thought it would be good for us.

          LIZ
          We're never going to make them all happy,
          Red. What we have is ours and no one

          ELSE'S-

          BELLBOY
          I can turn my back on the world. I don't
          care anymore I don't- as long as you stay
          with me- as long as you think I'm still a
          good man.

          (BEAT )
          Am I a good man, Liz?? Am I??

          LIZ
          Yes you are. You are the best man I've
          ever met.

          HELLBOY
          You still seem sad. Is there anything you
          want to tell me-??

          LIZ
          Yes, there is-

          HELLBOY
          Say it now, then. Whatever it is, I'm
          ready.

          (SIGHS)
          Is it about Johann-

          LIZ
          No- no- what are you talking about??
          Before she can go on, Johann appears. He carries a poultice
          and fresh rags.

          JOHANN
          Abe and I have found the entrance to the
          Golden Army's resting place- Liz come
          with us-
          (looks at Hellboy)
          You should stay behind and get some rest-

          HELLBOY
          And call you in the morning, right?? Like
          Hell I will. I'm keeping an eye on you,

          CUT TO:

          155

          155 EXT. HILLS - DAY

          Johann, Liz and Hellboy follow a rugged trail along a bluff
          high over the sea. Johann refers to the map, then points to
          the cave opening a half-mile ahead. Abe is standing there,

          WAVING-

          JOHANN
          There.
          Abe points at the violent sea below-

          ABE
          The only way in- I'm afraid we'll have to
          jump in-
          (looks at Hellboy)
          Can you make it-?
          Hellboy nods.

          BELLBOY
          Strange. If this is the entrance-

          ABE
          I know- Why isn't there more security??
          With a ROAR, WINK!!!!! - jumps out and throws a CHAIN around
          Bellboy's neck!
          The chain is connected to his IRON MACE which now dangles
          around Hellboy's neck.
          The two creatures battle each other fiercely. WINK's MACE
          destroys a nearby tree, like a wrecking ball and it connects
          twice with Hellboy's head.
          But Red gets the upper hand quickly, snapping the chain in
          two and twirling the mace like a boleador.

          

          

          

          

          HELLBOY 2 102
          He hits Wink again and again-

          HELLBOY
          See?? It hurts!!! It hurts!!!
          Hellboy grips the chain, pulls the creature close, then,
          like a weightlifter, raises him high overhead. With a mighty
          GRUNT, Hellboy tosses him overboard. WINK hits the jagged
          rocks once- twice- thrice-

          HELLBOY
          Ouch- ouch- ouch-
          (looking around)
          We better go swimming before any more
          ugly fellas show up-
          He stares down into the swirling waters and discreetly takes
          his hand to his bandaged side: He's bleeding. The wound has
          re-opened.

          ABE
          Red, are you-?

          HELLBOY
          Don't say a word, Blue- Let's move on-

          156

          156 UNDERWATER
          Johann plunges in from above, his body quickly tumbled by
          the rough seas. A moment later, Liz and Hellboy are in the
          water, too.
          Johann swims down, leading them into the darkness of the
          cave entrance.

          157 INT. CAVE ENTRANCE - SAME 157

          As they bob up for air, they find there's only a few inches
          of breathing room between the sea and the rocky ceiling. Liz
          starts coughing.

          JOHANN
          Hang on, people. I'll be right back.

          158

          158 UNDERWATER
          Johann dives down to find a rusting, iron LOCK six feet
          under the surface. He tries to turn the control wheel, but
          can't make it budge.

          

          

          

          

          BELLBOY 2 103
          Seconds later, Hellboy is at his side, gripping the wheel in
          his huge hands. Using all his strength, Hellboy finally
          manages to turn it.
          His bandage, however, floats free... and his wound opens up,
          emitting a plume of blood.
          Lungs bursting, he shoots to the surface. Johann stays
          behind and swings open the lock, revealing...

          159 A STAIRWELL 159
          .carved from the living rock, leading upward into the
          depths of the cliff.

          CUT TO:

          160 STAIRS - LATER 160
          The trio cautiously climbs the stairs, finding their way
          with light sticks. Hellboy stops to lean against the wall.
          He dabs at his chest with a rag.

          LIZ
          (to Johann)
          Hold up. We need to rest.

          HELLBOY
          Says who? I'm fine, I tell ya.
          He lurches forward, pushing past the others, fighting off
          his pain.

          LIZ
          (to Johann)
          This was a mistake. He's -

          JOHANN
          Mein Gott--
          The stairs lead to-

          161 INT. CAVERN 161

          -a vast underground arena where a thousand torches are
          flickering.
          CAMERA PULLS BACK to reveal rank upon rank of GOLDEN
          SOLDIERS. Immobile. Silent. Waiting.

          

          

          

          

          HELLBOY 2 104

          162 AMONG THE SOLDIERS 162
          Hellboy leads the way down a row of gleaming statues,
          pausing to gaze up at the blank face of one of the
          infantrymen.

          HELLBOY
          Hey, amigo. You got some gum?
          Two rows away, Johann examines the lethal weaponry that
          terminates the arms of each soldier.

          JOHANN
          Most ingenious. A versatile, highly
          mobile killing machine.

          LIZ
          Make that machines, Johann. I see more
          than one.
          Hellboy taps on a soldier's mechanical chest, which booms
          faintly, sending ECHOES up into the dark cavern.

          HELLBOY
          Wow. You hear that? Listen -
          He thumps it, harder. The mechanical thing rocks
          backwards...

          HELLBOY
          Uh oh.
          CRASH!!! The thing falls onto the soldier behind it! Then,

          -
          the ear-shattering noise of a hundred car wrecks builds as
          - a toppling LINE OF SOLDIERS races away like falling
          dominoes!!

          HELLBOY
          Whoops.
          The sound dwindles, then builds again as ANOTHER LINE of
          falling soldiers bears down on them!!
           Liz screams and Hellboy pulls her aside. The soldiers crash
          past them until -
          - the din suddenly stops. The PRINCE stands revealed at the
          head of the column.

          

          

          

          

          HELLBOY 2 105

          PRINCE
          As a boy, they say I enjoyed toy
          soldiers. So do you, I see.
          He strolls past the mechanical figures, pausing to kick
          aside some of the weapons.

          PRINCE
          (to Hellboy)
          You're bleeding. Most unfortunate.
          Hellboy wipes at his oozing chest wound.

          HELLBOY
          Yeah. Now it's your turn.

          PRINCE
          Do you envy these contraptions? They
          never bleed. They feel nothing. Not even
          the zest of combat.
          The Prince circles them, keeping an eye on Johann.

          PRINCE
          These fighting men are the very model of
          patience... merely awaiting word from
          their lawful commander.

          AS
          From his tunic, he brings forth two of the gold segments.
          he fits them together...

          PRINCE
          You have the remaining piece, I presume.

          JOHANN
          We do not -

          PRINCE

          (SURPRISED)
          Then you are most foolish.
          He gestures to some troll GUARDS near a tunnel entrance.
          They lead the Princess out in chains.

          PRINCE (CONT'D)
          You came here expecting what? Mercy?

          JOHANN
          The death you would unleash will never
          happen! What you need is far from here
          and will stay out of your reach forever.

          

          

          

          

          HELLBOY 2 106
          A VOICE reaches their ears from the tunnel entrance behind
          them.

          ABE
          Stop - I have it.
          Abe, dripping wet, stands there, the last gold segment in
          the palm of his hand.

          ABE

          (APPROACHING)
          Here... For her... Take it...

          JOHANN
          Oh, my God. What has he done?
          Keeping his eyes on the Princess, Abe gives the gold piece
          to the Prince.
          Hellboy steps forward, feeling dizzy and betrayed.

          HELLBOY
          Abe -

          ABE
          (to Hellboy)
          You cannot fight him- not without hurting
          her...

          (BEAT )
          What would you do if it was Liz??
          CLICK! The Prince fits the gold parts together and places
          the resulting crown on his head!

          PRINCE
          I am Prince Nuada and I command my army
          to life once more. Does anyone dispute my
          right?
          With the deep sound of gears, ratchets and springs, the army
          comes to life. Up comes the lances and shields.

          PRINCE (CONT'D)
          (points at the team)
          Kill them.
          Abe is now aghast, seeing the Prince drag his sister back.

          ABE
          (to the Prince)
          That was your price!! A ransom, you said -
          paid in good faith!!

          (MORE)

          

          

          

          

           HELLBOY 2 107
          ABE(continued)
           (to Hellboy)
          Why, he lied to us!

          HELLBOY
          Abe old buddy. If we survive this, we
          need to talk.
          The Army swings into action, marching toward them. The four
          friends retreat, soon pressed against one of the walls.

          ABE
          He - he's a cad! Can you imagine, a
          highborn heir to the throne, last in a
          noble line of-

          BELLBOY
          Not now, Abe, okay?
          The first phalanx of golden soldiers is upon them, their
          terrifying weapons slashing in unison. Hellboy brings out
          his huge gun and starts firing as Johann grabs a torch and
          swings it like a club.
          A couple of the mechanical soldiers go down, only to pop
          back onto their feet, new weapons blossoming on their arms.

          LIZ
          Let me -
          Liz summons up a white-hot burst of electrical fire in each
          hand. With a yell, she unleashes a searing EXPLOSION at the
          oncoming fighters.
          The shock wave rolls through the enemy ranks, flattening
          scores of soldiers. For a moment, the BPRD team regains
          hope... but the endless lines of mechanicals keep coming,
          marching on and over their scorched comrades.
          Hellboy holsters the Samaritan and rushes forward, giving it
          his best. His wound is running with fresh blood.
          He punches a soldier, whose mace pounds repeatedly against
          his ravaged chest; as blood spatters his face, Hellboy
          groans and keeps fighting, to absolutely no effect.
          At length, the mechanical arms throw Hellboy against the
          wall, where he collapses, unable to carry on.

          JOHANN
          Invincibility!? So - the only one thing
          may stop them -
          Johann unzips his suit; with a HISSS, his ectoplasmic self
          flows out, into the body of the nearest mechanical soldier!

          

          

          

          

          HELLBOY 2 108
          Instantly, the thing whirls on its companions and starts
          chopping! Bits and pieces of gold machinery fly about as
          Johann rips into the enemy!!
          But again, fresh metal soldiers fill in for the fallen. As
          the BPRD team watches in dismay, Johann's mechanical shell
          is surrounded by the other SOLDIERS, who methodically
          dismember it like marauding insects!
          As the parts drop to the floor, twitching and useless,
          Johann slithers out and re-inhabits his suit.

          JOHANN
          Ach. They are too many. Anyone have
          another idea?
          Hellboy grabs the nearest sword and hauls himself to his
          feet.

          HELLBOY
          (a bellow)
          Prince Nuada: I challenge your right to
          command this army!
          With a soft BOOM, the clockwork troops come to a halt! All
          the mechanical heads turn toward the Prince, who stands on a
          ledge with his sister.

          ABE
          (follows HB)
          No= please- no-
          Hellboy moves away from him.

          HELLBOY
          A challenge must be answered! Raise your
          sword!

          PRINCE
          A challenge from you? A nobody?? You are
          no one.

          PRINCESS
          No!! He is Anung-un-Rma- son of the
          Fallen one- He has the right!
          Her eyes lock with Abe's: there's no other way.
          The Prince sees Hellboy coming and with a bitter smile picks
          up his sword.

          

          

          

          

          HELLBOY 2 10 9

          PRINCE
          Very well.
          (to the BPRD team)
          May his fate show you the cost of pride
          and blindness.
          As the hall rings with their first blows of their swords-

          JOHANN
          Hellboy's too weak-
          Summoning up his last ounce of strength, Hellboy manages to
          drive the Prince back into the center of the arena, where
          they fight under the inscrutable gaze of the golden army.
          Every time Hellboy gets a clean shot at the Prince, Abe
          looks at him, pleading, and HB has no choice but to keep
          parrying off his enemy.
          Hellboy's sword grows heavy in his hands; he stares at it in
          dismay as it trembles. His muscles can no longer respond.
          The Prince is ready to kill him.

          LIZ
          (witness to a nightmare)
          No!! NO! !
          A sudden movement at the ledge, where the Princess steps
          forward and...
          Using her concealed DAGGER, she STABS HERSELF in the right
          arm!! In silent slow motion, she drops the dagger.
          Instantly, the Prince drops his arm... his hands come away
          red with blood. He looks over at his sister.
          They share a hard look of mutual understanding. Love and
          hatred.
          Hellboy raises, through supreme effort, bleeding. He quickly
          raises his sword. The fight resumes, but this time, HB has
          the advantage.
          He fights bravely and after parrying fiercely with the
          Prince, he disarms him and points his sword at his chest.

          HELLBOY
          I- have- won-

          PRINCE
          No. You have not-

          

          

          

          

          HELLBOY 2 110
          He impales himself on HELLBOY's sword. The blade goes
          through his abdomen and protrudes on the other side. Hellboy
          pulls it out, but it's too late. Both the Prince and the
          Princess collapse to the ground, mortally wounded.

          ABE

          (GASPS)

          NO-
          Abe hurries to the Princess. Takes her into his arms,
          blinking in despair.
          The pale young creature is now a ghostly white. She lifts
          her eyes to Abe's, caressing his thin, scaly face.

          PRINCESS
          We'll find each other again, somewhere.
          And she dies in his arms.
          In the center of the arena:

          PRINCE
          (to Hellboy)
          You... think you're any different from
          me? The humans - they will tire of you.
          They will disappoint you. And in the end,
          they will betray you. You... are living a
          lie. Your time will come again. May you
          make a better choice.
          Then, he, too, is dead. Both him and his sister turn to
          fine, pale dust. And the wind carries away the ashes from
          Abe's hands...
          Shaken, Hellboy lifts the crown from the Prince's head.
          Looks at it carefully, as if considering the possibilities.
          Suddenly, he rips it into pieces. As he crushes the first
          segement...
          . an entire division of the golden army collapses into a
          heap of scrap metal!
          Hellboy does the same with a second section of the crown and
          another massive division of the army tumbles into junk!
          HB is about the tear up the last segment of the crown, when
          it explodes in his hands!
          WHUMP! The last of the army disintegrates.
          Hellboy confronts the Prince's frightened troll guards:

          

          

          

          

          HELLBOY 2 111

          HELLBOY
          (to the trolls)
          You - and your kind! Leave here. And stay
          in the shadows - where you belong.
          As the ogres slink back into the tunnels, Liz looks at
          Hellboy. He seems angry, stung by the Prince's last words.

          DISSOLVE:

          163

          163 EXT. HILLS - DAY

          The BPRD team crosses waterfalls and stone bridges, through
          the magical hills.
          Liz walks at Hellboy's side, but he avoids her glance.

          164

          164 EXT. TREE -- DAY

          They reach the strange, twisted tree. Johann takes the map
          cylinder and fits it into the slot.

          JOHANN
          Any last minute requests?

          ABE
          (very quiet)
          Do it, please. I - I'm ready for the real
          world now.
          Johann turns the cylinder. The tree roots form their arch...
          and the BPRD team walks through.

          165

          165 EXT. RENVYLE - DAY

          On the other side of the tree: Manning and a bunch of agents
          have set up spotter scopes and are gazing out over the
          countryside, looking for them.
          Suddenly, the team appears, literally from out of nowhere.

          MANNING

          (STARTLED)
          Whoa! Where'd you come from? We were just-

          BELLBOY
          I know, here to help. Well, I appreciate
          that Manning.

          

          

          

          

          HELLBOY 2 112
          Abe steps past Hellboy and removes his gunbelt and equipment
          pack.

          ABE
          Yes, Mr. Manning. I want to thank you,
          too. For all you've done for us over the
          years.
          He gives his stuff to the astonished agent.

          MANNING
          What? What, exactly is this?

          ABE
          (walking away)
          I quit.
          Hellboy glances at Abe, then hauls out the Samaritan and
          shrugs off his pack, too.

          MANNING
          Come on. You're resigning?

          HELLBOY
          Looks that way, doesn't it?
          Hellboy starts to leave, but spins around and takes his gun
          back.

          HELLBOY (CONT'D)
          I think I'll keep this.
          He finally meets Liz's gaze. She crosses to him and takes
          him by the arm. She walks off with Hellboy and Abe, clinging
          tightly to the big, red daemon.

          Miles down the road, Abe stands on a promontory, staring off
          at the ocean, which blazes with golden reflections.
          Liz and HB sit next to each other on some mossy rocks.

 HIGHLANDER IV WORLD WITHOUT END OVER BLACK, A VOICE: VOICE IN THE DAYS BEFORE MEMORY, THERE WERE THE IMMORTALS. WE WERE WITH YOU THEN, AND WE ARE WITH YOU NOW. SWEEP LOW through CLINGING HIGHLAND MISTS that shroud a land still in its infancy. Cathedral spires of granite. Cradled lakes. A solitary vastness. VOICE (cont'd) WE HAVE BEEN WORSHIPPED AS GODS MISTAKEN FOR DEMONS AND REVILED'AS WITCHES. WE ARE THE SEEDS OF A MILLION LEGENDS BUT OUR TRUE ORIGINS ARE UNKNOWN. WE SIMPLY ARE. ANCIENT CASTLES dot the landscape, whisper of battles long forgotton. VOICE (cont'd) WE ARE DRIVEN BY THE CEASELESS FIGHT TO ENDURE. NO LIMIT, IT IS A BATTLE THAT KNOWS NO BOUNDRY OF TIME OR PLACE. TWO FIGURES clash with broadswords atop the tallest promontory. VOICE (cont'd) TO THE WINNER COMES AN UNKNOWABLE PRIZE. YET AN IMMORTAL CAN FIND NO COMFORT IN VICTORY. MATCH MOVE to the top of an ULTRA-MODERN SKYSCRAPER. Swordsmen continue to battle. VOICE (cont'd) BECAUSE IN THE END, THERE CAN BE ONLY ONE. Loser falls to the other's sword as the HEAVENS CLEAVE in a TITANIC RUPTURE OF SIGHT AND SOUND. Like the birth of a brand new universe. BEGIN/END TITLES: EXT - MANHATTAN, PRESENT-DAY ESTABLISHING - DAWN Teeming millions. Yawning concrete spires. Blare of traffic. EXT - ANTIQUE STORE - DAWN Engraved into a brass plaque: MACLEOD & ELLENSTEIN ANTIQUES (FORMERLY RUSSELL NASH LTD) A FACE reflects in the window glass. It's RACHEL ELLENSTEIN, early 60's now, a graying, maternal beauty. She moves to the front door, reaches out to unlock i.t. It falls open at her touch. Even though the hanging placard is still flipped to "WERE CLOSED" Rachel hesitates. Draws a shallow breath and steps inside. INT - ANTIQUE STORE All those sublime European antiquities now drip with menace. Celtic harp. Scottish targe. Brooding statuary. She moves deeper into the shadowed recesses, flicks on a lamp. Her gaze settles on the one exception to the impeccable order of things. An open wooden case, empty. Just the felt impression of a missing broadsword. RACHEL (icy dread) Connor...? She crosses to the foot of the staircase. Listens. A MUSIC BOX spools a faint, tinny madrigal. She climbs the stairs, padding softly upward. The music grinds EVER LOUDER in its maddening repetitions. Every so often, it's punctuated by a CHILD'S GIGGLE. AT THE SECOND FLOOR LANDING Rachel edges around the corner. Her breath catches in her throat. BEFORE HER stands a locked wooden cabinet. It's been cleaved nearly in half by the BROADSWORD that still juts hilt-first from the base of the splintered front panel. PHOTO ALBUMS and leather-bound DIARIES have been shredded and scattered across the floor-- --except for several selected PHOTOGRAPHS, skewered onto the sword tip like a Medieval message spike. Rachel struggles to breathe. Like she's taken that sword in her own gut. INSIDE THE CABINET A TELEVISION flickers with videotape of GRAINY HOME MOVIES. A LITTLE GIRL (RACHEL) is entranced by a PORCELAIN MUSIC BOX held out by an AGELESS CONNOR MACLEOD. YOUNG RACHEL Let me see, Connor! Let me see! Rachel stands frozen, watching her life with Connor flash by in RAGGED FILM CLIPS. CONNOR teaching RACHEL to ride a horse. CONNOR with RACHEL outside an English boarding school. In a train station. At her college graduation. CONNOR and RACHEL in a laughing embrace that only hints at something deeper. In each new clip, Rachel has aged further. Connor has not. Rachel steps up to the broadsword, wraps both hands around the grip and jerks it clean of the cabinet. THE SKEWERED PHOTOGRAPHS (flutterd to the floor like dead leaves) THE VIDEOTAPE ENDS, CLICKS OFF... and a NEW IMAGE burns itself onto the screen in perfect digital clarity. Rachel. Staring back at herself, terror-stricken. She hadn't even noticed it before now. The tiny CAMCORDER on the shelf above the TV with the glowing red light. MOVE IN ON THE TV as Rachel SLOWLY BACKS AWAY. Keep moving in on the TV until the PIXELS SWIM... THE PHONE RINGS shattering the stillness. The old rotary phone on the little Louis XIV stand. It's not just beckoning her. It's taunting her. Gathering up the photos and hugging them to her breast, Rachel slowly approaches the phone. Any second now, you'd expect it to stop ringing, nobody home. But whoever's on the other end knows better. It keeps right on RINGING. Insistant. Trembling fingers reach out for the receiver. Slowly lift it off the hook. RACHEL Hello? EXTREME CLOSE ON PHONE: A TINY ELECTRIC CLICK is the last thing Rachel hears before-- EXT - ANTIQUE STORE - WIDE --a BLISTERING EXPLOSION blows out the entire second floor. Rachel Ellenstein is obliterated right along with her own treasured history. Linger on the FLAMES as we TRANSITION TO: EXT - SCOTTISH HIGHLANDS (1565) - DAY A MOUND OF BURNING CORPSES They crackle and twist in the fire that feeds off them. It takes a moment to realize they're LIVESTOCK-- oxen, pigs, goats, sheep-- piled like burning refuse. A CRUDE, WOVEN-STRAW HUMAN EFFIGY stands astride the pile, engulfed in flame. BEYOND THE FIRE Connor MacLeod and his young wife, HEATHER, watch from the steps of their simple, isolated home. Connor betrays no emotion. Heather looks on in horror. HEATHER My God, what are they? CONNOR Farm animals. Dead of the plague. HEATHER Why do they torment us with their dead cattle? (no response) Connor...? CONNOR They think I've brought this upon them. It's a warning. A deeper fear now grips Heather. HEATHER A warning?! They drove you from your home! They cut you off from your own people! What else could they want?! Connor turns away from the flaming heap. CONNOR Someone to blame. CUT TO: CONNOR swinging astride his horse. HEATHER (dread) Don't go back there. THUNDER RUMBLES in the distance. CONNOR I have no choice. HEATHER Please-- CONNOR They can't hurt me. And they know it. But they can still hurt the ones I care about. Heather looks off. Shivers. HEATHER I'm afraid. Connor leans forward, takes her face in his hands. CONNOR I love you, Heather. More than anything in this world. She grips his hands. Desperately. CONNOR (cont'd) Do you believe me? HEATHER Yes. CONNOR Then you needn't be afraid. (kisses her) Nothing can ever keep us apart. DISSOLVE TO: EXT - SCOTTISH HIGHLANDS, VARIOUS - DAWN Connor travels a primeval landscape of jagged peaks and fog-shrouded valleys. CONNOR'S VOICE Nothing... CUT TO: EXT - RIDGE ABOVE GLENFINNAN - TWILIGHT He gazes down at the tiny hamlet of Glenfinnan, nestled between castle and shimmering loch. Breathes deep the forgotten smell of home. INT - HUT - EVENING CAIOLIN MACLEOD, ravaged by neglect and despair, strokes her son's face as if confirming his reality. CAIOLIN I thought you might be the water horse come to take me on his back and drown me in the loch. CONNOR (smiles) Maybe I am, Mother. CAIOLIN (touches his hair) Then come, let me grab hold of your golden mane and off we go. Connor lifts her from the tattered bed, spins her around several giddy times and sits her upright in a chair. CONNOR Not before we put some meat on those bones. He rummages through her shelves looking for food. Finds painfully little. CONNOR (cont'd) No one comes to look after you? CAIOLIN They're all afraid of me. They think I bedevil their children because I've lost my own. CONNOR I'm sorry. I'm so sorry... CAIOLIN Tiny minds and sour dispositions. I don't need them, Connor. Any of them. Connor crouches at her feet. CONNOR Then it's settled. You're coming with me. There's somebody I want you to meet. She's nearly as beautiful as you. Caiolin blinks back her disbelief. CAIOLIN You're sure? CONNOR (cont'd) We leave tonight. Let's start packing. CAIOLIN (lifts up her shoes) I'm already packed. THE SLATTED WOODEN DOOR swings OPEN. A YOUNG MAN stands in the doorway. He's strong and severe, dressed in clergyman's black. But that's not what draws the eye. Even though it's cold enough to fog his breath-- he's sweatinq. Connor looks up, guarded. CONNOR Jacob-- KASE You shouldna come back, Connor. Connor feels the tension in Kase's voice. CONNOR Surely as a friend you can look the other way just this once... For old times' sake... KASE You knew. You knew what would happen if you came back. I am not to blame for this. CONNOR What? (beat) What have you done? KASE God help you. FATHER ALASDAIR RAINEY, the local priest and inquisitor, steps inside, bent over a silver cane. He's gross, corpulent and perpetually short of breath. A nasty NOSE BOIL figures prominently in his overall appearance. VILLAGERS of varying stripe crowd nervously behind them. FATHER RAINEY In the name of the Holy See and the rule of law, you are hereby charged, Connor MacLeod, with heresy and the practice of black magic. (turns to the villagers) Take him. The townsmen jostle in place, each trying to squeeze backward behind the other. FATHER RAINEY (cont'd) (squints) Heresy is not contagious. Two of the bolder men move forward, gripping Connor by the elbows. Once its clear they haven't sucked up any demons, the others SWARM HIM. EXT - STONE HUT - NIGHT Caiolin SCREAMS as Connor's dragged outside and driven to the ground by a relentless battery of sticks and clubs. CUT TO: INT - STONE CELL - NIGHT Connor stirs awake in a centuries-old dungeon, a dark hole, crumbling and damp. VOICES seem to drip through the porous mortar. Taunting, vengeful, expectant. He crosses to the barred window that affords him a narrow, ground-level view of THE TOWN COMMONS where a well-attended EXECUTION is now underway. Connor squints, craning to make out the identity of the condemned. TOWNSPEOPLE mingle and mill in front of him, obstructing his line-of-sight. Even as A FAMILIAR VOICE rises above the surrounding chatter. JACOB KASE'S VOICE The curse that afflicts one generation will invariably pass its mark onto the next. The ties of blood cannot be severed by word or deed, if in fact your blood is that of your son. Several villagers STEP ASIDE to reveal: CONNOR'S MOTHER bound to an UPRIGHT STAKE atop a mound of shorn timber. CONNOR siezes with the impossible horror of recognition. CONNOR No.. . NO! ! JACOB KASE Makes the sign of the cross as he reads from a writ of execution. He stands atop a primeval CELTIC MONOLITH worn down to the form of a pedestal. Father Rainey wobbles behind him, sniffing ammonia to spell his chronic angina. KASE Through the infinite compassion of our Lord God, you are entitled one final opportunity to renounce all that is unholy, to declare Connor MacLeod not of your loins and help put an end to the darkness that has been cast upon this land. How say you, Caiolin MacLeod? Caiolin lifts her head, pale and beatific. CAIOLIN If your god should persecute me into the next world, then I shall simply have to find myself another. Shocked murmers of outrage shudder through the crowd. Kase steps up and RIPS AWAY Caiolin's cherished silver CRUCIFIX, with its distinctive wooden Christ figure. KASE (holding up Caiolin's crucifix) You won't need this where you're going. CONNOR grabs at the iron window-bars. Shakes them until the mortar chips from their moorings. THE RUDDY-FACED EXECUTIONER solemnly approaches Caiolin. Unseen by the bloodlusting crowd, he takes out a small leather sack and drapes it around her neck by the drawstring. He tucks it under her coarse woolen robe and pats it flush against her chest. EXECUTIONER (softly) Black powder. It will make short work of your suffering. Caiolin nods. He steps down off the pyre. Reaches for a BURNING TORCH. CONNOR strains against the bars like a madman. Mortar continues crumbling until one bar actually RIPS AWAY COMPLETELY. THE EXECUTIONER touches torch to kindling. It ALIGHTS. CONNOR tries to squeeze through the window gap. Too tight. So he winds back with the iron bar and swings with mindless fury. Iron strikes unyielding stone, SPARKING and CHIPPING... THE PYRE BENEATH CAIOLIN ENGULFS IN FLAME. Heat ripples her face, distorts her body. CONNOR hammers harder, quicker, louder. Bits of stone fly everywhere. But the bulk of it remains spitefully intact. Still, it's enough to convince ALL FOUR GUARDS to intervene. They throw open the heavy iron door and descend upon Connor with swords and axes. >Wielding the iron bar like a battle mace, Connor splits the first guard's head, catches his sword mid-air and slices into the next. Third guard's axe catches on a ceiling beam. Connor runs him through like an overstuffed feedsack. The fourth guard drops his sword and BOLTS. THE PYRE is now fully ABLAZE. Caiolin looks out through the rippling wall of flame... . . . and smiles weakly. CAIOLIN My water horse... AS CONNOR splits the crowd like a battering ram. He reaches the pyre, hurling flaming timbers aside with his bare hands. Initially stunned, the townsfolk shrink back, watching Connor desperately scatter the fire. Caiolin buries her face in her shoulder, biting back the agony as... Sword in hand, Connor stretches upward, hacking away the ropes that bind her, oblivious to the fire now crawling in serpentine coils around his own arms and legs. Freed of the ropes, Caiolin begins to slump forward. Connor grabs for her arm as THE BLACK POWDER EXPLODES in a CONCUSSION of FIRE that renders any further hope of rescue futile. Connor stands atop the burning pyre, wicked tongues of flame leaping off his back and shoulders like fiery wings. He throws back his head and HOWLS to the heavens. Fire dances across Connor's skin and clothing as he raises his broadsword and steps down into the crowd. PANDEMONIUM breaks out. This isn't just a common witch. This is one of Hell's very own. Those few foolish enough to attack are cut down where they stand. The rest scatter in mindless PANIC. Father Rainey blocks Connor's path. Lifts his cross... . . . as he's CUT DOWN by the blind SLASH of Connor's sword. Connor steps over Rainey's body and keeps coming, driving the mob fleeing into their dwellings. Kase crouches blustering over Rainey. KASE Father... Father, please-- (tries to staunch the bleeding) Father--! Rainey's eyes open slightly. RAINEY Who are you...? KASE Your son. It's your son-- Jacob. Rainey stares back as if a veil has suddenly been lifted. And what he now sees terrifies him to death. RAINEY (eyes widen) Who are YOU? KASE I'm your-- He stops. Rainey's eyes are frozen. Dead. CONNOR returns to the flaming pyre, refueling his rage with the sight of his mother's blackened corpse. >KASE scoops up a discarded sword, leaps to his feet and CHARGES CONNOR, bellowing like a madman. >Connor whirls around with his sword, making Kase IMPALE HIMSELF on the blade. Kase stares wide-eyed and gagging at Connor's smoldering visage-- the depthless black pools of hate that shroud his eyes. It's the last thing Jacob Kase will ever see. Connor opens his fingers and lets him DROP, the sword hilt still jutting from Kase's chest. Gathering up several chunks of flaming timber, Connor HEAVES them onto the straw-covered rooftops, setting them instantly ABLAZE. In short order, the village is transformed into a giant swirling INFERNO. Silhouetted against the crimson sky, Connor lifts Caiolin's body and turns his back on Glenfinnan for the last time. DISSOLVE TO: EXT - ANCIENT STONE MONASTERY - NIGHT Standing outside the massive door is a MONK clad in dark, hooded monastic garb. Nothing in the panorama would suggest we've just jumped four centuries into an uncertain future... Until-- A PACK OF MOTORCYCLISTS chew their way up the rubbled slope. Fishtail to a stop. THE LEADER, a tall eclectically-dressed Jamaican, dismounts and approaches the hooded monk. JAMAICAN You people are extremely hard to find. Monk unshoulders a PUMP-ACTION SHOTGUN. HOODED MONK We like it that way. (pumps shotgun) Now go. The other six INTRUDERS surround the monk. His eyes flick from one to the next-- a buffet of different nationalities, all big. JAMAICAN Take your pick. Before you squeeze the trigger a second time, you'll be dead. Easy choice. Monk levels his gun and BLOWS the Jamaican right off his feet. And sure enough, he GAGS before his next trigger-pull. A very nasty SERRATED BLADE retracts into a wooden hilt. Monk drops in a heap as his assailant, a WIRY ASIAN, turns for the door, joined by the others. IN THE VERY NEXT INSTANT the heavy oak-and-iron door SWINGS OPEN with a BARRAGE of AUTOMATIC GUNFIRE-- The intruders are CUT DOWN where they stand. THREE MORE HOODED MONKS appear in the doorway, wielding ASSAULT RIFLES. They grimly regard the bodies. MONK #1 Take the heads. Just in case. Saws and cleavers are pulled by the other two guards while Guard #l keeps his gun trained on the corpses. VOICE Don't bother. Really. A FIGURE stands in shadow, his face UNSEEN. We catch only a brief glimpse of a PRIESTS COLLAR. Guard #l whips his rifle toward the Stranger. Stranger diverts it with the tip of his sword. Bullets go nowhere. One slash and the guard is gone. Two more slashes and his comrades fall. Stranger kicks the body of the dead Jamaican as he steps through the open doorway. STRANGER Dont be long. INT - MONASTERY - NIGHT FOLLOW THE STRANGER through a maze of chambers and DOWN into serpentine catacombs. He KICKS THROUGH a DOOR into AN INNER ROOM cavernous and dripping, where even the air seems septic. A few dim candles illuminate A DOZEN MEN bound to complicated, almost Giger-esque chairs. Arms, legs and faces have been immobilized by crossing flats of metal BOLTED into flesh and wood. From the wild overgrowth of hair and beard, and the impossibly long, curled fingernails, it's a good guess none of them have moved a muscle in years. Except for a pale CUSTODIAN standing in a corner, trembling silently. Stranger stands at the threshold, his face obscured by flickering shadows. He scans the living corpses. STRANGER So it's true. He moves slowly among them. STRANGER (cont'd) What sacrifices they made of you all. Warehoused, like rotting pieces of meat. He pauses to lift up a downcast head. Gazes into the shackled face. The eyes are covered by strips of rusted iron, the face by tangled beard. STRANGER (cont'd) Tell me-- is this the better way? I'm sure you've had some time to reflect on it. One by one, THE RECENTLY-DEAD INTRUDERS filter into the room, led by the Jamaican. Blood stipples their clothes, streaks their faces. But they are, in every other sense, fully-restored. Stranger straightens, swivels around to the terrified Custodian. Custodian backpeddles into the wall. STRANGER Which one is Connor MacLeod? CUSTODIAN I-- I don't know... They never told me names... STRANGER (low, seething) Don't. Lie. To. Me. CUSTODIAN I swear. I don't know... Stranger grabs him under the chin, lifts him to his toes. STRANGER You need to understand one thing, my gimpy friend. I don't care about the Game. I don't care about the rules. I don't even care about these other pathetic souls you lock away as a barrier to the Prize. The Custodian stares back, uncomprehending. STRANGER (cont'd) (squeezes his throat) I want Connor MacLeod. Give me MacLeod and I'll leave. And you can go right on pretending that what you do here actually matters. The custodian lifts a shaking finger. RACK FOCUS TO: THE PRISONER IN THE LAST CHAIR Even with an iron slat across his eyes, he is unmistakably Connor MacLeod. Stranger lets go of the custodian, turns... STRANGER Long time. Connor strains to lift his head. His voice comes weak and drug-heavy. CONNOR Who are you...? STRANGER You'll know soon enough. GLINT OF A SWUNG BLADE-- CUT TO: EXT - MONASTERY - NIGHT An unearthly LIGHT pulses through slitted windows and cracked mortar. TENDRILS of RAW ENERGY vein the ancient building, growing BRIGHTER until-- THE WINDOWS EXPLODE OUTWARD with a keening, animal-like HOWL. ABOVE the sky responds with SCREAMING WIND and TORRENTS of RAIN. CUT TO: EXT - PARIS - NIGHT WIND HOWLS over the City of Lights, slicing up the Seine to. . . DUNCAN MACLEOD'S BARGE docked at the quay. EXT - BARGE - NIGHT PUSH IN on DUNCAN MACLEOD, cross-legged in meditation atop the deck. He JOLTS from a series of SUDDEN VIOLENT IMAGES. A FACE, bolted immobile, wrenched in agony. A SWORDBLADE slashing into flesh. FINGERNAILS clawing wood. BLOOD flecking tile. ESSENCE. PHONE. Ringing. Duncan snaps up the receiver, sweat drenched. DUNCAN Yeah? Tiny electric CLICK... . . . then the HISS of an overseas line. WOMAN'S VOICE (filtered) He's dead. DUNCAN Who? CUT TO: A PAYPHONE, SOMEWHERE IN LOWER MANHATTAN In a driving RAIN. A woman's hand holds the receiver to her face, obscuring her features. WOMAN Connor MacLeod. He was killed last night. INT - DUNCAN'S BARGE Duncan reels with a sudden flood of emotions. DUNCAN Who is this?! WOMAN'S VOICE A friend. EXT - PAYPHONE The unidentified woman slowly lowers the receiver and sets it back in the cradle. CUT TO: EXT - PARIS, ESTABLISHING, SUNRISE Shadows crawl across the Parisian skyline as an ENGINE REVS TO 8000 RPM. STREET LEVEL POV: We PUNCH through the ARC DE TRIOMPHE and up the CHAMPS ELYSEE with a throaty FERARRI HOWL. On a WICKED DOWNSHIFT, we SQUEAL HARD RIGHT onto the PONT NEUF, stopping on a franc at EXT - NOTRE DAME CATHEDRAL - DAY Duncan hops out of his Ferrari 355 Spyder, pauses before the massive Gothic edifice, then disappears inside. CLOSE ON A CROUCHING STONE GARGOYLE perched atop the highest balustrade. MOVE SIDEWAYS TO REVEAL A SECOND CROUCHING FIGURE, this one human. To many he'll be instantly familiar. Hes METHOS, oldest of all Immortals, gazing down in quiet contemplation. Methos keeps staring at the ground below, sipping bordeaux from a paper cup, even as Duncan joins him at the edge. DUNCAN Methos. METHOS so-- What brings you up here to the aerie of the lesser gods? DUNCAN I need your help. METHOS I'm out of the help business. No future in it. DUNCAN I was told Connor MacLeod was killed last night. Methos' darkens. Another one lost. DUNCAN (cont'd) I just want to know who did it. METHOS (sighs) In our world, does it really matter? DUNCAN It does to me. Methos looks down at the clotted life below. METHOS Did I ever tell you I once kept a vineyard on the very spot where they built this monstrosity? Glorious, the wine. (looks up) When did you see him last? DUNCAN Almost ten years ago. METHOS What did you talk about? DUNCAN Nothing much. METHOS Think back. FLASH TO: INT - PUB (FROM HIGHLANDER 1) - DAY Connor and Duncan hunch over the bar, pounding scotch. DUNCAN We mostly just sat around, downing shots, staring at the beer lights above the bar. When he finally got up to go, he looked at me like it was the last time I'd ever see him again. No goodbye. No handshake. Just got up and left. BACK TO SCENE: Duncan blinks back the memory. DUNCAN (cont'd) Nobody's seen him since. METHOS Describe the look. DUNCAN What do you mean? METHOS Describe it. DUNCAN It was like... FLASH: CONNOR'S FACE DUNCAN (cont'd) . . . Like every death he'd ever caused had come back to haunt him. BACK TO SCENE: Methos takes a thoughtful sip from his wine. METHOS For an Immortal who comes to abhor bloodshed, there's a solution-- a way to be removed from the Game forever. The price is unimaginably high, but you are, for all practical purposes, protected from the violence within yourself. It's called The Sanctuary. DUNCAN I don't understand. METHOS Think of those Buddhist monks who came to cherish life so much that to step on a single insect, to harm a blade of grass was a violation of their creed. They placed themselves into an extreme form of protective custody. A sanctuary of sorts. (beat) What I'm talking about is something similar. But one that doesn't allow for a change of heart. He opens his fingers and watches his cup plummet to the plaza below. Wine SPLATTERS like blood on white marble. METHOS (cont'd) Apparently it was wiped out last night. DUNCAN By who? METHOS I don't know. EXT - ABOVE THE ATLANTIC - DAY A 747 cruises at 40,000 feet. METHOS (O.S.) He left no witnesses. INT - 747 - DAY Duncan stares out the passenger window as the FLIGHT ATTENDANT sets a DRINK down. He lifts the little plastic COCKTAIL SWORD from the glass. Yanks it out of the olive... TRANSITION TO: A BROADSWORD being jerked from a fallen warrior. EXT - 17TH CENTURY BATTLEFIELD - DAWN FOLLOW THE SWORD swinging above a PAIR OF HIDE-BOOTED FEET that tramp across uneven ground littered with CORPSES. FEET STOP at a BLOOD-CAKED BODY, swathed in the shredded colors of a defeated army. On a SWIFT KICK TO THE RIBCAGE-- DUNCAN MACLEOD JERKS UPRIGHT, flailing in spastic fits. DUNCAN GAHHHHHHH! ! He blinks thickly, as if routed from a deep, disorienting slumber. Gapes up at-- A SILHOUETTE that ECLIPSES the rising sun. SILHOUETTE You've better things to do than lie there collecting flies. Duncan puts a hand to his chest, touches the worst of his several lethal wounds. Utter confusion stitches his face. SILHOUETTE (cont'd) I suppose you're wondering how a knock- kneed swordsman with your obvious lack of skill keeps living to fight another day. The figure extends a hand to Duncan. Duncan hesitantly reaches up... DUNCAN (squints) Are you an angel? SILHOUETTE I've been called that. And worse. Duncans hand RECOILS-- SILHOUETTE (cont'd) Rest assured, I'm neither. He hoists Duncan to his feet. Duncan gazes for the first time ever upon the face of CONNOR MACLEOD who smiles back with the gift of untold secrets. CONNOR I'm Connor MacLeod of the Clan MacLeod. And like you, I have a hard time dying. TRANSITION BACK TO: INT - 747 - DAY Duncan's now sitting upright in his seat as the FLIGHT ATTENDANT'S VOICE brings him back to the here and now. FLIGHT ATTENDANT (O.S.) We'll be making our final descent into New York... WHEELS SMACK down onto the runway at JFK. CUT TO: A PHOTOGRAPH OF DUNCAN PULL BACK and see it's his passport, held by a US CUSTOMS OFFICER. He lowers the passport and turns to the long metal case Duncan's brought with him from the plane. CUSTOMS OFFICER Would you open the case, please? Duncan hands the Officer documentation as he sets it on the counter and opens it. Inside is an old, meticulously cared-for Japanese KATANA SWORD. Customs Officer studies Duncan's paperwork, smiles. CUSTOMS OFFICER (cont'd) Get much use for this? DUNCAN You'd be surprised. Duncan shuts the case and continues on. Next MAN in line watches Duncan exit as he hands over his passport. Hang on the PHOTO. We'll remember those steel- gray eyes. INT - CAB, DRIVING - DAY Duncan watches the passing scenery. MUSIC and LANDMARKS familiar from the first "Highlander" sweep past. EXT - NEW YORK SIDE-STREET - DAY Cab WIPES FRAME, leaving Duncan standing before the charred husk of Connor's antique store. Windows boarded, shreds of flapping police tape, the investigators have long since come and gone. INT - ANTIQUE STORE Door SPLINTERS OPEN. Duncan steps inside. In the aftermath of the firebombing, nothing has been spared. Rachel and Connor's richly-cultivated collection has been reduced to a bitter moonscape. One can only shudder at the degree of overkill that went into this attack. Duncan climbs the back stairs to THE SECOND FLOOR LOFT which is even worse. Ash and cinder are virtually all that remain of Connor's home. Pausing at the far wall, Duncan yanks down an old charred tapestry, revealing AN INNER DOOR deliberately hidden from view. He dips down, retrieves a key from under a loose floorboard and opens the heavily- reinforced door. ENTERING he finds himself in a LARGE CIRCULAR ROOM surrounded by a staggering display of ARTIFACTS drawn from centuries of personal history. We're looking at the sum total of Connor MacLeod's existance, stacked floor to ceiling. Duncan moves among the mementos, smiles as he lifts them; an old Scottish coin, pocket flask... a faded PHOTO of himself in a World War I uniform. He pauses at a painting of Connor's wife HEATHER, radiant in simple peasant garb, smiling serenely across the ages. Finally, a tarnished epee that he wields with instant familiarity. TRANSITION TO: INT - FENCING ACADEMY, RAVENNA ITALY (1627) - DAY Duncan's LUNGE misses Connor by a mile. He stumbles upright in a grand hall streaked by SUNLIGHT from floor- to-ceiling windows. Duncan and Connor face off with duelling swords, sporting black waistcoak andd knee breeches in the manner of the times. Several other elegant FENCING PAIRS spar in this most genteel version of the ancient bloodsport, a far cry from the corpse-littered battlefield seen earlier. A little mustachioed PUFFER darts between the duellists with lint brush, pail and towel as Connor and Duncan re- engage in a rapid series of strikes and parries. CONNOR You've improved greatly. DUNCAN You really think so? Connor executes a simple combination that sends'Duncan's sword flying one way, his body the other. CONNOR No. I'm just being gracious. Duncan recovers, sets his feet. Puffer skitters over, brushes the dust off Duncan's coat, dabs his sweat and puffs the back of his hair. Duncan swats him away. They take en-garde position. Connor points his blade. CONNOR (cont'd) Remember, you're only immortal as long as your head remains attached to those shoulders. Duncan lunges again. Misses and hits the deck. CONNOR (cont'd) Which in your case might not be long at all. He puts his blade to Duncan's neck. Humor evaporates. CONNOR (cont'd) What we give up to our adversary in defeat, Duncan... is evervthinq. Duncan stares up at him, uncomprehending. CONNOR (cont'd) We call it "The Quickening"-- our strength, our knowledge, our life essence-- it all flows into the victor, feeds him, makes him stronger, in ways you can't possibly comprehend. It's what drives other Immortals to kill us. And what forces us to be better-- smarter-- than the rest. He takes Duncan by the arm, jerks him to his feet. CONNOR (cont'd) Survival. Learn it. Duncan goes on the attack. What he lacks in technique, he makes up for in determination. Almost. Connor sidesteps Duncan's next lunge, swats his blade flat across Duncan's ass and sends him plowing face-first into the floor. Duncan re-engages Connor in fighting stance. Puffer races up behind Duncan again, meticulously dusts his backside. Reaches around and plucks an unsightly piece of lint off his crotch with thumb and forefinger. DUNCAN (whirls around) You mind?! Connor clucks his tongue. CONNOR (cont'd) Allow me. He squares Duncans shoulders and steps back. Considers. CONNOR (cont'd) Unh uh. He steps up and swivels Duncan around until hes facing the opposite way. CONNOR (cont'd) If you should ever again find yourself backside to a blade... just keep this in mind. He proceeds to take Duncan through a move that's dazzling in it's inherent simplicity-- a move that winds up with Duncan's blade whisking perilously close across Connor's throat. CONNOR (cont'd) It's a coup de fin. He catches Duncan's sword-fist in his own, holds it immobile. CONNOR (cont'd) Properly executed, even you cannot prevent your blade from finding its mark. DUNCAN Properly executed, we'll never have this talk again. Duncan and Connor's eyes lock. They break. TRANSITION BACK TO: INT - CIRCULAR ROOM Duncan suddenly SIEZES UP with a strange disquiet and ringing in the ears known as THE BUZZ. It's the sense of another Immortal. He swings around, reaches for his katana and steps back through the door, swinging it closed as A YOUNG WOMAN appears at the top of the stairs. She saunters toward him, glancing around. She takes her time checking out the place before stepping up to Duncan. The ragged crop of her hair and the slashing trowel application of makeup impart a kind of crazed anti- beauty. Like a post-nuclear Barbi doll. Duncan regards her, intrigued and wary. DUNCAN Who are you? YOUNG WOMAN A friend. Those two words instantly recall the mystery voice on the phone. YOUNG WOMAN (cont'd) Or lover. Or wife. Take your pick. Memory jogs with a sudden lurch. DUNCAN Kate? YOUNG WOMAN Atta boy. 'cept I'm "Faith" now. Part of the makeover. Like it? She runs a playful finger across his chest. FAITH Funny how 'the time slips by, huh? You wake up one day and ohmigod-- Airplanes! DUNCAN Why're you here? FAITH Remember our wedding day, Duncan? I do. She takes him by the hands and leads him into an impromptu dance. FAITH (cont'd) We danced the "Highland Fling." She spins under his arm, circles back into his embrace. FAITH (cont'd) I felt like we were flying. Her sinuous body moves in perfect sync with his. FAITH (cont'd) And that we'd never come down. She spins out of his arms again-- --and SPIN KICKS him across the FACE. BLOOD spatters from his nose and mouth. FAITH (cont'd) Of course, we did come down. Didn't we? (kicks him again) Crashinq. Duncan staggers backward into a concrete stanchion. Recovers. They stand facing each other across a gulf centuries wide. DUNCAN (spitting blood) Why are you here? FAITH Isn't it obvious? I wanted to see you again. Duncan tenses at-- THE ROAR OF APPROACHING MOTORCYCLES. His eyes track the SOUND. It's directly BELOW him. EXT - STREET OUTSIDE ANTIQUE STORE THREE MOTORCYCLES hop the curb, SLICE through the open door to the antique store... INT - ANTIQUE STORE . . . and SPIRAL up the BACK STAIRS. INT - LOFT Duncan's eyes flick upward to a NEW SOUND, directly above him as-- EXT - ROOF - DAY A FOURTH BIKE VAULTS the NARROW GAP between buildings and LANDS. Knobby tires SLAM onto the rooftop, squirrelling wild across the tarred surface before shuddering to a stop. A jackbooted heel digs in and grinds to a stop. Biker suddenly BACKWHEELS around, BLASTS through the ROOF ACCESS DOOR and disappears inside. TWO MORE BIKERS follow suit, SLAMMING DOWN onto the roof like alien invaders. INT - LOFT Duncan reacts. But it's not just the full-throttle howl of approaching bikes. It's the BUZZ of approaching IMMORTALS. THE BIKERS now crest the stairs and fan out into the loft-- Same group we saw outside the monastery. Tricked out in everything from Keds to chainmail, they drag a variety of weapons in their trailing hands-- sword, baseball bat, mace, dao and chain-whip. The tips make a scraping noise across the floor that's deliberately unsettling. They surround Duncan, cutting off any avenue of escape. Nobody moves or speaks. Just the low staccato growl of idling two-stroke engines. Duncan takes a step backward. Looks to Faith. DUNCAN Who're they? FAITH More friends. PAN THE FACES. CARLOS from Bed-Stuy, BUG from Kyoto, WINSTON from Jamaica, SARGE from Shreveport and CRACKER BOB from nowhere in particular. And then there's CALVIN. A swaggering Immortal from the he's traded brute force in on a brand new weapon of choice. A DIGITAL VIDEO CAMERA. CALVIN Make it pretty now. It's the bottom of the ninth. BIKERS DISMOUNT and CONVERGE on Duncan, swinging their weapons to limber up. Duncan backs away. This is unheard of-- Immortals packing like jackals. DUNCAN What-- it's a team sport now? CALVIN (zooming in) Whole new ballgame. THREE IMMORTALS ATTACK. They're good. Duncan's better. About three times better. CALVIN jockeys his camcorder-- GOES IN TIGHT on Duncan. CALVIN Sup with the new blood, huh? Who's gonna lay him out? Take his secret sauce? (swivels around) YOU, Winston? WINSTON, the tall Jamaican, stands off to one side watching, the lone holdout. CALVIN (cont'd) Nope. Too proud. Old school. INTERCUT - VIDEO VIEWFINDER Image lurches and jostles as Calvin mixes it up with the combatants. CALVIN (O.S.) How 'bout you, Carlos? You good for it? Carlos--? CARLOS HURTLES THROUGH FRAME. Lands hard. CALVIN (O.S.) I'll catch you later. SWISH PAN TO: SWORD sparking off chainmail. HANDS AND FEET pounding flesh. BODIES slamming into walls. BLOOD. MAYHEM. PAIN. And Calvin, catching it all, up close and personal. CALVIN (cont'd) Sarge is down. Cracker Bob's down. But Carlos got some kick. Still got some kick. Carlos crawls to his feet, oozing blood and spite. CALVIN (cont'd) Like the man says, you gotta play with the small hurts. Carlos LUNGES-- Duncan lays him out flat again, then swivels around to face-- BUG who straightens up to his full five-foot frame. CALVIN (cont'd) Say hello to my man BUG and his ugly- stick. Bug brandishes a simple metal ROD with a woven grip. Nothing much to speak of... Until he squeezes the grip-- --and SIX BLADES EJECT SIMULTANEOUSLY. The two on each end are SWORD BLADES, one for piercing, one for slashing. Jutting perpendicular to the shaft, like an insane Swiss Army knife, are twin sets of DAGGERS-- two for stabbing and two sawtoothed SWORDBREAKERS. And then there's the shaft itself, if you're in need of a good old-fashioned battering ram. CALVIN (cont'd) Like it? Came from a Tamaric swordsmith. (grins) Who smoked a lotta very wicked stuff. Bug opens up a multi-pronged BARRAGE on Duncan. Duncan adapts to the first assault-- only to find himself reacting to an entirely new set of insane moves. CALVIN (cont'd) Uhp--- Say welcome back to Carlos... Carlos cuts in yet again, swinging for the stands. He fans several times before Duncan backfists him across the nose and dumps him back onto the floor. Duncan spins back to Bug as the wiry Asian lifts his lethal metal rod again and grins. But this time as he SQUEEZES the release mechanism-- --Duncan KICKS IT, shoving it flush against Bug's chest. SNICK SNICK two PIVOTING DAGGERS slice into the dumbstruck Immortal. He falls backward WAILING like a stuck pig. A BOOMING VOICE freezes everyone in their tracks. VOICE That's enough. All eyes converge on: THE STRANGER who stands at a distance, cloaked in murky halflight. STRANGER I'm sorry, Duncan. When it comes to discipline, the first hundred years are the hardest. Duncan lowers his katana, turns to the Stranger as-- CARLOS painfully hauls himself upright and suddenly BULLDOZES Duncan clear through one of the immense loft windows. Duncan's launched AIRBORNE in a plume of shattered glass, still clutching his katana. Carlos hooks an arm around the empty window-frame and watches with unvarnished satisfaction as the body SPIKES onto an upright iron ROD jutting from the construction site below. STRANGER What was that? CARLOS (squinting) Full gainer with a quarter twist. Degree of difficulty-- not very. STRANGER I thought I told you to stop. CARLOS Yeah, well. I stopped. STRANGER (cont'd) Are you challenging my authority? Carlos does his best to ignore him. STRANGER (cont'd) Because the only way to challenge my authority is to kill me. CARLOS (turns away) Hey hey, take it easy, man. STRANGER (cont'd) Is that clear? In the split second it takes Carlos to turn back from the window, the Stranger is right there in his face. CARLOS Shit! STRANGER IS THAT CLEAR? Stranger takes Carlos' sword and yanks it uo to his own neck -. STRANGER (cont'd) Here's your chance. Carlos stares wide-eyed. Pride won't let him back down. Fear won't let him proceed. STRANGER (cont'd) Take it. You won't have another. We can FEEL the SUDDEN HAMMERING of Carlos' HEART. CARLOS You're crazy, man! STRANGER Am I? Then go ahead... (rubs his neck across the blade) Stop the madness. CARLOS Hey-- STRANGER Or walk away... in perpetual fear of your own shadow. (beat) Tell me, Carlos. Can you live with that? Can you live with the fear? Can you live with the weakness? THUMP-THUMP-THUMP-THUMP-- STRANGER (cont'd) Weakness, Carlos. Isn't that why you're here with me? Isn't that why youre ALL here with me?! Face it, you're nothing but. . . (savoring) . . . cattle. Blood POUNDS in Carlos' eyes. He YANKS back the sword, CRIES OUT and SLASHES for the Stranger's neck. CLOSE ON STRANGER'S HAND as it catches his wrist and diverts the blade around to Carlos' own throat, wedging it up tight under his chin. STRANGER (cont'd) God loves you. I don't. In one vicious UP-SLICE, Stranger cuts through bone and sinew, stopping just short of a clean sever. Carlos gags and gurgles in liquid protest. STRANGER (cont'd) (whispers) They say the worst part, Carlos, is those last few seconds when you find yourself staring at your own headless body. SNICK-- He sends Carlos' head tumbling to the floor. STRANGER (cont'd) Of course it's pure speculation, since nobody ever lives to tell about it. HOLD ON CARLOS' EYES staring in pure, unknowable horror at his own body, twitching several yards away. A tiny ARC of electrical ESSENCE crackles from the neck... THE OTHERS bear mute witness to the GLOWING TENDRILS of ENERGY that stutter across the walls and ceiling. EXT - CONSTRUCTION SITE BELOW Duncan lies IMPALED on a JUTTING SHAFT OF RE-BAR as an UNMARKED PANEL VAN screeches INTO FRAME. His eyes stare sightless upward as THE LOFT WINDOWS EXPLODE with unearthly HOWLS of stretching metal and pulverizing concrete. SHOCKWAVES strafe the walls, blowing out mortar and brick. POWER LINES SNAP and LASH against the building, spitting fiery plumes of SPARKS. INT - LOFT Seen from behind, the Stranger absorbs the QUICKENING in a series of wild electro-shock convulsions. EXT - CONSTRUCTION SITE BELOW Several darkly-clad MEN jump from the panel van and race up to Duncan. With pit crew efficiency, one takes a mondo set of BOLT CUTTERS to the metal stake while the others grab Duncan by the arms and ankles. A fourth throws open the cargo door. Snap-lift... they TOSS Duncan in the back of the van. INT - LOFT, SAME Arms outstretched and rigid, head thrown back in silent rapture, the Stranger RISES slowly off the floor, suspended Christ-like in the air. BLINDING HALOES of PURE RADIANT ESSENCE engulf him, a lifeforce beyond human understanding. THE OTHERS watch transfixed. They've seen it all before, but it never ceases to amaze and terrify them. CUT TO: DARKNESS Which becomes a harsh blast of LIGHT. DUNCAN'S EYES flutter open, squint at the glare. He's strapped to the same Giger-like chair, immobilized. Standing around him are hooded members of that same monk-like order in what is, essentially, a dungeon. One of them, MATTHEW, steps forward. His steel-gray eyes are familiar. He's the one who followed Duncan through customs. As he reaches to cinch closed one of the iron cuffs with a thick metal dowel, he reveals a distinctive TATTOO across his inner forearm. One that Duncan instantly recognizes. _ DUNCAN Watchers? Matthew simply nods. DUNCAN Watchers observe. They don't interfere. MATTHEW True. And we were more than happy to perform our traditional function. Believe me, it's a whole lot easier charting the history of Immortals than it is running a day care center for them. Unfortunately our role has changed somewhat. DUNCAN Why? MATTHEW Because the rules have been broken. DUNCAN Not by me. MATTHEW You're not the one we're worried about. Matthew moves to the other side of the chair. Pegs the arm cuff and ratchets down a redundant set of bindings. MATTHEW (cont'd) One of your kind has gone renegade. In doing so he's gained himself a sizeable advantage. One that will be impossible to overcome. DUNCAN Nobody's unbeatable. MATTHEW He's surrounded himself with Immortals loyal only to him. He uses holy ground as a safe haven. And every head taken in battle is reserved for him alone, each Quickening-- hundreds upon hundreds-- taken by just one man. Yes, Duncan. He is unbeatable. Matthew pours a Scotch. Glenmorangie. Holds it to Duncan's lips like the final offering to a condemned man. MATTHEW (cont'd) Worse still, far worse, is that he's become a perversion to the Game. And if he prevails, that perversion will resonate through everything we know. For eternity. In ways we can't possibly comprehend. Duncan tugs at his bonds. Knows what's in store for him. MATTHEW (cont'd) There must always be two of your kind. As long as there are two, and they're kept from fighting, the Prize is safe. The Sanctuary must continue. DUNCAN Get yourself another volunteer. MATTHEW We had a number of "volunteers." Sadly, that's no longer the case. Another WATCHER steps up and forces an IRON FACE SHACKLE down over Duncan's head. MATTHEW (cont'd) You'll be warehoused. Hidden away. So the Prize can remain safe. Duncan struggles frantically against his bonds. DUNCAN You're insane! MATTHEW For the world, Duncan. We do this for the world... The Watcher takes two large BOLTS and begins to screw the mask directly into Duncan's skull. DUNCAN'S POV: BLACKNESS, accompanied by BRIGHT SEARING FLASHES of AGONY. MATTHEW'S VOICE (cont'd) Don't worry. The drugs should kick in momentarily. All external SOUND is slowly DROWNED OUT by the POUNDING IN HIS OWN BRAIN. A POUNDING interspersed with jarring, synaptic flashes of BATTLE. Killing. Dying. Killing again. Dying again. The recycling nightmare finally RECEDES back into NOTHINGNESS. Then, a NEW SOUND. Distant. Grind of metal on bone. Bolts being unscrewed. Iron plate lifts from his eyes, flood of LIGHT. Once again, Duncan SQUINTS up at a FACE. This time, the blurred, swimming features of a familiar Irish-American mug. DUNCAN (WOOZY) Dawson... JOE DAWSON, familiar to many as Duncan's one friend inside the Watchers, smiles back. DAWSON You look like shit. DUNCAN How... long...? DAWSON Week, maybe longer. We can't talk here. (unstraps Duncan) We gotta go. Dawson reacts to the sound of APPROACHING FOOTSTEPS. DAWSON (cont'd) (urgently) Now. Can you walk? DUNCAN Think so. He takes one step and pitches forward onto his face. DUNCAN (cont'd) Potent whiskey. He clambers to his feet and follows Dawson out of the chamber. EXT - ARMORY - NIGHT Dawson and Duncan emerge from a nondescript cinderblock armory, an overgrown Cold War relic recently co-opted by the Watchers. They duck some scurrying guards, plow through thick underbrush to A HIDDEN CAR and climb inside. INT - CAR, TRAVELLING - NIGHT DUNCAN You knew about The Sanctuary. DAWSON Just because I'm a Watcher, doesn't mean I'm always in the loop. DUNCAN I don't buy that. Dawson averts his gaze. Stares ahead. DAWSON I really struggled with it, y'know, the idea of keeping guys on ice like that. But I couldn't argue with the logic. Least not 'til they went after you. (squeals hard onto the main drag) Guess that put it a little too close to home. DUNCAN I owe you. Dawson slides Duncan's katana out from under the seat. Hands it over. DAWSON Do me a favor, buddy. Live to pay me back. DUNCAN What happened to the bodies? Dawson winces slightly. Keeps driving. DUNCAN (cont'd) C'mon, Joe. DAWSON Listen-- I got you outta one jam. Don't push your luck. DUNCAN I need to see them. DAWSON They're dead. Trust me. DUNCAN Was one of them Connor MacLeod? DAWSON Yes. DUNCAN Let me see the bodies. DAWSON The heads are gone. You really don't wanna go there. DUNCAN I have to, Joe. I have to know. Dawson jerks the car to a sudden shuddering stop. DAWSON Alright... Alright-- If I tell you, that's it, I'm outta here! You're on your own! I can't be a part of this, OK?! DUNCAN OK. DAWSON OK. Dawson stares at Duncan. A beat, then: DAWSON Fuck. I'm a part of it. He throws the car back into gear and fishtails back onto the road. CUT TO: A VIEW THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD of a forlorn and forgotten CEMETERY. Nothing marks its perimeter but a toppled gate and some trampled barbed wire. DAWSON It was a Christian burial. Decent. They said all the right words. DUNCAN I can't begin to tell you how reassuring that is. Pull over. WIDE Dawson pulls over. He and Duncan get out of the car. DAWSON Needless to say, with a dozen unexplainable corpses, they had to go a bit off the beaten track. EXT - CEMETERY - SUNSET From here it looks like just a barren hillside littered with broken and crumbling marble. CLOSER Duncan and Dawson tramp up the shallow incline. DAWSON (cont'd) What do you think you're gonna find when you get up there? DUNCAN I don't know. DAWSON I'm not digging. Get that through your skull right now. Not these hands... CRESTING THE RIDGE Twelve freshly-mounded graves come into view, gouged into the rubbled downslope like wounds, each set off by a simple wooden cross. Duncan stops when he reaches the first grave. Stiffens. DAWSON What? Duncan remains frozen, staring, seemingly at nothing. DAWSON (cont'd) My dog used to do that with locked closets. I hate that. DUNCAN Shh. Dawson listens. Nothing but the soft moan of WIND. DUNCAN (cont'd) He's here. DAWSON Tell me I'm not here for a seance. Duncan squints. Feels the BUZZ. Slight, but unmistakable. WHAT HE SEES: A row of stunted oaks, thick and gnarled againt the setting sun. CLOSER. . . Standing against the trunk, silhouette on silhouette, is the ghostly form of a MAN. Barely discernible, his features are hidden in shadow. Duncan slowly approaches the figure. Dawson hangs back, nervous and slightly twitchy. CLOSER STILL... The figure steps up to greet Duncan. Sunlight brightens the face of CONNOR MACLEOD who smiles as he embraces Duncan in the traditional bear- crush of Scottish clansmen. DUNCAN Sorry I missed your funeral. CONNOR All told, it was a bit underwhelming. DUNCAN So it would seem. They break. The brief joy suddenly drains from Connor's face-- his eyes speak of diffuse, faraway suffering. CONNOR Why are you here? DUNCAN Ten years ago you skipped out on a bartab. Connor's expression hardens. CONNOR You need to know something... He steps up to Duncan, locks eyes. CONNOR (cont'd) Every life I touch ends. Brutally. And for no reason. It's a curse that's followed me for centuries. I can't outrun it and I can't outlive it. (beat) You're my last friend in this world, Duncan. I left for your own good. It was better that you didn't know where. DUNCAN The Sanctuary. CONNOR Yes. The Sanctuary. DUNCAN But you escaped. CONNOR No, I didn't escape... FLASH BACK TO THE SANCTUARY as the STRANGER moves toward a shackled Connor MacLeod. CONNOR (V.O.) ...I was freed. As before, the immobilized Connor stirs in a drug-addled haze. CONNOR Who are you? STRANGER You'll know soon enough. CONNOR'S POV - THROUGH THE BOTTOM EDGE OF HIS FACEPLATE All Connor can see is the Stranger's HAND as it reaches down and PULLS THE PIN from one of Connor's arm shackles. The cuff FALLS OPEN. Stranger turns away. A beat later come the unmistakable SOUNDS of SLAUGHTER that fill the room to a DEAFENING CRESCENDO. CONNOR (V.O.) I couldn't see the slaughter. I only heard it. BACK TO CEMETERY: We can still see the agony playing out in Connor's eyes. He turns away, sees JOE DAWSON still standing on the ridge, swatting at the occasional deerfly. CONNOR Who's he? DUNCAN The reason I didn't become your replacement. Dawson casually removes one of his legs and vigorously shakes it upside down. CONNOR What's he doing now? DUNCAN Sand in the shoe would be my guess. Connor suddenly gazes beyond Dawson to THE NEXT HILLSIDE and the FAINT SOUND OF APPROACHING MOTORCYCLES. He stiffens. CONNOR You were followed. One by one, a HALF-DOZEN MOTORCYCLISTS crest the surrounding hills and come to a menacing stop. DUNCAN Yeah. I was meaning to tell you about those guys. Dawson fumbles to put his leg back on. Hops a full 360 as he watches the intruders surround them. TWO MORE approach on foot, following the same path Duncan and Dawson took. One is Faith. The other, The Stranger. Except he's no stranger to Connor MacLeod. Far from it. Connor goes rigid. Breathing stops. His nightmare's finally taken human form. MOVE IN for our first clear look at JACOB KASE striding forward, bigger than death. His is a face hewn by Gods sharpest blade, every angle cold, remorseless, Puritannical. As before, he's clad in basic black, accented by the stark white of a priest's collar. CONNOR (ice) Jacob Kase... Connor edges back his coat. Hand seeks out the grip of his sword. Duncan grabs his arm. DUNCAN Not here. CONNOR Walk away, Duncan. Kase and Faith continue toward them. Connor's rage seems to ratchet up with every step. DUNCAN You're on holy ground. Remember the rules... Pure, radiating hate seethes in Connor's eyes. CONNOR The rules be damned. Kase stops, inches from Connor's face. Cooly regards the sword. KASE Look at you. You'd think after half a millenium, you'd learn to keep that you'd learn to keep that temper of yours in check. Gone is any trace of brogue. He's a fully-assimilated New Yorker now. Connor's fingers tighten around the swordgrip... CONNOR Just tell me where, Kase. KASE If all I wanted was to kill you, you'd have been dead a very long time ago, Connor. Something roils under Kase's controlled exterior. A rage every bit as consuming as Connor's. KASE (cont'd) But your death alone could never appease the innocent souls you slaughtered. FLASH TO SEVERAL OF GLENFINNAN'S VILLAGERS being MOWED DOWN by Connor's mindless fury. KASE (cont'd) It couldn't even begin to appease mine. FLASH TO KASE as he drops to his knees, gagging blood, RUN THROUGH by Connor's blade. KASE (cont'd) Worst of all, you murdered a man of God. Who raised me as his son. FLASH TO A FATHER RAINEY as Connor brings his sword CLEAVING DOWN on him. KASE (cont'd) ...and no punishment conceived by man can ever atone for that. AFTERMATH OF MASSACRE Scattered wisps of smoke gambol across the demolished commons, leading up to the CORPSE of JACOB KASE. KASE (cont'd) What you never could have expected was that you'd leave behind this one humble servant... Kase's body lies there as cold as the Highland dawn. KASE (cont'd) ...who would trade eternity itself to make you pay. HIS EYES snap open. And we're once again TRANSPORTED BACK TO: EXT - CEMETERY - DAY Kase steps closer, revelling in this moment. KASE Look back over the endless travesties of your life and you'll see me. Always there, waiting in the shadows. (beat) When friends and lovers are wiped from your sight, I'm there. KASE (cont'd) When those you cherish die abruptly and for no reason, I'm there. (kicks a clod of dirt onto a grave) And when a handful of misguided and pathetic idiots just happen to share your own private hell... (shrugs) Guess who? He walks a full circle around Connor. All the while Kase addresses Connor, Faith never takes her eyes off Duncan. KASE (cont'd) But if you think it ends here, my ancient friend, you're wrong. Very... Very... Wrong. Kase turns back to Faith. Pulls his sword and without warning SLICES it across her throat. Faith reflexively GASPS, stumbles backward, leaving-- A WOOD AND SILVER CRUCIFIX dangling on Kase's swordtip. FOLLOW THE CRUCIFIX as he swings it around and offers it up to Connor. KASE Thought you might be wanting this. I kept it for you... FLASH TO CONNOR'S MOTHER, bound to the stake as Kase rips the crucifix from her neck. BACK TO SCENE: Connor stares down at the crucifix now in his open palm. KASE (cont'd) For old times' sake. Kase puts an arm around Faith. KASE (cont'd) Want to find me again, Connor? Just put your hands together... KASE (cont'd) (winks) And pray. He gives Faith a little shove and they both start downhill. THE SURROUNDING BIKERS gun their engines and ride off on billowing plumes of dust. Connor makes no move to follow. Strangely silent and impassive, he's like a warrior gutted by an invisible sword. Duncan puts a hand on his shoulder. DUNCAN Whatever it is... Connor swipes away Duncan's hand, starts walking. DUNCAN (cont'd) I can help you, Connor. Connor stops, swivels back. Eyes dead. CONNOR Nobody can help me. He walks off alone, a ghost against a sea of gravestones, DUNCAN CONNOR-- Duncan watches his friend depart, helpless. Turning back, he sees FAITH AND KASE stopped halfway down the hill. They seem to be arguing. Kase turns abruptly and strides off. CLOSE ON FAITH She stands there a moment, sullenly rubbing her throat. Duncan's VOICE spins her back around. DUNCAN (O.S.) Problem? FAITH I get a bit fussy whenever somebody points a sword at me. (dry) Goes a long way back. Their eyes fix on one another. Air thickens. Buzzes with electricity. DUNCAN Just one question. After all these years. . . (re: Kase) Why him? Faith glances down at Kase, who stands waiting at the base of the hill. Considers. FAITH Because I've never known anyone who had such an amazing capacity for hate. (beat) Except me. On that, she brushes past Duncan and rejoins Kase. TRANSITION TO: EXT - IRISH COUNTRYSIDE, 17TH CENTURY - DAY Duncan and Connor ride side by side on horseback. They reach a RIVERBANK where a YOUNG WOMAN and her elderly CONSORT are detained at a crude wooden TOLL GATE. Eight or nine disreputable-looking HIGHWAYMEN surround their carriage. Connor rides up to what would appear to be the LEADER. He has the most teeth. CONNOR What's going on? HIGHWAYMAN The lady here refuses to pay her toll. CONNOR Toll for what? HIGHWAYMAN Passage over the bridge. Connor cranes his eyes, upriver and down. CONNOR I see no bridge. HIGHWAYMAN What do you think pays for the bridge? Connor considers, then turns back to the lady with a shrug. CONNOR The man has a point. Despite her sweeping auburn hair and natural beauty, we now recognize the young woman as FAITH from an earlier era. Her original name is CATHERINE MARY DEVANEY. CATHERINE These men are liars and scoundrels. Theyve preyed upon us three years running. CONNOR This true? HIGHWAYMAN A good sturdy bridge is not an overnight accomplishment, Sir. CONNOR Exactly what, may I ask, have you accomplished so far? HIGHWAYMAN (proudly) The tollgate. Duncan trots around the tollgate and up alongside Connor. He leans over to the highwayman. DUNCAN Excuse me, but by whose authority do you act? HIGHWAYMAN (holds up scroll) By deed of the King. DUNCAN Might I see that? Highwayman slowly unravels the parchment scroll. The nearly-illegible scrawl suggests random words copied by an illiterate. DUNCAN (cont'd) Does the King always sign his name with an "X"? Highwayman's cronies reach for their swords. HIGHWAYMAN He was in a hurry. All eyes hover on Duncan's reaction. Two of the highwaymen edge around behind Catherine and her elderly consort, ready to gut them both at a moment's notice. Duncan tracks them with his eyes. DUNCAN (nods) Busy man, the King. (to Catherine) I suggest you pay the gentlemen and be on your way. CATHERINE His deed is a fake! DUNCAN That's a matter of opinion. CATHERINE You, Sir, are no better than they! DUNCAN That's also a matter of opinion. (to Connor) Shall we? Connor sizes up his young protege'. Gives a dubious nod. CONNOR Lead on. CATHERINE You can't just leave! DUNCAN You're right... He tosses a handful of gold coins to the Highwayman. DUNCAN (cont'd) Good luck with the bridge. He kicks his horse into a brisk trot. Connor reluctantly follows suit. They cross the river through ankle-deep water. CONNOR I can't believe you gave those bastards your money. DUNCAN It wasn't my money. Duncan pulls a cinched canvas BAG overstuffed with coins from his overcoat. DUNCAN (cont'd) It was theirs. RACK FOCUS TO the duped HIGHWAYMEN scrambling onto their horses and riding hard in frantic pursuit. They hit the river at a gallop, kicking up giant shimmering fantails of water. DUNCAN (cont'd) By the time they reach us, the young lady and her escort should be safely out of harms way. The pursuers close the gap in seconds. Connor grins approvingly. Draws his sword and glances over at Duncan. CONNOR Shall we? Duncan FLICKS his own sword, lets the hilt auto-rotate around his open palm and snaps it vertical. He nods back at Connor. DUNCAN Let's. Together, they whirl around to face the onrushing horde. THEY BATTLE in the middle of the shallow river. Nine maniacal thieves against two sporting Immortals. The spray of water, the slashing of swords and the pounding of hooves all build to an operatic crescendo. Duncan's improved since Ravenna. He easily scatters three of his adversaries before engaging the blood-crazed LEADER. This time it's Connor who finds himself in trouble. He tumbles from his horse and goes down, losing his sword in the river. DUNCAN suddenly winds back and FLINGS his sword at his opponent like a throwing dagger. BLADE whistles past the dumbstruck highwayman's head. Which was not the intended target... . . .as we discover when we follow it's end-over-end flight. . . . . . straight into CONNOR'S OUTSTRETCHED HAND. Connor parries his attackers, drives them backward onto their asses, then swivels around and TOSSES the sword back to DUNCAN, who catches it, ducks the highwayman's next swing and swiftly sends him packing. CONNOR recovers his own sword, which is enough to send the last of their attackers into a full-on, stumbling retreat. They both stand watching as THE CARRIAGE jostles safely across the river. CLOSE ON CATHERINE as she looks back at Duncan. She gives Duncan a knowing smile that's as innocent as it is seductive. CONNOR (watching Duncan) You know that stirring in your gut? It's not just simple lust, my friend. DUNCAN I know... CONNOR Ah, but do you really? MATCH CUT TO: FAITH as she and Kase drive away from the cemetery in a late model convertible. EXT - CEMETERY - SUNSET Joe Dawson walks up to Duncan. DAWSON I feel like I stepped in on the wrong party. Duncan keeps watching the convertible until it disappears over the next rise. DUNCAN (quietly) Let's go. CUT TO: EXT - BAR - NIGHT We recognize this place. It's where Connor and Duncan shared a last drink together. Duncan and Joe Dawson now hunch over that same bar, staring into their drinks. DAWSON I swear, the man's a walking ghost. EXT - SIDEWALK - NIGHT FEET pound pavement. DAWSON (V.O.) (CONT'D) Whatever it is he's carrying around inside him, it's like he's dead already. Glare of streetlights rake across Connor's face, his eyes fixed forward as if driven by a sense more powerful than sight. Connor bumps shoulders with a passing PEDESTRIAN. PEDESTRIAN Eyy man-- watch it. He continues on, oblivious. INT - BAR - NIGHT Duncan turns to Dawson. DUNCAN There are things you do in this life that damn you for eternity. They can't be changed. And they can't be undone. You carry these things to the grave, Joe, in the hopes that maybe, just maybe, you'll find some peace there. Some relief, even if it's oblivion. (hollow smile) But Immortals don't die. We just go on reliving our sins. Over and over again. EXT - ANOTHER STREET - LATER Connor stops. Lifts his eyes to the light. A SOLITARY STONE CHURCH stands before him in a bed of crawling mist. It seems eerily out of place amid the urban blight around it. INT - BAR - NIGHT Duncan downs the last of his drink, shoves off from the bar. Dawson glances warily up at him. DAWSON Where now? DUNCAN There were two places I figured Connor was likely to go. One of 'em was here. DAWSON And the other? DUNCAN You're the "Watcher." You tell me. EXT - STONE CHURCH - NIGHT Connor climbs the steps, presses through the heavy wooden doors... INT - CHURCH . . . and prowls slowly through the dimly-lit interior. Icon SHADOWS loom large and menacing. JUMP CUT: He moves along the stations of the cross. JUMP CUT: He's stalking through the nave. JUMP CUT: Barging into the sacristy. EXT - DAWSON'S CAR, DRIVING - NIGHT Dawson's car screams past with a doppler howl. DAWSON (O.S.) It's an old abandoned church just off Canal... INT - DAWSON'S CAR - SAME Dawson's behind the wheel, gunning through narrow back streets. DAWSON . . . Perfect safe haven for a so-called priest, huh? "Our Lady of Sorrows." (dry) Kinda has a nice ring to it. He fishtails around the next corner. Recovers. DAWSON (cont'd) I'll tell ya this-- if he's going after Kase, he's in for a rude awakening. The man's untouchable. DUNCAN So they tell me. INT - CHURCH SANCTUARY - NIGHT Connor stops before the darkened altar, senses BUZZING. THE SHADOWED CRUCIFIX stirs. Arms lift in the darkness. Jacob Kase steps down off the cross, lingers in shadow. KASE I would grant you absolution. If I were a better man. He turns and disappears out the back. Connor follows. Right past KASE'S POSSE OF IMMORTALS scattered throughout the pews, who simply track him with their eyes but make no move to follow. WINSTON, the tall Jamaican, leans over to Faith. WINSTON You know we're next, don't you? Faith lowers the book she's reading-- the Holy Bible. Looks up. FAITH What? WINSTON Our days are numbered. You can see it in Kase's eyes. FAITH Do you believe in a hereafter, Winston? WINSTON All I know is I won't be hereafter Jacob Kase gets through with me. And that's all I care about right now. Faith leans back against the hardback pew, closes her eyes. FAITH Yeah... CUT TO: EXT - REAR OF CHURCH - NIGHT Kase strides just beyond the perimeter of the church grounds, then turns back to Connor. Connor draws his sword, moves on Kase. KASE The ancient samurai vowed never to draw blood in anger. It defiled their sense of purpose. (draws his own sword) Of course they're also somewhat extinct. He steps fearlessly up to Connor, places his neck against Connor's swordblade... . . . just like he did with a certain late Immortal named Carlos. CLOSE ON KASE'S SWORD He opens his fingers and lets the sword DROP. It clatters useless to the ground. KASE Would you slaughter an unarmed man of God again, Connor? Would that finally put your soul to rest? (low, taunting) Then go ahead. Send me home. BLOOD POUNDS with the rage pulsing through Connor's veins. KASE (cont'd) What's stopping you? Guilt? The nagging sense that maybe you, more than I, deserve to die? Dawson's car pulls up in the background. Duncan jumps out. KASE (cont'd) Or somewhere along the way did you just lose your nerve? Connor's sword digs into Kase's neck. Breaks skin. DUNCAN (approaching) Don't do it, Connor. CONNOR (gritted) Keep back. KASE (to Duncan) You heard him. No Immortal can interfere with another's duel. DUNCAN He's playing you! Step back onto holy ground before it's too late-- Kase faces back to Connor. KASE Go ahead-- what better chance than now? Take your shot. DUNCAN Don't listen to him! KASE Do it. For your sweet mother... FLASH Caiolin burns at the stake. Suddenly startled, KASE (cont'd) Your Huguenot bitch in Navarre... FLASH rears back, THROWS Suddenly startled, the HORSE bearing a FRENCH DUCHESS her to the ground, breaking her neck. KASE (cont'd) Brenda Wyatt... FLASH BRENDA WYATT ("Highlander 1") is seen walking in CENTRAL PARK. A HIT-AND-RUN DRIVER MOWS HER DOWN from behind. KASE (cont'd) Rachel Ellenstein... FLASH RACHEL is BLOWN APART in the antique store she shared with Connor. KASE (cont'd) Tell me-- do they even begin to equal the devastation of an entire village? BLADE TREMBLES in Connor's hands. Kase presses his neck even harder against Connor's blade. BLOOD trickles down his neck. KASE (cont'd) So close. Soooo close... Duncan stands by, helpless to intervene. KASE (cont'd) Look at you. Even now, you're afraid you'll lose. That's your true fear isn't it? (whispers low, seductive) Oh, it's not the dying, my friend. I know that. That would be a blessing. It's the thought of giving up your essence to me. Making me even stronger by it. One look in Connor's eyes and you know he's right. KASE (cont'd) What's wrong? (almost a purr) Don't you want to be inside me? Connor slowly LOWERS his sword... and FLICKS Kase's discarded sword back up into his hands. Kase simply smiles and takes position. Duncan can only look on helplessly as Kase takes the first offensive, driving Connor backward with dazzling -- almost casual-- swordplay. KASE I've taken more heads than you can possibly imagine. His sword whistles across Connor's face, opens a THREE INCH GASH over his eye. KASE (cont'd) Do you really want a taste of all those accumulated quickenings? Connor stumbles backward again, blinded by his own dripping blood. Knows beyond a shadow of a doubt he's doomed. Duncan knows it too. And it's killing him to watch. Still Connor won't go down easy. He manages a brief offensive, walking Kase backward on his toes. Kase puts one hand behind his back, fencing-style, and goes to work on Connor's torso, crosshatching him in blood. Connor lunges wildly. Kase parries effortlessly. Kase now opens up a BLINDING BARRAGE on Connor. It's like duelling against lightning, so quick and unpredictable are Kase's strikes. Constantly off balance, Connor still manages to NICK Kase in the cheek. KASE (cont'd) (touches scratch) I'd almost forgotten what that felt like. Thank you. He now turns it on full. Drives Connor up against a wall and pins him with his swordtip. His eyes go impossibly cold. KASE I want you to think back to this moment in the endless nights ahead. And know that every time you close your eyes, from now to eternity, I'll be there. (beat) Ripping apart the ones you care about most. He removes his sword and steps back. KASE (cont'd) It's not over, Connor MacLeod. It will never, never be over. He turns and walks back toward the church. Duncan does not step aside to let him pass-- their shoulders bump. KASE (cont'd) You, on the other hand, are on borrowed time. He continues on, past the other Immortals who have gathered to watch the unfolding spectacle. One-by-one, they turn and file back into the church behind Kase. Connor stares into Duncan's eyes as if wanting to say something. Can't. Instead, he turns and starts limping out across the empty lot. Feeling the presence of another Immortal, Duncan slowly looks over at FAITH who stands at a distance. Watching him. As their eyes meet, she, too, turns and melts back into the surrounding blackness. TRANSITION TO: EXT - DUBLIN ROWHOUSE (17TH CENTURY) - DAY A BEARDED BRAWLER CRASHES DOWN onto a wooden table. He takes the table cloth with him as he TUMBLES head over heels onto the floor in a cascade of soda bread and cabbage. Miraculously (unless you're an Irishman) he spills not one drop of precious Guinness, which he hoists in a cheery salute to: THE BRIDE AND GROOM who sit laughing in the eye of an Irish hurricane. DUNCAN MACLEOD and CATHERINE MARY (KATE) DEVANEY-- aka "Faith"-- are a stunning couple that inspire joyful madness. Things have progressed nicely since their chance encounter at the toll crossing. BRAWLER Let's have at it! They kiss to a CHORUS of BOOS. So this time they REALLY KISS. Crowd goes wild. AROUND THEM REVELERS DANCE and FIGHT with equal abandon, making it almost impossible to tell the difference. But they stop like clockwork for every new toast and testimonial. THE BEARDED BRAWLER spears his mug into the air like a royal scepter. BRAWLER Happy is the bride that sees the sun! Sorry the corpse that sees the rain! CLOSE ON BEER MUG framed in a perfect BEAM of SUNLIGHT streaming through an open window. FOLLOW THE SUNBEAM TO: KATE who smiles back with her own inner radiance. Bedecked in flowers, her brown hair sweets low over white lace shoulders and cream skin. She leans over RAUCOUS CHEERS and kisses Duncan, provoking a new RIOT of and UPRAISED GLASSES. THE PIPERS resplendent in their Celtic kilts, launch into the "Highland Fling. Kate is instantly YANKED up onto her feet and into a ROUSING JIG. Before Duncan can protest, he's HOISTED from his seat and FLUNG onto the dance floor. Duncan and Kate link arms, goaded on by a circle of shouting, stumbling CLAPPERS. With each new upshift in tempo, they spin faster and faster until they're hanging on for dear life. SIGHT AND SOUND gradually blur into a queasy sense of vertigo. But for Duncan, it's not just the headstrong mix of drink and passion. It's the BUZZ of another Immortal. He spins to a stop as his eyes come to rest on CONNOR MACLEOD who enters the room on a wave of silence. Duncan breaks away from Kate, crosses over to Connor and wraps him in a bear hug. DUNCAN About time. I was beginning to wonder. CONNOR I was on a junk in the South China Sea when I got your notice. 12 hours ago. DUNCAN How...? CONNOR Don't ask. Kate spins by on the arm of a new partner. KATE You're next, Connor MacLeod. CONNOR That better be no idle threat. Duncan watches Kate with a rapturous smile. DUNCAN Well, I finally did it! CONNOR So it would appear. DUNCAN What do you think of her? CONNOR You know that's not an easy answer. The edge in his voice is not lost on Duncan. CONNOR (cont'd) Outside. EXT - PORCH - NIGHT Connor stands with Duncan at the railing, staring out into the encroaching night. CONNOR You know she's like us. DUNCAN Yes. I sensed it the day we met her. CONNOR So you know that, like us, her immortality can only be triggered by the shock of a violent death. Duncan looks off, as if purging the thought from his head. CONNOR (cont'd) It's what makes warriors of us all, Duncan. Good or bad, there seems a purpose to it. DUNCAN Yes. And without such a death, she'll simply grow old and die like any other. Is that what you dragged me out here to tell me? Connor removes a uniquely-braided GOLDEN ROPE from his vest pocket. It catches the candlelight with the glint of a thousand silken threads as he runs it lightly over his fingertips. CONNOR Many years after I was married, I came home to find Heather sitting on a stool in the kitchen, with a knife in one hand... and her hair in the other. FLASH TO: HEATHER, early-forties, her hair shorn to the scalp. She looks up at Connor with red-rimmed eyes and a bitter smile. CONNOR (cont'd) At first I was scared. Scared that she'd gone mad. And then angry, as if she'd somehow meant to hurt me by it. BACK TO CONNOR AND DUNCAN: CONNOR (cont'd) When I asked her why she'd done such a thing to herself, her answer cut me to the quick. She said it was the one part of her that would not age. It would forever remain the same as when I first fell in love with her. FLASH TO: CONNOR burying Heather in a simple grave overlooking their home. Tears streak his face. He sinks to his knees in unspeakable anguish. CONNOR (cont'd) And that's how she wanted me to remember her. BACK TO CONNOR AND DUNCAN: Connor closes his fingers around the braid. Squeezes. CONNOR (cont'd) It's all I have now. DUNCAN I love Kate. I'll hold on to her as long as I can. That's all I can do. Kate can be seen through the window behind them, exchanging dance partners with dizzying abandon. CONNOR If that's your intent, so be it. Duncan swings over the rail and hops off the porch. Takes to the ground in long angry strides. EXT - COBBLED STREET - NIGHT Conner walks double time to catch up with him. DUNCAN Why are you telling me this? CONNOR Because I once loved a woman more than life itself. And I watched her die. Unlike you, I had no other choice. DUNCAN And I have a choice?! What would you have me tell her?! CONNOR I'd tell her nothing. She wouldn't believe you. They never do when it involves themselves. DUNCAN Then I can do nothing. CONNOR She's in the flower of her youth. Enjoy the moment and let it pass. If you think you can. Duncan suddenly grabs Connor's shoulder, spins him around. DUNCAN You'd have me kill her?! Is that it?! Is that what you came all this way to tell me on my WEDDING NIGHT?! CONNOR I'd have you do what your heart-- and our conscience-- demand. Duncan settles. Searches his eyes. DUNCAN And if it were you in my place? Connor ponders. Then shakes his head. CONNOR I thank God I never had the choice. He listens to the faint strains of music and laughter carried on the rising WIND. CONNOR (cont'd) Tell Catherine I'm sorry I couldn't stay longer. He clasps Duncan by the forearm. Then turns and continues n down the cobbled lane leading from the wedding party. TRANSITION BACK TO: INT - SOHO HOTEL - NIGHT Duncan lies sleepless in a nouveau-stark hotel room, somewhere in the bowels of Manhattan. A half-empty bottle of Glenmorangie is there for company. The door CREAKS OPEN, casting a single ribbon of light across the room. It WIDENS to REVEAL THE SILHOUETTE OF A WOMAN. Duncan closes his eyes. Feigns sleep. She pads silently inside. Pulls the door closed. Duncan remains still, breathing heavily. The woman steals slowly up to the bedside. Pauses, as if quietly studying Duncan-- --then swings her leg up and straddles him. Even in the murky halflight, he can still make out the familiar painted eyes framed by a tangle of bleached hair. She says nothing, her expression lost under a veil of darkness. Only her rapid breathing betrays her tension. Instead, she suddenly leans forward and KISSES HIM. Passionately. Duncan responds in kind. AS if powerless to do anything else... LIGHTNING stitches the sky outside as-- They embrace. Bodies entwine with an urgency that builds with the STORM raging outside. ON THE NEXT THUNDERCRACK TRANSITION TO: EXT - EMPTY FIELD (DUBLIN) - NIGHT ANGRY SHEETS OF RAIN rake the countryside as Duncan slogs imlessly through calf-deep mud. Still in his wedding arb, he's thoroughly drenched, as if he's been wandering this way for hours. INT - ROWHOUSE - NIGHT The last of the guests have gone or passed out beneath toppled kegs of ale. Only Kate remains upright, her face etched with sober dread as DUNCAN appears in the doorway, rivulets of water pouring off his shoulders and brow. For a while they just stare at one another, each lost to his own sense of foreboding. Kate is the first to speak. Despite her stoic veneer, her voice comes out small and terrified. KATE If this is wrong, Duncan, tell me now. Saying nothing, Duncan slowly crosses the floor and takes her hands in his own. INT - BEDROOM - NIGHT CANDLES flicker in the storm-fed drafts that whistle through closed windows. Kate lays Duncan's rainsoaked clothing across a nightstand then turns, regarding him naked for the very first time. Duncan reaches out to touch her. She trembles. Gently, as if unwrapping an object of unimaginable fragility, Duncan removes her clothing down to a simple floating chemise. Then guides her down onto a canopied bed encircled by a hundred fresh-cut wildflowers. HANDS clasp, fingers dig into skin. Whatever refinements Kate displayed in public are now happily abandoned. She arches up under Duncan, puts her lips to his ear. KATE I'll love you forever. On an OMINOUS THUNDERCLAP-- TRANSITION BACK TO: INT - SOHO HOTEL - NIGHT We're back in the present. Little has changed but the sheets. And the fury of their lovemaking. Each new THUNDERCRACK highlights a different aspect of their hunger-- their wet, glistening bodies STROBING FASTER AND FASTER until the act itself becomes abstracted from any sense of time or place. FLASH FRAMES stutter inside the lightning: SILKEN HAIR coursing over cream-colored breasts and a simple pewter cross. EYES similar in shape and color, that shift from painted to plain... FINGERNAILS that toggle between neo-goth BLACK and natural pink... FAITH throws back her head, biting back the shudders of release... . . . and sinks down into the bed with a drawn sigh. INT - DUBLIN BEDROOM - NIGHT A SHADOW darkens Kate as she sleeps. It lingers there, deadly still. DUNCAN stands over her, gripped by indecision. The fateful choice tears at him, even as he holds a DAGGER over her gently-rising chest. His hand TREMBLES. DUNCAN (softly) Forgive me. KATE'S EYES SNAP OPEN as the DAGGER PLUNGES INTO HER HEART. For an instant their eves meet. And in that single shattering moment, Duncan knows he chose wrong. It's not just terror that passes through Kate's eyes. It's the incomprehensible pain of betrayal. Kate gasps once, jerks and settles. Lies there dead, blood pooling across her nightgown. Duncan stares down at her body, numb. DUNCAN I'm sorry... On that look we TRANSITION BACK TO: INT - HOTEL - NIGHT The pain imprints on Duncan as if he's still clutching the knife. DUNCAN I'm sorry. Whatever passion stirred Faith moments before is gone without a trace. Her eyes are as cold and empty as the dead Kate. FAITH You had no right. DUNCAN I was doing it for you. For us. FLASH TO: INT - DUBLIN BEDROOM - NIGHT Kate CONVULSES BACK TO LIFE, eyes wild, insane. Duncan reaches out to her, which only sends her reeling further into panic delirium. She swats at him, punching flailing... DUNCAN Now you're an immortal. Like me. It was the only way... Words fall on deaf ears. She wrenches out of his grip. Stumbles for the door, drenched in her own blood. Leaves Duncan standing mindblown in her wake. EXT - DUBLIN STREETS - NIGHT Kate flees through wet empty streets-- barefoot, nightgown ripped and bloody, face contorted like a madwoman. Breath comes in ragged, whimpering gasps. She trips, falls. Comes up running. BACK TO PRESENT: Faith climbs off the bed, throws on Duncan's shirt, whirls back, tears streaking her face like warpaint. FAITH You wanted this! I never asked for eternity! You forced it on me! (screams) IT WAS MY DECISION, NOT YOURS!! DUNCAN Would you have really understood? FAITH Understood? Which part?! The part about never having children? Or the endless, numbing sameness of it all? (bitter laugh) Or maybe you mean the part where you wake up one day and realize you're nothing but a whore racking up faceless affairs because whole lifetimes tick by so fast they don't even count anymore! She wraps her arms around herself as if to stem the escaping demons. Duncan remains silent, taking it all in. FAITH (cont'd) Here's the kicker, Duncan. I came here for one reason and one reason only. To see if I could feel again. Anything. She walks out, leaving the door hanging wide in her wake. INT - HALLWAY Faith reaches for the stairwell door as-- --DUNCAN'S ARM LANCES OUT, holding it shut. DUNCAN (leaning in) I'm watching my best friend driven insane by something that happened four centuries ago. And there's nothing I can do to stop it. Because those people are dead and nobody can bring them back. Faith struggles to open the door. Duncan holds firm. DUNCAN (cont'd) But I'm lucky. You know why? FAITH Let go! DUNCAN I'm lucky because my crime can still be forgiven. FAITH LET GO!! DUNCAN As long as you're still alive, there's at least the chance. It could take years. Centuries even. It may never happen... Faith is now PUSHING FURIOUSLY on the door. DUNCAN (cont'd) But at least I can still carry the hope inside me. That's one blessing of immortality. There's always tomorrow. He lets go of the door and steps back. DUNCAN (cont'd) Even for you. Faith shoves her way past him and disappears into the stairwell. CUT TO: EXT - MANHATTAN SKYLINE - NIGHT CONNOR MACLEOD stands on a ROOFTOP, sword in hand, face upturned to the bitter heavens. Stinging WIND and RAIN slash at his face. He doesn't even blink. CUT TO: EXT - NEAR CHURCH - NIGHT Seen through a CAMCORDER VIEWFINDER, our roving POV wends its way past a couple fixing junkies up to a GARAGE where WINSTON hunkers over his bike making repairs. Kase's church looms in the background like a veiled threat. CALVIN (O.S.) Win-ston. WINSTON Shut that thing off. CALVIN (O.S.) Hey, c'mon. WINSTON SHUT IT OFF! SCREEN BLACKS OUT as Winston slams his hand over the lens, ENDING CAMCORDER POV. Calvin sets it down. CALVIN Awright... WINSTON I'm out. I'm leaving. CALVIN You're out. You're out... You don't g&z out. WINSTON Watch me. CALVIN You saw what he did to Carlos. He's Genghis the fucking Hun, man. You live his way or you die your way. Be grateful you got the choice. Winston looks off. WINSTON We could take him. CALVIN Huh? Say how much you value your life? WINSTON Forty-three guineas. Saw the bill of sale myself. Kingston Jamaica, August 14th, 1813. CALVIN Sorry there, Cinque', but I got a bigger price goin on this unit. WINSTON I watched Connor MacLeod stand up to Kase tonight. Got me thinking. CALVIN What about. WINSTON That maybe my soul wasn't part of the deal after all. Calvin considers his point. CALVIN You really think we can take him? WINSTON The man can't stop a bullet. I know that much. But I need your help. CALVIN Yeah and who takes his head, huh? Gets that bucket fulla lucky charms. You, Mr Cool? (beat) Who's gonna be master then? INSERT - CALVIN'S CAMERA and that little glowing RECORD LIGHT... EXT - RUBBLED CEMETERY - DAWN FOLLOW CONNOR MACLEOD CUT TO: as he reaches the crest of the cemetery ridge. He sags against a solitary windswept oak, slides down until he's sitting cross-legged at the base of the tree. Eyes wide, unblinking. BEFORE HIM stand those TWELVE DEAD IMMORTALS from The Sanctuary, directly over their burial plots. Their heads are missing. CONNOR looks on impassively. Even as-- THOUSANDS MORE now stipple the barren landscape. All headless, in period dress spanning untold centuries. The forgotten casualties of an endless, impossible war. Connor nods solemnly. CONNOR Soon. He blinks. The specters are gone. TIME LAPSE ON CONNOR: DAY becomes NIGHT becomes DAY. And still he sits there, unmoved, as if ready to embrace the rest of eternity from this one desolate spot. TRANSITION TO: EXT - CEMETERY RIDGE - DAY Connor remains sitting against the tree as A SHADOW slices over him. He slowly tilts his gaze upward. Squints. DUNCAN (O.S.) There's supposed to be an end to all this, right? A final answer... Duncan slides down next to him. Gazes out at the trackless ocean. DUNCAN Isn't that the "prize" we're all butchering each other to win? CONNOR I already know the answer. The "prize"-- the real prize-- is just to close your eyes and see nothing. DUNCAN I don't believe that. CONNOR You think the Game is still about good against evil? A better world? Look around. Who among us really deserves to win? DUNCAN Not Jacob Kase. CONNOR And who's going to stop him? You? Me? DUNCAN There has to be a way. Connor looks off. Nods. CONNOR Oh, there's a way, kinsman. There's a way. But I don't believe you have the guts to take it. DUNCAN Try me. Connor stands up. Offers a hand to Duncan. Hauls him upright. CONNOR Alright then. HE SUDDENLY LASHES OUT WITH HIS SWORD. Duncan barely catches Connor's blade with his own. DUNCAN What're you doing?! CONNOR Don't you know? The better of us will take the other's gift. Pray it'll be enough. Duncan lowers his blade. DUNCAN I won't do it. CONNOR Then you'll die. Again, Connor STRIKES. Again, Duncan barely escapes with his head. And settles into a fighting stance. DUNCAN It can't end like this! CONNOR It already has. Goodbye, brother. He SWINGS FOR DUNCAN'S NECK. Steel RINGS against steel. Clansman against clansman. CUT TO: INT - CHURCH SANCTUARY - DAY Faith sits in a center pew, head bowed, deep in thought. Or prayer. Hard to tell with somebody like Faith. Kase sits down beside her. KASE You were with him. He curls his nose, as if he can still smell the sin. KASE (cont'd) Woman is a temple built upon a sewer. FAITH Glad I can help you feel a bit better about yourself there, Jacob. KASE Remember what you were when I first found you? A whore. Now look. A liberated woman. FAITH Fuck you. Kase runs a delicate finger across her neck. KASE Be grateful I don't this minute remove your pretty little heafod. FAITH (looks up, cold) Holy ground, lover. It's a bitch, ain't it? CUT TO: EXT - CEMETERY RIDGE - DAY Two figures dot the faraway ridge as the savage music of their swordplay PEALS out across the barren countryside. MOVING CLOSER, we watch these timeless warriors exchange strikes that would drive lesser men into the ground. Each gifted in his own way, neither gaining full advantage over the other... . . . they both gradually succumb to EXHAUSTION. CLOSER: Connor and Duncan finally lower their swords, panting and spent. DUNCAN (hollow rasp) Enough? CONNOR (barely audible) Enough... And that's as much as either can say as they suck back great gulping lungfulls of air. A little color finally returns to Duncan's cheeks. He mops his face with his sleeve. DUNCAN Next time I won't hold back. CONNOR Nor I. Dragging his sword like a half-ton barbell, Duncan turns and makes his way back toward the "resting tree. CONNOR closes his eyes and HOISTS HIS SWORD... CONNoR (whispered) Remember well, old friend. DUNCAN feels, more than sees, the ONCOMING BLADE. He turns into the ARC of CONNOR'S SWING-- SLOW MOTION He reacts on pure instinct, SWORD LIFTING, BODY PIVOTING with the DRIVING FORCE of CONNOR'S THRUST... FLASH TO: CONNOR TEACHING THAT SAME MOVE TO DUNCAN BACK IN 1627. FLASH BACK TO: CONNOR'S SWORD as it GRAZES Duncans side. DUNCAN'S KATANA SWINGS UP with the same vicious thrust, CATCHES CONNOR UNDER THE CHIN... Connor doesn't flinch. TIME SUSPENDS the instant before blade meets flesh... CONNOR'S VOICE The game is not about survival, Duncan. It's about living. In the end, it's all that matters. REAL TIME-- THE BLADE CUTS CLEAN THROUGH CONNOR'S NECK WITH UNSTOPPABLE MOMENTUM. Duncan CRIES OUT as he follows through, BLOOD staining his blade with the crushing reality of what he has just committed. He sinks to his knees... . . . and SCREAMS TO THE HEAVENS. The heavens answer back with THUNDER, LIGHTNING and GALE FORCE WINDS that seem to come from everywhere at once. PURE ESSENCE-- --HOWLS out of CONNOR'S BODY. DUNCAN CON-NORRRRRRR!! It SURGES UPWARD into endless SHEETS of LIGHTNING. Duncan CONVULSES at the epicenter of a GROWING CLASH between EARTH and SKY. SHOCKWAVES POUND through his skull, triggering A LAST FLEETING VISION OF CONNOR MACLEOD: Walking with Heather across an open field. He turns and looks back at Duncan. CONNOR'S EYES shine with a look of ultimate peace and transcendence. He seems to be gazing straight into Duncan's soul. And smiling at what he sees as-- A FINAL BLAST OF ESSENCE RIPS through Duncan's BRAIN. EXT - HIGHRISE - NIGHT DISSOLVE TO: Duncan stands alone on the rooftop, stripped to the waist, moving slowly through an elaborate kata. The precision of his movement belies the chaos inside him. He windmills the katana over his head, faster and faster, until he suddenly RELEASES IT-- THE SWORD PINWHEELS through the night sky, arcing out across the open space between buildings... Duncan watches its long, lofting trajectory... . ..then takes off RUNNING. He reaches the edge of the rooftop and LEAPS. WIDE Legs cycling through empty air, he traces a matching arc directly under the far-flung sword. Like a long-jumper stretching for that last inch of sand, Duncan HYPER-EXTENDS for the next rooftop. EXT - NEXT ROOFTOP HIS LEADING FOOT hits the edge-- digs in, pivots and sets. HIS HAND THRUSTS UPWARD as the sword grip SLAPS INTO HIS OPEN PALM. Fingers wrap around the ivory hilt, slowly lowering it down to eye-level. GO IN CLOSE ON THOSE EYES and see a new Duncan MacLeod. Stronger. Deadlier. A man cooly aware of his own destiny. CUT TO: EXT - ARMORY - DAY Dawson's car pulls up to the generic cinderblock building that now stands unguarded and abandoned. INT - ARMORY - DAY Dawson enters, squints into the darkness. The interior looks as if it's stood fallow for the last three decades. No giger-chair, no gothic restraints. No evidence the Watchers ever took up temporary residence here. Except for MATTHEW, who emerges from the stale halflight to confront Dawson. MATTHEW I'm a bit surprised to see you again. All things considered. Dawson just stands there, hands plunged inside his coat pockets. MATTHEW (cont'd) As you can see, we had to move on. Find a new Sanctuary. DAWSON It's wrong. What you're doing. It's inhuman. MATTHEW Ah, but they're not human, really. Are they? DAWSON Gimme a reason, Matthew. MATTHEW It's for the good of us all. You know that. DAWSON Gimme a reason. Matthew cocks his head like the RCA dog. MATTHEW Because we must. It's that simple. And if you get in our way again, there will be very serious consequences. DAWSON Gimme a good reason. Matthew pulls a gun. Aims it at Dawson's heart. MATTHEW I'm sorry to have to do this, Joe. He pulls the trigger... as TWO SLUGS pound into his chest. Matthew topples backward, dead. Dawson palms the gun still concealed in his coat pocket. Nods. DAWSON Reason enough. CUT TO: EXT - NEW YORK STREET - DAY Kase is roaring through narrow streets in a low-slung convertible, Faith at his side. With utter disregard for speed or care, he guns it madly in shrieking turns. INT - CONVERTIBLE, DRIVING Faith grips the dashboard two-handed. FAITH Slow down. KASE Adrenalin's good for the sex drive. FAITH I'm not amused, Jacob. She reaches over and slaps on her shoulder harness. KASE Thought maybe you needed a little more excitement. You know, spice up our relationship a bit. WIDE He OVERSTEERS, caroms off several parked cars, recovers... KASE (cont'd) I mean, isn't that why you went back to Duncan MacLeod? The risk? FAITH I don't know what you're trying to prove. Kase puts an arm around her shoulder... KASE Why do I have to prove anything to you? .... as his foot flattens the accelerator. ENGINE WHINES. KASE (cont'd) I can have anything I want already. FAITH Except me. And that bugs the shit out of you, doesn't it? KASE Not really. AT THE NEXT TURN it's clear he'll never make it, he's going too fast. Kase only smiles. Releasing the wheel, he stands in his seat, lifts his arms above his head and SHOUTS in exultation as-- --the car EXPLODES into the wall. It's all over in a breath. Accordioned metal, drooling radiator, and Faith, slumped over the dash. Kase lies sprawled and battered on the pavement, thrown some distance from the wreckage. He's clearly taken the worst of the impact. FAITH stirs and slowly wrenches herself free of the smoking mangle of steel and plastic. She reaches back and pulls Kase's sword free of the wreckage. With single-minded determination, she limps over to Kase's body, face-up in his own pooling blood. A disbelieving PEDESTRIAN pauses in shock. Faith gives her a twisted smile. FAITH Don't mind us. Pedestrian SCURRIES OFF as Faith lifts the sword over her head and brings it WHISTLING DOWN across Kase's neck. With inhuman reflexes, Kase awakens and catches her wrist in the same heartbeat. Eyes narrow. KASE Does this mean it's over? DISSOLVE TO: EXT - KASE'S CHURCH - DAY Kase steps up to the back entrance, alone. THE DOOR hangs slightly ajar, which clearly disturbs him. INT - CHURCH SANCTUARY - DAY Kase enters the main room to find Calvin and Sarge asleep on their pews. He kicks the first pew, awakens both with a start. KASE Who left the back door open? CALVIN Huh? Kase looks to Sarge. SARGE I dunno. KASE Where's Cracker Bob? He was supposed to be watching the back. Calvin and Sarge both shrug. KASE (cont'd) (sotto) Infants. He whirls, stalks out. INT - SACRISTY Kase enters his dark, cluttered office, SLAMMING the door behind him. FLICKS ON THE LIGHT and stops cold. A SWORD JUTS from a small wooden table... . . . right through CRACKER BOB, who lies skewered to the tabletop. WRAPPED AROUND THE SWORDHILT is Caiolin MacLeods unique silver-and-wood CRUCIFIX. The message is not lost on Kase. BOB'S EYES suddenly flutter open. First thing he sees is that sword hilt sticking rudely out of his own chest. CRACKER BOB Ah-- Ahhh-- AHHHHHHH!! KASE Shut up. He reaches forward and JERKS the sword out of Bob, and with it A SINGLE SCRAP OF PAPER impaled on the blade. It bears just one word, scrawled in Bob's plentiful blood. GLENFINNAN Bob sits up on the table, wild-eyed, as Kase calmly opens his fingers and lets the paper slide from his fingers. CUT TO: EXT - LITTLE ITALY, ESTABLISHING - NIGHT Glitter lights and milling tourists. Row upon row of gimmicky Italian restaurants. INT - ITALIAN RESTAURANT, PRIVATE ROOM - NIGHT Jacob Kase and his acolytes dine at a long table set against a gaudy backdrop of faux Roman ruins, babbling fountains and plastic holly. It all imparts a whiff of "Last Supper" pomp to the proceeding. Which is not lost on the other Immortals, who glance around warily while eating, as suspicious of each other as they are of Kase. Nor does anyone miss the fact that there are no windows in this particular room. CLOSE ON WINSTON He stares into his pasta, beading sweat. BENEATH THE TABLE his fingers curl around the cold steel of a .38 SPECIAL wedged between his knees. He inches the gun upward toward the table rim as... Kase suddenly stands up in the center. KASE A toast... All heads turn. Gun freezes in Winston's lap, just hidden from view. KASE (cont'd) I see tonight as a celebration of the spirit. (raises his glass) Here's to all of you who continue to stand by me... (smiles at Winston) . . . even those who might waver at times. Winston stiffens, fears that Kase is on to him. And when Calvin averts his gaze, he knows. Still, he raises his glass. As do the others. KASE (cont'd) You are my flock. You nourish my soul. It's now or never for Winston. His moment of truth. Kase's eyes slowly drift over to meet his. SLOW MOTION, Kase tips back his glass and drinks, eyes locked on Winston. Winston responds in kind, gulping down his wine as he slips the gun back into his pocket. He shoves off from the table. WINSTON Excuse me. KASE Where you going? WINSTON Toilet. KASE Sit sit. I'm not through with my toast yet. WINSTON Can't wait. He angles for the door. KASE I'm almost finished. Sit. Winston reaches for the doorknob. Locked. He swivels back. Sees death in Jacob Kase's eyes. His death. KASE (cont'd) It'll all be over in a few more seconds. A cold spike of fear shoots through every single one of them... . . . as Kase continues. KASE (cont'd) Youve all been a part of a great quest. A four hundred year quest for justice. He lifts up an exquisitely-crafted sword. KASE (cont'd) And here, my friends, is the instrument of that justice. It's called the "Colichmarde." Finest sword known to man. The blade WHISTLES upright. KASE (cont'd) Blessed by Popes and baptized in blood. I only break it out for special occasions. He kisses the perfect cross formed by the juncture of blade and quillons. KASE (cont'd) It sings like an angel. Just listen. Winston jerks for his gun. In a SUDDEN BLUR of STEEL and BLOOD, Kase beheads Winston and dispatches the next two of his stunned acolytes with blinding efficiency. TONGUES OF LIQUID ENERGY coil up and around Kase's body. But he keeps right on coming. The others scatter like roaches. ESSENCE PULSES off walls and ceiling, SHATTERING STATUARY, HURLING FURNITURE... . ..before MERGING with the WALKING INFERNO that is now Jacob Kase. His sword BLAZES through the remaining victims, trailing STREAKS OF BLUE FIRE. One after another, they drop headless to the concrete, triggering A FULL-ON MULTIPLE-QUICKENING. THE NEXT WAVE OF ESSENCE SLAMS into Kase front on. His knees BUCKLE. ANOTHER Hits him BROADSIDE, buffeting him one way as YET ANOTHER POUNDS him from the opposite- side, rocking him back center and IMMOBILIZING HIM inside an omni-directional CRUSH of LIGHT AND SOUND that WHITES OUT THE FRAME. DISSOLVE TO: EXT - SCOTTISH HIGHLANDS - DAY A THICK CLINGING FOG, enshrouds the rocky highlands. Somewhere along the invisible coastline below, a foghorn MOANS. The skeletal remains of an ancient Gaelic CASTLE loom spectral gray above JACOB KASE who stands before an ANCIENT CELTIC MONOLITH (familiar from Glenfinnan's town square) revelling in the changeless land of his birth. KASE (calling out) Where else could stir the blood of a Scotsman too long of this earth and too far from home? Kase picks his way across the uneven ground, unable to see beyond the reach of his own arm. KASE (cont'd) (filling his lungs) I can nae get enough of it. He draws his sword, extends it outward until the tip disappears from sight. A LOW SCRAPING OF METAL ON STONE taunts him from somewhere out there in the slow-drifting whiteness Kase's sword TWITCHES toward the SOUND. Just the FAINTEST OUTLINE of a FIGURE COALESCES BRIEFLY inside the fog. KASE Ah, what's this? Hamlet's ghost? The FIGURE melts back into silent nothingness. KASE (cont'd) I'm afraid even the cloak of fog won't help you overcome a sizeable disadvantage. A DIFFERENT SCRAPING SOUND spins him around to see ANOTHER GHOSTLY FIGURE looming over him from a narrow stone outcropping. Kase masks a slight tinge of concern. KASE (cont'd) It's always good to see two fellow clansmen banded together in a common cause. But I hope you haven't sunk to the level of a simultaneous ambush. Once again, the figure steps backward into the enveloping fog. Disappears. Slightly unnerved, Kase jerks around. No sign of anyone. Just that infernal mist. A SOFT SCRAPING of SWORD against ROCK swivels him back around to his original position. CLOSE ON KASE His nerves are starting to shred. He turns several full rotations, craning for a glimpse of his tormentors. And then he sees it... AN APPARITION WIELDING A SWORD. Kase LUNGES for it. And this time, it doesn't retreat. Swords CLANG in thunderous overture as TWO SPECTRES IN THE FOG battle for position on tenuous footing. KASE drives his adversary backward into a BLUNTED STONE WALL, leaving him no avenue of escape. Their swords LOCK UP and Kase suddenly finds himself FACE TO FACE WITH-- DUNCAN MACLEOD. You can sense Kase's bitter disappointment. KASE Not at all who I'd hoped for. CLOSE ON DUNCAN'S EYES as they flick to a point iust behind Kase's head. CLOSE ON KASE'S EYES as he realizes he's been had. He SWINGS FULLY AROUND TO FACE CONNOR-- --and sees that NOBODY'S THERE! Too late-- he SWINGS BACK TO DUNCAN-- and IMPALES HIMSELF ON DUNCAN'S SWORD. DUNCAN (through clenched teeth) I'm afraid Connor couldn't be here. But don't worry, he's with us in spirit. Still gripping his sword two-fisted, Duncan seems to surge with newfound strength. DUNCAN He gave himself for this moment. And I shan't let him down. Duncan SHOVES OFF from Kase and goes to work on him with a VENGEANCE. WHAT KASE SEES: A frightening, hallucinitory vision of a DUAL ADVERSARY-- one that CHANGES back and forth in the flux of swirling mist. As Duncan's blade BLURS PAST, Kase sees CONNOR. With the very next SWING, he sees Duncan again. Then Connor. Then Duncan. Connor. Duncan... Kase rubs his eyes with the back of his hand. Shakes it off. Can't be. Duncan buffets Kase backward with several dazzling combinations, then goes inside, tough and ugly. Kase seems suddenly overwhelmed, physically and mentally, as he's driven onto his back by sheer relentless overdrive. Duncan SLASHES DOWN for the killing blow, which Kase BARELY DEFLECTS. He SLASHES AGAIN. And AGAIN. Each time Kase barely escapes with his head intact. Duncan keeps up this relentless barrage, hacking down in every conceivable direction, looking for an opening, finding none. With each increasingly-leaden DOWNSTROKE, Duncan is losing strength... . . . and Kase is regaining his. Kase BATTLES BACK TO HIS FEET, deftly siezes the advantage. KASE (savage smile) This is not a game won on points, I'm afraid. He drives Duncan back with an answering exchange that leaves no doubt of his superior ability. In a single massive THRUST, Kase STRIPS Duncan's sword and sends him flying. Duncan lands on his back, weaponless. Kase steps up to the katana, scoops his toe under it and FLICKS IT BACK TO DUNCAN. Then waves him back to his feet. A cat playing with his prey. Both combatants square off... and RESUME. KASE That's the beauty of eternity. The fun never stops. He THRUSTS-- spiking Duncan clear through the shoulder. Duncan hangs up on the blade, unable to move. Grimaces in pain. Setting boot to chest, Kase KICKS Duncan off his sword and sends him spiralling backward. Duncan reaches out to break his fall-- --but there's no ground beneath him. He PLUMMETS OFF a SLANTED CLIFF. Bounces at fifty feet, then tumbles clear to the bottom. Kase steps up to the edge, scowls. A FRESHLY-CUT QUARRY has been hewn from the hilltop by the massive sword of modern technology. EARTH MOVING EQUIPMENT several stories tall lines the inner basin. KASE What have they done to my mountain?! He gazes down at DUNCAN'S BODY sprawled at the base of the cliff. Then starts down after him. EXT - BOTTOM OF QUARRY - DAY Duncan crawls over to his sword... . . . as Kase picks his way down the steep incline. Duncan spikes his sword into the ground and uses it to climb upright. One look at his battered body and you know this fight is over. He just stands there, hunched over his sword, grimly waiting for Kase to reach him and deliver the killing blow. It doesn't take long. Kase stops, regards him with contempt. KASE Don't make it easy. I hate that. DUNCAN Youre breaking my heart. KASE Pick up! Duncan shakes his blood-streaked head. KASE PICK UP! DUNCAN It's always been too easy for you, Kase. No reason this time should be any different. He plucks his sword out of the ground... . . . and TURNS HIS BACK TO KASE. DUNCAN (cont'd) Take your best shot. He hobbles off, sword hanging limp at his side. Kase starts TREMBLING WITH RAGE. KASE MACLEOD! Duncan ignores him, keeps walking. About now, we should have a pretty good idea what Duncan has in mind. But Kase doesn't have a clue. DUNCAN'S POV: For a fleeting moment, Connor stands before Duncan, more mist than flesh. He opens his arms wide. CONNOR'S APPARITION Remember weil, old friend. He DISSOLVES AWAY as Kase hoists sword over shoulder... KASE (cont'd) MAC-LEOD!! . ..and CHARGES... Which is exactly what Duncan expected. USING THE SAME MOVE CONNOR TAUGHT HIM-- --Duncan PIVOTS WITH the THRUST, catching Kase completely off guard and off balance. This time, no force of man or nature can keep Duncan's sword from hitting home. He SLICES UPWARD with a ROAR OF DEFIANCE... . ..and FOLLOWS THROUGH. ON KASE: He stands there, head miraculously still intact, a look of bewildered relief. Duncan simply POPS his sword butt into Kase's face. The head comes easily away from the neck and falls. KASE'S POV spins END OVER END through the air, bounces twice and comes to a rest SIDEWAYS. And that's how we first see his HEADLESS BODY, sprawled across the ground. KASE'S SEVERED HEAD blinks with sudden recognition. And now he knows. This is the worst part of losing your head-- those last few seconds of cold lucidity. DUNCAN opens his arms to HEAVES UNDERFOOT. WIDE - THE QUARRY the ULTIMATE OUICKENING as THE EARTH WALLS EXPLODE like a circle of VOLCANOES venting into the center. Duncan CLAWS UPWARD on a GROUNDSWELL OF RAW ENERGY as DIRT, ROCK, ASH and SMOKE OBLITERATE THE BASIN. The SEISMIC CONVULSIONS GRADUALLY SUBSIDE. The dust settles. And the blighted landscape falls into an unearthly SILENCE, blind to its own buried secrets. HOLD on the trailing wisps of smoke as THE GROUND SHUDDERS and DUNCAN'S KATANA BREAKS THE SURFACE. It PLUNGES UPWARD ONE, TWO, THREE MORE TIMES, pulverizing dirt and stone. HANDS FOLLOW, clawing their up way through the loosely- mounded earth until DUNCAN'S HEAD AND SHOULDERS APPEAR. As if the earth itself is giving birth to a new generation of Immortal. He rolls out onto the ground, gasping, triumphant. Reborn. One inch at a time, he slowly rises to his feet. As we KEEP ON RISING up into a FIERY HIGHLAND SUNSET. TILT BACK DOWN TO: EXT - HIGHLANDS ABOVE GLENFINNAN Duncan stands over a freshly-dug grave. Onto the simple stone, he's chisled: HEATHER MACLEOD BELOVED WIFE OF CONNOR And beneath it: CONNOR MACLEOD BELOVED HUSBAND OF HEATHER Duncan's eyes glisten with an unspeakable loss. And a comfort in knowing that his friend has finally found the peace of eternity. DUNCAN yours is the greater prize my friend. Welcome home. LINGER ON DUNCAN as we DISSOLVE SLOWLY TO... EXT - MANHATTAN SKYLINE - DAWN FAITH stands sentinel-like atop a bluff overlooking the Hudson River and the insignificant island of Manhattan beyond. Her trademark slashes of facepaint and hair dye have been shed like molted skin. What remains is a serene beauty that defies fashion or vanity. Her faraway eyes BLINK with a sudden, frightening clarity. THE BUZZ sets her reflexes snapping as she SPINS AROUND-- --and CATCHES the COLICHMARDE, handle first. DUNCAN follows, strolling toward her with hands loose at his side. Faith runs her finger down the shimmering blade. FAITH (considers) So... what am I supposed to do next -- kiss you or take your head? Duncan steps up to her, smiling enigmatically. DUNCAN The choice is yours. FADE OUT: THE END

    OVER DARKNESS...                                                  1

    ...we hear what we will come to know as the VOICE OF THE
    GUIDE.
                 GUIDE VOICE
         It is an important and popular fact that
         things are not always what they seem.

    A small square image appears on screen.    Home video.      The
    dolphin stadium at Sea World.

                 GUIDE VOICE (CONT'D)
         For instance, on the planet Earth, man had
         always assumed that he was the most
         intelligent species occupying the planet,
         instead of the third most intelligent
         which was, in fact, entirely accurate.

    The dolphins perform; leaping through hoops, etc.

                 GUIDE VOICE (CONT'D)
         The second most intelligent creatures
         were, of course, dolphins who curiously
         enough had long known of the impending
         destruction of the planet Earth. They had
         made many attempts to alert mankind to the
         danger, but most of their communications
         were misinterpreted as amusing attempts to
         punch footballs or whistle for tidbits, so
         they eventually decided they would leave
         Earth by their own means.

    They leap madly, desperately. Higher and higher...

                 GUIDE VOICE (CONT'D)
         The last ever dolphin message was
         misinterpreted as a surprisingly
         sophisticated attempt to do a double-
         backward somersault through a hoop while
         whistling the "Star-Spangled Banner" but
         in fact the message was this...
         "So long and thanks for all the fish."

    TITLES ROLL - (FULL SCREEN 35mm IMAGES)

    Dolphins leap over and interact with the opening titles.
    Breathtaking somersaults, back flips, choreographed to a
    Buzby Berkley-style song called, "SO LONG AND THANKS FOR
    ALL THE FISH." We end with a wide shot of all the
    dolphins jumping out of the top of frame, but they never
    come back down. TILT UP to a starry night sky - the
    dolphins have vanished.

    END TITLES

    As night turns to morning, we hear CLICK, then...

                         VOICE ON RADIO
                 ...as well as Sea World Orlando and San
                 Diego reporting their dolphins have
                 mysteriously disappeared overnight.

    INT. ARTHUR DENT'S BEDROOM - MORNING                        2

    CLOSE ON the clock radio from which the voice emanates.
    A hand shuts it off. ARTHUR DENT is awake. 30's. Kind
    faced. His feet land perfectly in slippers as he stands
    and shuffles out of his very neat but very boring room.

3   IN THE BATHROOM - Arthur gargles in front of the mirror.    3
    He bends over to spit revealing a YELLOW BULLDOZER
    through the window, crawling toward his house. A TEA
    KETTLE WHISTLES O.S.

4   INT. ARTHUR DENT'S KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS                     4

    Arthur sets the newspaper (with the headline "DOLPHINS
    VANISH") on the table, removes the kettle. Doesn't notice
    through the window 3 MORE LARGE YELLOW BULLDOZERS.

    He pours a cup of tea, sets the pot down next o his
    mobile phone. He picks it up, stares at a DIGITAL PHOTO
    ON THE SCREEN of himself and a very pretty woman (Tricia)
    at a costume party.

    He presses the phone to his head as if it were a cold
    compress. Suddenly, there's a LOUD RUMBLING o.s. The
    tea cup RATTLES. Arthur looks out the window. Now he
    sees the bulldozers.

    The tea cup shatters on the floor.
                                                     CUT TO:
5   EXT. ARTHUR DENT'S HOUSE - MORNING                          5

    Arthur, dressed in pajamas and robe, lies in the dirt in
    front of a bulldozer, blocking it from destroying his
    house. He yells into his mobile phone.

                       ARTHUR
                  (into phone)
              What do you mean he's gone out to lunch?
              You just said he was still at breakfast!

    MR. PROSSER, a bureaucrat, leans over him.

                      PROSSER
              Come off it, Mr. Dent. You can't lie in
              front of the bulldozers forever.

                      ARTHUR
              I'm game. We'll see who rusts first.

                      PROSSER
              This bypass has got to be built and it's
              going to be built. You should have made
              your protest months ago.

                      ARTHUR
              The first I heard of it was when a workman
              came yesterday. I asked if he'd come to
              clean the windows, and he said he'd come
              to demolish the house. He didn't tell me
              right away of course. First he wiped a
              couple of windows and charged me twenty
              quid. Then he told me.
                                                (CONTINUED)

    CONTINUED:                                                   5

    The bulldozer driver, looking guilty, ducks behind the
    steering wheel. Prosser removes plans from his briefcase.

                         PROSSER
                 Look. These plans have been on display at
                 the planning office now for a year.

                         ARTHUR
                 On display? I had to go down to a cellar!

                         PROSSER
                 That's the display department.

                         ARTHUR
                 I eventually found them in the bottom of a
                 locked filing cabinet in a disused
                 lavatory with a sign on the door saying
                 'beware of the leopard'.

                         PROSSER
                 Mr. Dent, have you any idea how much
                 damage that bulldozer would suffer if I
                 just let it roll straight over you?

                         ARTHUR
                 How much?

                         PROSSER
                 None at all.

                         FORD (O.S.)
                   (American accent)
                 Arthur!

    Arthur and Prosser turn to see a man cresting a hill,
    pushing a shopping cart which is filled with beer and
    bags of peanuts. This is FORD PREFECT. Wiry, intense.
    As he heads downhill, he leaps up and rides the cart down
    towards Arthur's house -- like a kid in a supermarket.
    He rolls right past Arthur and the bulldozers.

                         ARTHUR
                 Ford?

    He leaps off, drags the cart to a full stop.

                         FORD
                 Arthur! There you are. Here drink and
                 eat with me. We need to talk.

                         ARTHUR
                 Er, um...now's not the best time, Ford
                 They're going to demolish my home,

                          FORD
                 Whoa.   You already know? How?

    Arthur simply motions to the bulldozer.

               Oh. When you say "they" you mean they.
               Got it. Listen, I gotta tell you
               something important, and I gotta tell you
               now.

                       ARTHUR
               But what about my house?

    Ford looks to Prosser who is conferring with the
    bulldozer driver. He pushes the cart over to him.

    ARTHUR - watches as Ford gestures to Prosser who waves
    his hand and the all the 'dozer engines die.
    The bulldozer drivers step down, start drinking the beer
    and eating the peanuts. Ford returns to Arthur.

                      FORD
              C'mon. Let's go to the pub. He said they
              won't destroy your house until they've
              finished the beers.

                      ARTHUR
              Can we trust him?

                       FORD
               I'd trust him to the end of the Earth.

                      ARTHUR
              And how far's that?

                      FORD
              About twelve minutes away.

                                                                CUT TO:

    Ford and Arthur enter the half-full pub. Ford hurries to
    the bar. Arthur follows, cell phone to his ear.

                      FORD
              Six pints of bitter. And quickly.      The
              world's about to end.

                       BARMAN
               Oh yes, sir? Nice weather for it.

    He starts to pull pints. Ford shoves bar peanuts into
    his pockets while Arthur shouts into his phone...

                      ARTHUR
              Well, when does he get back from lunch?
              Or is he going straight out for tea?!

    He shuts the phone, sits, looking forlorn.

                      ARTHUR (CONT'D)
              This is shaping up to be a crap day.

                         FORD
                 It's about to get a lot crappier.

                         BARMAN
                 There you are, six pints.

    Ford slaps down a £50 note. The barman's impressed.

                         FORD
                 Keep the change. You've got ten minutes to
                 spend it.

    Ford pushes three pints in front of Arthur.

                         ARTHUR
                 Three? At lunchtime?

                         FORD
                 Time is an illusion. Lunchtime doubly so.

                         ARTHUR
                 Very deep. You should send that in to the
                 Reader's Digest. They've got a page for
                 people like you.

                         FORD
                 Drink up.

                         ARTHUR
                 Why three pints?

                         FORD
                 Muscle relaxant.
                    (grabbing more peanuts)
                 And eat these. You'll need the salt.

                         ARTHUR
                 What's going on. Ford?

                         FORD
                 What would you say if I told you I wasn't
                 really from Guilford but from a small
                 planet somewhere in the vicinity of
                 Eetelgeuse?

                         ARTHUR
                 Why, is it the sort of thing you're likely
                 to say?

                         FORD
                 Remember when we met? That car was racing
                 toward me, I was trying to greet it, you
                 pushed me out of the way?

         QUICK CUT TO A STREET - MID-DAY                                  7

         Ford stands in the middle of the road, extending a hand
         to a fast approaching car.
         Arthur drops his shopping, dives at him and tackles him
         out of the way as the car zooms past.

(6 cont) BACK TO FORD IN THE PUB:                                      (6 cont)

                           FORD
                   Didn't you find it a little strange that I
                   was trying to shake hands with a car?

                           ARTHUR
                   I assumed you were drunk.

                           FORD
                      (shaking his head)
                   I thought cars were the dominant life
                   form. I was trying to introduce myself.

                           ARTHUR
                   And that's why you're named after a
                   discontinued car from the seventies?

                           FORD
                      (nodding)
                   You saved my life that day.      Now I'm
                   saving yours.

         Arthur just stares at him, then turns to his beer.

                           ARTHUR
                   This must be Thursday. I never could get
                   the hang of Thursdays.

                           FORD
                   Look, if it's about your house...

                           ARTHUR
                   No, it's not that.    It's....

         He shows Ford the photo of he and Tricia on his phone.

                           ARTHUR (CONT'D)
                   I found her. Ford. The perfect girl. I
                   found her, and then I let her get away.
                   You remember that fancy dress party I told
                   you about?

                           FORD
                   This isn't a long story, is it? We've
                   only got six minutes.

         Arthur shakes his head.    Ford checks his watch.

              Okay.     Talk and drink. Fancy dress party.

                      ARTHUR
              At that flat in Islington. I told you
              about it. Last week, remember?

                                                    FLASHBACK TO:

8   INT. ISLINGTON FLAT - NIGHT                                     8

    Crowded flat.    Everyone is in costume.   Loud music BLARES.

                       ARTHUR (V.O.)
               I can't bear those sort of parties, didn't
               want to go, would have much rather stayed
               home and, I don't know, brush the dog.
               Anything. But there I was -- and then,
               there she was...

    Arthur, dressed in safari attire complete with pith helmet,
    sits off to the side, observing, looking miserable.

                       TRICIA (O.S.)
               Who are you?

    Arthur looks up. TRICIA MCMILLAN is dressed in a mid
    19th century mens suit with mutton chop sideburns and is
    holding a taxidermy beagle -- and she still looks
    beautiful.   Arthur, ever the gentleman, stands.

                       ARTHUR
               I'm Arthur. Arthur Dent.

                       TRICIA
               No, I mean who are you?

                       ARTHUR
               Oh, the costume. Right. Er, um...
                  (sheepishly tipping his hat)
               Livingston, I presume.
                   (pointing to her attire)
               Granted. Not as clever as Darwin, but the
               best I could do on short notice.

                       TRICIA
               You're the first person who's got it
               right. Everyone keeps calling me
               Sherlock.

                      ARTHUR
              Really? I thought the beagle made it
              rather obvious.

    THE BALCONY -- Arthur has just taken a digital photo of
    he and Tricia on his cell phone. They look at the screen
    image and laugh.

                         ARTHUR (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                 She was amazing, Ford. Witty, and
                 beautiful, and brilliant. Four or five
                 degrees. One in math, one in astrophysics,
                 another in biology...

                 I've got so many degrees I am officially
                 unemployable. Let's drink to that!

    They clink their wine glasses, take sips, continue to chat.

                 And just as I was asking myself, "Why is
                 this stunning and intelligent woman even
                 giving me the time of day, out of nowhere
                 she says...

                 Let's go somewhere.

                         ARTHUR
                 Yeah. It is a bit noisy. There's a
                 lovely little cafe around the corner...

                         TRICIA
                 I was thinking Madagascar.

                         ARTHUR
                 Is that a new club on Dean Street?

                         TRICIA
                 No. It's a country.    Off the coast of
                 Africa.

                         ARTHUR
                 Oh, that Madagascar. Right, off we go

                          ARTHUR (CONT'D)
                  Well...that's...an extraordinary
                  proposition. But...I can't just up and
                  go. What about my job?

                           TRICIA
                  Quit.   Get a new one when we return.

                          ARTHUR
                  I can't just...what about my house?     Who
                  would feed my dog?

                          TRICIA
                  Bring him with.

                          ARTHUR
                  He's a Welsh Collie.   He'd feel all out of
                  place in Madagascar.

     Trillian forces a smile, clearly disappointed.

                          ZAPHOD (O.S.)
                  You don't want to go to Madagascar.

     They both turn to face ZAPHOD BEEBLEBROX - very charming,
     extremely handsome - whose attire seems very "other
     worldly." Knee high boots, a yellow sash...

                      (pulling a blinking electronic
                       device from his satchel)
                   We've got two minutes. So drink up.

      There's a ROAR OF ENGINES and a LOUD CRASH outside.
      Arthur and everyone else in the pub look up.

                           ARTHUR
                   My house!

      He runs out. Ford rises, grabs two handfuls of peanuts from
      the bowl, tosses the barman all the money in his pocket.

                           FORD
                   A round for everyone, on me.

                           BARMAN
                   You really think the world's going to end?
                      (Ford nods)
                   Shouldn't we lie down or put a bag over
                   our heads or something?

                           FORD
                   If you want.

                           BARMAN
                   Will it help?

                           FORD
                   Not really.

      He gives everyone in the bar a friendly salute, exits.

                           BARMAN
                   Last orders, then?

11    EXT. STREET OUTSIDE THE PUB - MID-DAY                         11

      Arthur runs up the road towards his house which is being
      bulldozed. Ford strides casually behind in the distance.

                            ARTHUR
                   STOP!   STOP, YOU BASTARDS!!

      Arthur suddenly stops running and covers his ears as we
      hear THE LOUDEST RUMBLE IN MOTION PICTURE HISTORY.

11a   A GIGANTIC YELLOW SPACESHIP (picture a concrete tower         11a
      block)) sweeps overhead. Ford hits the deck. Arthur is
      blown sideways. Trees are uprooted.

      Ford rises and hurries to the rubble that was Arthur's
      house. He digs around near the exposed toilet and comes
      up with -- A TOWEL. He hurries to Arthur's side.

         Another ship screams over, blowing them down again. Rain
         is knocked out of the clouds and lands in one big THWUMP!
         Everywhere is soaked.

                      picked up their signal this morning.

         He shows Arthur his blinking Sens-0-Matic device.

                      Here.   You'll need this.

         He tosses Arthur the towel. Then, he removes a short
         black rod, his ELECTRONIC THUMB. He sticks it out.

                    about it. The plans and demolition orders

        Like a giant casino going down in Vegas, there are a few
        small explosions AMD THE EARTH IMPLODES. Just collapses
        in on itself. Gone.

        The Vogon ships slowly retreat in formation, leaving
        nothing but DARKNESS AND STARS.

21      Then a distant RED GLOW appears. As it gets nearer we       21
        see that it says..."THE HITCHHIKERS GUIDE TO THE GALAXY."

                             GUIDE VOICE
                     The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy is a
                     wholly remarkable book...

        The title draws nearer. We see that it sits on an
        electronic book with lots of buttons.

                             GUIDE VOICE (CONT'D)
                     ...Perhaps the most remarkable, certainly
                     the most successful book ever to come out
                     of the great publishing corporations of
                     Ursa Minor.

        The book opens revealing TWO SCREENS. Images appear. A
        star map, layers of data, captions, video, animations...

                             GUIDE VOICE (CONT'D)
                     More popular than the CELESTIAL HOME CARE
                     OMNIBUS, better selling than 53 MORE
                     THINGS TO DO IN ZERO GRAVITY, and more
                     controversial than Oolon Colluphid's
                     trilogy of philosophical blockbusters,
                     WHERE GOD WENT WRONG, SOME MORE OF GOD'S
                     GREATEST MISTAKES, and WHO IS THIS GOD
                     PERSON, ANYWAY?

        Now the images rise up from the screen like holographs as
        the book "presents itself" like some hi-tech infomercial.

                             GUIDE VOICE (CONT'D)
                     In many of the more relaxed civilizations
                     on the Outer Eastern Rim of the Galaxy,
                     the Hitchhiker's Guide has already
                     supplanted the great Encyclopedia
                     Galactica as the standard repository of
                     all knowledge and wisdom. For though it
                     has many omissions, and contains much
                     which is apocryphal, or at least wildly
                     inaccurate, it scores over the older, more
                     pedestrian work in two important respects.
                     First, it is slightly cheaper. And second,
                     it has the words "DON'T PANIC" printed in
                     large friendly letters on its cover.

        The book closes. The words "DON'T PANIC" appear just
        below the title, blinking like a tacky diner marquee.

        PULL BACK FROM THE GUIDE to find Arthur holding it, the
        blinking light illuminating his very disoriented face.

        Arthur, in total shock, holds up the guide.

                             ARTHUR
                     So you're not from Guilford, which would
                     explain the accent -- which I've always
                     wondered about...and you're not an out of
                     work actor -- but rather a writer for
                     this...this...book thing.

        Ford nods.    Arthur rubs his weary brow.

                             ARTHUR (CONT'D)
                     I don't feel well. I need a cup of tea.

        Ford hands him a fistful of peanuts.

                             FORD
                     Here. Eat these. If you've never been
                     through a transmat beam before you've
                     probably lost some salt and protein.

        Arthur eats some peanuts, sits up, squints. Ford feels
        his way around the room, looking for something.

                             ARTHUR
                     If I asked where we were would I regret

                     Obviously some strange usage of the word
                     safe I wasn't previously aware of.

                             FORD

                             FORD
                     Okay. I'm joking.

                             ARTHUR
                     And do a reassuring little laugh.

        Ford does a reassuring little laugh.

                     Now tell me where we really are.

                     And all those ants.

                             ARTHUR
                     Yes, but ants aren't exactly people!

                             FORD
                     And now you're thinking like a Vogon.
                        (before Arthur can respond)
                     I saved your life, okay? Which makes us
                     even. Next thing.

        Ford throws Arthur a towel. Arthur looks confused.

                              FORD (CONT'D)
                      It's a tough galaxy. You want to survive
                      out here, you really gotta know where your
                      towel is. Now gimme a hand over here.

        Arthur joins Ford near a rusty ventilation pipe.

                              FORD (CONT'D)
                      Careful, it's hot.

        He slides the towel behind the pipe, holding each end of
        it, Arthur does the same.

                              FORD (CONT'D)
                      We've got to get off this ship before the
                      Vogons find us. Vogons hate hitchhikers.
                      Which is why they make ships with walls
                      that won't allow the Sub-Etna signal to
                      pass through. So we've got to send the
                      signal up and out if we wanna catch a
                      ride. Pull.

        They both pull. A section of pipe snaps off. Steam
        shoots out. Ford holds the black Thumb under the pipe.

                             ARTHUR
                     What's a Vogon?

                             FORD
                     Ask the guide.    Say "Vogons."

        Ford continues turning dials.        Arthur lifts the Guide.

                             ARTHUR
                     "Vogons."

        The word "VOGONS" floats up into his field of vision.

                  Vogons are one of the most unpleasant
                  races in the Galaxy - not evil, but bad-
                  tempered, bureaucratic, officious and
                  callous. They wouldn't even lift a finger
                  to save their own grandmothers from the
                  Ravenous Bugblatter Beast of Traal without

                  They've destroyed a planet today, that

                  Mostly harmless.

        Before Arthur can react, a speaker HUMS to life with
        screeching HOWLS and GARGLES. Arthur cups his ears.

        Ford removes a small yellow fish from his pouch. He
        moves to put it in Arthur's ear. Arthur struggles.

                  WHAT?...STOP!..DON'T COME NEAR ME WITH...

        The LOUD GARGLING NOISE continues. Ford has to wrestle to

                  It feeds on brainwave energy, absorbing

                  speech centres of the brain, the practical
                  upshot of which is that if you stick one in
                  your ear, you instantly understand anything
                  said to you in any language.

        Arthur continues to struggle, until he passes a portal
        window. He backs up to look out.

                          GUIDE VOICE (CONT'D)
                  Now, it is such a bizarrely improbable

                  useful could have evolved in the Universe
                  purely by chance that many thinkers have

         Arthur and Ford are strapped against two concrete pillars
         with hundreds of elastic bands.

         A STRANGE AND LETHAL LOOKING DEVICE DESCENDS FROM THE
         CEILING. Looks like an instrument of torture. As the
         device descends, Jeltz fishes a JEWELED CRAB out of a
         gunky trough and smashes it with a hammer -- BLAM!

         Jeltz takes the device in his hand -- then blows in it.
         We hear FEEDBACK. It's a microphone (like ones used to
         introduce boxers). He taps it. This thing on? It is.
         He faces them, holds up a book entitled... "       " --
         smirks, then begins to read Vogon poetry.

                     The absolute worst poetry was written by
                     Paula Nancy Millstone Jennings of Sussix.
                     It involved decaying swans. Luckily, it
                     was destroyed when the Earth was.

                     So, Earthlings, I present you with a
                     simple choice. Either die in the vacuum
                     of space, or -- tell what you thought of
                     my poem.

        Ford is spent, can't say a word. Arthur looks up.

                             ARTHUR
                     Actually...I rather liked it.

        Jeltz looks surprised. Ford notices, whispers to Arthur.

                             FORD
                     Good tact. Run with it.

                             ARTHUR
                     Um...some of the words I didn't understand,
                     but I found the imagery quite effective.

                             JELTZ

                  And, um, interesting rhythmic devices which
                  seemed to counterpoint the surrealism of
                  the underlying metaphor of the humanity...

                          FORD
                  Vogonity!

                           ARTHUR
                  ... Vogonity, sorry. Vogonity of the poet's
                  soul, which contrives through the medium
                  of the verse structure to sublimate, er...

                          ARTHUR
                  ... the poem was about.

        Jeltz rubs one of his chins, then smiles and claps slowly.

                             FORD
                  Damn.

                             ARTHUR
                  What?

                          FORD
                  I think you just saved my life again.

                          JELTZ
                  An astute analysis. Very impressive.
                     (turning to the Guard)
                  Throw them off the ship.

        The guard grabs them, drags them out of the bridge.

                          VOGON GUARD
                  Resistance is useless!

                           JELTZ
                  Hmph. "Counterpoint the surrealism of the
                  underlying metaphor..." Death's too good
                  for them.

        Jeltz picks up his fishing rod, goes for another crab.

        They sit, panting.    Arthur stares forward.

                           ARTHUR
                   So this is it? We're going to die?

                        (reaching for it)
                     No, it's nothing. We are going to die.

        Arthur sits for a moment, then oddly chuckles to himself.

                             ARTHUR
                     You know, it's at times like this, when
                     I'm trapped in a Vogon airlock with a man
                     from Betelgeuse and about to die of
                     asphyxiation in deep space that I really
                     wish I'd listened to what my mother told
                     me when I was young.

                             FORD
                     Why? What did you she tell you?

                             ARTHUR
                     I don't know. I didn't listen.

        Ford folds his towel into a tiny square, holds it up
        toward Arthur. He raises an eyebrow. Will this help?

                             FORD
                     You're sweating.

        Ford dabs Arthur's brow. They stare forward at the
        airlock door. Long pause. Nothing happens. They look
        to each other. Shrug. They might be okay. Then --
        PSSH. The bottom drops out. They're sucked down and out.

30      EXT. DEEP SPACE -- CONTINUOUS                                   30

        Ford and Arthur spin away from the ship, holding their
        breath. The guide slips out of Arthur's pocket.

                             GUIDE VOICE
                     "Space..." says the introduction to the
                     Hitchhikers Guide, "...is big. Really big.
                     You just won't believe how vastly, hugely
                     mind-bogglingly big it is. I mean, you
                     may think it's a long way down the road to
                     the market, but that's just peanuts
                     compared to space..." and so on.

        The weightless guide twirls away.    Arthur reaches for it.
        The words "DON'T PANIC" alight.

                             GUIDE VOICE (CONT'D)
                     It also says that if you hold a lung full

                     of space for about thirty seconds -- but
                     with space being really big and all, the

        Something else falls out of his pocket -- his digital
        phone with the photo of he and Tricia at the fancy dress
        party.

                     ...which, by a staggering coincidence, is
                     also the telephone number of the Islington
                     flat where Arthur once went to a fancy
                     dress party and met a very nice girl whom
                     he totally failed to connect with.

        He reaches for the phone, it's just beyond his fingertips.
        His eyes widen with fret as the phone tumbles away.

30a     Then -- WOOMPH -- space seems to stretch and bend. A tiny        30a
        hole appears, then opens wide. Paper hats and party
        balloons fall out, then drift away. The hole flips inside
        out. Arthur and Ford are enveloped, then replaced by a
        stunning, sleek starship, the HEART OF GOLD.

        In the middle of this hi-tech receiving bay sit two

        TRILLIAN turns -- and we now recognize her as Tricia from
        the fancy dress party. Her hair is shorter and bright
        red. She looks amazing.

                           TRILLIAN
                   Can we put your ego aside for one moment?
                   Something important has happened.

        His head jerks upwards. He quickly grabs it with his
        hands and shoves it back down.

                          TRILLIAN (CONT'D)
                  I didn't pick them up. The ship did.

                  I didn't engage the drive.

                          TRILLIAN
                  We picked them up in sector ZZ9 Plural Z
                  Alpha -- where you picked me up.

                          ZAPHOD
                  That's impossible.

                            TRILLIAN
                  No.    Just very, very improbable.

                           ZAPHOD
                  I don't have time for this! We've got the
                  police of half the Galaxy after us and we
                  stop to pick up hitchhikers?! Okay, so
                  ten out of ten for style, but minus
                  several million for good thinking, eh?

        He reaches for a hi-tech gun on the wall.      She stops him.

                          TRILLIAN
                  Don't. I'll send Marvin. (calling)

        Zaphod rolls his eyes as a humanoid robot rises from its
        seat behind them. This is MARVIN. He trudges slump-

                  I think you ought to know I'm feeling very

                          MARVIN
                  Just that?

                          TRILLIAN
                  Yes.

                          MARVIN
                  I won't enjoy it.

                          ZAPHOD
                  She's not asking you to enjoy it. Just do
                  it will you?

                          MARVIN
                  All right. I'll do it.

        Marvin turns and trudges away. Then he turns again.

                          MARVIN (CONT'D)
                  I'm not getting you down at all am I?

                          TRILLIAN
                  No, no, Marvin, it's fine really. It's just
                  part of life.

                           MARVIN
                  Life.   Don't talk to me about life.

        Marvin trudges away. A door slides open for him and
        makes an audible, satisfied SIGH as it does.

        The Heart of Gold cruises around a bright star.

34      INT. BRIDGE OF VOGON DESTROYER SHIP - NIGHT                 34

        A light blinks on a console. A VOGON CAPTAIN turns a
        dial, listens through his head set. He punches a few
        buttons. COMMANDER KWALTZ (green and walrusy like Jeltz)
        appears on the large monitor, sitting in his chair at
        Command Headquarters.

        Kwaltz sits at the end of a concrete war room table.

                             KWALTZ
                     Get me the vice-president.

        Approximately 15 Vogons sit around the table murmuring
        sporadically. A VOGON MESSENGER runs up, holding papers.
        Kwaltz takes them, signs, signs the next page -- and the
        next. He hands them back to the messengers (who has been
        jogging in place the whole time). He runs off. The
        VOGON CAPTAIN appears on the large screen before him.

        A hundred rectangular vogon ships blast forward.

        Arthur looks around and notices the room is gleaming
        white, hi-tech, brand new, plastic still on some stuff.

                              ARTHUR
                     Now this is more like my idea of a
                     spaceship. Look at all these buttons...

        They listen.    Hear footsteps.

                             FORD (CONT'D)
                     This way.

        He pushes a button. The door slides open with a satisfied
        sigh -- "Hhhmmyaaaahhh". As they walk through...

                     enjoyed opening for you. Hhmmyaahh...

        They leap through to the other side as the door closes.

                             MARVIN (0.S.)
                     Ghastly, isn't it?

        They whip around to find Marvin standing before them.

                      I've been ordered to take you up to the
                      bridge. Here I am, brain the size of a
                      planet, and they ask me to take you up to
                      the bridge. Call that job satisfaction? -
                      'cause I don't.

         Marvin turns and walks away. They shrug to each other and
         follow. Marvin passes through another door that opens with
         the same sigh -- "Hhmmaaaahhh"

                      What a pleasure it is to open for you.

         The door closes.

         The door repeats its whole closing and opening routine
         again.

                    Yes, I know. I was being...never mind.

38       INT. HEART OF GOLD. BRIDGE. -- MOMENTS LATER                  38

         HANGING ON THE WALL is the official presidential portrait,
         featuring Zaphod who sports a very smart suit and a fake
         politicians smile. Tilt down to the door which opens -
         "Mmyyahhh!" - to reveal Ford, Arthur and Marvin.

                            MARVIN
                    I've brought the aliens.    Don't thank me
                    or anything.

         Zaphod spins around in his chair, holding a gun but
         sporting that same politically correct smile.

                              ZAPHOD
                    Freeze!

         Arthur and Ford throw their hands up.      Marvin doesn't.

                            MARVIN
                    Do you mean sit in a corner and rust or
                    just fall apart where I'm standing?

                           ZAPHOD

         Zaphod gives Ford a big bear hug. He pulls away, then
         playfully punches Ford in the arm.

        Arthur is stunned silent. He goes to her, making sure she's
        really there. He's speechless. She smiles and gives him a

                   I know. And it was rude to just leave,

                   he had a spaceship parked outside, well,

        Arthur SHOVES Zaphod's hand off his shoulder. Oddly,
        Zaphod reacts with a smile. And then -- his head shoots
        all the up way revealing a second head that lives
        somewhere under his chin.

        Arthur recoils in horror, instinctively raises his fists.

        Zaphod wrestles with Head 2 while A THIRD ARM springs out
        of Zaphod's chest and PUNCHES ARTHUR in the jaw. Arthur
        buckles and hits the floor.

                            ZAPHOD HEAD 2
                    You should teach your pal a lesson, Ford.
                    He's a guest on my ship.

                            FORD
                    I thought you said you stole it.

         A KLAXON sounds. Red lights FLASH. Zaphod (Head 2)
         hurries to the console. Ford follows.

         Trillian hurries to Arthur who nurses his jaw.

                       Are you all right?

                       I feel like a bloody idiot. I've spent
                       all week looking for Tricia McMillan and
                       that isn't even your name.

                       It is my name. I shortened it.

                       A little help over here?

         Trillian leaves Arthur, joins Zaphod

                               ZAPHOD HEAD 2
                       They're after us! Fire a gun! Launch a
                       missile! DO SOME DAMAGE!

         Zaphod's arms struggle with his head again.

        An IMAGE APPEARS on the ship's monitor - Vice President,
        QUESTULAR RONTOK, flanked by Vogon Commander KWALTZ {at
        H.Q.). He looks reluctant. He has to say this...

                          QUESTULAR (ON MONITOR)
                  This is Vice President Questular Rontok.
                  I am speaking to the kidnapper of the
                  President. Surrender your stolen vessel at

                  permitted by Section 1.8 of the Galactic
                  Interstellar Space Bi-Laws.

                  Sure thing, fella, but I should tell you
                  we need proper authorization before
                  entering a hyperspace expressway.

                          ZAPHOD HEAD 2
                  Or else what? They'll send a hundred and
                  one ships? DO it!

        He and Trillian buckle up. Ford turns to Arthur.

                          FORD
                  Brace yourself.   This is a bit like being
                  drunk.

                     You do realize he did what he did because
                     he knew this is what you would do.

                            KWALTZ
                     Rules are rules, Mr. Vice President.     And
                     they are made to be followed.

        Questular looks up to the screen at all the Vogon ships.

                            QUESTULAR
                     Don't you think this many ships is a bit,
                     oh I don't know -- excessive?

                            KWALTZ
                     The provisions are clear. Under
                     subsection 37a these are the forces we
                     deploy to protect the president in the
                     case of an attempted or actual kidnapping-

        He holds up one fat official book with one hand.

                            KWALTZ (CONT'D)
                     -- and these are the forces we deploy to
                     apprehend any intentional or actual
                     kidnapper.

        He holds up another fat book with the other.

                            QUESTULAR
                     You are aware, Commander, that the
                     President kidnapped himself.

                            KWALTZ
                     Hence...

        He puts the two books together, slams them down.

                            QUESTULAR
                     Do you have any idea how ridiculous this

                     just do what I do.

        A VOGON MESSENGER runs up holding papers. Kwaltz takes
        them, signs one in two places, initials others, lifts the
        top sheet, removes the pink copy. Folds it.

        Hands slam Head 2 down.         Zaphod (Head 1) turns to Ford.

                     So you carved it up?

                     Yes -- I think. And I think I did it in
                     such a way that it wouldn't be detected by
                     the Government screening tests -- or by
                     me. So, what's so secret that I can't let
                     anybody know I know it, not the Galactic
                     Government, not even myself? And the
                     answer is--
                        (thinking)
                     --I don't know. Obviously. But I put a

                     Come on, Arthur, don't be like that.

                             ARTHUR
                     Well, what am I supposed to be like?
                     Green? Bleeping? What?

                             TRILLIAN
                     Just be yourself. Have some fun. Does it
                     hurt?

                             ARTHUR
                     No, I suppose it wouldn't..

                             TRILLIAN
                     I mean...

        She points to his jaw, he nods, she picks up her BACKPACK.

                             TRILLIAN (CONT'D)
                     I might have an aspirin.

        She unzips it. TWO MICE scurry out and scamper off, a
        hair-clip is clipped to one of the mice's tail.

                              TRILLIAN (CONT'D)
                     Hey.   What are they doing in there?

        Before she can catch them, they scurry under the door.

                             TRILLIAN {CONT'D)
                     They were from my lab at university.    Odd...

                             ARTHUR
                     So all that's left is me and you, "mostly
                     harmless," and two lab rats.

        She furrows her brow.     What does he mean?

                             ARTHUR (CONT'D)
                     Look, there's something I should tell
                     you...

                             ZAPHOD (O.S.)
                     Showtime, Trill!

                             TRILLIAN
                     Can it keep? You might want to see this.

        Arthur nods. She leaves.        He looks at his "tea", throws
        it in the trash bin.

        Trillian and Arthur join Ford and Zaphod at the computer.

                          ZAPHOD
                  --and when I saw what I'm about to show
                  you, that's when I realized why I did what
                  I did to my brain -- or it least, I think
                  that's why.

44      ON THE COMPUTER SCREEN --                                   44

        The screen brightens. A BRAND LOGO appears (a circle made
        of a dotted line with an "M" in the middle) then a sub-
        title: MAGRATHEAN PUBLIC ARCHIVE. Zaphod fast forwards
        until a noisy picture DISSOLVES TO...

45      EXT. OUTSIDE TEMPLE OF DEEP THOUGHT -- DAY                  45

        A procession surrounds a CHARIOT. Two young philosophers,
        LUNKWILL and FOOK (20'S) ride it into a grand TEMPLE.

46      INT. TEMPLE OF DEEP THOUGHT.                                46

        The aisles are lined with Priest-Technicians. Ahead is
        DEEP THOUGHT - a huge Buddha-esque computer.

        The procession peels away to both sides. Lunkwill and
        Fook dismount and approach.

                          DEEP THOUGHT
                     (deep and sonorous)
                  What is this great task for which I, Deep
                  Thought, the second greatest computer of
                  all time have been called into existence?

                          LUNKWILL
                  Your task, O computer...

                          FOOK
                  Hang on. Did you say second greatest?

                          DEEP THOUGHT
                  Second greatest. Yes.

                          FOOK
                  But we designed you to be the greatest
                  computer so you could...

                          LUNKWILL
                  You're not talking about the Milliard
                  Gargantubrain which can count all the
                  atoms in a star in a millisecond?

                          DEEP THOUGHT
                  The Milliard Gargantubrain? A mere abacus,
                  mention it not.

                  The Omnicognate Neutron Wrangler then?

                     The Omnicognate Neutron Wrangler could
                     argue all four legs off an Arcturan
                     Megadonkey, but only I could persuade it

                             FOOK
                     Then what's the problem?

                             DEEP THOUGHT
                     I am the greatest computer you are able to
                     design without my help. Which, one day,
                     you are going to need.

                              LUNKWILL
                         (to Fook)
                     Let's just ask the question.

                              FOOK
                     Oh Deep Thought, your task is this. We
                     want you to tell us -- the Answer.

        Long pause.    Deep Thought bleeps and bloops.

                             DEEP THOUGHT
                     The Answer...to what?

                              LUNKWILL
                     You know. The answer.      To Life...the
                     Universe...Everything.

                              FOOK
                     We'd really like an answer. Something
                     simple. Can you do it?

                             DEEP THOUGHT
                     The Ultimate Question of Life, the
                     Universe and Everything. Yes. There is an
                     answer. But I'll have to think about it.

        Lunkwill glances at his time piece, Fook at the expectant
        throng behind them. They wait.

                             DEEP THOUGHT (CONT'D)
                     Return to this place in exactly... seven and
                     a half million years.

                              LUNKWILL & FOOK

48      INT. TEMPLE OF DEEP THOUGHT --                                     48

        Lunkwill and Fook enter the now modern temple, flanked by a
        crowd. They have beards and look like they're in their
        40's. Deep Thought rises, looks lifeless. WORRIED MUTTERS
        FROM THE CROWD. Slowly, Deep Thought groans to life.

                             DEEP THOUGHT
                     Can I help you?

                     An answer for you? Yes. I have.

                             FOOK
                     There really is an answer?

                             DEEP THOUGHT
                     Yes. There really is one.

                           (almost strangled with emotion)

                             LUNKWILL

                     Yes. Though I don't think you're going to
                     like it.

                     I checked it thoroughly. It would have

        Zaphod thinks again -- hard.

                     I don't seem to be letting myself in on

                     Because of this, obviously.

        They turn to see Trillian flipping open a glass lid

                  Definitely. I'm in.

        They're all standing together. They turn to Arthur.
        Arthur looks to Trillian. She stares back -- waiting.

                  Do I even have a choice?

        Zaphod smiles, all bright and cheery.

                             GUIDE VOICE
                     The Infinite Improbability Drive is a new
                     method of crossing vast interstellar
                     distances without all that tedious mucking
                     about in hyperspace. As soon as the drive
                     reaches Infinite Improbability, it passes
                     through every conceivable point in every
                     conceivable Universe almost simultaneously,
                     then selects the appropriate re-entry
                     point. The principle of generating small
                     amounts of finite improbability by hooking
                     the logic circuits of a Bambleweeny 57 Sub-
                     Meson Brain to an atomic vector plotter

                     producer, say a nice hot cup of tea, were
                     of course well understood.

        Seconds later, the Vogon Destroyer comes out of
        hyperspace and slows to cruising speed.

                     Such generators were often used to break

                     of science, but mostly because they didn't

                     Are you requesting hyperspace clearance so

                             ARTHUR
                     You mean fully clothed?

        She stops, fires him a look.

                             ARTHUR (CONT'D)
                     Sorry, but I can't for the life of me
                     figure out why you, the most brilliant
                     woman I have ever met, have ended up with
                     that half-witted, self-obsessed, vapid
                     politician! I mean, look at him!

        They squint through the fog at Zaphod, Head 2 out. His
        hands keep trying to get it down but the 3rd arm keeps
        whacking them away. He disappears into the fog.

                     Look, if you're going to pout your way
                     around space, then maybe you should just
                     go home.

                              ARTHUR
                     I can't. That's the whole point -- and
                     I've been trying to tell you...

                        (interrupting)
                     Hey, look what I found in the guide.

        He hands the guide to Trillian. She keeps walking.

                             FORD (CONT'D)
                     I wouldn't tell her if I were you.

                             ARTHUR
                     She deserves to know.

                              FORD
                     But if you tell her and she ends up with
                     you because you're literally the last guy
                     on Earth -- you'll always doubt her
                     intentions.

        Arthur considers this.      Nods.

                             FORD (CONT'D)
                     Got your towel?

                             ARTHUR
                     Do I need it?

                             FORD
                     Only always.

        Ford puts his towel to his mouth as they follow Trillian
        down the mist covered street. She's reading the guide.

                     This made a lot of people very angry and

                   Humma Kavula!

        SLAM.   Zaphod's two arms shove his chin back down.

                           ZAPHOD
                   I'll handle this.

56a     EXT. SEEDY STREET-VILTVODLE                                   56a

        The others approach, watching Zaphod as he stops a
        passing an eight-armed alien creature, asks him
        something, oozing charm. The creature points down the
        street with 3 arms, then with 2 others hands him a pen
        and paper. Zaphod signs an autograph and moves on.

        The alien beams, then squirts three cans of aerosol under
        several arms. More mist rises. FOLLOW IT UP revealing:

57      A LARGE BUILDING -- a temple with two giant arches.           57

        The others follow. CAMERA TILTS UP and we see this
        building looks like a nose lying horizontally, the "giant
        arches" are the nostrils.

58      INT. ARKLESEIZURE TEMPLE - CONTINUOUS                         58

        Zaphod opens the huge doors inside the large
        nostril/arches. A rush of air blows the mist past Ford,
        Trillian and Arthur a few steps behind. They stop.

        A congregation of worshipers faces front where HUMMA KAVULA
        stands behind a podium. He's a humanoid wearing a white
        robe and night-vision sun glasses.

                           HUMMA KAVULA
                   The handkerchief is coming, beloveds. Are
                   you ready? Let us pray that the almighty
                   will exhale a breath of compassion on us.

        Instead of bowing, they all point their noses heavenward.
        Zaphod marches down the center aisle while Humma prays.

                           HUMMA KAVULA (CONT'D)
                   Almighty Arkleseizure, we lift our noses,
                   clogged and unblown in reverence to you.

        Zaphod stops a few feet away from Humma's chair.

                           ZAPHOD
                   Hello, Humma.

                     That's Humma Kavula? I thought he was

                             FORD
                        (shaking his head)
                     Humma Kavula was his opponent in the
                     election. Something happened during the
                     campaign. Zaphod never forgave him.

                             ARTHUR
                     What was it?

        Ford shrugs.    HUMMA looks up, sees Zaphod, smiles.

                             HUMMA KAVULA
                        (wrapping up the prayer)
                     Send the handkerchief, lord, so that it may

        And they all sneeze. Akin to crossing himself, Humma
        raises a hand to his nose, then down again.

                             HUMMA KAVULA
                     Bless you.

        Humma's quarters are opulent. He sits behind his desk
        flanked by several ARMED BODY GUARDS. Ford, Arthur and
        Trillian keep a safe distance as Zaphod faces off with
        Humma who has the air of a cool news anchor man.

                         HUMMA KAVULA
                 Zaphod Beeblebrox, our famous President.
                 The Arkleseizure has exhaled many
                 blessings upon you. What brings you to
                 our humble planet?

                         HUMMA KAVULA
                 I don't think I do.

                         ZAPHOD
                 Oh, I think you think you don't, but we
                 both know -- you do.

                         HUMMA KAVULA
                 Elequent as always, Zaphod. Your ability
                 to communicate a clear thought never
                 ceases to amaze.

        Head 2 suddenly springs up -- to the surprise of all.

                         ZAPHOD HEAD 2
                 You called me stupid!

                         HUMKA KAVULA
                    (re: the heads)
                 Interesting. And I don't know what you're
                 talking about.

                         ZAPHOD HEAD 2
                 During the campaign, Humma -- you said I
                 was stupid.

                         HUMMA KAVULA
                 This Humma you speak of no longer exists.
                 He came here in his consolation position
                 as Ambassador to Gamma Z10 to squelch an
                 ideological threat to the system and
                 repented from his wicked ways. He now
                 goes by the holy name Tazelo the
                 Unceasingly Righteous, given to him by his
                 devoted followers.

                            ZAPHOD HEAD 2
                     I DON'T CARE WHAT YOU CALL YOURSELF, YOU
                     RIGHTEOUS FREAK!! YOU STARTED THE RUMOR
                     THAT I'M STUPID AND YOU'RE GONNA PAY!!!

        The 3rd arm reaches for a gun in Zaphod's vest. The BODY
        GUARDS aim their weapons. One runs up and smacks Zaphod
        in the back of the head -- slamming Head 2 back in place.

                            ZAPHOD
                     Thank you.

        The 3rd arm disappears.      The gun falls.   A BODY GUARD
        picks it up.

        WITH ARTHUR, FORD AND TRILLIAN

                            ARTHUR
                     Why do I get the feeling he's going to get
                     us all killed?

                            FORD
                     Probably because it's very possible.    Just
                     don't save me, okay? We're even.

        Humma lays his palms on the table and lifts himself as if
        to stand - but there is nothing of him below the table
        line except for thirty, one inch metal legs, attached to
        the base of his torso. He glides towards Zaphod, the
        little legs extending to reach the floor as he reaches
        the end of the table.

                  The election is ancient history, Zaphod,
                  but if memory serves -- you won, proving
                  that good looks and charm win over
                  brilliance and ability to govern.

        A guard drapes a white robes over Humma's shoulders - which
        he ties with a belt - hiding his peculiar undercarriage.

                          HUMMA KAVULA (CONT'D)
                  And incidently -- you are stupid.

        His head jerks up.   Zaphod stops it, paints on a smile.

                          ZAPHOD
                  That's really not the point.

                          HUMMA KAVULA
                  You haven't come halfway across the galaxy
                  to settle a campaign grudge. Why are you
                  here, Zaphod?

        Zaphod doesn't answer. Humma motions to a guard who
        grabs his arm, twists it -- hard.

                          ZAPHOD
                     (wincing)
                  I don't know. I was headed for Magrathea,
                  I ended up here.

        PUSH IN ON HUMMA -- who raises his hi-tech sun glasses.

                          HUMMA KAVULA
                  How very, very...
                     (knowingly)
                  ...improbable.

        He pulls the nose off his body guard, turns a key.    A
        secret safe door slides open from the mans' chest.

                          HUMMA KAVULA (CONT'D)
                  I kept a few souvenirs from my former
                  life. Ah, the heady days of space
                  piracy... so young, so foolish..,

        Another, smaller box rises from the chest cabinet. Inside
        we see glowing jewels, a skeleton hand, etc. Humma
        removes a PINK CUBE (like Zaphod's blue cube.)

                  I'll gladly give you the coordinates to

        He holds up the pink cube revealing A SERIES OF
        COORDINATE NUMBERS on each side. Zaphod reaches for it.
        Humma takes it back...

                   buried in the bowels of Magrathea.

                           ZAPHOD
                   Fine. I'll get your gun.    Just give me
                   the coordinates.

        Zaphod reaches out.    Humma pulls it back.

                           HUMMA KAVULA
                   And what will you give me to insure your
                   return?

                           ZAPHOD
                   My word as President.

                           HUMMA KAVULA
                   Ha! I'd be better off with the dung of a
                   Bethusian Mega Donkey.

                           ZAPHOD
                   Okay, then I'll get you that.

                           HUMMA KAVULA
                   I need a hostage, something you hold dear.
                   Only what does Zaphod Beeblebrox treasure?

        ON ZAPHOD'S SECOND HEAD -- peeping out of the collar
        looking terrified.

        Humma smiles. Bingo. He signals the guards. They grab
        Zaphod who looks back to Trillian, offers a weak smile.

                                                      SMASH CUT TO:

                   Nooo!!!

        PULL BACK to see it being lifted out of Zaphod's neck.
        Zaphod unconscious on the operating table. Blood and
        instruments everywhere.

    1   INT. HUMMA KAVULA'S ROOM -- LATER                           61

        Zaphod's head hangs on the wall. Wires feed out of the
        neck into a huge machine.
        Beneath the head is a crude drawing of a body and the
        words "I'm with Stupid." An arrow points to Zaphod's
        Head 2 -- which is shouting...

                           ZAPHOD HEAD 2
                   IDIOT! ZARKING MORON!! COME BACK!! YOU
                   NEED ME!! COME BAAAAACKKKK!!!!

                           HUMMA KAVULA
                   You should quit while you're "a head"
                   Zaphod. No one has ever got passed the
                   Magrathean defence system alive.

        Humma laughs maniacally.

62      EXT. VILTVODLE 6. MAIN STREET - NIGHT                       62

        Zaphod, held aloft on Ford and Arthur's shoulders,
        staggers down the street toward the spaceport where the
        Heart of Gold is parked. His neck is wrapped with a
        blood-soaked bandage which looks like a scarlet ascot.

                           ARTHUR
                   Are we sure this is the right way?

                            FORD
                   Yes!   I think.   I don't know.   Maybe not.

                           ARTHUR
                   Yes, thank you for clearing that up.

        Ford looks puzzled at Arthur. Did I clear it up? A crowd
        has gathered. When they see Zaphod, they scream...

                           CROWD
                   Mr. President!...Zaphod, over here!...I
                   want to have your baby!, etc...

        Zaphod, still feeling the effects of whatever drugs he
        was given, dons a presidential smile and waves.

                           FORD
                   Back to the ship. Quickly.

        They quicken their pace when suddenly...

        FIFTY VOGON POLICE -- emerge from the mist.

                           VOGON POLICE #1
                   Mr. President! We are here for your
                   protection!

        Zaphod, Ford, Trillian and Arthur freeze in their tracks.

         The police fire.      F, T, & A run for it, but Z stays put.

                            ZAPHOD
                    Zarquon! Friendly fire! Well, if that's
                    what they want--

         He pulls out his gun up and fires back.

                            ZAPHOD (CONT'D)
                    Hey! Let's do lunch! Nice haircut, fella!
                    Hey! Your kids are the same age as mine--
                    We should get them together some time!

         With each line he fires. Ford grabs him. Shots hit a
         stack of aerosol cans. They EXPLODE. More mist rises.

         The gang run down an alley and hide behind a kiosk.
         Zaphod sports a goofy smile. Arthur is scared to death.

                            ARTHUR
                    Oh God, I really hate Thursdays.

                            FORD
                    Zaphod, what do we do?

                            ZAPHOD
                    Build bridges between the stars!
                    He holds up two peace signs, a la Nixon.

                               ARTHUR
                    What?

                            FORD
                    I think that was his campaign slogan.

         Trillian finds a deodorant can, grabs it, gets an idea.

                            TRILLIAN
                    Alright, follow me.
               She aims the can at Zaphod's ear- Arthur's face registers
               the madness of the moment.

          moves down the street. The crowd GASPS. The quartet
          continues anxiously forward, eyeing the police whose guns
          track their every move.

                               TRILLIAN

(62 cont) The police step backwards -- but the crowd takes a step       (62 cont)
          forward. A huddle of female ADMIRERS rush them, waving
          pens and paper as if the Beatles have arrived.

                               ADMIRERS
                       Mr. President, Mr. President!...

            Zaphod paints on a smile, breaks away from the others to
            go sign a few autographs.

                              FEMALE ADMIRER
                      I totally voted for you!

(62 cont) CHAOS! The walrusy Vogon police swarm in like maggots,        (62 cont)
          surrounding Trillian and edging Ford and Arthur away.

                               VOGON POLICE
                       Resistance is useless!

            Shots are fired. The crowd SCREAMS and SCATTERS. Arthur
            reaches for Trillian but she is engulfed by Vogons who
            move, en masse, and pull her away into the mist.

                                ARTHUR
                      Tricia!

            Ford, with Zaphod in tow, shoves Arthur forward, using
            his towel to clear a path through the mist. They see the
            Heart of Gold ramp descending from the belly of the ship.

            usher Trillian, in futuristic hand-cuffs, past the Vogon
            Captain who stands in the foreground on his ship.

                          And until the kidnapper is properly
                          processed, she isn't officially
                          apprehended, now is she, Mr. Vice-

                     How, if you want me to take you somewhere,
                     we're going to have to start using our
                     magic words, "please" and "thank you."

                             ARTHUR
                     Can you change it back?

                     I can -- but I won't enjoy it.

        Arthur sees the Vogon ships getting away. Desperate, he
        shoves_Zaphod out of_the_driver's seat. Zaphod hits the
        floor, considers protesting, lies down on the floor to
        sleep instead -- with a contented smile.

        Arthur sits. He looks very out of place in a seat
        normally reserved for the likes of Han Solo. He scans
        the console. Ford sits in the seat beside him.

                               ARTHUR

                     Show me the override switch or I'll
                     reprogram you with a very large axe.

                        (long pause)
                     I can see this relationship is something
                     we're all going to have to work at.

64a     DING. A chime sounds. A switch on the console                 64a
        ILLUMINATES. "MANUAL OVERRIDE." Arthur flips the switch.
        The cockpit is sealed in a glass ball and shoots upwards.

        little glass pod. It floats through space, then rear
        thrusters ignite and blast the ship forward.

        An aircraft steering wheel rises up between Arthur's
        legs. He grabs it, spinning out of control.

                             FORD
                     I think I should push this button.

        Ford pushes a big button.    AN ALARM SOUNDS!

                     A sign lit up saying "Please do not push

        Arthur grabs the control, does his best to steer.

    9    DIFFERENT PART OF VOGSPHERE/NEAR SWAMP--                          69

         The ground is barren. A scintillatingly jeweled crab
         crawls out of a swamp and looks up at the sky. We hear
         the sound of the pod approaching (but hold on the crab)
         as EEEOOOO-KA-KFFFZZZ! The crab runs back into the
         swamp. PAN LEFT to see the pod rammed into the ground,
         steam rising. The door opens. The three emerge.

                              FORD
                    Wow...

                              MARVIN

                    Sorry about the landing.    Where are we?

                            FORD
                    Wrong. This is the Vogon planet.     This is
                    Vogsphere.

                             ZAPHOD
                    No.   It's Magrathea!   I know it!

         Ford reaches in his satchel, pulls out a sort of
         ELECTRONIC BERET, pulls it snugly onto Zaphod's head.

                            FORD
                    Little something I learned about on an
                    Altairian star cruiser. Captains use them
                    when they really need to concentrate.

                    A Thinking Cap.

         Zaphod squints hard to think as he looks around.

         THEIR P.O.V. -- there are rows and rows of dull, gray,
         rectangular buildings as far as the eye can see.

(69 cont) The three men step out of the ship.                          (69 cont)

                    This will all end in tears, I just know
                    it.

         Marvin moves out, a few paces behind.

                            FORD
                    I checked the guide for ways to rescue a
                    prisoner from Vogsphere. It said "Don't."
                    I'm assuming your plan is better.

                     Well, I sort of had this idea we could...

        A TELESCOPIC ROD WITH A PADDLE AT THE TOP shoots out of
        the ground, SMACKS Arthur on the face, then retracts.

        Arthur is stunned. None of the others have noticed.

                             ARTHUR (CONT'D)
                     Did anyone see that?

        They look at Arthur. It suddenly seems ridiculous.

                             ARTHUR
                     Nothing.

        They all walk along - Arthur at the back, perplexed.

                     Nothing. Just my imagination.

        Another paddle springs up, double smack in the face.
        Arthur leaps back. Looks down. Nothing. Nothing at all.

                             ARTHUR (CONT'D)
                     Alright, stop. Everyone stop and watch

                     Okay.     I think we...

        A paddle springs up and smacks Ford's face.

                               FORD (CONT'D)
                     AH!

        He leaps back, clutching his cheeks.      Arthur spins around.

                  I have... an idea.

        A paddle shoots up. Ford ducks. It misses. He grabs its
        telescopic stalk. It thrashes in his hands. He breaks it.

                         FORD (CONT'D)
                  Okay, don't think of anything.     Don't have
                  ideas or theories -- nothing.

        A beat. They all strain to think of nothing.     Several
        paddles shoot up. Smacking them.

                         ARTHUR
                  I can't, help it!    Trillian is in there
                  somewhere and we need an idea to save her.

                          FORD
                  Ever the politician.

        They take off running. A forest of paddle stalks erupts
        out of the ground around them, smacking violently.

        They come to rest at the side of a Vogon building.

         The front doors BURST open. Arthur storms through them,
         holding Marvin's arm which has the fingers pointed like a
         gun. He trips, falls, drops the arm, picks it up again,
         trying hard to look tough. Ford and Zaphod follow, Zaphod
         wearing the Thinking Cap and sunglasses for disguise.
         Ford wearing his towel over his face like a bandit.

        THEIR P.O.V. - a typical government pick-a-number and
        wait sort of room. Bland. Bad lighting. Numbered

                     I know how to queue.

        He confidently takes a number and gets in line with the
        several hundred others -- feeling very much at home.

            Trillian sits at the Officer's desk, arms folded, defiant.

                               TRILLIAN
                       I don't believe you. This is some sort of
                       trick. Zaphod wouldn't blow up a planet,
                       especially mine.

            Kwaltz now steps forward and extends a piece of paper.

                               KWALTZ
                       These are the orders.

            Trillian takes the paper, runs her finger down to the
            signature line where it reads "Love and kisses, Zaphod!"

                               TRILLIAN
                       Love and kisses...?

            She hands the paper back, swallowing emotion.

                               KWALTZ
                       Now -- according to Section 8, sub-section
                       34 dash A, the punishment for kidnapping
                       is a recitation of the classic poem, "Ode
                       to the Removal of Your Left Kidney."
                       Unless -- said kidnapping is of the
                       President, in which case you are to be fed
                       to the Ravenous Bugblatter Beast of Traal.
                       We thank you for your cooperation.

            A door is opened revealing a room with a large steel box.
            A huge, angry eye stares out of a tiny barred window.

            The box shakes like crazy. Trillian gulps.

            Zaphod is in line with Arthur and Ford.     He looks up to:

            A PRESIDENTIAL PHOTOGRAPH -- of himself, in suit and tie,
            smiling broadly. He lowers his thinking cap.

                               FEMALE VOGON PROCESSOR

            Arthur steps up, followed by Ford and Zaphod who keeps
            his head low and bowed.

                               ARTHUR
                       Yes. Hi. We're here about getting a
                       prisoner released?

                               FEMALE VOGON PROCESSOR
                       Prisoner release form?

            She holds out her hand. Arthur doesn't have a form.
            Annoyed, she points across the room to a wall that is
            nothing but shelves holding forms.

                  Right. Once I've filled it out can I
                  return to the front of the line, seeing as
                  I've already waited...

                              FEMALE VOGON PROCESSOR
                  No.     Next!

        Arthur sighs, frustrated. All three of them walk to the
        shelves holding the forms. Arthur turns to Zaphod.

                           ARTHUR
                  Can't you do something?!     You're
                  President, aren't you?

                           ZAPHOD
                  You want me to make a speech, shake a
                  hand? That's what I do -- I think. It's
                  all a little fuzzy.

        Arthur angrily fills out the form.

        MOMENTS LATER--

        Arthur is back in line, having waited a long time. He
        finally gets to the window, hands the green form to the
        Vogon Processor. She types into her computer, then checks
        the screen.

                          FEMALE VOGON PROCESSOR
                  This Prisoner is being detained for...
                     (reading)
                  Kidnapping the president. Not eligible for
                  release at this time. You can make an
                  appointment for a later date or take a
                  number and wait.

        Arthur's breathing quickens.     He can't take this.

                          ARTHUR
                  Alright, look.
                      (yanks thinking cap and
                       sunglasses off Zaphod)
                  This is the President.

        She looks at Zaphod, then back to the large portrait of
        Zaphod, then back to Zaphod. She nods. Okay...

                              ARTHUR   (CONT'D)
                      He says the whole kidnapping thing was a
                      terrible misunderstanding, she didn't mean
                      anything by it and he's ordering you to
                      let her go.

                         (holding up green form)
                      But this isn't a Presidential Release of

        She points to the wall of forms. Arthur sighs.

            Trillian is lowered into the Bugblatter beast box/cage.
            We cannot see the beast but it's screams of hunger are
            scaring the hell out of Trillian.

            Zaphod hands the Vogon Processor the blue form.

                       Okay...

            She reviews the form, stamps it, pulls off the carbon
            copy underneath, hands that to Zaphod.

            As she braces herself to be eaten by the monster.
            Suddenly, a couple of VOGON GUARDS enter and hand Kwaltz
            a blue piece of paper. He reviews it, then signs it.

                               KWALTZ
                       You're free to go.    Release her.

            The Vogon Guard pulls Trillian up and out of the box on a
            cable. The Bugblatter beast goes berserk.

                               QUESTULAR
                       What!?

                       He's here?! Zaphod is here!? Let's go
                       get him!

            But the Guard is already escorting Trillian out of the
            room. Kwaltz is completing paperwork.

                               QUESTULAR (CONT'D)
                       Commander?

            Kwaltz holds up a walrusy hand, one finger raised,
            silencing Questular while he continues. Questular sighs.

            We hear the Bugblatter beast weeping as the doors are
            closed on him.
                                                              CUT TO:

            await. Arthur steps toward her but Zaphod steps in front

            Trillian walks up to Zaphod -- and SLAPS HIM.

                     RIGHT WAY?!

        Zaphod is all smiles, hanging on as if he were on a
        rollercoaster ride.

                             ZAPHOD
                     ISN'T IT GREAT?!

        ...the H.O.G. is but a blur as it streaks along.

83      BACK IN THE H.O.G. - LATER                                     83

        Stars appear on the screen as they slow from hyperspace.

                             EDDIE
                     Guys, I'm just super happy to tell you
                     we're approaching hyperspace exit Gamma
                     Z8B530.

        Arthur steadies himself, turns to Trillian who's still
        staring forward, angry. She unbuckles her seat-belt and
        moves away from the console.

        A planet appears on screen.     Zaphod and Ford lean
        forward.

                             ZAPHOD
                     Okay, that's it...I think. Computer?      Is
                     that...where are we headed again?

                             FORD

        Arthur turns, look over at...

        TRILLIAN -- who stares out a portal window into the
        emptiness of space. A tear rolls down her cheek.

        Arthur steps up, isn't sure what to say.

                             ARTHUR
                     Look, you're right. You deserved to know
                     and I should've told you. I don't blame
                     you if you're angry.

        She turns and stares, wipes the tears away.     Can't speak.

                              ARTHUR (CONT'D)
                     Right.   Anyway...I'm sorry.

                             EDDIE (O.S.)
                     Guys, it just tickles me pink to tell you
                     we are currently in orbit at an altitude
                     of three hundred miles around the
                     legendary planet of Magrathea. Goll-ee.

        Hearing this news, Arthur, Trillian and Ford turn.

                          ZAPHOD
                       (tasting it)
                     Take us in.

83a     EXT. NIGHT DEEP SPACE - MAGRATHEA                              83a

        They all stare in awe as they move toward a planet which
        gets closer and closer. Suddenly, their faces are awash
        with light.

        Two suns rise behind the planet.     It's breathtaking.

                             ZAPHOD
                     The twin suns of Soulianis and Rahm...

        Marvin (both arms in tact) rises in the back, peers out.

                             MARVIN
                     It's rubbish.

83b     Suddenly,a ghostly white swirl of light, vaguely in the        83b
        shape of a man, appears on the screen before them.

                     Greetings. This is a recorded announcement
                     as we're all out the moment. The Commercial
                     council of Magrathea thanks you for your
                     esteemed visit, but regrets that the entire
                     planet is temporarily closed for business.
                     If you would like to leave your name and a
                     planet where you can be contacted, kindly
                     do so at the tone.

        BEEP.   Then stunned silence.

                      Closed? How can a planet be closed?

                               ZAPHOD
                      For once, Aldus, I agree with you. Okay,
                      computer. Keep going. Take us down.

                              EDDIE
                      Happy to!

         The ship eases forward. The image appears again.

                              GHOSTLY IMAGE
                      It is most gratifying that your enthusiasm
                      for our planet continues unabated.    As a
                      token of our appreciation, we hope you
                      will enjoy the two thermonuclear missiles
                      we've just sent to converge with your
                      craft. To ensure on-going quality of
                      service, your death may be monitored for

         The image vanishes. A beat.    Then...

                              EDDIE
                      Guys, I'm delighted to tell you there are
                      two thermonuclear missiles headed right
                      for us. Should I take evasive action?

83c      The screens show two huge rockets thundering at us,               83c
         Zaphod just smiles. Ford steps up.

                              FORD
                      Um...yes, computer.   Evade!

         Massive acceleration! An illuminated dome lowers from the
         ceiling over the crew seats - creating a safety pod.

84       EXT. ABOVE MAGRATHEA. DAWN                                        84

         The Heart of Gold streaks away. Two large missiles follow
         and mimic the H.O.G.'s every move.

85       INT. THE BRIDGE - CONTINUOUS                                      85

         The crew are thrown from one side of the pod to the other.

                              EDDIE
                      There seems to be something jamming my
                      guidance systems. Impact minus 45
                      seconds. Call me Eddie if it'll help you
                      relax.

            Big swell of Muzak. The ship drops like a stone.
            THE MISSILES -- miss, then turn in a screeching curve.

(85 cont) INT. THE SAFETY POD -                                            (85 cont)

            Zaphod tries to wrestle with three controls.

                                  ZAPHOD
                          I can't do this without my other arm!

          straight for us.

                          No.   They're right behind us.

            He looks down, sees the IMPROBABILITY DRIVE BUTTON.

                                  ARTHUR
                          Look, why don't I just hit this thing?

                                   ZAPHOD
                          NO! We're here! No telling where it will

             The missiles turn and accelerate high into the sky. A
             second set of boosters kick in on the missiles as they
             soar back toward the H.O.G. --- much, much faster.

(85 cont) ON THE BRIDGE--                                                  (85 cont)

            They all stare at the approaching missiles. Arthur looks
            at the drive button. Screw it. He flips open the glass
            lid.
                               ZAPHOD
                       NO!

            Too late. ARTHUR HITS THE BUTTON.

            WOOMF! Light blasts through the bridge. Morphing
            madness!

            Empty for a moment. Then, the HEART OF GOLD reforms. A
            few beats later, a SPERM WHALE floats into frame followed
            by a BOWL OF PETUNIAS.

        It coalesces back into shape out of chaos. The safety
        dome rises revealing our heroes standing in the exact
        same place they were - dazed.

                           ZAPHOD
                   Um...where are we?

                           TRILLIAN
                   Exactly where we were, I think.

                           ZAPHOD
                   And the missiles?

                           FORD
                   Have apparently turned into a bowl of
                   petunias and a very surprised looking
                   whale.

        He points to the screen. The whale and petunias float by.

                           EDDIE
                   At an improbability factor of eight
                   million, seven hundred and sixty-seven
                   thousand, one hundred and twenty-eight to
                   one against.

        They all look to Arthur who shrugs. Zaphod nods his
        approval. Ford counts on his fingers -- are they even?

        He waves it off, gives Arthur a little salute and moves
        on. Trillian looks to Arthur and musters a smile.

                          ARTHUR
                  I could really use a cup of tea.

88      EXT. SPACE - NIGHT                                          88

        The H.O.G. arches away. The whale in mid-air, stops
        rising, starts falling.

                          GUIDE VOICE
                  It is important to note that suddenly, and
                  against all probability, a sperm whale had
                  been called into existence several miles
                  above the surface of an alien planet. And
                  since this is not a naturally tenable
                  position for a whale, this innocent
                  creature had very little time to come to
                  terms with its identity as a whale before
                  it then had to come to terms with suddenly
                  not being a whale any more. This is what
                  it thought as it fell.

        The camera moves around the whale as it falls.

                     better start finding names for things if I
                     want to make any headway in what for the
                     sake of what I shall call an argument I
                     shall call the world, so let's call it my
                     stomach! Good. Ooooh! It's getting quite
                     strong now. And hey,what's this whistling
                     roaring sound going past what I'm suddenly
                     going to call my head? Perhaps I can call
                     that ... wind! Is that a good name? It'll
                     do. Perhaps I can give it a better name
                     later when I've found out what it's for!
                     It must be very important because there
                     certainly seems to be an awful lot of it.
                     Hey! What's this thing ... this ... let's call
                     it a tail - yeah! Tail!

        The whale thrashes its tail. Between the camera and the
        whale drops the bowl of petunias. It falls from sight.

                     with anticipation ... Or is it the wind?
                     There really is an awful lot of that now,
                     isn't there?

        It's eye tries to look down. Camera pulls back from the
        whale, abandoning it ...

                     suddenly coming towards me very fast, so
                     big and flat and round it needs a big
                     wide-sounding name like ... ow ... ound...round
                     ... ground! That's it, ground! I wonder if
                     it'll be friends with me?

        We hear a sickening thud o.s.

                     Curiously, the only thing that went
                     through the mind of the bowl of petunias
                     as it fell was "Oh no, not again."

        We hear the petunia vase SHATTERING.

                             GUIDE VOICE (CONT'D)
                     Many have speculated that if we knew why
                     the bowl of petunias had thought that we
                     would know a lot more about the nature of
                     the Universe than we do now.

89      EXT. HEART OF GOLD. MAGRATHEA SURFACE - DAY                   89

        The gang stand by A HUGE CRATER (the H.O.G. parked in the
        b.g.) -- a large whale carcass sits in the middle of it --
        along with a few petunias. They all grimace.

        BEYOND THE CRATER -- they see a formation of large rocks,
        aligned in a circle. It's the only structure in sight.

        They walk toward it.

90      EXT. ROCK FORMATION - DAY                                     90

        Arthur walks behind the others, his head down.

                             FORD (O.S.)
                     Hey...this looks familiar.

        Arthur looks up, registers surprise.

        THE ROCK FORMATION -- looks like Stonehenge - only newer.
        The rocks letters carved into them that read "DESIGN
        DEPARTMENT" "SHOWROOM" "EXECUTIVE OFFICES" "TOILETS"

                             FORD (CONT'D}
                     Must be portal doors.

                             ARTHUR
                     You mean -- the hippies were right?

        In the middle of the circle sits a stone receptionist
        desk with a sign on it that says "OUT TO LUNCH."

        Zaphod heads for the "To Design Department" stone.
        Trillian and Ford follow.

        Zaphod feels around it, looking for a switch, a knob,
        anything. He must've hit something because the front of
        the stone suddenly slides open revealing a SWIRLING
        VORTEX THAT LOOKS LIKE A JET ENGINE.

                              ZAPHOD
                     Okay.   In we go.

                     What?! Are you out of what's left of your
                     mind? We can't step into that...that.

                             FORD
                     We gotta pick one, right? If it's not the
                     right one, we come back and pick another.
                     No biggie.

                             ARTHUR
                     Yes -- big biggie. What if that's the
                     last door we ever step through? What if
                     it rips us into tiny little atomic
                     particle...thingies.

        Trillian, who hasn't said a word since leaving Vogsphere,
        covers her ears - trying to block them out

                             ZAPHOD
                     It's the right one.   I have a hunch.

                               ARTHUR
                     Ford..?

                             FORD
                     He's got good hunches.   I say we go.

                             ARTHUR
                     Go with the hunch of a narcissist with
                     half a brain who's wearing a ridiculous
                     thinking cap!? Are you insane?!

                             ZAPHOD
                     Hey, I think I resent that.

                             ARTHUR
                     I don't care what you think you think...

        They all start arguing over each other. We focus on
        Trillian -- Anger and frustration building, she covers
        her ears -- then screams....

                             TRILLIAN
                     AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!

        And she takes off running for the door. Suicide? Bravery?

        They turn just in time to see her jump into the vortex.
        She YELPS as her body is bent in half, twisted like a
        rung mop, then sucked inside.

        Arthur is horrified, literally gasping for air.      Ford is
        semi-impressed. Zaphod, unfazed.

                             ZAPHOD
                     That's supposed to happen...I think.

        Ford shrugs, throws his towel around his neck like a
        scarf and dives through. Same thing. Bent, twisted...

        He runs after Ford, stops at the door, turns like he's
        about to board Air Force one, gives a salute, jumps in.

        Arthur finally gets his legs to move, steps up -- but
        hesitates at the threshold, paralyzed with fear, unable
        to take a step. Then -- FFSSSSH - the door seals shut.

                               ARTHUR
                  No.    No!     NOOO!!!

        He bangs on the stone, slides his hand around like Zaphod
        did, desperately looking for a way to open it. He
        collapses and buries his head in his hands.

                          MARVIN
                  I told you this would all end in tears.

                                                            CUT TO:

91      EXT. TEMPLE OF DEEP THOUGHT - MOMENTS LATER                   91

        Ford stands outside a stone doorway at the end of a
        cobblestone street. Zaphod's body falls to the ground
        next to him, untwists, unbends and snaps bolt upright
        beside them.

        Trillian is already heading down the street toward the
        Temple. Ford and Zaphod hurry to catch up to her.

92      EXT. ROCK FORMATION - DAY                                     92

        Arthur sits with his back against the stone, staring
        across the field at the beautiful double sunset. He looks
        over and sees THE TWO MICE FROM THE SHIP -- scurrying
        toward one of the giant stone doors. They slip through a
        crack beneath the stone. A FLASH OF LIGHT bursts through
        the crack. Arthur barely reacts, so drained of emotion.

                          ARTHUR
                  Life is full of paradoxes, isn't it?

                          MARVIN
                  Don't talk to me about life.

                          ARTHUR
                  Here I am, God knows how far from home...

                          MARVIN
                  Don't talk to me about God.

                          ARTHUR
                  ...and this is where I see the most
                  spectacular sunset I've ever laid eyes on.
                  We only had the one sun at home. Planet
                  called Earth.

                     Oh no, it's beautiful.    Or at least, it
                     was...

                     Did it have oceans?

                     So this is how it will all end, then? Me,
                     on a dead planet -- with a manically
                     depressed robot.

                     You think you've got problems? What are
                     you supposed to do if you are a manically
                     depressed robot? No, don't bother to
                     answer that, I'm fifty thousand times more
                     intelligent than you and even I don't know
                     the answer. It gives me a headache just
                     trying to think down to your level.

        Arthur spins to see AN OLD, BEARDED MAN IN LONG ROBES.

                             ARTHUR
                     Aah!

        He jumps, crab walks backwards away from the man.

                             ARTHUR (CONT'D)
                     Who are you?

                     You must come with me. Terrible events are

                    Late   as in "the late Dentarthurdent."
                    It's   a sort of threat you see. Never been
                    much   good at them myself, but I'm told
                    they   can be terribly effective.

        He motions to the stone that is marked "To Showroom."

                            SLARTIBARTFAST (CONT'D)
                    Your friends are safe. You can trust me.

                       (heaves a sigh, reluctant)
                    My name is...Slartibartfast.

        Arthur reacts with a furrowed brow.

                            SLARTIBARTFAST(CONT'D)
                    I said it wasn't important.

        Slartibartfast motions to the door.     He looks to Marvin.

                             MARVIN
                    I could calculate your chances of survival
                    -- but you won't like it.

        Arthur rises, cautiously moves over to Slarti's side.

                            SLARTIBARTFAST
                    I must warn you. We are about to pass
                    through, well, a sort of gateway thing. It
                    may disturb you. It scares the willies out
                    of me.

        He puts his hand on a certain spot in the stone and
        presses. The stone dissolves revealing once again the
        jet engine swirling vortex. Slarti motions -- after you.

        Arthur takes a deep breath -- and steps in.

                    Whaa!

        He is bent, twisted and sucked away.     Slarti follows.

                           SLARTIBARTFAST
                   I told you you might find it a bit
                   disturbing.

                           ARTHUR
                   I have found this whole day a bit
                   disturbing.

        Arthur realizes he has his towel with him. He wipes his
        mouth with it, dabs his brow. Then he notices...

        ...THE ROOM -- which is like a car dealer's showroom only
        instead of cars there are models of various planets.

                           SLARTIBARTFAST
                   Did you know we built planets?

        No.   Arthur didn't know that.   He looks perplexed.

                           SLARTIBARTFAST (CONT'D)
                   Fascinating trade. Doing the coastlines
                   was always my favorite. Used to have
                   endless fun doing all the little fiddly
                   bits round fjords. But the Galactic
                   economy collapsed, and seeing that custom-
                   built planets are something of a luxury
                   commodity...
                        (getting back on subject)
                   At any rate, there's been a terrible mix
                   up with your planet. You must come with me
                   or it's all going to blow up in our faces.
                   The best laid plans of mice, you know...

                           ARTHUR
                   ...and men.

                           SLARTIBARTFAST
                   Mmmm? What?

                           ARTHUR
                   The best laid plans of mice and men.

                             SLARTIBARTFAST
                     I don't think men have got much to do with
                     it.

        Arthur looks confused.     Slarti motions him to a door.

95      Arthur readies his towel at his mouth as Slarti hits a        95
        button. The door slides open and nothing happens. It's
        just a door that leads to a room where several TRANSPORT
        CARTS move past -- like a kids ride at Disneyland. They
        step into one. Slarti closes the little door. The cart
        MOVES through a curtain, out into DEEP SPACE.

        PULL BACK - till the cart is no more than a speck being
        pushed forward by the longest telescoping arm in history.

96      INT. - PLANET FACTORY - NIGHT                                 96

        The space is millions of miles across. Floating in it are
        half-finished planets, construction gantries around them.

                             SLARTIBARTFAST (CONT'D)
                     Welcome to our factory floor.

        ON ARTHUR -- who is positively blown away.
                                                            CUT TO:

97      INT. TEMPLE OF DEEP THOUGHT -- CONTINUOUS                     97

        Ford, Zaphod and Trillian enter the dimly lit temple.
        They hear a faint, tinny sound. They follow it.

        FURTHER DOWN THE CORRIDOR...

        The sound gets louder. Tinny music. And laughter...
        Flickering light illuminates the end of the corridor.

                             ZAPHOD
                     This is it!

        He quickens his pace. Trillian and Ford follow.      They
        round the corner to find...

        DEEP THOUGHT -- sitting there majestically.     The TINNY
        MUSIC emanates from somewhere near him.

        Zaphod takes another step in and now sees the source of
        the TINNY MUSIC.

        Deep Thought is watching TV.     A violent, stupid cartoon.

                             ZAPHOD (CONT'D)
                     Deep Thought...!

                              DEEP THOUGHT
                     Shhh.   This is a good bit.

        The cartoon continues. Zaphod enters, removes his
        thinking cap and reverently approaches. He kneels...

                     Oh great Deep Thought...we have traveled
                     long...and far.
                     Have you calculated... the Ultimate
                     Question? Of Life, the Universe and
                     Everything?

                              DEEP THOUGHT
                     No.

                              ZAPHQD
                     No?

                             DEEP THOUGHT
                     I've been watching TV.

                              ZAPHOD
                     Oh...

        Zaphod holds a smile but his world is slowly crumbling.

                             DEEP THOUGHT
                     I designed another computer to perform
                     that great task.

                             ZAPHOD
                     Oh, right...I forgot.
                        (looking around)
                     Is it here?

                             DEEP THOUGHT
                     Not here. Another world.

                             ZAPHOD
                     It's on another world?

                             DEEP THOUGHT
                     It is another world. Or was.

                              ZAPHOD
                     Where?

                             DEEP THOUGHT
                     Ask your companion.

        Zaphod turns to Ford.     Ford looks confused.

                             DEEP THOUGHT (CONT'D)
                     Not him.

        Zaphod looks to Trillian. She looks equally confused.
        Zaphod puts the thinking cap back on. Strains hard.

                             ZAPHOD
                     0kay -- you're sure you don't have the
                     Question?
                     Or a way to you, you know -- access it or
                     something. I think I've done like a lot
                     to get here...

                          DEEP THOUGHT
                  Shhhhhh...

        Zaphod looks up.    Deep Thought is shushing him?

                          DEEP THOUGHT (CONT'D)
                  The show's back on.

        A robotic arm reaches out and turns up the volume.

        Zaphod stands, turns to Ford and Trillian, smiles that
        smile -- but it's starting to look a bit crazed.

                          ZAPHOD
                  Great. This is just great. Let's go find
                  something else for my entire life to be
                  about.

        He starts to march off.    Ford grabs his arm.

                          FORD
                  Zaphod. The gun? The one Humma sent us
                  for? We have to get it. You gave the guy
                  your head.

                            ZAPHOD
                  I know.    Why did I do that?

        He pulls his thinking cap down -- all the way over his
        eyes. Ford rolls his eyes, turns...

                          FORD
                  Um...Deep Thought? We we're told you have
                  a g...

        Before he finishes the sentence, a PANEL in the wall
        slides open revealing a LARGE, SCARY LOOKING GUN. A
        robotic arm pushes it forward.

        Ford goes over, takes it, carries it like it's
        nitroglycerin to Zaphod who's already walking away,

        CORRIDOR LEADING AWAY FROM DEEP THOUGHT

        Ford hands Zaphod the gun.

                             FORD (CONT'D)
                  Here.     Take it. I don't do guns.

        Zaphod takes it with a smile...

                          ZAPHOD
                  Thank you.

        ...and instantly points it at his head. Ford lunges for
        it. There's a struggle. Ford's trying to get Zaphod's
        finger off the trigger when CLICK! The trigger is
        pulled. Ford winces. But apparently, nothing has
        happened.

                            ZAPHOD (CONT'D)
                  Great!    This is a bust, too!

                  Hey, man, you must be really frustrated.
                  To go through all you did only to come
                  here and get no answer, which means no
                  fame and money, and you deserve that, man.
                  Because you're great -- you're just
                  really, really great.

        Zaphod isn't sure what just happened. But he smiles
        anyway. Trillian, however, is onto something.

                         TRILLIAN
                  Give me that thing.

        The transport cart moves past two half-finished planets
        and on toward a 3rd planet. Construction gantries and
        clouds obscure our view.

                  The galaxy was a bit of a shambles, you
                  see. Everyone enjoying themselves being
                  singers and comedians and really creative
                  and interesting things like that. No one
                  doing the boring jobs.

                          ARTHUR
                  Oh, you had that problem, too?

                          SLARTIBARTFAST
                  In spades. So a species was genetically
                  engineered to do the boring jobs. Tax
                  inspectors, traffic wardens, government
                  officials. We were commissioned to build
                  a special planet for them.
                  Problem was, some cleverdick made it so
                  any time one of the creatures had an
                  interesting idea it would get a hefty
                  smack around the face.

                  What? You did that? I've been there!

        The cart lowers down toward the surface of the planet.

                  Then I gather you've met some of the

         TWO MISSILES screech overhead and soar up toward...

         THE VOGON SHIPS -- descending from space. The missiles

                  Yeah.    I kinda like this.

         She take the gun from him.

                          TRILLIAN
                  A gun that makes people suddenly see
                  things from your point of view. Useful
                  tool for the deranged evangelist trying to
                  convert the masses, eh?

         She starts walking.

                          TRILLIAN (CONT'D)
                  We should get back. Arthur's waiting.

                  Who cares?

                     (spinning on him; pointed)

                           ZAPHOD (CONT'D)
                   Of course you're edgy, your planet's been
                   blown up and you've been tooling around
                   the Galaxy with the guy who signed the
                   order

         CLICK.   She shoots him again.

                           ZAPHOD (CONT'D)
                   You actually wanted to know the Question
                   because you always thought there was more
                   to life, and now you're crushed because
                   you find out there really isn't.

         She's getting angrier and more hurt.     CLICK.

                              ZAPHOD (CONT'D)
                      You've got no home, no family, no one to
                      be with -- and you're stuck with me,
                      another in a long line of men who doesn't
                      appreciate you because he's too busy
                      appreciating himself.

         Hearing this puts a lump in her throat, causes her eyes
         to well with tears. She lowers the gun.

         Zaphod shakes his head -- the effect wearing off.       But he
         realizes what he said and doesn't like it.

                              ZAPHOD (CONT'D)
                      Give me that thing.

         He grabs the gun, points it at her.

                              TRILLIAN
                      Won't affect me.   I'm already a woman.

         Before he can react, A BRIGHT LIGHT SHINES BEHIND THEM.
         They turn, shielding their eyes.

                              ZAPHOD
                      Uh oh -- oh. It's okay, it's only a
                      couple of...

         FLASH! KEEEOOOW!    They are engulfed in WHITE LIGHT.

                                                            BACK TO:

         The transport cart continues toward the 3rd planet.

                              SLARTIBARTFAST
                      Here we are, then. Look familiar?

         Arthur turns and looks. There before him is...

    O1a   EARTH -- Arthur is thunderstruck...then confused.           101a

                            ARTHUR
                    So -- it wasn't destroyed?

                            SLARTIBARTFAST
                    Actually, it was. This is a back-up.
                    Earth Mark II.

                            ARTHUR
                    So you're saying you ... made the Earth?

                            SLARTIBARTFAST
                    Well, not me alone. It was a group
                    effort. I did my part, though. Ever heard
                    of a place, I think it's called Norway?

101b      Arthur nods. The cart pushes through the clouds, towards    101b
          Ayers Rock. A GUY ON A LADDER is painting it it's
          familiar red color. Some of it is still primer grey.

                            SLARTIBARTFAST (CONT'D)
                    That was one of mine. Won an award you
                    know. Lovely crinkly edges. I was sorry
                    to hear about it being blown up. Shocking
                    cock up. The mice were furious.

                              ARTHUR
                    Mice?    Who cares about bloody mice?

                            SLARTIBARTFAST
                    Are you a fan of plate tectonics?

          Arthur looks up.   Slartibartfast points down.

101c      ANOTHER MAN pushes a button causing mountains to spring     101c
          up noisily.

                             SLARTIBARTFAST (CONT'D)
                    Voila!   Himalayas. Good, eh?

          Arthur is working very hard to process all this.

101d      JUMP CUT. They move through a forest where a man presses    101d
          a lever making several MUSHROOMS pop up on the ground.

                            SLARTIBARTFAST (CONT'D)
                    Earthman, you must realize that the planet
                    you lived on was commissioned, paid for,
                    and run by mice. It was destroyed shortly
                    before the completion of the purpose for
                    which it was built. Ten minutes later, we
                    would have been free and clear. But we
                    gave them our standard ten million year
                    warranty and they have come here to
                    retrieve this back-up copy. And they've
                    brought you with them.

          The transport cart flies out of forest toward the ocean.

                    They brought...I'm sorry, when you say
                    "mice" do you mean the little white furry
                    creatures with the cheese fixation?

                               SLARTIBARTFAST
                       These creatures you call "mice" are merely
                       the protrusion into our dimension of hyper-
                       intelligent pan-dimensional beings. The
                       whole business with the cheese must've
                       been a front. They were experimenting on
                       you, you see. A vast computer program...

                               ARTHUR
                       Ah. I see where you're confused.    You see
                       -- we were experimenting on them.

101e      Over the ocean, a "Perfect Storm" wave rolls toward them.      101e

                               SLARTIBARTFAST
                       Oh, I gather they arranged for you to
                       conduct some primitively staged
                       experiments so they could prod your
                       thinking here and there. But you were
                       actually elements in the computer program.
                       They really are very clever hyper-
                       intelligent pan-dimensional beings.
                          (looking down)
                       Ah. They've nearly finished the oceans.

101f      They move toward the white cliffs of Dover. A man stands       101f
          on a cliff holding a giant hose, water spewing from it.

                               ARTHUR
                       So -- you're trying to tell me that mice
                       designed and built Deep Thought...and Deep
                       Thought designed the Earth...which was a
                       giant supercomputer...that you built...to
                       calculate the Ultimate Question. Only,
                       Vogons destroyed it ten minutes before the
                       program was completed?

                               SLARTIBARTFAST
                       That's bureaucracy for you.

                               ARTHUR
                       Actually, this explains a lot. All my
                       life I've had this strange feeling that
                       something was going on in the world,
                       something big, something sinister ...

                               SLARTIBARTFAST
                       That's just perfectly normal paranoia.
                       Everyone in the universe has that.

102       EXT. EARTH II. ENGLISH COUNTRYSIDE - CONTINUOUS                102

          A & S swoop down and soar over the English countryside --
          partially constructed; tall tree stocks with branch and
          leaves lying beside them, waiting to be attached. Men
          rolling out sod like a giant carpet, etc.

                              SLARTIBARTFAST
                      I don't know, perhaps I'm old and tired,
                      but I always think that the chances of
                      finding out what's really going on are so
                      absurdly remote that the only thing to do
                      is say hang the sense of it and keep
                      yourself busy. I'd much rather be happy
                      than right any day.

                              ARTHUR
                      And are you?

                              SLARTIBARTFAST
                      No. That's where it all falls down of

                      Here we are, then.

l03      The platform slows to a stop.      Arthur steps out and is     103
         stunned to see...

         HIS HOUSE. It's partially constructed. The chimney lies
         intact on the ground, waiting to be hoisted up. A row of
         hedges lies on it's side beside a trench. But it's his
         house alright.

                              ARTHUR
                      Is this...?

         Slartibartfast nods.      Arthur, in a daze, stumbles toward
         the house.

103a     INT. ARTHUR DENT'S HOUSE/MARK 2 - CONTINUOUS                   103a

         Arthur enters his house. There is no furniture, no
         photographs or books or any evidence of his existence
         there. He feels the walls, the countertops. He's home?

                      Arthur!

         Arthur pokes his head around a wall to find...

104      FORD, ZAPHOD AND TRILLIAN -- sitting at an elegantly set       104
         table -- stuffing their faces with a meal fit for a king.

         They talk while continuing to stuff food in their mouths.

                              FORD
                      Funniest thing. (chew, chew) Our hosts

                      Stun Mist (chew, chew) then brought us to
                      this amazing meal as a way to make it up

          They can't seem to stop eating, like they've been

          Arthur has spotted a TEA POT on the table. He hurries to
          it, feels it. Warm. He pours a cup, takes a sip,
          Closes his eyes, enjoying it.

                               ARTHUR (CONT'D)
                       Now that's a cup of tea.

                       We're glad you like it, Earth creature.

          He looks down and sees THE TWO WHITE MICE sitting on a
          silver platter.

                               BENJY MOUSE
                       After ten million years on Earth, and a
                       rather large chunk of that time in
                       England, it would be utterly humiliating
                       if we didn't know how to make a decent pot
                       of tea.

          Arthur stares in shock...can't speak.

                               TRILLIAN
                       Arthur, these are our hosts. Benjy mouse
                       and Franky mouse (chew, chew).
                       They control a large sector of the
                       Universe in our dimension (chew, chew).
                       I'm sorry, I thought you were told about
                       the mice...

                                ARTHUR
                       Yes. Yes, I was. I just wasn't quite
                       prepared for the full reality of it.

          He steadies himself on the table.

                               BENJY MOUSE
                       Sit, Earthman. Eat.

          Benjy pushes his hand through the air, the chair at the
          end slides backward.

                               ARTHUR
                       In a moment, perhaps.   I can't seem to let
                       go of this table.

          Slartibartfast steps forward.

                    Right.

                            BENJY MOUSE
                    It looks like we won't be needing the new
                    Earth after all, now that we've found the
                    only living native of the planet.

                            SLARTIBARTFAST
                    But...they've nearly finished the oceans.

                            FRAHKY MOUSE
                    That will be all, Slartibartfast.

          Slarti, slightly hurt, backs away out of sight.

                            ARTHUR
                    I'm sorry, when you say "the only living
                    native" -- do you mean me? What about
                    her?

          Benjy holds up a strand of hairs, same color as Trillian's.

                            BENJY MOUSE
                    We performed some rudimentary DNA tests on
                    the ship. She's half-native. Her real
                    father was a Blahardid, the hyper-
                    intelligent yet carelessly nomadic race
                    native to the planet Olbed, who apparently
                    popped in to Earth for a one-nighter with
                    a one Ms. Francis McMillan.

                            TRILLIAN
                       (looking up, mouth full)
                    Which explains a lot.

          She goes back to eating.    Arthur is taking this all in.

                            ARTHUR
                    So -- mostly harmless and me.    That's it.

                            BENJY MOUSE
                    We're sorry to have stage managed you so
                    shamelessly, but once we learned you were
                    the only full-blooded Earthling in the
                    universe, it was important that we get you
                    here by any means necessary.

                    We've spent a considerable amount of time
                    on your planet trying to find this
                    wretched Ultimate Question, and the
                    thought of doing it all over again on
                    account of those idiotic Vogons sickens me
                    to no end. Which is why you're here.

                            BENJY MOUSE
                    Sit, Earthling. Sit.

          Arthur goes to pull out the chair beside him.

                            BENJY/FRANKY
                    NOT THERE!

          Arthur jumps. The others look up.      Benjy and Franky
          cover their outburst with a smile.

                            BENJY MOUSE
                    This chair is much more -- comfortable.

          Benjy makes a motion. The chair he pushed out before
          slides over behind Arthur's knees, making him sit.

                              BENJY MOUSE (CONT'D)
                    Drink.

          He slides the cup of tea over.     Arthur takes a sip.

                              ARTHUR
                    Mmmm.    This really is delicious.

                            BENJY MOUSE
                    Good. Glad you like it.      Now -- to
                    business.

          Ford and Zaphod raise their glasses like drunken sailors.

                            FORD/ZAPHOD
                    To business!

          Benjy and Franky fire them a look.

                              ZAPHOD
                    Sorry.    Thought you were proposing a
                    toast.

                              BENJY/FRANKY
                    EAT!

          Ford and Zaphod eat. Benjy turns to Arthur. Smiles. No
          one notices, through the window, a row of Vogons cresting
          the hill.

                            BENJY MOUSE
                    About this Ultimate Question. You see,
                    we've been offered a quite enormously fat
                    contract to do the 5D TV chat show and
                    lecture circuit, and quite frankly, we're
                    very much inclined to take it.

                            FRANKY MOUSE
                    But - and here's the point - we have to
                    have product. Which means we still need
                    an ultimate question.

                            BENJY MOUSE
                    Or at least, one that sounds ultimate.

                               FRANKY HOUSE
                    Yes.     Got to sound good.

                            ARTHUR
                    An Ultimate Question that sounds good...
                    From a couple of mice...for a chat show.

                            FRANKY MOUSE
                    And as it turns out, the chances are
                    astronomically high that the structure of
                    the question is encoded in your brain.
                    Which is why we need it. More tea?

          Franky tries to pour more tea. Arthur stops drinking, a
          little woozy. Did he hear them right?

                            ARTHUR
                    I'm sorry -- did you just say you need my
                    brain?

                               BENJY MOUSE
                    Yes.     To extract the question.

                            ARTHUR
                    You can't have my brain. I'm using it.

                               FRANKY MOUSE
                    Barely.

                             BENJY MOUSE
                     We can replace it if you think it's
                     important. An electronic brain maybe.

                             FRANKY MOUSE
                     A simple one should suffice. Who would
                     know the difference?

                             ARTHUR
                     I would!

                             FRANKY MOUSE
                     No, you wouldn't. We could program you not
                     to.

          Arthur tries to get up. Clamps spring up from the chair
          and wrap around his arms. A dome flips over from the
          back and slams down on his head. Arthur struggles.

                               ARTHUR
                     Ford!    Zaphod!   TRILLIAN!!

          They're gorging on the food, half-lidded, out of it.

                            ARTHUR (CONT'D)
                    What are they-- what's in the food?!
                    WHAT WAS IN THAT TEA!?

          The platter the mice are standing on rises up, moves toward
          Arthur, ominous surgical instruments spring from it.

                            BENJY MOUSE
                    Don't worry. You won't feel a thing.

          The mice on the platter move ominously toward Arthur.
          Arthur, still attached to the chair, backs away.

          Scythes and rotating arms with circular saw blades shoot
          out -- ominous surgical equipment to remove his brain.

                             ARTHUR
                    Wait a minute, JUST WAIT A SODDING
                    MINUTE!!

          The scythes and arms stop spinning. Arthur stumbles
          backwards and sits down in the chair. The others stop
          eating and listen.

                            ARTHUR (CONT'D)
                    You want the question that goes with the
                    answer "42" How about "What's six times
                    seven?" Or "How many Vogons does it take
                    to screw in a lightbulb?" Or here's one,
                    "How many roads must a man walk down?"

                            BENJY MOUSE
                    Hey, that's not bad.

          Through the opposite window (in much the same way
          bulldozers arrived in the opening) we see more Vogons
          arriving.

                            ARTHUR
                    Fine. Take it. There's plenty more where
                    that came from because my head is filled,
                    with questions, and I can assure you mate,
                    no answer to any of them has ever brought
                    me one iota of happiness. Confusion? Yes.
                    Indecision? Loads. But happiness...?

          He shakes his head.

                            BENJY MOUSE
                    We don't want to be happy.   We want to be
                    rich.

                            FRANKY MOUSE
                    Take his brain.

          Benjy steers the platter toward Arthur. He jerks his
          arms up. They break free of the shackles and hit the
          platter. The mice fly through the air and land on the
          table -- right beside the POV gun. They scramble to
          their feet.

                            BENJY MOUSE
                    Shoot him!!

          They try to lift the POV gun but it's way too heavy.

          Arthur, his butt still strapped in the chair, leaps over
          to the table and grabs the first thing he sees -- a leg
          of mutton. He raises it high. Benjy and Franky look up.

                            FRANKY MOUSE
                    Oh, shit.

          Arthur brings the mutton down, squashing them flat.

          The others instantly snap out of their food induced haze,
          Zaphod suddenly clutches his gut.

                            ZAPHOD
                    Ohhhh, I think I'm gonna be sick.

          Arthur looks up and now he sees the Vogons marching down
          the hill toward the house. He leans over the table,
          bumping his teacup. IT SHATTERS TO THE GROUND.

105       ON THE HILL JUST BEYOND --                                   105

          An ARMY OF VOGON POLICE march over it.    Amongst them...

          MARVIN -- marches as well, a gun held to his head.

                            MARVIN
                       (to the Vogon)
                    I must warn you, I'm feeling very
                    depressed.

                            KWALTZ
                    Mr. President!     We are here for your
                    protection!

          Zaphod appears at the front door and waves Presidentially.

                            ZAPHOD
                    Thank you!

106       The Police open fire. Zaphod and the others flee as the      106
          barrage of fire continues. Trillian drops the POV gun,
          goes back for it. Arthur stops her and pulls her behind
          the truck. Marvin catches a bullet in the back of his
          head - sparks fly and he is thrown forwards! Is he dead?

          BEHIND THE TRUCK --

          FORD looks at MARVIN lying face down in the dirt - his
          head emitting smoke.

                      Okay -- I'll create a distraction.

         He holds up his towel.

                          (sarcastic)

                          (squinting at Arthur)

                      things that mean something other than what
                      you're actually saying.

         More gunfire erupts. Ford spins his towel until it's
         twisted and taught. He leaps up and runs towards...

107      ...THE VOGON POLICE FORCE -- who see him coming, his            107
         towel held like he's going to whip someone on the ass.

                      AHHHHHHHH!!!!

         The Vogons are so caught off guard, they back away.

         They each grab the gun just as Questular realizes...

                              QUESTULAR
                      It's a towel! It's only a TOWEL!!     GET
                      HIM!!

         The Police stop their retreat, raise their guns, move
         forward. Ford skids to a stop and runs back toward
         Arthur and Trillian, both clinging to the gun, running
         back toward the truck. GUNFIRE ERUPTS. A and T TRIP.
         The POV gun goes flying and lands in... MARVIN'S ARMS.

         The Vogon Police run in formation toward the gang.       Ford
         looks back, sees the Vogons approaching. He looks
         forward, sees Marvin raising the gun.

                                FORD
                      Duck!

                                ZAPHOD
                      Where?

         He looks to the skies just as Ford fans out his towel and
         uses it to bring Z, A & T to the ground just as...

         MARVIN FIRES THE POV GUN,

         Questular ducks. CLICK. The entire Vogon Police force is
         hit. They instantly stop. Their shoulders slump.

                           VOGON POLICE FORCE
                      (in unison)
                      Oh what's the point?

         They turn their weapons on themselves and...

         ANGLE ON FORD, ZAPHOD, ARTHUR AND TRILLIAN -- turning
         their heads as we hear the weapons fire. They look up.

108a     All the Vogon Police lie motionless on the ground                108a
         including Kwaltz. Questular is the last man standing.

         He marches toward them, patches of clump baldness on his
         head. He drops to his knees.

                              QUESTULAR
                      Shoot me. Please Zaphod. Shoot me.

         Zaphod takes the gun, fires it at Questular.       He rises --
         and paints on a big smile.

                              QUESTULAR (CONT'D}
                      What am I so pissed off about? I'm great?
                      I'm zarking incredible! Everyone loves
                      me! WHOOO HOOO!!! Look at me...etc.

         Questular runs towards a lake/blow hole, takes off his
         clothes and jumps in.

                                ZAPHOD
                      Marvin.    You saved our lives.

                                MARVIN
                      I know.    Wretched, isn't it?

                              QUESTULAR
                      (distant) Oh man! I love being me!!

         They share a laugh.      Arthur approaches Slartibartfast.

                              ARTHUR
                      Thank you.

                               SLARTIBARTFAST
                       I've just been informed by some of the
                       lads that since we're so near completion,
                       we're going to go ahead and finish Earth.
                       We can put it back exactly the way it was
                       when you left, you know -- unless there's
                       anything you'd like to change. Something
                       you think your planet could do without?

          Arthur thinks about it...looks around...slowly nods...

                                ARTHUR
                       Yes.   Me.

          He looks to Trillian who raises an eyebrow.    Really?
          She smiles.

                               TRILLIAN
                       Let's go somewhere.

                               ARTHUR
                       Yes, You name it. I'll go.

                               ZAPHOD
                       I'm going to Humma's. He has my head...I
                       think. Doesn't he? I'm so confused.

                               FORD
                       And I'm hungry. After we get your head
                       let's grab a bite. I know this great
                       restaurant at the end of the universe.

          As they walk away, we CUT TO...

109       SLARTI'S FACTORY ELEVATOR -- where they all board.           109

                               SLARTIBARTFAST
                       Okay. Hold tight.

          Everyone grabs the rail, except for Trillian who holds on
          to Arthur. SSSSSSHHHHHHHHHVUMP! Up into the sky they go.

                               VOICE (O.S.)

          We hear KL-KLUNK. BZZZZZZZ... and watch nature burst
          into life - animals run - flowers bloom - waterfalls
          cascade - mountains rise in the mist - monkeys bathe in
          hot springs etc. Set to a wonderful, uplifting piece of
          music ("WHAT A WONDERFUL WORLD?").

          Tilt up to the sky. The day turns to night. Stars appear.
          The Heart of Gold streaks through the stars.

                         FADE IN:

          EXT. NORTH SEA/VILLAGE - NIGHT

          We skim above a dark, wild ocean. The camera turns toward a
          lone island, Berk. It is a gigantic shard of rock jutting
          straight out of the water.

          HICCUP (V.O.)
          This, is Berk. It's twelve days
          North of hopeless, and a few
          degrees South of freezing to death.
          It's located solidly on the
          meridian of misery.
          The camera drifts over rolling hills to reveal a small
          village nestled on an outcropping of sea mounts.

          HICCUP (V.O.) (CONT'D)
          My village. In a word, sturdy.
          And it's been here for seven
          generations, but every single
          building is new.
          The camera drifts closer, circling.

          HICCUP (V.O.) (CONT'D)
          We have fishing, hunting, and a
          charming view of the sunsets. The
          only problems are the pests. You
          see, most places have mice or
          mosquitos. We have...
          Sheep graze peacefully on a hillside. Suddenly one is
          snatched.

                         CUT TO:

          INT. STOICK'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

          A door is pulled open... as a DRAGON swoops directly toward
          it, BLASTING FIRE. The door is SLAMMED. The fire shoots
          through the slats of wood, illuminating HICCUP, a gangly
          teenage Viking.

                         HICCUP
          ...dragons.

          EXT. STOICK'S HOUSE

          He reopens the sizzling door, as leaps off of the front
          porch. He weaves through the erupting mayhem as Vikings pour
          out of the buildings, ready for a fight.

          More dragons swarm in, setting rooftops alight and hauling
          off sheep.

          HICCUP (V.O.)
          Most people would leave. Not us.
          We're Vikings. We have stubbornness
          issues.
          Vikings sound the alarm. Viking men and women pour out into
          the streets, axes in hand.
          ON HICCUP darting through alleys, staying under eaves, making
          his way through the battle.

          HICCUP (V.O.) (CONT'D)
          My name's Hiccup. Great name, I
          know. But it's not the worst.
          Parents believe a hideous name will
          frighten off gnomes and trolls.
          Like our charming Viking demeanor
          wouldn't do that.
          Dragons sweep back and forth, dodging axes and blasting the
          Vikings who throw them. A burly warrior gets tossed in an
          explosion, knocking Hiccup to the ground.

                         VIKING

          Arggghhhhh!
          (cheery, insane)
          Mornin'!
          Hiccup gets to his feet and continues to rush past gigantic
          men and women.

          HICCUP (V.O.)
          Meet the neighbors. Hoark the
          Haggard...

                         HOARK
          What are you doing out!?

                         HICCUP
          ... Burnthair the Broad...

                         BURNTHAIR
          Get inside!

          ... Phlegma the Fierce...

          PHLEGMA THE FIERCE
          Get back inside!

                         HICCUP
          . Ack.
          He passes a silent ox of a viking, picking his ear.

          HICCUP (CONT'D)
          Yep, just Ack.
          Enter STOICK, the biggest Viking of all. He yanks Hiccup from
          the path of a strafing dragon and holds aloft to the crowd.

                         STOICK
          Hiccup!?
          (accusingly; to the crowd)
          What is he doing out again?!

                         (TO HICCUP)
          What are you doing out?! Get
          inside!
          The flames light up his scowling face and matted red beard.
          He sets Hiccup down and turns to the sky, searching.

          HICCUP (V.O.)

                         (IN AWE)
          That's Stoick the Vast. Chief of
          the tribe. They say that when he
          was a baby he popped a dragon's
          head clean off of its shoulders.
          Do I believe it?
          Stoick grabs a wooden cart and hurls it, knocking the
          strafing dragon out of the sky.

          HICCUP (V.O.) (CONT'D)
          Yes I do.
          An EXPLOSION forces Vikings to DUCK. Stoick stands firm,
          brushing flaming debris off of his shoulder.

                         STOICK
          (barking; to his men)
          What have we got?

                         VIKING #1
          Gronkles. Nadders. Zipplebacks. Oh,
          and Hoark saw a Monstrous
          Nightmare.

                         STOICK
          Any Night Furies?

                         VIKING #1
          None so far.

                         STOICK

                         (RELIEVED)
          Good.

                         VIKING
          Hoist the torches!
          Massive flaming braziers are raised on poles, lighting up the
          night sky... and revealing swirling dragons of all types.
          Below, Hiccup crosses an open plaza and ducks into an open
          building with a tall chimney.

          INT. BLACKSMITH STALL - CONTINUOUS

          He crosses behind a counter, where a peg-legged, one-armed
          hulk of a Blacksmith reshapes blades with a hammer and tongs
          appendage.

                         GOBBER
          Ah! Nice of you to join the party.
          I thought you'd been carried off.
          Hiccup dons a leather apron and starts to put away Gobber's
          scattered appendages.

                         HICCUP
          Who me? Nah, come on! I'm way too
          muscular for their taste. They
          wouldn't know what to do with all
          this.
          Hiccup strikes a bodybuilder pose.

                         GOBBER
          They need toothpicks, don't they?
          Hiccup gets to work, transferring bent and chipped weapons to
          the forge as Vikings crowd the counter for replacements.

          HICCUP (V.O.)
          The meathead with attitude and
          interchangeable hands is Gobber.
          I've been his apprentice ever since
          I was little. Well...littler.

          EXT. VILLAGE - CONTINUOUS


                         ON STOICK

                         STOICK
          We move to the lower defenses.
          We'll counter-attack with the
          catapults.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          "Dragon" DeBlois/Sanders Final Draft (Rev.19) 02-13-2010 5.
          Armed men rush past, flanking others who carry sheep to
          safety. Stoick follows up the rear as, overhead, a dragon
          strafes the rooftops with Napalm-like fire.

          HICCUP (V.O.)
          See? Old village. Lots and lots
          of new houses.

                         VIKING

          FIRE!
          In response, the fire brigade charges through the plaza --
          four TEENS, tugging a large wooden cask on wheels. From it,
          they fill buckets of water to douse the flames. One among
          them is a cute, energetic Viking girl.
          Hiccup leans out of the stall to watch her.

          HICCUP (V.O.)
          Oh and that's Fishlegs, Snotlout.
          The twins Ruffnut and Tuffnut.
          And...

                         (DREAMY)
          Astrid.
          A SLOW-MOTION explosion erupts behind her, framing her in a
          sexy ball of fire. The others join her, looking awesome and
          heroic.

          HICCUP (V.O.) (CONT'D)
          Their job is so much cooler.
          Hiccup tries to join them as they pass, but he's hooked by
          Gobber and hoisted back inside.

          HICCUP (CONT'D)

                         (PLEADING)
          Ah, come on. Let me out, please. I
          need to make my mark.

                         GOBBER
          Oh, you've made plenty of marks.
          All in the wrong places.

                         HICCUP
          Please, two minutes. I'll kill a
          dragon. My life will get infinitely
          better. I might even get a date.

                         GOBBER
          You can't lift a hammer. You can't
          swing an axe...
          Gobber grabs a bola (iron balls connected by rope).

          GOBBER (CONT'D)
          ... you can't even throw one of
          these.
          A Viking runs by and nabs it out of Gobber's hand, hurling it
          at a dive-bombing Gronkle. The bola binds its legs, sending
          it into a heavy crash.

                         HICCUP
          (ready with the answer)
          Okay fine, but...
          He rushes to the back corner of the stall and presents a
          bizarre, wheel barrow-like contraption.

          HICCUP (CONT'D)
          ... this will throw it for me.
          Hiccup OPENS the hinged lid of the device. An arm springs up,
          equipped with twin bows. They prematurely launch a bola,
          narrowly missing Gobber... and taking out a Viking at the
          counter.

                         VIKING
          Arggh!

                         GOBBER
          See, now this right here is what
          I'm talking about.

                         HICCUP
          Mild calibration issue.

                         GOBBER
          Hiccup. If you ever want to get out
          there to fight dragons, you need
          to stop all...
          Gobber gestures in Hiccup's general direction.

          GOBBER (CONT'D)
          ... this.

                         HICCUP

                         (ASTONISHED)
          But... you just pointed to all of
          me.

                         GOBBER
          Yes! That's it! Stop being all of
          you.

          Ohhhh...

                         GOBBER

                         (MIMICKING)
          Ohhhhh, yes.

                         HICCUP
          You, sir, are playing a dangerous
          game. Keeping this much,
          raw...Vikingness contained.

                         (BEAT)
          There will be consequences!
          Gobber tosses him a sword.

                         GOBBER
          I'll take my chances. Sword.
          Sharpen. Now.
          Hiccup takes it begrudgingly and lobs it onto the grinding
          wheel. He stews... fantasizing...

          HICCUP (V.O.)
          One day I'll get out there. Because
          killing a dragon is everything
          around here.

          EXT. VILLAGE - LOWER PLAINS - CONTINUOUS

          Nadders land, gathering like seagulls around a seemingly
          vacant house.

          HICCUP (V.O.)
          A Nadder head is sure to get me at
          least noticed.
          The Nadders clamber onto the building, tearing the roof and
          walls apart. Sheep pour out and SCATTER.
          Elsewhere, hippo-like Gronckles pick drying racks clean of
          fish and fly off like loaded pelicans.

          HICCUP (V.O.) (CONT'D)
          Gronckles are tough. Taking down
          one of those would definitely get
          me a girlfriend.
          A stealthy, snake-like dragon head peeks over a rooftop,
          breathing gas into a chimney.

          HICCUP (V.O.) (CONT'D)
          A Zippelback? Exotic, exciting. Two
          heads, twice the status.
          A second head pokes through the door and lights it. KABLAM!
          The two heads fly through the explosion, their necks zipping
          together to reveal a single body.
          It flies past Stoick as he climbs to the top of a CATAPULT

          TOWER.

                         CATAPULT OPERATOR
          They found the sheep!

                         STOICK

                         (FRUSTRATED)
          Concentrate fire over the lower
          bank!

                         CATAPULT OPERATOR
          Fire!
          Boulders are catapulted at the corralling Nadders...
          Just as a huge red dragon whips past, spraying the base of
          the catapult with sticky fire.

          HICCUP (V.O.)
          And then there's the Monstrous
          Nightmare. Only the best Vikings go
          after those. They have this nasty
          habit of setting themselves on
          fire.
          It emerges from the flames, climbing the catapult with a
          leering, toothy grin.

                         STOICK
          Reload! I'll take care of this.
          Stoick takes on the Nightmare, face to hammer.
          Suddenly, a LOUD BALLISTIC MOANING streaks overhead. The
          catapult crew ducks.

          INT. BLACKSMITH STALL - CONTINUOUS

          ON HICCUP, looking up from his work, reacting to the same
          sound.

          HICCUP (V.O.)
          But the ultimate prize is the
          dragon no one has ever seen. We
          call it the--

                         VIKING
          Night Fury! Get down!
          Vikings everywhere take shelter. The moaning sound BUILDS.

          EXT. VILLAGE - CATAPULT - CONTINUOUS

          The Monstrous Nightmare suddenly stops fighting and takes
          flight. Stoick looks skyward.

                         STOICK

          JUMP!
          KABOOM! The Catapult EXPLODES as though hit by an artillery
          shell... sending Stoick and the crew leaping for their lives.

          HICCUP (V.O.)
          This thing never steals food, never
          shows itself, and...
          The sound recedes, leaving the crippled catapult in flames.

          HICCUP (V.O.) (CONT'D)
          ...never misses.

                         (BEAT)
          No one has ever killed a Night
          Fury. That's why I'm going to be
          the first.

          IN THE STALL
          Gobber trades his hammer for an axe.

                         GOBBER
          Man the fort, Hiccup, they need me
          out there!
          Gobber pauses. Turns with a threatening glare.

          GOBBER (CONT'D)
          Stay. Put. There. You know what I
          mean.
          Gobber charges into the fray, HOLLERING.
          ON HICCUP, a smirk crosses his face.

          EXT. VILLAGE - MOMENTS LATER

          WHAM! Hiccup pushes his wheeled contraption through a wall of
          clustered Vikings. He weaves through the ongoing mayhem, as
          fast as his legs can carry him.

          VIKING #6 (O.S.)
          Hiccup, where are you going!

                         VIKING #7
          Come back here!

                         HICCUP
          I know. Be right back!

          ON THE PLAIN BELOW
          The Nadders have cornered the house-full of sheep. They close
          in, ready to spring upon them.
          Stoick suddenly appears, HURLING FISHING NETS over them. The
          surprised Nadders are caught. Stoick and his men rush in.
          A Nadder blasts a hole through its net. Stoick leaps onto it,
          clamping his thick arms around its head, forcing its jaws
          shut.

                         STOICK
          Mind yourselves! The devils still
          have some juice in them.

          ON THE PLAIN ABOVE
          Hiccup reaches a cliff overlooking the smoking CATAPULT and
          drops the handles to the ground. He cranks several levers,
          unfolding and then cocking the bowed arms of his contraption.
          He drops a bola onto a chamber and then pivots the weapon on
          a gimbal head toward the dark sky.
          He listens, with his eye pressed to the scope, hand poised on
          the trigger. He hears the NIGHT FURY approaching... and turns
          his aim to the defense tower. It closes in for the final
          strike, completely camouflaged in the night.

                         HICCUP

                         (TO HIMSELF)
          Come on. Give me something to shoot
          at, give me something to shoot at.
          KABLAM! The tower topples. The blast of fire illuminates the
          dragon for a split second. Hiccup pulls the trigger.
          KERTHUNK! The flexed arms SNAP forward, springing the weapon
          off the ground. The bola disappears into the sky, followed by
          a WHACK and a SCREECH.

          HICCUP (CONT'D)
          (surprised, then elated)
          Oh I hit it! Yes, I hit it! Did
          anybody see that?
          Hiccup's victory is short-lived. A Monstrous Nightmare
          appears, slithering up over the lip of the cliff.

          HICCUP (CONT'D)
          Except for you.
          ON STOICK, holding down the netted Nadders. He hears a
          familiar HOLLER and looks up to see...
          HICCUP running through the PLAZA, SCREAMING, with the
          NIGHTMARE fast on his heels.
          Alarmed, Stoick abandons the Nadders and runs off.

                         STOICK
          (to his men, re: the

                         NADDERS)
          DO NOT let them escape!

          IN THE PLAZA
          Vikings scatter as Hiccup dodges a near fatal blast. The
          Nightmare's sticky, Napalm-like fire splashes up onto
          buildings, setting them alight.
          Hiccup ducks behind the last standing brazier -- the only
          shelter available. The Nightmare blasts it, spraying fire all
          around him. Hiccup peers around the smoldering post. No sign
          of the Nightmare.
          He turns back to find it leering at him, blocking his escape.
          It takes a deep breath. Hiccup is finished.
          Suddenly, Stoick LEAPS between them, tackling the Nightmare
          to the ground. They tumble and wrestle, resuming their
          earlier fight. The Nightmare tries to toast him, but only
          coughs up smoke.

          STOICK (CONT'D)
          You're all out.
          He smashes the Nightmare repeatedly in the face, driving it
          away. It takes to the air and disappears. Winded, Stoick
          turns to Hiccup.

          HICCUP (V.O.)
          Oh, and there's one more thing you
          need to know...

          The burnt brazier pole collapses, sending the massive iron
          basket crashing. It bounces down the hill, destroying as it
          goes and scattering the Vikings who were holding down the
          netted Nadders. The freed dragons escape... with several
          sheep in tow.

          HICCUP (CONT'D)
          Sorry, dad.

          EXT. VILLAGE - UPPER PLAZA - CONTINUOUS

          The escaped Nadders fly past with sheep in their clutches.
          The raid is over. The dragons have clearly won.
          The murmuring crowd eyes Stoick, awaiting his response.

                         HICCUP

                         (SHEEPISH)
          Okay, but I hit a Night Fury.
          Stoick grabs Hiccup by the back scruff of his collar and
          hauls him away, fuming with embarrassment.

          HICCUP (CONT'D)
          It's not like the last few times,
          Dad. I mean I really actually hit
          it. You guys were busy and I had a
          very clear shot. It went down, just
          off Raven Point. Let's get a search
          party out there, before it--

                         STOICK
          --STOP! Just....stop.
          He releases Hiccup. Everyone goes silent, staring
          expectantly.

          STOICK (CONT'D)
          Every time you step outside,
          disaster follows. Can you not see
          that I have bigger problems?
          Winter's almost here and I have an
          entire village to feed!
          Hiccup looks around. All eyes are upon him.

                         HICCUP
          Between you and me, the village
          could do with a little less
          feeding, don't ya think?
          A few rotund Vikings stir self-consciously.

                         STOICK
          This isn't a joke, Hiccup!

                         (EXASPERATED)
          Why can't you follow the simplest
          orders?

                         HICCUP
          I can't stop myself. I see a dragon
          and I have to just... kill it, you
          know? It's who I am, Dad.

                         STOICK
          You are many things, Hiccup. But a
          dragon killer is not one of them.
          Sting. Hiccup looks around to see many nods of agreement.

          STOICK (CONT'D)
          Get back to the house.

                         (TO GOBBER)
          Make sure he gets there. I have his
          mess to clean up.
          Stoick lumbers off in the opposite direction.
          Gobber leads Hiccup through the walk of shame. They pass the
          teen fire brigade as they snicker.

                         TUFFNUT
          Quite the performance.

                         SNOTLOUT
          I've never seen anyone mess up that
          badly. That helped!

                         HICCUP
          Thank you, thank you. I was
          trying, so...
          Hiccup avoids Astrid's glare and heads up toward a large
          house, standing prominently on the hill above the others.

          HICCUP (CONT'D)
          I really did hit one.

                         GOBBER
          Sure, Hiccup.

                         HICCUP
          He never listens.

                         GOBBER
          Well, it runs in the family.

                         HICCUP
          And when he does, it's always with
          this... disappointed scowl. Like
          someone skimped on the meat in his
          sandwich.

                         (MIMICKING STOICK)
          Excuse me, barmaid. I'm afraid you
          brought me the wrong offspring. I
          ordered an extra large boy with
          beefy arms. Extra guts and glory on
          the side. This here. This is a
          talking fish bone.

                         GOBBER
          You're thinking about this all
          wrong. It's not so much what you
          look like. It's what's inside that
          he can't stand.
          Beat.

                         HICCUP
          Thank you, for summing that up.
          They reach the doorway.

                         GOBBER
          Look, the point is, stop trying so
          hard to be something you're not.
          Hiccup SIGHS heavily.

                         HICCUP
          I just want to be one of you guys.
          Gobber eyes him sympathetically. Hiccup turns and goes
          through the front door.
          And straight out the back door. He hurries off into the
          woods, determined.

          INT. GREAT HALL - DAY

          A noisy din of PROTESTING VOICES leads to...
          STOICK, glowering in the firelight. Surrounded by his men.

                         STOICK
          Either we finish them or they'll
          finish us! It's the only way we'll
          be rid of them! If we find the
          nest and destroy it, the dragons
          will leave. They'll find another
          home.

          He sinks his blade into a...
          LARGE NAUTICAL MAP, spread out on the table... the blade
          pierces the middle of an uncharted corner, swirling with
          painted sea monsters and dragons.

          STOICK (CONT'D)

                         (DECIDEDLY)
          One more search. Before the ice
          sets in.

                         VIKING
          Those ships never come back.

                         STOICK

                         (MATTER-OF-FACT)
          We're Vikings. It's an occupational
          hazard. Now who's with me?
          Stoick throws up his fist. No one follows. The crowds shifts
          in restless silence. Head scratches. Eyes averted.

                         VIKING

                         (FEEBLE)
          Today's not good for me.

          VIKING (CONT'D)

                         (EQUALLY FEEBLE)
          I've gotta do my axe returns.

                         STOICK
          Alright. Those who stay will look
          after Hiccup.
          Hands jut into the air, volunteers galore. Enthusiastic
          murmurs of prep and packing fill the room.

          PHLEGMA THE FIERCE
          To the ships!

                         SPITELOUT
          I'm with you Stoick!

                         STOICK

                         (DRY)
          That's more like it.
          The Vikings rush for the door, leaving Gobber and Stoick
          alone. Gobber gulps back the contents of his tankard
          attachment and scrapes back the bench.

                         GOBBER
          I'll pack my undies.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          "Dragon" DeBlois/Sanders Final Draft (Rev.19) 02-13-2010 16.

                         STOICK
          No, I need you to stay and train
          some new recruits.

                         GOBBER
          Oh, perfect. And while I'm busy,
          Hiccup can cover the stall. Molten
          steel, razor sharp blades, lots of
          time to himself...what could
          possibly go wrong?
          Stoick sinks onto the bench beside Gobber, his brow burdened.

                         STOICK
          What am I going to do with him
          Gobber?

                         GOBBER
          Put him in training with the
          others.

                         STOICK
          No, I'm serious.

                         GOBBER
          So am I.
          Stoick turns to him, glaring.

                         STOICK
          He'd be killed before you let the
          first dragon out of its cage.

                         GOBBER
          Oh, you don't know that.

                         STOICK
          I do know that, actually.

                         GOBBER
          No, you don't.

                         STOICK
          No, actually I do.

                         GOBBER
          No you don't!

                         STOICK
          Listen! You know what he's like.
          From the time he could crawl he's
          been...different. He doesn't
          listen.

                         STOICK (CONT'D)
          Has the attention span of a
          sparrow. I take him fishing and he
          goes hunting for... for trolls.

                         GOBBER

                         (DEFENSIVE)
          Trolls exist! They steal your
          socks.

                         (DARKLY)
          But only the left ones. What's with
          that?

                         STOICK
          When I was a boy...

                         GOBBER

                         (GRUMBLING)
          Oh here we go.

                         STOICK
          My father told me to bang my head
          against a rock and I did it. I
          thought it was crazy, but I didn't
          question him. And you know what
          happened?

                         GOBBER
          You got a headache.

                         STOICK
          That rock split in two. It taught
          me what a Viking could do, Gobber.
          He could crush mountains, level
          forests, tame seas! Even as a boy,
          I knew what I was, what I had to
          become.

                         (BEAT)
          Hiccup is not that boy.

                         GOBBER
          You can't stop him, Stoick. You can
          only prepare him.

                         (BEAT)
          Look, I know it seems hopeless. But
          the truth is you won't always be
          around to protect him. He's going
          to get out there again. He's
          probably out there now.
          ON STOICK, as Gobber's words hit their mark.

          EXT. WOODS - DAY


          ON AN OPEN NOTEBOOK

                         

                         

                         

                         
          "Dragon" DeBlois/Sanders Final Draft (Rev.19) 02-13-2010 18.
          A drawn map of the island, covered in X's.
          Hiccup looks up from it and peeks over a gorge, expectantly.
          Sees nothing.
          He adds another 'X' to the page, then scratches his pencil
          over the whole map in frustration. He snaps the book closed
          and pockets it.

                         HICCUP
          Uggh, the gods hate me. Some people
          lose their knife or their mug. No,
          not me. I manage to lose an entire
          dragon.
          Hiccup WHACKS a low-hanging branch. It SNAPS back at him,
          hitting him in the face. He looks up to see a snapped tree
          trunk. His eyes follow it to a long trench of up-turned
          earth.
          He follows it to a downed, black dragon, its body and tail
          tangled in a bola. It appears dead. Hiccup approaches,
          beaming.

          HICCUP (CONT'D)

                         (IN SHOCK)
          Oh wow. I did it. I did it. This
          fixes everything.

                         (ELATED)
          Yes!
          He strikes a victory pose, planting his foot on the fallen
          Night Fury.

          HICCUP (CONT'D)
          I have brought down this mighty
          beast!
          It suddenly shifts.

          HICCUP (CONT'D)
          Whoa!
          Hiccup springs back, terrified. He turns his blade on it.
          Rattled, Hiccup creeps along the length of the weak, wounded
          dragon, dagger poised to strike.
          As he reaches the head, Hiccup finds the Night Fury staring
          coldly at him. Hiccup tries to look away, but he's drawn back
          to its unnerving, unflinching stare.
          With the dragon safety tangled in the ropes, Hiccup jabs with
          his dagger, puffing himself up with false bravado.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          "Dragon" DeBlois/Sanders Final Draft (Rev.19) 02-13-2010 19.

          HICCUP (CONT'D)
          I'm going to kill you, Dragon. I'm
          gonna cut out your heart and take
          it to my father. I'm a Viking.

                         (BEAT)
          I am a VIKING!
          Hiccup raises the dagger, determined to prove his Viking-
          ness. The dragon's labored breathing breaks Hiccup's clenched
          concentration. He opens an eye, uncertainty leaking through.
          The dragon holds the stare. Something profound is exchanged.
          Finally, the Night Fury closes its eye and lowers its head,
          resigned to its fate.
          Hiccup tries to go through with it, holding the dagger
          aloft... fighting himself... until finally lowering it with a
          frustrated sigh.
          He looks over the dragon's chaffed rope wounds.

          HICCUP (CONT'D)
          (muttered, ashamed)
          I did this.
          He turns to leave. Pauses. And glances back at the dragon,
          chest heaving.
          Hiccup GRUMBLES. He checks over his shoulder to ensure that
          no one is watching... then hurries back to cut the ropes.
          The Night Fury's eye shoots open. With the dragon watching
          his every move, Hiccup hurriedly saws through the bola ropes.
          As the last rope falls free, the Night Fury suddenly POUNCES!
          In a blur, the dragon is upon him, pinning Hiccup down,
          grazing his neck. Looking like it's about to kill him. Hiccup
          is paralyzed. The dragon's breath ruffles his hair. Hiccup
          opens his eyes to find the Night Fury's wolf-like stare
          boring into him. The exchange is intense, profound.
          The dragon draws a deep breath, as though it's about to torch
          him, then lets out an ear-piercing scream instead. It turns
          and takes flight, flapping violently through the canopy of
          trees. It bashes against a nearby mountain side, recovers,
          and drops out of view some distance away.
          Winded, Hiccup struggles to his feet, staggers a few steps,
          collapses to his knees, and faints.

          INT. STOICK'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

          Hiccup enters to see...

          STOICK, seated on a thick slice of tree-trunk. He is slouched
          over the fire-pit, stirring the coals with his axe. Embers
          waft around his beard.
          Hiccup tries to sneak past, up the stairs to his room. Stoick
          seems none the wiser, when...

                         STOICK
          Hiccup.

                         HICCUP

                         (CAUGHT)
          Dad. Uh...
          Stoick stands, takes a deep breath.

          HICCUP (CONT'D)
          I, uh... I have to talk to you,
          Dad.

                         STOICK
          I need to speak with you too, son.
          Hiccup and Stoick STRAIGHTEN at the same moment.

                         HICCUP STOICK
          I've decided I don't want to I think it's time you learn
          fight dragons. to fight dragons.

          STOICK (CONT'D)
          You go first.

          No, you go first.

                         STOICK
          Alright. You get your wish. Dragon
          training. You start in the morning.

                         HICCUP

                         (SCRAMBLING)
          Oh man, I should've gone first. Uh,
          'cause I was thinking, you know we
          have a surplus of dragon-fighting
          Vikings, but do we have enough
          bread-making Vikings, or small home

                         STOICK
          --You'll need this.
          Stoick hands Hiccup his axe. Hiccup avoids taking it.

                         HICCUP
          I don't want to fight dragons.

                         STOICK
          Come on. Yes, you do.

                         HICCUP
          Rephrase. Dad I can't kill dragons.

                         STOICK
          But you will kill dragons.

                         HICCUP
          No, I'm really very extra sure that
          I won't.

                         STOICK
          It's time Hiccup.

                         HICCUP
          Can you not hear me?

                         STOICK
          This is serious son!
          Stoick forces the axe into Hiccup's hands. Its weight drags
          him down. He looks up to see Stoick under-lit with firelight.

          STOICK (CONT'D)
          When you carry this axe... you
          carry all of us with you. Which
          means you walk like us. You talk
          like us. You think like us. No more
          of...

                         (GESTURING NON-
          specifically at Hiccup)
          ... this.

                         HICCUP
          You just gestured to all of me.

                         STOICK
          Deal?

                         HICCUP
          This conversation is feeling very
          one-sided.

                         STOICK

          DEAL?!
          Hiccup glances at the axe in his hands. It's a no-win
          argument.

                         (RESIGNED)
          Deal.
          Satisfied, Stoick grabs his helmet and duffel bag... and
          heads for the door.

                         STOICK
          Good. Train hard. I'll be back.
          Probably.

                         HICCUP
          And I'll be here. Maybe.
          Stoick heads out the door, leaving Hiccup holding the axe.

          Gobber raises a massive iron gate at the entrance of a vast

          Welcome to dragon training!
          The recruits file through the gate, and out onto the arena
          floor. They take it in like gladiators entering the
          colosseum. The walls are covered in scorched silhouettes of
          blasted Vikings. It's a grim yet awe-inspiring place.

                         ASTRID
          No turning back.

                         TUFFNUT
          I hope I get some serious burns.

                         RUFFNUT
          I'm hoping for some mauling, like
          on my shoulder or lower back.

                         ASTRID
          Yeah, it's only fun if you get a
          scar out of it.

          HICCUP (O.S.)
          Yeah, no kidding, right? Pain. Love
          it.
          The recruits turn to see Hiccup behind them. Groans all
          around.

                         TUFFNUT
          Oh great. Who let him in?

                         

                         

                         

                         
          "Dragon" DeBlois/Sanders Final Draft (Rev.19) 02-13-2010 23.

                         GOBBER
          Let's get started! The recruit who
          does best will win the honor of
          killing his first dragon in front
          of the entire village.

                         SNOTLOUT
          Hiccup already killed a Night Fury,
          so does that disqualify him or...?
          The recruits LAUGH and chatter in the background.

                         TUFFNUT
          Can I transfer to the class with
          the cool Vikings?
          Gobber throws a supportive arm around Hiccup and ushers him
          along.

                         GOBBER
          (cheery, in confidence)
          Don't worry. You're small and
          you're weak. That'll make you less
          of a target. They'll see you as
          sick or insane and go after the
          more Viking-like teens instead.
          GOBBER stick him in line with the others and continues on
          toward five massive reinforced doors. Terrible ROARS and
          BELLOWS issue from within.

          GOBBER (CONT'D)
          Behind these doors are just a few
          of the many species you will learn
          to fight.
          Fishlegs bounces and giggles with excitement, barely able to
          contain himself.

                         GOBBER (CONT'D)
          The Deadly Nadder.

                         FISHLEGS
          (under his breath)
          Speed eight. Armor sixteen.

                         GOBBER
          The Hideous Zippleback.

                         FISHLEGS
          Plus eleven stealth. Times two.

                         GOBBER
          The Monstrous Nightmare.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          "Dragon" DeBlois/Sanders Final Draft (Rev.19) 02-13-2010 24.

                         FISHLEGS
          Firepower fifteen.

                         GOBBER
          The Terrible Terror.

                         FISHLEGS
          Attack eight. Venom twelve.

                         GOBBER

          CAN YOU STOP THAT?!

                         (BEAT)
          And...the Gronckle.

                         FISHLEGS
          (quietly; to himself)
          Jaw strength, eight.
          Gobber pulls a lever, raising the cross beam on the last of
          the doors.

                         SNOTLOUT
          Whoa, wait! Aren't you gonna teach
          us first!?

                         GOBBER
          I believe in learning on the job.
          BAM! A GRONCKLE thunders out of its cave, charging into the
          ring like an irate rhino.
          The recruits scramble in every direction. Except for Ruffnut
          and Tuffnut who rush toward it, like pumped-up rodeo clowns.

          GOBBER (CONT'D)
          Today is about survival. If you get
          blasted, you're dead. Quick, what's
          the first thing you're going to
          need?

                         HICCUP
          A doctor?

                         FISHLEGS
          Plus five speed?

                         ASTRID
          A shield.

                         GOBBER
          Shields. Go.
          The recruits scramble for shields, finding them scattered
          around the ring.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          "Dragon" DeBlois/Sanders Final Draft (Rev.19) 02-13-2010 25.

          GOBBER (CONT'D)
          Your most important piece of
          equipment is your shield. If you
          must make a choice between a sword
          or a shield, take the shield.
          Hiccup STRUGGLES to lift his. Gobber helps him and sends him
          running.
          Ruff and Tuff stand amidst a dozen shields. But only one has
          a skull painted on it. They both grab it.

                         TUFFNUT
          Get your hands off my shield!

                         RUFFNUT
          There are like a million shields!

                         TUFFNUT
          Take that one, it has a flower on
          it. Girls like flowers.
          Ruffnut uses the shield to BASH Tuffnut in the face. He
          doesn't let go.

                         RUFFNUT
          Ooops, now this one has blood on
          it.
          The Gronckle takes aim at the distracted twins. Blam! The
          shield is blasted out of both of their hands. Tuff and Ruff
          SPIN like tops and go down.

                         GOBBER
          Tuffnut, Ruffnut, you're out!

                         TUFFNUT

                         (DAZED)
          What?!

                         RUFFNUT

                         (CONFUSED)
          What?!
          The Gronckle scoops up a pile of rocks and SWALLOWS them
          back. The teens gather on the far side of the ring.

                         GOBBER
          Those shields are good for another
          thing. Noise. Make lots of it to
          throw off a dragon's aim.
          The kids scoop up weapons and begin hammering on their
          shields. The Gronckle shakes its head at the clatter.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          "Dragon" DeBlois/Sanders Final Draft (Rev.19) 02-13-2010 26.
          GRONCKLE'S POV - the teens targets become blurry and
          scrambled. It's working.

          GOBBER (CONT'D)
          All dragons have a limited number
          of shots. How many does a Gronckle
          have?

                         SNOTLOUT
          Five!

                         FISHLEGS
          No, six.

                         GOBBER
          Correct, six. That's one for each
          of you!

                         FISHLEGS
          I really don't think my parents

                         WOULD--
          BAM! Fishlegs has his shield blasted away.

                         GOBBER
          Fishlegs, out.
          Gobber spots Hiccup hiding from the Gronckle's molten slugs.

          GOBBER (CONT'D)
          Hiccup, get in there!
          ON ASTRID bouncing on her heels, ready to dodge a blast.
          Snotlout appears, trying to hit on her.

                         SNOTLOUT
          So anyway I'm moving into my
          parents' basement. You should come
          by sometime to work out. You look
          like you work out--
          She cartwheels out of the way, allowing a shot to shoot past
          her and hit Snotlout's shield. He's blasted onto his back.

                         GOBBER
          Snotlout! You're done!
          Astrid ROLLS to a stop beside Hiccup, who stirs awkwardly,
          trying to look cool.

                         HICCUP

                         (VOICE BREAKING)
          So, I guess it's just you and me
          huh?

                         

                         

                         

                         
          "Dragon" DeBlois/Sanders Final Draft (Rev.19) 02-13-2010 27.

                         ASTRID
          No. Just you.
          Astrid ROLLS away. A split-second later a lava slug knocks
          Hiccup's shield clear off of his arm. Hiccup is exposed.

                         GOBBER
          One shot left!
          Hiccup panics and chases after his shield as it rolls across
          the ring.
          The sudden movement sends the Gronckle chasing after him,
          leaving Astrid in the clear.

          GOBBER (CONT'D)

                         (WORRIED)
          Hiccup!
          The Gronckle drives straight toward Hiccup, pinning him
          against the wall. It opens its mouth and cocks its tail,
          ready to fire point-blank.
          Gobber lunges in and hooks the Gronckle's mouth at the last
          second, causing its head to jerk back and fire against the
          stone wall above Hiccup's head.

          GOBBER (CONT'D)
          (rattled, but masking it)
          And that's six!
          Gobber wrestles the irate Gronckle back into his pen.

          GOBBER (CONT'D)
          Go back to bed, ya overgrown
          sausage! You'll get another chance,
          don't you worry.
          Slam! Lock. Gobber turns to the recruits.

          GOBBER (CONT'D)
          Remember... a dragon will always,
          (with a stern look to

                         HICCUP)
          always go for the kill.
          He hoists Hiccup to his feet and walks off. Hiccup looks
          overhead to see a steaming pit in the solid stone wall.

          EXT. WOODS/HIDDEN COVE - DUSK

          HICCUP, battered after another disastrous day in the ring. He
          studies the remnants of the discarded bola... revealing that
          he's back at the scene of the crime.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          "Dragon" DeBlois/Sanders Final Draft (Rev.19) 02-13-2010 28.

                         HICCUP

                         (MUTTERED)
          So...why didn't you?
          He drops the bola and presses on in the direction it flew
          off. He drops into a rocky crevice and follows it to an...
          ISOLATED COVE complete with a pristine spring pool. He scans
          the high stone walls... then notices a single black SCALE on
          the ground. He crouches and picks it up, studying it.

          HICCUP (CONT'D)
          Well this was stupid.
          SUDDENLY, the NIGHT FURY blasts past him. Hiccup recoils,
          watching the massive beast struggle to climb the walls. It
          flaps violently, then peels away to a rough landing. The
          dragon is trapped.
          Hiccup grins, excited to see it again, and slips closer.
          He watches as the dragon, exhausted and frustrated, leaps
          into the air, beating its wings furiously. Again and again,
          it rolls uncontrolled and CRASHES heavily.
          As if remembering to snap a photo, Hiccup pulls a leather-
          bound book and flips past drawings of weapons to a blank
          page. He sketches the dragon quickly, desperate to record the
          image.
          The Fury claws at the steep rock walls, trying climb out of
          the cove. It SLIPS and falls hard, crushing several saplings.
          The Fury rolls back to his feet and slowly crawls to the
          water's edge. He spots fish in the shallow water and snaps at
          them... but comes up empty. He lowers his head, looking
          weakened.

          HICCUP (CONT'D)

                         (MUTTERED)
          Why don't you just...fly away?
          ON HICCUP as he spots the problem. He adjusts his drawing,
          carefully erasing one half of the dragon's tail. He
          accidentally drops the charcoal stick. It rolls off of the
          rock outcropping that hides him from view and bounces into
          the cove. TINK. TINK. TINK.
          The Night Fury raises his head, spotting Hiccup. They
          exchange a profound, unflinching stare.

                         DISSOLVE TO:

          INT. GREAT HALL - NIGHT

          A storm is brewing outside. The great doors rattle on their
          hinges.

          GOBBER (O.S.)
          Alright. Where did Astrid go wrong
          in the ring today?
          The recruits are seated at a table, eating dinner by the glow
          of the fire pit.

                         ASTRID
          I mistimed my summersault dive. It
          was sloppy. It threw off my
          reverse tumble.
          Eye rolls from the group.

                         RUFFNUT

                         (SARCASTIC)
          Yeah. We noticed.

                         SNOTLOUT
          (grabbing Astrid's hand)
          No, no, you were great. That was
          so 'Astrid'.

                         GOBBER
          She's right, you have to be tough
          on yourselves.
          CREAK. All eyes turn to Hiccup, entering the hall,
          sheepishly. Gobber glares at him.

          GOBBER (CONT'D)
          (glaring at Hiccup)
          Where did Hiccup go wrong?
          He tries to take a seat at the table...

                         RUFFNUT
          He showed up.

                         TUFFNUT
          He didn't get eaten.
          ... but the recruits keep closing the gaps. Rolling his eyes,
          Hiccup sits at the vacant table next to them.

                         ASTRID
          He's never where he should be.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          "Dragon" DeBlois/Sanders Final Draft (Rev.19) 02-13-2010 30.

                         GOBBER
          Thank you, Astrid.
          Gobber stands.

          GOBBER (CONT'D)
          You need to live and breathe this
          stuff.
          Gobber lays a giant book in the center of the table.

          GOBBER (CONT'D)
          The dragon manual. Everything we
          know about every dragon we know of.
          A RUMBLE of thunder shakes the hall. Rain pours down outside.

                         GOBBER (CONT'D)
          No attacks tonight. Study up.
          Gobber EXITS into the storm, leaving the teens staring at the
          book.

                         TUFFNUT
          (you've got to be kidding)
          Wait, you mean read?

                         RUFFNUT
          While we're still alive?

                         SNOTLOUT
          Why read words when you can just
          kill the stuff the words tell you
          stuff about?

                         FISHLEGS
          Oh! I've read it like, seven times.
          There's this water dragon that

          And there's this other one that
          buries itself for like a week...
          The teens stare as Fishlegs goes on too long.

          Yeah, that sounds great. There was

          The others follow, with Fishlegs in tow.

                         FISHLEGS
          Oh and there's this other one that
          has these spines that look like

          She pushes it toward him and leaves.

          Extremely dangerous. Kill on sight.
          Hiccup's eyes drift to a lurid illustration of decapitated

          A painted DRAGON, with a sword run through it. It's the
          billowing sail of Stoick's ship.
          Stoick hovers over the familiar nautical map -- his eyes on
          the uncharted corner, swirling in mist and illustrations of
          dragons.

                         STOICK
          I can almost smell them. They're
          close. Steady.
          Stoick raises his gaze to...
          AN EPIC FOG BANK, towering from sky to sea like a bruised,
          daunting curtain, beyond which nothing is visible. The three
          ships drift alongside it, skirting its solid edge, looking
          for an opening.
          ON DECK the crewmen mill nervously, all too aware of what
          Stoick is considering.

          CLOSE ON a DRAGON painted onto a shield. Hiccup runs his
          finger over its outline.

                         HICCUP
          You know, I just happened to notice
          the book had nothing on Night
          Furies. Is there another book? Or a
          sequel? Maybe a little Night Fury
          pamphlet?
          KABLAM! A blast takes the axe head off of Hiccup's hilt,
          leaving a smoking hole behind him. Hiccup YELPS and RUNS.

          GOBBER (O.S.)
          FOCUS Hiccup! You're not even
          trying.
          CUT BACK to reveal a Deadly Nadder, loose in a maze-like
          arrangement of moveable walls. Gobber calls orders from
          above.

          GOBBER (CONT'D)
          Today... is all about attack.
          The Nadder hops from wall to wall, sending the recruits

          Nadders are quick and light on
          their feet. Your job is to be
          quicker and lighter.
          The teens move in, stumbling over Hiccup and his unwieldy
          shield. The Nadder spots Fishlegs' ample rear hiding behind a
          wall. It whips its tail of spikes. Fishlegs SCREAMS and lifts
          an entire wall to shield himself from the spray.

                         FISHLEGS
          I'm really beginning to question
          your teaching methods.

          Look for its blind spot. Every
          dragon has one. Find it, hide in
          it, and strike.

          Ruff and Tuff rush in, diving and rolling up to the Nadder's
          nose. The Nadder sniffs the air -- it can't see them. Tuff
          and Ruff are smashed together - too close for comfort.

          How about I give you one!
          Ruff and Tuff SHOVE each other, till their movement and noise
          gives them away. The Nadder ATTACKS, SNAPPING at both of
          them.

                         GOBBER
          Blind spot? Yes. Deaf spot? Not so
          much.
          Hiccup wanders up to Gobber, while the others dart past.

                         HICCUP
          Hey, so how would one sneak up on a
          Night Fury?

          She puts her finger to her lips and gestures for him to hide.
          A moment later, the Nadder leaps over the walls, surprising
          them by landing in front of her.
          Astrid somersaults into its blind spot, confusing it. She
          rears back to strike -- just as Snotlout LEAPS IN,
          protectively SWEEPING Astrid behind him.

                         (DEFENSIVE)
          The sun was in my eyes, Astrid.
          What do you want me to do, block
          out the sun? I could do that, but I
          don't have time right now!
          The Nadder tears off after her, knocking down walls in
          pursuit. She leaps and dives like a highly trained gymnast.
          Hiccup wanders up to Gobber again.

                         HICCUP
          They probably take the daytime off.
          You know, like a cat. Has anyone
          ever seen one napping?

          --Hiccup!
          Hiccup spins around to see the maze walls collapsing like
          dominos toward him. Astrid comes flying through the dust and
          crash-lands on top of him, laying him out in a limb-tangled
          mess.

                         TUFFNUT
          Oooh! Love on the battlefield!

                         RUFFNUT
          She could do better.
          The Nadder closes in, emerging through the cloud of dust.

          Just... let me... why don't you...
          The Nadder spins around and races back toward them like a
          Raptor.
          Astrid untangles herself and tries to pull her axe from
          Hiccup's shield... which is attached to his limp, gangly arm.
          She PLANTS her foot on his torso and YANKS the axe free,
          still burrowed into the shield.

          She SPINS and SWINGS the axe and shield, scoring a DIRECT HIT
          on the oncoming Nadder's NOSE. It yelps and scurries off.

                         GOBBER
          Well done, Astrid.
          Gobber hobbles off to wrestle the Nadder back into his cave.
          Hiccup gets to his feet -- all eyes are upon him. He turns to
          find Astrid glaring at him, winded.

                         ASTRID
          Is this some kind of a joke to you?
          Our parents' war is about to become
          ours. Figure out which side you're

                         CLOSE ON
          A fish... being thrown into the cove. It hits the ground and
          slides. A moment later, Hiccup peeks through a gap in the
          rock, looking around cautiously. Nothing.
          Hiccup squeezes through and enters the cove.
          A BEAT, then Hiccup hears a SNORT from behind him.
          Hiccup turns to see the Night Fury, crouched on a rock like a
          stealthy panther. It descends, approaching him... ready to
          pounce.
          Hiccup swallows his fear and offers the fish. Doing so
          reveals the dagger at his waist. The dragon sees it and
          hisses. Hiccup reaches for it, eliciting a growl. He pauses,
          carefully lifts it by the handle, and tosses it away. The
          dragon calms.
          As it approaches the fish, Hiccup notices that it's missing
          teeth.

                         HICCUP
          Huh. Toothless. I could've sworn
          you had...
          A set of razor sharp teeth emerge from its gums to grab the
          fish. Toothless snatches and gnashes it up, swallowing it.

          The teeth retract again.
          Toothless presses closer with an expectant look. Hiccup
          retreats nervously.

          HICCUP (CONT'D)
          Uh, no. No, I don't have any more.
          The Fury backs Hiccup against a rock, placing himself the
          same position as before. The dragon closes in over him,
          staring blankly.
          A tense moment passes... then Toothless regurgitates a chunk
          of fish onto Hiccup's lap. They exchange stares. Hiccup
          realizes what Toothless wants him to do.
          Hiccup crouches slowly and squeamishly picks it up.
          The dragon waits expectantly. Hiccup gags and gnaws off a
          bite of the slimy fish. He forces a smile. Toothless mimics
          him.
          Amazed, Hiccup sits up and tries to touch him. Toothless
          HISSES and flaps off to a crash on the other side of the
          cove. He BLASTS the mossy ground to a red-hot temperature...
          and curls up on it like a giant dog.
          He turns to find Hiccup seated beside him. Toothless
          tolerates his persistent presence... until Hiccup tries to
          touch his damaged tail. Toothless SNAPS at him. Hiccup takes
          the hint and leaves.

          EXT. COVE - LATER

          It's MAGIC HOUR. Toothless wakes, hanging upside down from a
          tree. He spots Hiccup sitting on the other side of the cove.
          Sketching in the sand.
          CLOSE ON a sketch of Toothless. Hiccup draws with a stick,
          minding his own business. Toothless appears behind him,
          watching carefully. Aware of his presence, Hiccup continues,
          trying not to scare him off.
          Toothless walks off. A moment later, he reappears with an
          entire sapling, drawing lines in the sand. He rushes here and
          there, making haphazard lines in every direction.
          Finally, Toothless drops the tree and inspects his work. He
          seems pleased.

          Hiccup stands and takes in the sprawling scribble, amazed by
          it. He accidentally steps onto one of the lines, eliciting an
          instant growl from Toothless. He steps on it again. Toothless
          growls again. Realizing how sensitive he is, Hiccup steps
          carefully between each line, turning round and round until he
          unwittingly bumps into Toothless.
          Toothless snorts. Once again, they're face to face. Hiccup
          slowly extends his hand. Toothless hesitates. Hiccup turns
          his head away and closes his eyes. To his amazement,
          Toothless bridges the gap and presses his muzzle against
          Hiccup's hand.
          In a flash, the dragon is gone, leaving Hiccup astounded.

          EXT. VILLAGE - NIGHT

          Gobber and the recruits are seated at the top of an abandoned
          catapult tower, toasting campfire food around a roaring
          bonfire.

                         GOBBER
          ...and with one twist he took my
          hand and swallowed it whole. And I
          saw the look on his face.
          (can't deny it)
          I was delicious. He must have
          passed the word, because it wasn't
          a month before another one of them
          took my leg.

                         FISHLEGS
          Isn't it weird to think that your
          hand was inside a dragon. Like if
          your mind was still in control of
          it you could have killed the dragon
          from the inside by crushing his
          heart or something.

                         SNOTLOUT
          I swear I'm so angry right now.
          I'll avenge your beautiful hand and
          your beautiful foot. I'll chop off
          the legs of every dragon I fight,
          with my face.
          He postures to Astrid. She rolls her eyes.

                         GOBBER
          (with a mouthful)
          Un-unh. It's the wings and the
          tails you really want. If it can't
          fly, it can't get away. A downed
          dragon is a dead dragon.

          ON HICCUP hiding his horrified look form the others.
          Gobber stands and stretches.

          GOBBER (CONT'D)
          Alright. I'm off to bed. You should
          be too. Tomorrow we get into the
          big boys. Slowly but surely making
          our way up to the Monstrous
          Nightmare.
          (playful, taunting)
          But who'll win the honor of killing
          it?
          He hobbles off. The teens reflect.

                         TUFFNUT
          (very matter of fact)
          It's gonna be me.

                         (BEAT)
          It's my destiny. See?
          Tuffnut rolls up his sleeve to reveal a red dragon on his
          arm.

                         FISHLEGS

                         (GASPS)
          Your mom let you get a tattoo?

                         TUFFNUT
          It's not a tattoo. It's a
          birthmark.

                         RUFFNUT
          Okay, I've been stuck with you
          since birth, and that was never
          there before.

                         TUFFNUT
          Yes it was. You've just never seen
          me from the left side until now.

                         SNOTLOUT
          It wasn't there yesterday. Is it a
          birthmark or a today-mark?
          Hiccup gets up and walks away from the group. Astrid watches
          him as he leaves the bonfire.

          INT. BLACKSMITH STALL - MOMENTS LATER

          Hiccup enters a small room at the back of the stall. It's
          covered in drawings of weaponry and scale models. He lights a
          candle and lays his sketchbook out on the desk, opening it to
          the drawing of Toothless.
          With a look of determination. Hiccup picks up a charcoal
          stick and re-draws the missing tail.

                         DISSOLVE TO:

          INT. BLACKSMITH STALL - LATER


                         CLOSE ON
          ... a creaking leather bellows. The stone forge glows with
          every pump. Tongs pull intricate iron pieces from the coals.
          They're dropped onto the anvil, twisted, lightly hammered,
          and dunked in a barrel.
          The pieces are carried to Hiccup's workbench and laid out in
          place on a one-to-one schematic. It's a sketch of a
          mechanical fin.

          EXT. HIDDEN COVE - DAWN

          Hiccup arrives, winded, straining under the weight of a full
          basket. He clicks the scale he found (like a jar top).
          Toothless approaches, sniffing him.

                         HICCUP
          Hey Toothless. I brought breakfast.
          I hope you're hungry.
          Hiccup drops the basket and kicks it over. Fish spill out.

          HICCUP (CONT'D)
          Okay, that's disgusting.
          Toothless approaches, settling in to devour the feast.

          HICCUP (CONT'D)
          Uh..we've got some salmon...
          Toothless swallows it.

          HICCUP (CONT'D)
          ... some nice Icelandic cod...
          Swallows those too.

          HICCUP (CONT'D)
          ... and a whole smoked eel.
          Toothless nabs it, chews a few times, then spits it out. He
          shakes his head violently, snorts and scrubs his massive
          tongue on the sand. Hiccup takes note.

          HICCUP (CONT'D)
          No, no, no! It's okay. Yeah, I
          don't like eel much either.
          Toothless focuses on the remainder. With the dragon
          distracted, Hiccup unwraps his prosthetic fin and opens it
          like a fan.

          HICCUP (CONT'D)
          Okay. That's it. That's it, just
          stick with good stuff. And don't
          you mind me. I'll just be
          back...here. Minding my own
          business.
          Hiccup cautiously approaches the injured tail, but every time
          he gets near it, Toothless sweeps it away like a cat.

          HICCUP (CONT'D)
          It's okay.
          Hiccup drops a knee on top of the tail. Toothless' head juts
          up, slows its chewing to a halt.

          HICCUP (CONT'D)
          Okay...okay..
          The dragon tenses, slowly spreading his wings. Hiccup straps
          the prosthetic fin in place. He cinches the straps.

          HICCUP (CONT'D)

                         (PLEASED)
          There. Not too bad. It works.
          Toothless BOLTS! He snaps his massive wings and takes to the
          air, carrying Hiccup with him.

          HICCUP (CONT'D)
          Woah! No! No! No!
          Hiccup struggles to hold on to the tail. As the ground speeds
          away, Toothless immediately TIPS into a uncontrolled bank and
          dive.
          Hiccup sees the folded fin rattling uselessly in opposition
          to its flared counterpart. Flap as he may, Toothless can't
          correct his trajectory.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          "Dragon" DeBlois/Sanders Final Draft (Rev.19) 02-13-2010 43.
          Hiccup swallows his fear and crawls toward the folded
          prosthetic. He reaches it and YANKS it open. The flared, fan-
          like appendage catches the air, stabilizing the twisting
          tail.

          HICCUP (CONT'D)
          (excited, terrified)
          It's working!
          Toothless arcs just short of the water and climbs... high
          into the air.

          HICCUP (CONT'D)
          Yes! Yes, I did it.
          He glances back at Hiccup, busily holding the tail open while
          trying to hold on. They're going to crash.
          Whoomp! Hiccup is suddenly thrown from the tail in the
          intense force of a turn.

          HICCUP (CONT'D)

          AAAAAGGGGHHHHH!
          He bounces across the water's surface and takes a dive.
          Without Hiccup to operate the tail, Toothless does the same,
          plunging in a massive cannonball.
          Hiccup resurfaces, roughed up, but beaming. Toothless appears
          seconds later.

          HICCUP (CONT'D)
          Yeah!

          EXT. TRAINING GROUNDS - MORNING


          GOBBER (O.S.)
          Today is about teamwork. Work
          together and you might survive.
          ON A DOUBLE-WIDE DOOR. Gas seeps through the cracks.
          It BLASTS OPEN. A cloud of smoke engulfs the ring, swirling
          around the paired-up teens. Astrid with Ruffnut. Snotlout
          with Tuffnut. Fishlegs with Hiccup. All carry buckets of
          water, poised to throw them.

          GOBBER (CONT'D)
          Now, a wet dragon head can't light
          its fire. The Hideous Zippleback is
          extra tricky. One head breathes
          gas, the other head lights it. Your
          job is to know which is which.

          The smoke encircles them, cutting them off from each other.
          The teens LISTEN and WATCH for any sign of the dragon.

          Razor sharp, serrated teeth that

          Will you please stop that?

          ON SNOTLOUT AND TUFFNUT
          Moving nervously through the fog, back to back. Snotlout is
          singing to himself to calm his nerves.

                         SNOTLOUT
          If that dragon shows either of his
          faces, I'm gonna--
          (spotting an approaching
          shape, terrified)
          --There!
          Snotlout and Tuffnut HURL their water into the fog.

                         ASTRID
          Hey!

                         RUFFNUT
          It's us, idiots.
          Astrid and Ruffnut are soaked.

                         TUFFNUT
          Your butts are getting bigger. We
          thought you were a dragon.

                         SNOTLOUT

                         (TO ASTRID)
          Not that there's anything wrong
          with a dragon-esque figure.
          Astrid ELBOWS Snotlout in the face. Ruffnut DROPS Tuffnut
          with a PUNCH to the throat.

                         ASTRID
          Wait.
          They FREEZE. A tail SWEEPS out of the fog, taking them down.
          Their buckets spill.

          ON FISHLEGS AND HICCUP coming across them. They see the
          puddles of spilled water.

                         TUFFNUT
          Oh, I'm hurt. I am very much hurt.

                         FISHLEGS
          Chances of survival are dwindling
          into single digits now...

                         HICCUP
          Look out!
          A Zippleback head emerges out of the smoke. Fishlegs hurls
          his water at it, completely dousing the head. It leers and
          opens its mouth, spewing gas into the area.

                         FISHLEGS
          Oh. Wrong head.
          GAS FLOWS around their legs. Fishlegs flees in a panic.

                         GOBBER
          Fishlegs!
          Beat. A clicking sound comes from behind them. Sparks flash
          in the smoke.

          GOBBER (CONT'D)
          Now, Hiccup!
          The other head sweeps out of the smoke. Hiccup hurls his
          water with all his might. It arcs and drops short of the
          dragon's sparking mouth. The dragon grins, savoring the kill.

                         HICCUP
          Oh, come on!

                         GOBBER

          Gobber COVERS his eyes.

          GOBBER (CONT'D)
          Hiccup!
          Beat.
          The Zippleback hesitates. SNIFFS. Then retreats.
          The teens get to their feet, watching transfixed. Gobber
          peeks through his fingers to see...

          The Zippleback backing away from Hiccup. He stands and holds
          his hands out, as if controlling it.

                         HICCUP
          BACK! BACK! BACK! Now don't you
          make me tell you again!
          The Zippleback retreats through its door and into its cave,
          hissing.

          HICCUP (CONT'D)
          Yes, that's right. Back into your
          cage.
          Hiccup slyly OPENS his vest, revealing the spotted smoked EEL
          from earlier. He TOSSES it inside the door, then SLAMS it
          shut.

          HICCUP (CONT'D)
          Now think about what you've done.
          Hiccup turns to the teens and Gobber. They stare, slack-jawed

          HICCUP (CONT'D)
          Okay! So are we done? Because I've
          got some things I need to...
          Hiccup jogs out of the ring, past the speechless group.

          HICCUP (CONT'D)
          Yep...see you tomorrow.
          Astrid SNEERS. Something's going on.

          Hiccup cuts and stitches leather, draws and shapes steel. He
          works by candlelight. An overhead shot reveals what he's
          building: a harness, complete with handles and foot pedals.

          EXT. COVE - DAY

          Hiccup appears before Toothless, holding the new prosthetic.
          Toothless runs off as Hiccup chases him down.

                         HICCUP

          EXT. COVE - DAY

          Toothless and Hiccup are zooming over the ocean. The tail
          breaks free sending Hiccup flying.

                         HICCUP
          Yeah! Whoa!

          INT. BLAKCSMITH STALL - LATER

          Hiccup adjusts the harness and uses a metal clamp to affix
          himself to Toothless' saddle.

          EXT. SKY/FIELD - DAWN

          Hiccup and Toothless zip through the air -- his rudimentary
          harness and tail controls are working, barely. They crash-
          land in an open field.
          Hiccup recovers to find Toothless still rolling around in the
          tall grass. Hiccup discovers that it's a patch of âdragon-
          nip.' Toothless writhes on his back, tongue wagging, in
          complete bliss.

          EXT. TRAINING GROUNDS - MORNING

          Hiccup grabs the head as instructed, then discreetly pulls a
          fistful of âdragon-nip' and presses it up to the Gronkle's
          nose. It immediately stops struggling and goes weak in the
          knees. Hiccup drops the handful of dragon-nip to the ground.
          The Gronkle goes down with it, whimpering and blissful.
          From Gobber and the recruits' point of view, Hiccup is
          controlling the Gronkle with no more than a limp arm.

          EXT. WOODS - AFTERNOON

          The recruits walk home together, surrounding Hiccup and

          BOMBARDING HIM WITH QUESTIONS.

                         FISHLEGS
          Hey Hiccup, I've never seen a
          Gronkle to that before.

                         TUFFNUT
          How'd you do that?

          It was really cool.
          He squirms and invents an excuse.

                         HICCUP
          I left my axe back in the ring.
          He turns and hurries back.

          HICCUP (CONT'D)
          You guys go on ahead and I'll catch
          up with you.
          Astrid watches, suspicious.

          EXT. COVE - LATER

          Hiccup rubs Toothless behind the ear, causing him to relax
          and fall over.

          EXT. TRAINING GROUNDS - LATER

          An angry Deadly Nadder approaches Hiccup. Just as Astrid
          moves in to strike, Hiccup performs his special rubbing
          technique, which sends the Nadder down. Astrid and the other
          kids look on from the sideline in amazement.

          INT. MEADE HALL - CONTINUOUS

          Hiccup sits down at a table to eat. The other recruits notice
          him and move over to his table to talk to him -- leaving
          Astrid alone.

                         FISHLEGS
          Hey Hiccup!

                         SNOTLOUT
          What was that? Some kind of trick?
          What did you do?

                         TUFFNUT
          Hiccup, you're totally going to
          come in first, there's no question.

          EXT. COVE - LATER

          Hiccup is using a mirror-like object to create a patch of
          light on the ground. Toothless claws and chases the light
          patch like a cat chasing a laser pointer.

          EXT. TRAINING GROUNDS - DAY

          A beam lifts from the door of another dragon pen.

                         GOBBER
          Meet the Terrible Terror.

          A tiny, pint-sized dragon steps out and moves toward the
          recruits.

                         TUFFNUT
          Ha. It's like the size of my--
          Tuffnut is taken down in a blur.

          TUFFNUT (CONT'D)
          Get it off! Get it off! Oh! I'm
          hurt, I am very much hurt!
          Hiccup stops the Terrible Terror with the same light-patch
          trick he used earlier with Toothless. The tiny dragon
          retreats back to it's cage. The teens approach him yet again
          as Astrid looks on with suspicion.

          TUFFNUT (CONT'D)

                         (TO ASTRID)
          Wow, he's better than you ever
          were.

          EXT. FOREST - MOMENTS LATER

          Astrid furiously hurls her axe at a nearby tree. She notices
          Hiccup walking by in the distance, carrying one of his
          trademark harnesses. She quickly tries to follow, but he
          loses her in the woods.
          She HUFFS, frustrated.

          EXT. COVE - LATER

          Hiccup straps a newly designed harness onto Toothless. With
          Toothless tied to a nearby post with a rope. Hiccup rides him
          in the air -- while stationary. Toothless looks like a giant
          kite tied to a tree stump. This harness seems to work.

          EXT. SKY - MOMENTS LATER

          The rope breaks and the pair CRASH into a tree. Hiccup's face
          is red.

                         HICCUP
          Oh, great.

          EXT. BERK - NIGHT

          The streets are empty save for a lone Viking who crosses
          Hiccup's path.

                         VIKING
          Hiccup.
          Hiccup nods, trying to look casual. Once the coast is clear,
          he covertly steers Toothless into the Blacksmith's stall.
          Toothless PRESSES himself inside, rooting through stuff and
          making a racket. Astrid, walking nearby, is alerted.

          ASTRID (O.S.)
          Hiccup?
          Hiccup FREEZES. Then frantically tries to pry the ring off
          the saddle hook. It won't budge.

          ASTRID (CONT'D)
          Are you in there?
          Too late - she's right outside.
          ON ASTRID walking along the outside of the Blacksmith's.
          Hiccup JUMPS OUT the window and CLOSES the shutters behind
          him. Hiccup's harness line is stretched through the window,
          still attached to Toothless' saddle.

                         HICCUP
          Astrid. Hey! Hi Astrid. Hi Astrid.
          Hi Astrid.

                         ASTRID
          I normally don't care what people
          do, but you're acting weird. Well,
          weirder.
          Toothless spots a nearby sheep and makes a move toward it. As
          a result, Hiccup is suddenly PULLED TIGHT against the window
          shutters. He STRIKES A POSE to compensate... then gets PULLED
          THROUGH the shutters. They snap back in Astrid's face.
          Astrid reopens them and finds nothing but an empty stall.
          In the distance, Toothless and Hiccup slip off unseen.

          EXT. DOCKS - DAWN

          A lone, battered ship is pulled into a slip, overloaded with
          equally battered-looking men. They disembark to a crowd of
          onlookers, looking like a team of hometown heroes who just
          had their butts kicked.
          Gobber hobbles through the MUMBLING crowd to find Stoick --
          last to disembark and glowering with battered pride.

                         SPITELOUT
          You don't want to know.
          Stoick lumbers past Gobber, leaving him staring at the
          trashed ship.

                         GOBBER
          Well, I trust you found the nest at
          least?

                         STOICK
          Not even close.

                         GOBBER
          Ah. Excellent.
          Gobber follows Stoick up the ramp and snags his duffle bag
          with his hook appendage, sharing the burden.

                         STOICK
          I hope you had a little more
          success than me.

                         GOBBER
          Well, if by success, you mean that
          your parenting troubles are over
          with, then... yes.
          Stoick stops. What does that mean?
          A group of merry villagers rush past.

                         VIKING #1
          Congratulations Stoick! Everyone is
          so relieved.

                         VIKING #2
          Out with the old and in with the

          Stoick is stunned, overwhelmed by the insensitivity. He turns
          to Gobber.

          He's... gone?

                         GOBBER
          Yeah...most afternoons. But who can
          blame him? I mean the life of a
          celebrity is very rough. He can
          barely walk through the village
          without being swarmed by his new
          fans.
          Stoick is doubly confused.

                         STOICK
          Hiccup?

                         GOBBER

                         (BEAMING)
          Who would've thought, eh? He has
          this...way with the beasts.

                         CUT TO:

          EXT. SKY - AFTERNOON

          Toothless and Hiccup soar through a perfect blue sky.
          Billowing clouds rise like mountains. The ground seems miles
          below them.

                         HICCUP
          Okay there bud, we're gonna take
          this nice and slow.
          Hiccup checks a leather cheat sheet, clipped onto his
          harness. Inscribed upon it are several tail positions and
          their pedal position equivalents.

          HICCUP (CONT'D)
          Here we go. Here we go...position
          three, no four.
          He presses the pedal, causing the tail to flare. They roll
          off into an arcing bank, gloriously lit by the late afternoon
          sun.
          Hiccup tucks tight against his neck, thrilled that his new
          harness and vest are holding. The foot controls make the tail
          appendage quick and responsive. He watches Toothless' every
          fluctuation, trying to match it with the prosthetic.
          Hiccup sizes up a target -- a towering arch of stone, rising
          from the sea.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          "Dragon" DeBlois/Sanders Final Draft (Rev.19) 02-13-2010 53.

          HICCUP (CONT'D)
          Alright, it's go time. It's go
          time.
          They dive toward it, lining up to pass through the arch.

          HICCUP (CONT'D)
          Come on. Come on buddy. Come on
          buddy!
          They zip through the arch. A perfect maneuver.

          HICCUP (CONT'D)
          Yeah! Yes, it worked!
          The triumph is short-lived. They smack into one of several
          sea stacks as Hiccup tries to keep up with the turns.

          HICCUP (CONT'D)
          Sorry.
          They hurtle into another rock pillar. Toothless grumbles.

          HICCUP (CONT'D)
          My fault.
          Toothless swats him with his 'ear' plate.

          HICCUP (CONT'D)
          Yeah, yeah, I'm on it.
          (referring to the cheat

                         SHEET)
          Position four, no three.
          They pierce the clouds. For the first time, Hiccup can see
          the whole of the island below them. It shrinks with every
          passing second. He SWALLOWS hard and tightens his grip on the
          handles.

          HICCUP (CONT'D)
          Yeah! Go baby! Yes! Oh, this is
          amazing! The wind in my...
          He spots the leather guide tearing free in the turbulence.

          HICCUP (CONT'D)

                         (PANICKED)

          ... CHEAT SHEET! STOP!!
          Hiccup grabs frantically for the airborne sheet...

          HICCUP (CONT'D)
          No!

          ... and NABS IT before it's carried out of reach. Toothless,
          however, obeys the command and suddenly STOPS beating his
          wings.
          As they slow to a stop, Hiccup goes weightless. The rings of
          his vest float off of the harness hooks. Hiccup suddenly
          finds himself detached, free-falling.

          HICCUP (CONT'D)
          Oh gods! Oh no!
          Without Hiccup, the tail loses control. Hiccup and Toothless
          spiral downward. Toothless FIGHTS to get back under Hiccup.

          HICCUP (CONT'D)
          (trying to calm Toothless)
          Alright, okay. You just gotta kinda
          angle yourself. No, no...come back
          down towards me. Come back down--
          Hiccup extends his arms and legs, giving himself as much
          surface area as he can. He angles back towards Toothless as
          the tumbling dragon WHACKS Hiccup with his wing.
          After a few more misses, Hiccup finally GRABS HOLD of the
          harness and manages to lock in -- just in time to pull
          Toothless out of his dive... barely shy of the tree tops.
          They careen past the wooded cliff and directly into a
          treacherous slalom course of jutting sea stacks.
          Hiccup pulls the cheat sheet from his teeth and attempts to
          check positions. It flaps violently in the turbulence, making
          it impossible.
          With no time to think, Hiccup throws it away and steers
          Toothless' tail on instinct... with perfect intuition.
          Together, they manage a tight, hair-rasing series of split-
          second turns, making it to the open water, unscathed.
          Hiccup takes a breath and glances back at the death-defying
          obstacle course, now safely behind them. He beams, relieved.
          He sits back and throws his arms up in victory.

          HICCUP (CONT'D)

          YEEAHHH!
          Toothless concurs with a happy SQUEAL and a fireball.
          Hiccup's glee turn to dread as they fly directly into it.

          ON HICCUP'S FACE

          HICCUP (CONT'D)
          Ah, come on.

          EXT. BLACK SAND BEACH - SUNSET

          Hiccup and Toothless lounge on a sprawling, deserted beach,
          snacking of freshly caught fish. As Hiccup cooks his over a
          fire, Toothless suddenly regurgitates a fish head. Hiccup
          smirks with forced politeness.

                         HICCUP
          Uh..no thanks.
          (gesturing to his fish on

                         A STICK)
          I'm good.
          Several Terrible Terrors land like seagulls, hissing and
          nipping at each other as they approach Toothless' pile of
          fish.
          One grabs the regurgitated fish head and drags it away.
          Another attempts to steal it from him. They face off and last
          fire balls at each other to settle the fight. Hiccup and
          Toothless watch, amused. That is until...
          Toothless spots one of his fish leaving the pile. A stealthy
          Terrible Terror is exposed as the thief. They tug on the
          fish, and it snaps back into Toothless' mouth. He swallows it
          back tauntingly.
          Irate, the little dragon paws at the ground and blast
          Toothless. He opens his mouth, the gas hiss comes, and
          Toothless fires a tiny flame straight into its mouth, causing
          the gas to backfire into the little dragon. It coughs up
          smoke and staggers away, looking ill.
          Hiccup laughs.

          HICCUP (CONT'D)
          Not so fireproof on the inside, are
          you?
          Hiccup throws the hapless Terror his freshly cooked fish.

          HICCUP (CONT'D)
          Here you go.
          The appreciative little dragon gulps down the meal and
          approaches Hiccup cautiously. He curls up next to him. Hiccup
          is amazed.

          HICCUP (CONT'D)

                         (PENSIVE)
          Everything we know about you guys
          is wrong.

          Hiccup carefully pets him... sending the Terror into an
          immediate, blissful sleep.

          INT. BLACKSMITH STALL - HICCUP'S CLOSET - NIGHT

          HICCUP is lost in thought, his head laid of a desk full of
          Toothless drawings. Burdened with the weight of the world.
          Suddenly, STOICK appears in the doorway. Hiccup jumps and
          quickly covers up his desk.

                         HICCUP
          Dad! You're back!
          He skirts the bench, blocking Stoick's view of Toothless, the
          prosthetic fin, and other drawings.

          HICCUP (CONT'D)
          Gobber's not here, so...
          He strikes an awkwardly casual pose, trying to cover up as
          much as possible.

                         STOICK
          I know. I came looking for you.

                         HICCUP

                         (CAUGHT)
          You did?

                         STOICK

                         (STERN)
          You've been keeping secrets.
          Hiccup's legs give out. He slides, dragging the table's
          contents with him.

                         HICCUP
          I...have?

                         STOICK
          Just how long did you think you
          could hide it from me?

                         HICCUP

                         (IN VAIN)
          I don't know what you're...

                         STOICK
          Nothing happens on this island
          without me hearing about it.

                         HICCUP
          Oh?

                         

                         

                         

                         
          "Dragon" DeBlois/Sanders Final Draft (Rev.19) 02-13-2010 57.

                         STOICK
          So.

                         (BEAT)
          Let's talk about that dragon.
          Blood drains from Hiccup's face.

                         HICCUP
          Oh gods. Dad I'm so sorry. I was
          going to tell you. I just didn't
          know how to--
          Stoick starts laughing. Big, booming. Hiccup stares, baffled.

          HICCUP (CONT'D)
          You're not...upset?

                         STOICK
          What?! I was hoping for this!

                         HICCUP
          Uh...you were?

                         STOICK
          And believe me, it only gets
          better! Just wait til you spill a
          Nadder's guts for the first time.
          Hiccup's elated expression sinks.

          STOICK (CONT'D)
          And mount your first Gronckle head
          on a spear. What a feeling!
          Stoick laughs and smacks Hiccup on the shoulder, sending him
          into the wall.

          STOICK (CONT'D)
          You really had me going there, son.
          All those years of the worst Viking
          Berk has ever seen! Odin, it was
          rough. I almost gave up on you!
          Hiccup gets back up, grimacing in the irony of it all.

          STOICK (CONT'D)
          And all the while, you were holding
          out on me! Thor almighty!
          Stoick grabs a stool and sits. His massive frame nearly fills
          the tiny room.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          "Dragon" DeBlois/Sanders Final Draft (Rev.19) 02-13-2010 58.

          STOICK (CONT'D)

                         (RELIEVED)
          Ahhhhh. With you doing so well in
          the ring, we finally have something
          to talk about.
          Pregnant pause. Hiccup averts his eyes nervously. Stoick
          adjusts, awkwardly clearing his throat.
          After a long, uncomfortable silence...

          STOICK (CONT'D)
          Oh, I... brought you something.
          He presents a horned helmet.

          STOICK (CONT'D)
          To keep you safe in the ring.

                         HICCUP

                         (SINCERE)
          Wow. Thanks.
          Hiccup accepts it, looking it over.

                         STOICK
          Your mother would've wanted you to
          have it.

                         (HEARTFELT)
          It's half of her breast plate.
          Stoick taps his own helmet and smiles.

          STOICK (CONT'D)
          Matching set. Keeps her close,
          y'know?
          Hiccup eyes the mismatched helmets, grimacing.

          STOICK (CONT'D)
          Wear it proudly. You deserve it.
          You've held up your end of the
          deal.
          Stoick beams with pride. Hiccup squirms. He forces a YAWN.

                         HICCUP
          I should really get to bed.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          "Dragon" DeBlois/Sanders Final Draft (Rev.19) 02-13-2010 59.

                         STOICK HICCUP
          (talking over each (talking over each

                         OTHER) OTHER)
          Yes! Good! Okay. Good talk. See you back at the house.
          We should do this again. I'm Great. Thanks for stopping
          glad I stopped by, I hope you by. And for the... the uh,
          like the hat. breast hat.

                         STOICK
          Well..uh..good night.
          Stoick leaves the room awkwardly, leaving Hiccup looking more
          burdened than ever.

          EXT. TRAINING GROUNDS - AFTERNOON

          A Gronckle hovers above the ring, hunting victims as the teen
          recruits scramble.
          Astrid ducks behind a barrier to find Hiccup already there.
          She forces her axe at his throat.

                         ASTRID
          Stay out of my way! I'm winning
          this thing.

                         HICCUP
          Please, by all means.
          She darts off, CLOSING FAST on the dragon. The crowd above
          cheers her on.

          VIKING IN CROWD
          You got it Astrid!
          Hiccup stands and looks around. Amidst the crowd of
          onlookers, Stoick watches keenly, beaming with pride.
          He locks eyes with Hiccup, giving him a nod of encouragement.
          Hiccup adjusts his new helmet and forces a half-hearted
          smile.
          Unbeknownst to Hiccup, the Gronckle spots him and makes a bee-
          line toward him.

          BACK TO ASTRID
          ... as she catches her breath behind a barrier. She scowls,
          focused, determined.

                         ASTRID
          This time. This time for sure.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          "Dragon" DeBlois/Sanders Final Draft (Rev.19) 02-13-2010 60.
          With a FIERCE BATTLE-CRY she LEAPS from cover, axe cocked to
          throw.

          ASTRID (CONT'D)
          Aaaaaaaaaa...
          And as she clears the barriers, she sees that Hiccup has
          already laid the Gronckle out.

          ASTRID (CONT'D)
          ...aaaaaaauGGGGGHHHHHHHH! No! No!
          Hiccup shrugs, as unhappy with the situation as she is.

          ASTRID (CONT'D)

          NO! NO! SON OF HALFTROLL RAT EATING

          MUNGE BUCKET!
          A loud CLACK ring out. From the crowd above, Gothi, the
          village elder, steps forward, tapping her staff. Everyone
          lights up excitedly.

                         STOICK
          Wait! Wait!

                         HICCUP
          So, later.
          Gobber snags Hiccup as he attempts to leave.

                         GOBBER
          Not so fast.

                         HICCUP
          I'm kinda late for--

                         ASTRID

                         (LIVID)
          What? Late for what exactly?
          Stoick holds out his hands to silence the jabbering crowd.

                         STOICK
          Okay quiet down. The elder has
          decided.
          Thrilled, Gobber stands behind Hiccup and Astrid. He points
          to Astrid as the crowd waits in silent anticipation. Gothi
          shakes her head 'no.' The crowd 'Oooohs.'
          Gobber then points to Hiccup. The elder nods an affirmative
          'yes.' The crowd erupts in cheers.
          Astrid turns a seething, deadly glare on Hiccup.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          "Dragon" DeBlois/Sanders Final Draft (Rev.19) 02-13-2010 61.

                         GOBBER
          You've done it! You've done it,
          Hiccup! You get to kill the dragon!

                         STOICK
          Ha, ha! That's my boy!
          Hiccup is hoisted onto the recruits' shoulders and carried
          out to the cheering spectators...

                         HICCUP

                         (MASKING PANIC)
          Heh, heh. Oh yeah! Yes! I can't
          wait. I am so...

          EXT. HIDDEN COVE - DUSK


                         HICCUP
          ... leaving. We're leaving. Let's
          pack up. Looks like you and me are
          taking a little vacation, forever.
          Toothless is nowhere in sight. Hiccup sets down his basket
          and opens it up, his head clouded with troubles.

          HICCUP (CONT'D)
          Oh..man...
          SHINK! Hiccup looks up to the sound of...
          ASTRID, sitting on the rock right in front of him, sharpening
          her axe.

          HICCUP (CONT'D)

                         (SHOCKED)
          Aggh! What the--

                         (RECOMPOSING)
          What are you doing here?
          She hops off the rock and back him down, spinning her axe
          threateningly. Hiccup's eyes dart around nervously, searching
          for Toothless.

                         ASTRID
          I want to know what's going on. No
          one just gets as good as you do.
          Especially you. Start talking! Are
          you training with someone?

                         HICCUP
          Uh...training?
          She grabs him by his odd-looking harness.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          "Dragon" DeBlois/Sanders Final Draft (Rev.19) 02-13-2010 62.

                         ASTRID
          It better not involve... this.

                         HICCUP
          I know this looks really bad, but
          you see...this is, uh...
          They hear a RUSTLE coming from the other side of the cove.
          Astrid DROPS Hiccup to the ground and sets off to
          investigate.

          HICCUP (CONT'D)

                         (PANICKED)
          You're right! You're right. I'm
          through with the lies. I've been
          making... outfits. So you got me.
          It's time everyone knew. Drag me
          back. Go ahead. Here we go.
          He puts her hand back on his harness, getting her to 'drag
          him back.' Astrid BENDS Hiccups hand backwards, driving him
          down.

          HICCUP (CONT'D)
          AAAAUUGGGHHH! Why would you do
          that?!

                         ASTRID
          That's for the lies.
          Astrid pounces the hilt of her axe off of Hiccup's laid-out
          body.

          ASTRID (CONT'D)
          And THAT'S for everything else.
          Hiccup's YELP is answered with A GROWL, coming from the other
          side of the cove. Astrid looks up to see...
          A NIGHT FURY. Toothless pounces toward them, snarling.

                         HICCUP

                         (FEEBLE)
          Oh man.
          She dives onto Hiccup.

                         ASTRID
          Get down! Run! Run!
          Astrid pulls her axe, ready to take on Toothless.

                         HICCUP
          No!

                         

                         

                         

                         
          "Dragon" DeBlois/Sanders Final Draft (Rev.19) 02-13-2010 63.
          Hiccup knocks Astrid's cocked axe to the ground, out of
          reach, then stops Toothless short of crushing her.

          HICCUP (CONT'D)
          No. It's okay! It's okay...
          Toothless pulls up short and lands hard, SPRAYING Astrid with
          sand.

          HICCUP (CONT'D)

                         (CALMING)
          She's a friend.
          Toothless snorts in disagreement. Astrid is frozen. Toothless
          looks from her to Hiccup and back to her, confused.

          HICCUP (CONT'D)

                         (TO ASTRID)
          You just scared him.

                         ASTRID
          I scared him!?
          Hiccup makes a âbe quietâ motion.

          ASTRID (CONT'D)

                         (INTENSE WHISPER)
          Who is him?

          HICCUP.
          Astrid, Toothless. Toothless,
          Astrid.
          Astrid backs away, eyeing Hiccup and Toothless together with
          pure disgust. She turns and RUNS for the village.

                         HICCUP
          We're dead.
          Satisfied with Astrid's departure, Toothless turns away.

          HICCUP (CONT'D)

                         (TO TOOTHLESS)
          Where do you think you're going?

          EXT. WOODS - MOMENTS LATER

          ASTRID races through the trees. A large shadow overtakes her.
          She is suddenly SNATCHED into the air. Astrid SCREAMS.

                         ASTRID
          Oh great Odin's ghost, this is it!

                         

                         

                         

                         
          "Dragon" DeBlois/Sanders Final Draft (Rev.19) 02-13-2010 64.
          Hiccup and Toothless fly Astrid to the top of a towering
          pine. It bows and creaks under their weight as Astrid dangles
          a hundred feet in the air.

          ASTRID (CONT'D)
          Hiccup! Get me down from here!

                         HICCUP
          You have to give me a chance to
          explain.

                         ASTRID
          I'm not listening to ANYTHING you
          have to say!

                         HICCUP
          Then I won't speak. Just let me
          show you.
          Hiccup extends a hand.

          HICCUP (CONT'D)
          Please, Astrid.
          She eyes him and the dragon, then the ground far, far below.
          After a moment, she swats Hiccup's outstretched hand away and
          reluctantly climbs over the pedal, lines, and harness. She
          settles behind Hiccup, avoiding as much contact as possible.

                         ASTRID
          Now get me down.

                         HICCUP
          Toothless? Down. Gently.
          Toothless leers mischievously. He spreads his wings slowly.
          With a WHOP, they fill with the updraft. Toothless releases
          the tree, tucks in his legs, and HOVERS in place.

          HICCUP (CONT'D)
          See? Nothing to be afraid of.
          Toothless suddenly LAUNCHES straight upward. Astrid SCREAMS.
          The acceleration is tremendous. Every downbeat bucks the
          saddle, heaving them into the sky, doubling their speed like
          a rocket. Astrid is thrown backward. She SCREAMS and hugs
          Hiccup for dear life, squeezing the breath out of him.

          HICCUP (CONT'D)
          Toothless! What is wrong with you?!
          Bad dragon!
          (mortified; to Astrid)
          He's not usually like this. Oh
          no...

          Toothless ROLLS and PLUMMETS toward the coastline far below.
          Astrid SCREAMS.
          Toothless rockets over the ocean waves, deliberately dipping
          them in the froth.

          HICCUP (CONT'D)
          Toothless, what are you doing?!
          We need her to like us!
          Toothless rockets skyward and begins tumbling head over tail.

          HICCUP (CONT'D)
          And now the spinning. Thank you for
          nothing you useless reptile.
          Astrid clamps her hand over her eyes.

                         ASTRID
          Okay! I'm sorry! I'm sorry! Just
          get me off of this thing.
          Astrid is defeated, her aggressive energy gone. Satisfied,
          Toothless relents.
          They level off and head up into the clouds. Astrid opens her
          eyes again, and looks out over a world she'd never dreamed
          of. She reaches out and touches clouds, pierces columns
          ablaze in golden hues, and floats over a vast, alien sky-
          scape. Her terror is replaced by wonder. She grins, despite
          herself.
          Toothless rises above a blanket of clouds...

                         DISSOLVE TO:

          EXT. SKY - NIGHT

          ...and levels off under a starry sky. They emerge from a
          blanket of clouds under the dancing Northern Lights,
          shimmering in ribbons across the vast sky.
          Below them, Berk's torches flicker in the inky darkness. The
          new perspective is breathtaking.
          Astrid tucks her arms into Hiccup's vest, burying her chin
          into his shoulder. The moment is not lost on either of them.
          Hiccup smiles nervously.
          Toothless climbs past Berk's tallest peaks and heads out over
          open water, leaving the village lights behind them.

                         ASTRID
          Alright I admit it. This is pretty
          cool. It's... amazing.

                         (BEAT)
          He's amazing.
          Astrid carefully reaches down and pats Toothless' side.

          ASTRID (CONT'D)
          So what now?
          Hiccup groans. It's a problem without an answer.

          ASTRID (CONT'D)
          Hiccup, your final exam is
          tomorrow. You know you're going to
          have to kill...

                         (WHISPERED)
          ... kill a dragon.

                         HICCUP
          Don't remind me.
          A strange, unearthly din approaches. Toothless' ear plates
          suddenly stand on end. Panicked, he abruptly dives, dipping
          into cloud cover.

          HICCUP (CONT'D)
          Toothless! What's happening? What
          is it?
          Toothless BARKS at him. 'Quiet!'
          Suddenly, out of the dense cloud, a Monstrous Nightmare
          emerges.

          HICCUP (CONT'D)
          Get down!
          Hiccup and Astrid duck. The Nightmare calls out. A Zippleback
          appears to the other side of Toothless, boxing him in.

                         ASTRID
          What's going on?

                         HICCUP
          I don't know.

                         (BEAT)
          Toothless. You've got to get us out
          of here, bud.
          Toothless HISSES.

          Other dragons, previously invisible in the thick clouds,
          appear all around them. HUNDREDS of them, all carrying fish
          and game in their talons.

          HICCUP (CONT'D)

                         (WHISPERED)
          It looks like they're hauling in
          their kill.
          The Zippleback eyes them ravenously.

                         ASTRID
          What does that make us?
          The dragons BANK and dive in formation, plummeting through
          the thickening fog and weaving between towering, craggy sea
          stacks.
          They emerge at the base of a massive volcanic caldera,
          glowing with rivulets of lava. The flock of dragons fall into
          rank, funneling through a crack, and zipping through a
          winding tunnel.
          It gives way to a vast, steamy inner chamber, tiered with
          pocky shelves. Dragons of all breeds lay about, nested in
          hordes.
          The arriving dragons fly in, dropping the fish and game into
          a central pit, glowing red and shrouded in mist.
          Hiccup is amazed.

                         HICCUP
          What my dad wouldn't give to find
          this.
          Toothless peels away from the procession, landing on a small
          shadowy shelf to keep a low-profile.
          Hiccup and Astrid peek around, taking in the busy hive of
          sorts. They watch as the food continues to be dropped into
          the pit.

          HICCUP (CONT'D)
          It's satisfying to know that all of
          our food has been dumped down a
          hole.

                         ASTRID
          They're not eating any of it.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          "Dragon" DeBlois/Sanders Final Draft (Rev.19) 02-13-2010 68.
          Last to arrive is a dim-witted Gronckle. It hovers over the
          pit and regurgitates his paltry contribution -- a pathetic
          little fish. As it falls into the steamy pit, a terrible ROAR
          rings out.
          The Gronckle tries to flee, but before it can, a gargantuan
          dragon head juts from the steamy pit and SNAPS it out of the
          air. Swallowing it back whole.
          Hiccup and Astrid recoil, terrified.

          ASTRID (CONT'D)
          What is that?
          The monstrous beast SNIFFS the air, seemingly aware of them.
          It nears the ledge where Toothless is hiding... and ROARS.
          Several dragons take flight in fear.

                         HICCUP
          Alright buddy, we gotta get out of
          here. Now!
          Toothless takes flight, barely evading the monster's snapping
          jaws.
          The behemoth dragon lunges for them, snatching a Zippleback
          out of the air instead.
          Toothless disappears into the winged exodus as thousands of
          dragons flee the caldera in fear.

          EXT. HIDDEN COVE - NIGHT - LATER

          Toothless glides into the cove and touches down on the
          moonlit beach.

                         ASTRID
          (her mind reeling, talking
          Hiccup's ear off)
          No, no, it totally makes sense.
          It's like a giant beehive. They're
          the workers... and that's their
          queen. It controls them.
          She leaps off of Toothless and runs toward the village.

          ASTRID (CONT'D)
          Let's find your dad.

                         HICCUP
          No, no! Not yet. They'll... kill
          Toothless.

                         HICCUP (CONT'D)
          Astrid, we have to think this
          through carefully.
          Astrid eyes him, incredulous.

                         ASTRID
          Hiccup, we just discovered the
          dragons' nest...the thing we've
          been after since Vikings first
          sailed here. And you want to keep
          it a secret? To protect your pet
          dragon? Are you serious?
          Hiccup stands firm, resolute.

                         HICCUP
          Yes.
          Astrid's taken aback.

                         ASTRID
          Okay.

                         (BEAT)
          Then what do we do?

                         HICCUP
          Just give me until tomorrow. I'll
          figure something out.

                         ASTRID
          Okay.
          Astrid PUNCHES Hiccup in the arm.

          ASTRID (CONT'D)
          That's for kidnapping me.
          Hiccup looks to Toothless for support. Toothless SNORTS,
          dismissive.
          Astrid grabs him. He braces for another hit. She KISSES
          Hiccup on the cheek.

          ASTRID (CONT'D)
          That's for, everything else.
          In the awkward wake of the moment, Astrid hurries off...
          leaving Hiccup RUBBING his cheek, stunned.
          Toothless hobbles up, eyeing him.

                         HICCUP
          What are you looking at?

          EXT. TRAINING GROUNDS - DAY

          The grounds have been transformed. Banners and flags flap in
          the morning sun. Surrounding the ring, a festive crowd had
          gathered. All of Berk has turned out for the event.

                         STOICK
          (aloud to the crowd)
          Well, I can show my face in public
          again.

          LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE

          STOICK (CONT'D)

                         (PLAYFUL)
          If someone had told me that in a
          few short weeks, Hiccup would go
          from being, well... Hiccup, to
          placing first in dragon training...
          I would've tied him to a mast and
          shipped him off for fear he'd gone
          mad. Yes! And you know it!

                         (BEAT)
          But here we are. And no one's more
          surprised...
          ON HICCUP standing at the entrance to the ring, listening,
          looking burdened.

                         STOICK (CONT'D)
          ... or more proud than I am. Today,
          my boy becomes a Viking. TODAY, HE

          BECOMES ONE OF US!
          CHEERS and ROARS.
          Astrid approaches Hiccup.

                         ASTRID
          Be careful with that dragon.

                         HICCUP
          (re: the roaring crowd)
          It's not the dragon I'm worried
          about.

                         ASTRID

                         (WORRIED)
          What are you going to do?

                         HICCUP
          Put an end to this.
          She eyes him, dubious.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          "Dragon" DeBlois/Sanders Final Draft (Rev.19) 02-13-2010 71.

          HICCUP (CONT'D)
          I have to try.

                         (BEAT)
          Astrid. If something goes wrong...
          just make sure they don't find
          Toothless.

                         ASTRID

                         (GRIM)
          I will. Just promise me it won't go
          wrong.
          Hiccup can't. Gobber approaches.

                         GOBBER
          It's time, Hiccup. Knock him dead.
          Hiccup puts his helmet on and enters the ring.

          ON THE TEENS
          HOOTING and HOLLERING from the stands.

                         TUFFNUT
          Show 'em how it's done, my man!
          Hiccup locks eyes with Stoick. Stoick nods with a smile.
          Hiccup returns a half-smile. Takes a deep breath.
          He hoists a shield onto his forearm and selects his weapon
          from a rack of many -- a small dagger.

                         STOICK

                         (MUTTERED)
          Hrmph. I would've gone for the
          hammer.
          Hiccup turns to face a bolted, heavy door. Takes a deep
          breath.

                         HICCUP
          I'm ready.
          The door bolt is raised. The crowd grows quiet...
          Beat.
          BOOM! The doors blast open with a stream of sticky fire.
          Followed by a Monstrous Nightmare, coated in flames. It tears
          out of its cave like an irate bull -- as the crowd roars and
          jeers.
          It climbs the walls and chain enclosure like a bat, hissing
          at the provoking crowd and blasting fire.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          "Dragon" DeBlois/Sanders Final Draft (Rev.19) 02-13-2010 72.
          It spots Hiccup and descends, leering and licking the flaming
          drool from its lips.
          The crowd grows silent, bracing for the big fight.
          With the Monstrous Nightmare's eyes locked upon him, Hiccup
          deliberately drops his shield and dagger stepping away from
          them. The dragon pauses, confused.
          ON STOICK, also confused.

                         STOICK
          What is he doing?
          The dragon presses closer, snorting. Hiccup extends his open
          hand. It snarls.

                         HICCUP

                         (WHISPERED)
          It's okay. It's okay.
          The dragon continues to pace, focused on... HICCUP'S HELMET.
          Hiccup realizes, then reaches up and removes it. Taking a
          breath to acknowledge the point of no return, he tosses the
          helmet aside. It hits the ground.

          HICCUP (CONT'D)
          I'm not one of them.
          GASPS and MURMURS race through the crowd.
          ON STOICK, as all eyes turn to him. He's welling with upset.
          Hiccup avoids Stoick's glare and remains focused on the
          Nightmare, holding his hand out. It paces around him, calming
          down.

                         STOICK
          Stop the fight.

                         HICCUP
          No. I need you all to see this.
          The crowd gets restless.

          HICCUP (CONT'D)
          They're not what we think they are.
          We don't have to kill them.

                         STOICK

          I SAID STOP THE FIGHT!

          Stoick whacks his hammer against the iron enclosure, rattling
          the arena with a terrible reverberating clatter.
          Spooked, the Nightmare snaps at Hiccup's outstretched hand.
          Hiccup YELPS and springs backward.
          The spell is broken. The Nightmare reacts to Hiccup's sudden
          movements and blasts another stream of fire. Hiccup SCREAMS
          and barely dives out of reach.

          EXT. COVE - CONTINUOUS


                         ON TOOTHLESS
          His ear plates shoot up. Panic flares in his eyes.

          Hiccup scrambles around the ring. The Nightmare pursues,
          snapping and springing from ground to wall.
          Stoick pushes through the crowd, rushing to the doorway.

                         STOICK
          Out of my way!

                         ASTRID

          Astrid wedges her axe under the arena gate and squeezes
          through.

          Toothless bounds to the cove walls, clawing them in
          desperation. It seems he's as trapped as before, but with an
          incredible BURST of effort he HOOKS a claw over the upper lip
          of the stone wall.

          EXT. TRAINING GROUNDS - CONTINUOUS

          A narrow stream of fire narrowly avoids Hiccup as he
          continues to dash around the ring, evading the Monstrous
          Nightmare. Desperate, he goes to the weapon rack in an
          attempt to arm himself, but the Nightmare quickly destroys
          the rack and closes in on him.

          EXT. COVE - CONTINUOUS

          Toothless tears through the woods, bounding like panther and
          taking to the air in short bursts.

          EXT. TRAINING GROUNDS - CONTINUOUS

          Stoick wrenches the grated door to the arena and jumps
          through. The Monstrous Nightmare is only a few feet behind
          Hiccup. Astrid is now in the ring.

                         ASTRID
          Hiccup!
          She picks up a hammer and hurls it at the Monstrous
          Nightmare, hitting it in the head. It turns its attention to
          Astrid, and begins chasing her. Stoick raises the arena gate,
          waving her toward it.

                         STOICK
          This way!
          Astrid makes it through, but the Nightmare BLASTS the
          doorway, cutting Hiccup off. It pounces on him and prepares
          to finish him off.
          Suddenly, a terrible roar pierces the din.

                         GOBBER
          Night Fury! Get down!
          Toothless bounds over the crowd and BLASTS a hole through the
          chain enclosure. He flies through it and disappears in the
          boiling smoke.
          The Vikings rush to railings... in time to see a flurry of
          wings cutting through the dissipating smoke. Toothless and
          the Nightmare tumble into the clear, locked in a toothy,
          vicious fight. Toothless kicks the Nightmare off and plants
          himself between Hiccup and it.
          The Nightmare snarls, circling them. Toothless lunges and
          ROARS... causing the Nightmare to relent and back away.
          To everyone's shock and horror, Hiccup gets to his feet and
          grabs Toothless protectively.

                         HICCUP

                         (PANICKED)
          Alright, Toothless, go. Get out of
          here!
          The crowd is gob-smacked, growing livid.

                         VIKINGS
          Night Fury!

          Hiccup tries to shoo Toothless away in vain. Vikings begin
          pouring clambering through the enclosure and dropping into
          the ring.

                         HICCUP
          Go! GO!

                         VIKING
          Take it alive!
          Stoick grabs an axe and charges into the arena. Astrid calls
          out to him, panicked.

                         ASTRID
          Stoick no!

                         HICCUP
          Dad! No! He won't hurt you!
          The other Vikings surround and attack Toothless. He tosses
          them aside like rag dolls, his eyes focused on Stoick.

          HICCUP (CONT'D)
          No, don't! You're only making it
          worse!
          Stoick raises his hammer as he charges for Toothless.
          Toothless ducks and pounces on him. They tumble end over end.

          HICCUP (CONT'D)
          Toothless! STOP!
          He pins Stoick and inhales. The familiar hiss of gas builds.
          Everyone braces...

          HICCUP (CONT'D)

          NO!
          Toothless swallows back the blast and turns to Hiccup, not
          understanding.

                         VIKING
          Get him!
          The crowd rushes him, piling on, and taking Toothless down.
          Astrid holds Hiccup back.

                         HICCUP

                         (DESPERATE)
          No! Please...just don't hurt him.
          Please don't hurt him.

          Stoick gets to his feet, fuming, shaken. A Viking presents
          Stoick with an axe. He eyes Toothless a moment, then pushes
          the axe back into the Viking's hands.

                         STOICK
          Put it with the others!
          His burning glare turn to Hiccup.

          INT. GREAT HALL - DAY


                         ON HICCUP
          Being shoved into the dank, dimmed hall.
          SLAM! The massive doors rattle and echo. Stoick pushes past
          him. He paces against a backdrop of shadowy tapestries and
          carved pillars -- a legacy of heroes, all peering down in
          angered judgement.

                         STOICK
          I should have known. I should have
          seen the signs.

                         HICCUP
          Dad.

                         STOICK
          We had a deal!
          Stoick pauses to say something, but stops short. He SNORTS
          and resumes pacing, repeating the cycle.

                         HICCUP

                         (FLUSTERED)
          I know we did... but that was
          before... ughh, it's all so messed
          up.

                         STOICK
          So everything in the ring. A
          trick? A lie?
          He stomps toward Hiccup. Stops short and points, fighting
          back words.

                         HICCUP
          I screwed up. I should have told
          you before now. Take this out on
          me, be mad at me, but please...
          just don't hurt Toothless.

                         STOICK
          The dragon? That's what you're
          worried about? Not the people you
          almost killed?!

                         HICCUP
          He was just protecting me! He's not
          dangerous.

                         STOICK
          They've killed HUNDREDS OF US!

                         HICCUP
          And we've killed THOUSANDS OF THEM!
          They defend themselves, that's all!
          They raid us because they have to!
          If they don't bring enough food
          back, they'll be eaten themselves.

                         (BEAT)
          There's something else on their
          island dad...it's a dragon like--
          Stoick HUFFS.

                         STOICK
          --Their island?
          He stomps back... pointing an accusing finger.

                         STOICK (CONT'D)
          So you've been to the nest.

                         HICCUP
          Did I say nest?
          Hiccup goes silent -- he said too much.

                         STOICK
          How did you find it?!

                         HICCUP
          No... I didn't. Toothless did.
          Only a dragon can find the island.
          Stoick GLARES. A moment passes, then an idea takes form on
          his face. His eyes flare. Hiccup watches, realizing. Stoick
          stomps toward the doorway.

          HICCUP (CONT'D)
          Oh no. No, Dad. No.
          Hiccup chases after him, panicked.

          HICCUP (CONT'D)
          Dad. It's not what you think. You
          don't know what you're up against.
          It's like nothing you've ever seen.
          He grabs Stoick by the arm, tugging with all his might. He
          has no effect whatsoever.

          HICCUP (CONT'D)
          Dad. Please. I promise you that you
          can't win this one.
          Nothing.

          HICCUP (CONT'D)
          No. Dad. No. For once in your life,

          WOULD YOU PLEASE JUST LISTEN TO

          ME?!
          He throws Hiccup off of him, SWATTING him to the floor.
          Icy stillness. Hiccup stares back, stunned.

                         STOICK
          You've thrown your lot in with
          them. You're not a Viking.

                         (BEAT)
          You're not my son.
          Stoick pushes through the door, leaving Hiccup alone,
          devastated.

          STOICK (CONT'D)

                         (CALLING OUT)
          Ready the ships!

          EXT. GREAT HALL - CONTINUOUS

          Stoick staggers on the steps, breaking inside.

          EXT. DOCKS/OPEN SEA - DAY

          Broken-down catapults and trebuchets are bundled up and
          lowered from the cliffs.
          Below on the docks, Vikings load the heavy artillery into the
          hulls of awaiting ships. Children and the elderly gather to
          on the walkways to wave apprehensive farewells to the
          departing warriors.
          Lastly, Toothless is loaded aboard Stoick's ship, chained
          down to a palette, muzzled, and restrained with a weighty
          neck ring. He looks exhausted, miserable.

          Stoick crosses to the bow as the ship pushes off and joins
          the amassed armada of ships adrift in the harbor.
          Stoick's brow is furrowed, all warmth drained away. He turns
          west and glares at the horizon with cold determination.

                         STOICK
          Set sail! We head for Helheim's
          Gate.
          He then notices HICCUP watching from his familiar cliff-side
          perch beyond the village. Their eyes meet, full of hurt and
          regret. Hiccup slowly shakes his head in warning. Stoick
          breaks the stare and turns to Toothless, fuming.

          STOICK (CONT'D)
          Lead us home, Devil.

                         ON HICCUP
          Watching. He's powerless to stop what is happening, but won't
          leave.

          Still standing there. The ships have cleared the horizon.
          CRANE UP to reveal Astrid is standing behind him. She
          approaches cautiously and stands beside him in silence.

                         ASTRID
          It's a mess.
          Hiccup doesn't respond.

          ASTRID (CONT'D)
          You must feel horrible. You've lost
          everything. Your father, your
          tribe, your best friend.

                         HICCUP
          Thank you for summing that up.

          HICCUP (CONT'D)
          Why couldn't I have killed that
          dragon when I found him in the
          woods. It would have been better
          for everyone.

          So why didn't you?
          Hiccup just shakes his head - he really doesn't know.
          Astrid's eyes glimmer. She wants something.

          ASTRID (CONT'D)
          Why didn't you?

                         HICCUP
          I don't know. I couldn't.

                         ASTRID
          That's not an answer.

                         ASTRID
          Because I want to remember what you

          (angry, loud)
          Oh for the love of -- I was a
          coward! I was weak. I wouldn't kill
          a dragon.

                         ASTRID
          You said 'wouldn't' that time.

          Whatever! I wouldn't! Three hundred
          years and I'm the first Viking who
          wouldn't kill a dragon!

          I looked at him and I saw myself.
          Astrid turns to face the open sea.

          I bet he's really frightened now.

          That's more like it.

          EXT. OPEN SEA/DRAGON ISLAND - DAY

          The armada coasts toward a shroud of heavy fog, hung like
          drapes from a low-hanging, ominous sky.
          The ships enter, one by one. Visibility drops immediately.
          Flanking ships becomes ghosts. The armada disappears, drawn
          into the blinding mist. Complete whiteout. Nothing remains
          but the eerie creaking of wood on water.
          ON STOICK at the bow of his ship. He taps his fingers on the
          gunwale, then looks back at Toothless impatiently. Weighed
          down with chains, Toothless seems unresponsive.

                         VIKING #5
          Ahead, at your bow.

                         VIKING #6
          Haven't a clue.
          ON STOICK straining into the fog as the calls continue.
          Massive, jagged sea stacks begin to emerge, threatening to
          rip the ships to shreds.
          Gobber approaches him, speaking under his breath.

                         GOBBER
          Listen... Stoick... I was
          overhearing some of the men just
          now and, well, some of them are
          wondering what it is we're up to
          here -- not me of course, I know
          you're always the man with the plan
          -- but some, not me, are wondering
          if there is in fact a plan at all,
          what it might be?

                         STOICK
          Find the nest and take it.

                         GOBBER
          Ah. Of course. Send them running.
          The old Viking fall-back. Nice and
          simple.

                         STOICK
          Shhh.
          Stoick notices that Toothless' ear plates are at the alert,
          quietly reacting to inaudible sounds.
          Stoick crosses to the stern of the ship and grabs the tiller,
          moving the helmsman out of the way.

          STOICK (CONT'D)
          Step aside.
          Stoick pulls the ship into a turn, covertly following
          Toothless' head movements.

          The ship barely misses a jagged outcrop that suddenly appears
          out of the soupy fog.

                         VIKING
          Bear to port.
          The order is called out from ship to ship.
          CRUNCH! The bow barely makes it past another sea stack.
          Stoick continues to follow Toothless' cues, undeterred.

          EXT. TRAINING GROUNDS - DAY

          Hiccup raises the bolt on the Monstrous Nightmare's pen.

          FISHLEGS (O.S.)
          If you're planning on getting
          eaten, I'd definitely go with the
          Gronckle.
          Hiccup turns to see his fellow recruits, watching him with
          folded arms. Tuffnut steps forward with a scowl.

                         TUFFNUT
          You were wise to seek help from the
          world's most deadly weapon.

                         (BEAT)
          It's me.

                         HICCUP
          Uh...

                         SNOTLOUT
          I love this plan.

                         HICCUP
          I didn't...

                         RUFFNUT
          You're crazy.

                         (SULTRY)
          I like that.

                         ASTRID
          So? What is the plan?
          Hiccup smiles, glowing in the support of his friends.

          EXT. FOGGY SEA - DAY

          The ships follow in line through the gauntlet of rocks as
          orders are whispered from ship to ship.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          "Dragon" DeBlois/Sanders Final Draft (Rev.19) 02-13-2010 84.
          A dragon head looms out of the fog. The men recoil... only to
          discover that it's a wrecked ship, impaled high on a gnarled
          sea stack.

                         GOBBER
          Ah. I was wondering where that
          went.
          A clicking buzz becomes audible, growing louder. It fills the
          sky, converging in one general direction. Stoick sniffs the
          air.

                         STOICK
          Stay low and ready your weapons.
          Stoick's ship suddenly JERKS to a halt as the keel burrows
          into shallow black sand.
          Stoick hops overboard, landing on a sprawling beach. The
          BUZZING suddenly STOPS. Above him, a craggy volcano towers
          into the gloom.

          STOICK (CONT'D)
          We're here.
          Behind him, several dragon-headed bows pierce the fog.

          EXT. TRAINING GROUNDS - RING - DAY

          Hiccup steps back from the door, drawing the Monstrous
          Nightmare out of its cave. It snorts, stepping into the ring,
          calmed by Hiccup's outstretched hand -- focused on him.
          ON THE TEENS... bewildered, in awe.
          Snotlout nervously reaches for a spear laying near his foot.
          Astrid stops him.

                         ASTRID

                         (CORRECTING)
          Uh-uh.
          Hiccup slows to a stop in front of the teens, with the
          Nightmare inches from his outstretched hand.
          He reaches over and grabs Snotlout's trembling hand.

                         SNOTLOUT
          Wait! What are you...

                         HICCUP
          Relax. It's okay... it's okay.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          "Dragon" DeBlois/Sanders Final Draft (Rev.19) 02-13-2010 85.
          Hiccup replaces his outstretched hand with Snotlout's,
          putting him in control of the massive beast. The Nightmare
          snorts, but remains calm. Snotlout, by contrast, chuckles
          nervously -- it's at once terrifying and amazing.
          The others watch, spellbound.
          Hiccup turns and walks away.

                         SNOTLOUT
          Where are you going?!
          Hiccup pulls a bundle of rope from a supply box.

                         HICCUP
          You're going to need something to
          help you hold on.
          The teens eye each other apprehensively, and look up to
          reveal...
          ALL THE DRAGONS standing in the ring, facing the teens
          expectantly.

          EXT. DRAGON ISLAND - DAY


                         CLOSE ON
          Tree trunks, being sharpened and planted into the sand at
          angled rows.
          Boulders being loaded into catapult baskets.
          And a war plan being scratched in the sand.
          STOICK looms over it, looking determined. His generals are
          at his sides.

                         STOICK
          When we crack this mountain open,
          all hell is going to break loose.

                         GOBBER
          In my undies. Good thing I brought
          extras.
          Stoick TURNS to face the men.

                         STOICK
          No matter how this ends, it ends
          today.
          He walks toward the base of the volcano wall, back by several
          hundred warriors. He raises his arm and drops it.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          "Dragon" DeBlois/Sanders Final Draft (Rev.19) 02-13-2010 86.
          A line of catapults UNLEASH their two-ton loads into the
          cliff wall. It cracks and flakes away.
          Several more hits tear away at the hollow shell of hardened
          lava.
          A final boulder shatters the fractured wall, creating a deep,
          dark opening to the cavern within.
          Silence. Stock raises his hand, makes a gesture. A flaming
          bushel is launched into the dark, lighting the wall... CHOKED

          WITH DRAGONS.
          Stoick pulls his hammer and rushes into the cave, brazen.

          STOICK (CONT'D)
          (War cries and slashing efforts)
          In a chaotic flurry, the dragons suddenly rush out like bats
          from a cave. The take to the air, bypassing the axe-swinging
          Vikings and fleeing the island in a mass exodus.
          The battle-ready Vikings drop their weapons, confused.

                         GOBBER
          Is that it?
          Above the island, dragons POUR from every crevice, fleeing to
          the sky. The sound of screeching dragons fades.

                         VIKINGS
          (Cheering as one)

                         SPITELOUT
          We've done it!
          Stoick doesn't celebrate. Something is not right. He HEARS
          something. Stoick turns to peer down the dark throat of the
          cavern.
          A deep, rumbling ROAR echoes from the cavern. The ground
          underfoot TREMBLES. The ships rock. Their sails fill with a
          blast of air.
          The cheering stops. Stoick's expression sinks.

                         STOICK
          This isn't over. Form your ranks!
          Hold together!
          The men SCRAMBLE to organize themselves.

          STOICK (CONT'D)
          Get clear!

                         

                         

                         

                         
          "Dragon" DeBlois/Sanders Final Draft (Rev.19) 02-13-2010 87.
          The ground CRACKS. Stone tears away, cascading like an
          avalanche. And through the settling debris, the silhouette of
          a gargantuan dragon emerges -- THE RED DEATH. Stirred and
          furious.

                         GOBBER
          Beard of Thor...what is that?

                         STOICK

                         (AGHAST)
          Odin help us.

                         (BEAT)
          Catapults!
          The Vikings score direct hits. The burning stones BOUNCE off
          the dragon's skin. The Red Death focuses on the catapults.
          It crushes the first one - smashing it and its crew, rattling
          the beach underfoot.
          Stoick races toward the second catapult. He LEAPS and pushes
          a Viking out of the way just before the dragon crushes him
          under his forepaw.
          The Vikings scramble in all directions.

                         VIKING #3
          Get to the ships!

                         STOICK
          No! NO!
          The Red Death BLASTS the ships like a mile-long flamethrower.
          The sails are torched. Vikings dive overboard and masts come
          down.
          Gobber Joins Stoick.

                         GOBBER
          Heh. Smart, that one.
          Stoick looks up and down the beach for an answer.

                         STOICK

                         (GUILT-RIDDEN)
          I was a fool.
          The monster raises its head to the sky and BELLOWS. The
          sound SHAKES the beach, knocking Vikings off their feet.
          This island is his.
          Stoick stops a Viking General.

          STOICK (CONT'D)
          Lead the men to the far side of the
          island.

                         SPITELOUT
          Right.
          (turns to the others)
          Everybody to the far side of the
          island!
          The Vikings scatter into the rocks like ants. Satisfied with
          the ships destruction, The Red Death turns its attention back
          to the Vikings. They seem to have vanished. It SNIFFS the
          air, searching for their scent.
          Gobber drops in beside Stoick, like two soldiers in a trench.
          Fire blasts over head, causing them to duck.

                         STOICK
          Gobber, go with the men.

                         GOBBER
          I think I'll stay, just in case
          you're thinking of doing something
          crazy.
          Stoick grabs him.

                         STOICK

                         (EMPHATIC)
          I can buy them a few minutes if I
          give that thing someone to hunt.
          Gobber removes Stoick's hand. Clenches his forearm,
          determined.

                         GOBBER
          Then I can double that time.
          Stoick grins. Friends to the bitter end. They BREAK COVER and
          dash into the open, SPLITTING UP. Stoick rips a sharpened
          post from the ground and hurls it into the monster's face.

                         STOICK

          HERE!

                         GOBBER

          NO, HERE!
          It spots both of them. He fuels up to fire, glancing back and
          forth between the two men. He focuses on Stoick.

          GOBBER (CONT'D)
          Come on! Fight me!

                         STOICK
          No, me!
          The Red Death remains focused on Stoick - this is it. It
          rears back and inhales. Gas begins to amass, when...
          KABLAM! A BLAST explodes against the back of The Red Death's
          head. It turns distracted, as...
          ... a Nadder punches through the flames, banking across the
          sky. Followed by a Monstrous Nightmare, a Zippleback, and a
          Gronckle. They roll in unison, revealing the recruits riding
          on their backs. Hiccup leads, with Astrid clinging to his
          waist.
          GOBBER AND STOICK, watch slack-jawed, in awe.

                         HICCUP
          Ruff, Tuff, watch your backs! Move
          Fishlegs!
          The monster shakes off the blast and snaps in their wake.
          Hiccup directs his squadron out of harm's way. They climb out
          of reach and circle each other.

                         TUFFNUT
          Look at us, we're on a dragon!
          We're on dragons, all of us!

                         HICCUP
          Up, let's move it!
          The dragons climb past the Red Death.

          ON THE GROUND
          Gobber hobbles over to Stoick.

                         GOBBER
          Every bit the boar-headed, stubborn
          Viking you ever were.
          Stoick is speechless.

          IN THE AIR
          The group circles over the dragon's head.

                         HICCUP
          Fishlegs, break it down.

                         FISHLEGS
          Okay. Heavily armored skull and
          tail made for bashing and crushing.

          Steer clear of both. Small eyes,
          large nostrils. Relies on hearing
          and smell.

                         HICCUP
          Okay. Lout, Legs, hang in its blind
          spot. Make some noise, keep it
          confused. Ruff, Tuff, find out if
          it has a shot limit. Make it mad.

                         RUFFNUT
          That's my specialty.

                         TUFFNUT
          Since when? Everyone knows I'm
          more irritating. See.

                         (IRRITATING SOUNDS)

                         HICCUP

                         (EXASPERATED)
          Just do what I told you. I'll be
          back as soon as I can.

                         TUFFNUT
          Don't worry, we got it covered!

                         FISHLEGS
          Yeah!
          Hiccup and Astrid peel away. The teens bank and dive toward
          the monster, splitting up. The Twins race alongside the
          monster's head, taunting it.

          Troll!

                         RUFFNUT
          Butt Elf!

                         TUFFNUT
          Bride of Grendel!
          The Red Death unloads a spray of fire at the twins. They
          barely dodge it.
          Fishlegs and Snotlout hang behind its eyes, banging away at
          their shields, making a racket.
          The Red Death opens all SIX of its eyes, spotting them.

                         FISHLEGS
          Uh, this thing doesn't have a blind
          spot.

          ON HICCUP AND ASTRID
          ... searching for Toothless. Hiccup spots him among the
          burning ships.

                         HICCUP
          There!
          He steers the Nadder over the deck and hands Astrid the
          reins. He lines up his jump... and hops off, guarding his
          face from the flames. He lands on the burning deck.

          HICCUP (CONT'D)

                         (TO ASTRID)
          Go help the others!
          She and the Nadder take off.
          As Hiccup fights his way to Toothless. He unbuckles the
          muzzle. Toothless shrieks.

          HICCUP (CONT'D)
          Okay, hold on. Hold on.
          He gets to work on the chains.

          ON SNOTLOUT AND FISHLEGS
          They clang their weapons against their shields, making the
          monster wince.

                         SNOTLOUT
          It's working.
          The huge beast starts to sway its head dizzily.

                         FISHLEGS
          Yeah! It's working.
          PAN DOWN to reveal that the noise is also confusing the
          Gronckle and the Monstrous Nightmare. Both dragons lose their
          bearings.
          The Red Death thrashes, knocking Snotlout off of his dragon
          and onto the monster's gigantic head. Snotlout bounces across
          the top and comes to a stop just shy of the hundred foot
          drop.

                         SNOTLOUT
          Agghh!
          Fishlegs' Gronckle goes down in a spin of confusion.

                         FISHLEGS
          I've lost power on the Gronckle.
          Snotlout! Do something!
          He hurls Snotlout his hammer. The Gronkle crashes and skids
          to a stop...

          FISHLEGS (CONT'D)
          I'm okay!
          ... then flips over, crushing Fishlegs.

          FISHLEGS (CONT'D)

                         (FEEBLE)
          Less okay.

          BACK TO SNOTLOUT
          ... who eyes the Red Death's gigantic, veiny eyes. He raises
          the hammer...

                         SNOTLOUT
          I can't miss!
          ... and hammers the monster's eyes, playing whack-a-mole.

          SNOTLOUT (CONT'D)
          What's wrong buddy, got something
          in your eye?
          Astrid flies by on her Nadder, catching Snotlout in all his
          heroics.

                         ASTRID
          Yeah! You're the Viking!
          Snotlout grins, finally vindicated in her eyes. In his
          distraction, he gets thrown and lands heavily on one of the
          Red Death's spines -- clinging precariously. A close call.

                         SNOTLOUT
          Whoa!

          ON THE GROUND
          The monster's tail sweeps across the burning ships, snapping
          masts like twigs. We follow one down as it crashes onto a
          deck, revealing...

                         HICCUP
          Working at the chains. He can't budge them. Fire licks at his
          clothes. He looks up to see...

                         

                         

                         

                         
          "Dragon" DeBlois/Sanders Final Draft (Rev.19) 02-13-2010 93.
          THE RED DEATH blasting at the teens, enraged.
          The monster's giant foot crashes through frame, smashing the
          bow under its impressive weight.
          Hiccup and Toothless are thrown into the water in a maelstrom
          of burning planks and rigging.

                         UNDERWATER
          Hiccup swims toward Toothless. They're both caught in a mess
          of rigging, being dragged down. The heavy palette settles
          into the rocky bottom like an anchor. Toothless has stopped
          struggling. Hiccup takes one more hopeless tug at the chains -
          he's almost out of air.
          Suddenly, a meaty hand grabs Hiccup.
          STOICK explodes to the surface, pulling Hiccup to the
          shoreline through flaming debris. He lays him down, under the
          shelter of an overhanging rock.

                         HICCUP

                         (OVERWHELMED)
          Dad...
          Stoick dives back into the water between flaming flotsam.

                         UNDERWATER
          ON TOOTHLESS, drowning. Stoick appears in front of him.
          Toothless freezes. Stoick tears the chains off of the yoke
          and lets it float free.
          Momentary stillness. They eye each other, through the churned
          up bubbles. Toothless lunges out of the bars -- grabbing
          Stoick.
          BOOM! In an explosion of sea water, Toothless lands on the
          shore, setting Stoick down and releasing him. Hiccup is awed.
          The ground rumbles underfoot. The monster screeches. Its
          massive claws stomp around in the smoke.
          Stoick gives way as Toothless mounts the rock and raises his
          wings. He turns to Hiccup and SNORTS - âLet's go.'

          HICCUP (CONT'D)
          You got it, bud.
          Hiccup climbs onto Toothless and buckles himself in.
          Stoick grabs his arm.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          "Dragon" DeBlois/Sanders Final Draft (Rev.19) 02-13-2010 94.

                         STOICK
          Hiccup. I'm sorry...for
          everything.

                         HICCUP
          Yeah...me too.

                         STOICK
          You don't have to go up there.

                         HICCUP
          We're Vikings. It's an occupational
          hazard.
          They exchange smiles.

                         STOICK
          I'm proud to call you my son.
          Hiccup beams, taken aback.

                         HICCUP
          Thanks dad.
          Stoick lets go of Hiccup's arm.
          Hiccup spurs Toothless on, charged with his father's belief
          in him. They rocket into the sky as Stoick watches.

          IN THE AIR
          Astrid sees Toothless streaking through the sky, gaining
          altitude.

                         ASTRID
          He's up!
          She turns to Ruffnut and Tuffnut, who are ARGUING and
          THROWING PUNCHES at each other.

          ASTRID (CONT'D)
          Get Snotlout out of there!
          IN MID-PUNCH, the twins look over to see Snotlout stranded on
          the monster's head. They eye each other.

                         TUFFNUT RUFFNUT
          I'm on it! I'm on it!

                         TUFFNUT
          I'm on it first! I'm ahead of you.
          The twins spot Snotlout on the giant dragon and steer their
          Zippleback in his direction.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          "Dragon" DeBlois/Sanders Final Draft (Rev.19) 02-13-2010 95.

                         RUFFNUT
          Hey! Let me drive!
          The twins peel off, ARGUING as they race each other to the
          monster.
          Snotlout sees the Zippleback diving toward him and DASHES
          down the Red Death's head. He runs up the end of its horn...
          As the twins sweep past, both missing him... but perfectly
          snatching him where the necks merge. Ruff and Tuff eye each
          other, surprised and impressed.

                         TUFFNUT
          I can't believe that worked.
          The Red Death spots Astrid and INHALES, preparing to blast.
          She and her Nadder get caught in the suction, pulled toward
          the monster's gaping mouth.

          ON THE GROUND
          The Vikings watch with dread. They hear the familiar whir of
          the...

                         GOBBER
          Night Fury! Get down!

          IN THE AIR
          A massive BLAST jolts the Red Death's head sideways. Astrid
          is thrown clear of its mouth... AND her Nadder. She tumbles
          through the air. The ground races toward her, when...
          She's suddenly CAUGHT by the leg. She looks up to see
          Toothless.

                         HICCUP
          Did you get her?
          Toothless grunts.

          ON THE GROUND
          They fly over the crowd of Vikings and set Astrid down, mid-
          run. They circle back to reengage - a black speck against the
          clouds.

                         ASTRID

                         (BREATHLESS)
          Go.

          IN THE AIR

                         

                         

                         

                         
          "Dragon" DeBlois/Sanders Final Draft (Rev.19) 02-13-2010 96.
          Hiccup and Toothless rocket past the Red Death's head and
          climb, higher and higher.

                         HICCUP

                         (TO TOOTHLESS)
          That thing has wings! Okay, let's
          see if it can use them!
          Hiccup pulls Toothless into a turn. They plummet, gaining
          tremendous speed. The wind buffets them as they target the
          Red Death as super sonic speed.
          KABLAM! Toothless unloads a fireball against the Red Death's
          head. It goes down with a rumble as they climb anew.

          ON THE GROUND
          The Vikings shield themselves from the dust of the fallen
          monster... as its wings unfold and extend.

          IN THE AIR
          Hiccup looks back as they put distance between them.

          HICCUP (CONT'D)
          Do you think that did it?
          Suddenly, the enraged behemoth RISES into frame... flapping
          its wings furiously. A daunting sight.

          HICCUP (CONT'D)
          Well, he can fly.
          Hiccup and Toothless DIVE into the tangled sea stacks - they
          weave through the rock like rabbits through a briar. The Red
          Death SNAPS at them, but cannot reach them. Hiccup and
          Toothless PULL AHEAD.
          The Red Death SMASHES through the canopy of rock and pulls in
          behind Toothless. He BURSTS THROUGH fifty-foot formations
          like they were saplings.

          ON THE GROUND
          Stoick, Gobber, and the Teens watch as Hiccup and Toothless
          streak past, weaving through sea stacks.

                         TEENS
          Woohoo! Yeah!
          A moment later the Red Death SMASHES the sea stacks to dust
          in hot pursuit. The Vikings mood is quenched.

          IN THE AIR

                         

                         

                         

                         
          "Dragon" DeBlois/Sanders Final Draft (Rev.19) 02-13-2010 97.
          Hiccup and Toothless can't slow the monster down. Hiccup eyes
          the clouds above. An idea hits him. He locks eyes with
          Toothless.

                         HICCUP
          Okay Toothless, time to disappear.
          Toothless PULLS into a steep climb, heading toward the
          clouds.

          HICCUP (CONT'D)
          Come on bud!
          The Red Death follows, closing in fast.

          HICCUP (CONT'D)
          (hearing the gas)
          Here it comes!
          BLAST! They narrowly dodge a column of flame and smoke. They
          reach the low-hanging clouds and pierce them. The monster
          follows, immediately losing them in the hampered visibility.
          It roars irritably.
          From out of nowhere, Toothless DIVES at the huge dragon,
          BLASTING and PUNCTURING a hole in its wing. Toothless and
          Hiccup are gone again before the dragon can get a shot at
          them.

          ON THE GROUND
          The Vikings stare up at the sky listening to the resounding
          BOOMS and watching FLASHES light up the clouds.
          Gobber places a hand on Stoick's shoulder.

          IN THE AIR
          HICCUP and TOOTHLESS dive in again and again, using the
          clouds to hide and surprise as they puncture the monster's
          wings.
          It BELLOWS in frustration and WHIRLS around, unleashing fire
          blindly, in all directions.
          Hiccup sees the glow of fire cutting towards them.

          HICCUP (CONT'D)
          Watch out!
          The random blast CLIPS Toothless' tail. It's heavily damaged.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          "Dragon" DeBlois/Sanders Final Draft (Rev.19) 02-13-2010 98.

          HICCUP (CONT'D)
          Okay, time's up. Let's see if this
          works.
          He pulls Toothless into a turn. They fly directly into the
          Red Death's face, taunting it.

          HICCUP (CONT'D)
          Come on! Is that the best you can
          do!?
          Toothless utters an insult too, and they jackknife into a
          steep dive. The Red Death pursues.
          Toothless PUMPS his wings, racing faster than he's ever gone
          before. Hiccup and Toothless stay just ahead of the Red Death
          -- no longer trying to evade it.
          Hiccup glances back to check the tail - it's disintegrating.

          HICCUP (CONT'D)
          Stay with me buddy. We're good.
          Just a little bit longer.
          The Red Death closes the gap. Hiccup tucks in and holds
          Toothless steady -- allowing the monster to set its sights on
          them. It narrows its eyes.

          HICCUP (CONT'D)
          Hold, Toothless.
          The Red Death OPENS his mouth. The familiar gas HISS emanates
          from his throat -- ignition is coming.

          HICCUP (CONT'D)

          NOW!
          Hiccup HITS the PEDALS HARD as Toothless extends one wing.
          They PIVOT in place, hurtling directly into the Red Death's
          mouth.
          Toothless FIRES point blank down the monster's throat. Its
          amassing gas is ignited, BACKFIRING into the monster,
          erupting in a chain of blasts throughout its body.
          Hiccup and Toothless BURST from the clouds, the Red Death hot
          on their tail, exploding from within. It glances forward and
          sees the ground rushing up. It throws open its wings,
          attempting to put on the brakes, but the punctured, damaged
          wings can't stop its momentum.
          As the Red Death chokes on the expanding fireball, he sees
          Toothless suddenly pull out of the dive, streaking up, past
          its head.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          "Dragon" DeBlois/Sanders Final Draft (Rev.19) 02-13-2010 99.
          The Red Death HITS the ground, head-first. It EXPLODES like
          the Hindenburg.
          Hiccup and Toothless weave through the monster's massive back
          plates, wings, and flailing legs -- a high-speed recall of
          the FREE FALL slalom run. The expanding fireball races toward
          them, about to swallow them.
          They manage to clear the obstacles. Hiccup glances back.
          They're outrunning the fireball.
          He looks forward just in time to see the monster's massive
          club tail careening toward them.
          He tries to shift their direction. The last shreds of
          Toothless' tail tear away. Hiccup's pedals go DEAD.

          HICCUP (CONT'D)
          No. No.
          Hiccup and Toothless can't maneuver - they're dead in the
          air. The giant club tail CLIPS Toothless, TEARING Hiccup from
          the harness and sending him tumbling against the backdrop of
          the fast-approaching fireball.
          Toothless STRUGGLES with all his might to reach the
          unconscious Hiccup. But the fireball swallows them both.

          ON THE GROUND
          The Vikings watch in horror as Hiccup and Toothless disappear
          into the boiling inferno.

                         DISSOLVE TO:
          A whiteout of ash. And through it comes...

                         STOICK
          Hiccup? Hiccup!?
          Stoick appears, searching desperately. Everything is
          scorched. Even the ground is smoking from the terrible heat.

          STOICK (CONT'D)
          Hiccup!? Son!?
          Through the ash, Stoick the motionless silhouette of
          Toothless.

          STOICK (CONT'D)

                         (GRAVE)
          Hiccup.

          He hurries to the dragon's side. Toothless is roughed up, but
          conscious. His scorched saddle, however, is vacant.
          Stoick looks to the sky in despair. He buckles at the knees,
          overwhelmed by the loss.

          STOICK (CONT'D)
          Oh son...I did this...
          Astrid pushes through the crowd, her eyes welling up.
          Followed by Gobber. They flank Stoick as he kneels, slumped
          over.
          Behind them, a ring of Vikings form, keeping a respectful
          distance. As the dust and smoke clear, a ring of wild
          dragons can also be seen, gathering just behind and between
          the Vikings.
          Toothless stirs and groggily rolls his head toward Stoick.
          Their eyes meet.

          STOICK (CONT'D)
          I'm so sorry...
          Toothless unfolds his wings, revealing Hiccup, unconscious,
          clutched safely against his chest. Stoick's eyes widen.

          STOICK (CONT'D)
          Hiccup.
          He scoops Hiccup into his arms. Listens to his heart. Bursts
          into relieved laughter.

          STOICK (CONT'D)
          He's alive!

                         (TO TOOTHLESS)
          You brought him back alive!
          The crowd roars. Followed by the dragons. The Vikings look
          around to find themselves surrounded.
          Stoick leans close to Toothless, meeting him eye to eye.

          STOICK (CONT'D)

                         (PRIVATELY)
          Thank you... for saving my son.
          Gobber looks Hiccup up and down.

                         GOBBER
          Well, you know... most of him.
          Stoick glances back at him. Gobber shrugs, redirecting his
          eyes toward...

          INT. STOICK'S HOUSE - DAY


                         CLOSE ON
          HICCUP, asleep, his head on a pillow. Healing scars on his
          face show that maybe a week or two have passed.
          Toothless hovers over him, WHINING and GRUMBLING impatiently.
          Hiccup stirs. Opens his eyes.

                         HICCUP

                         (GROGGY)
          Oh, hey Toothless.
          Toothless excitedly nuzzles and nudges Hiccup.

                         HICCUP (CONT'D)
          Okay, okay! I'm happy to see you
          too, bud. Now just--
          Toothless steps on his groin, causing Hiccup to sit BOLT
          UPRIGHT with a YELP.
          He looks around, confounded. He's in his bed, moved beside
          the fire pit on the main floor of his house.

          HICCUP (CONT'D)
          I'm in my house.
          (re: Toothless, leaning
          over him, excited)
          You're in my house.
          Toothless TEARS around the room, knocking things over, far
          too big for the space.

          HICCUP (CONT'D)
          Uh...does my dad know you're in
          here?!
          Toothless pauses at the foot of the bed, tongue wagging. He
          eyes the rafters... and LEAPS UP onto them, brimming with
          'happy dog' energy.

          HICCUP (CONT'D)

                         (DISTRESSED)
          Okay, okay -- no Toothless! Aw,
          come on...
          Hiccup shifts to get out of bed... then pauses... sensing
          that something is wrong.
          He peels back the covers slowly. What he sees startles,
          horrifies, and overwhelms him -- all at once.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          "Dragon" DeBlois/Sanders Final Draft (Rev.19) 02-13-2010 102.

          ON THE BARE FLOOR
          His booted foot touches down. Followed by a mechanical
          prosthetic in place of his second leg. It's an ingenious
          spring-loaded replacement, made of wood and iron.
          Toothless lands by the bed and approaches calmly, sniffing
          the new leg. He raises his eyes to meet Hiccup's, seemingly
          aware of what Hiccup is going through.
          Hiccup braces himself on the bedpost and tries to stand on
          it. He winces and stifles the pain...

          HICCUP (CONT'D)
          Okay...okay...
          ... but STUMBLES with the first step. Toothless catches
          Hiccup's fall with his head... and slowly lifts him up,
          stabilizing him.

          HICCUP (CONT'D)
          Thanks bud.
          Hiccup leans on him like a crutch. They take a few steps
          together.
          Their missing parts form a poetic silhouette as they make
          their way toward the door.
          Hiccup pries it open (as he did in the opening scene),
          revealing a MONSTROUS NIGHTMARE flapping outside the door.
          Hiccup YELPS and slams the door closed. He turns to
          Toothless, alarmed.

          HICCUP (CONT'D)
          Toothless? Stay here, bud.
          Hiccup pauses... and cracks the door open again. He peeks
          outside, his eyes widening. He allows to door to swing open,
          revealing...
          ... the Monstrous Nightmare, carrying Snotlout on its back.

                         SNOTLOUT
          Come on guys, get ready! Hold on
          tight! Here we go!
          A class of newbie dragon riders follow him through frame on a
          variety of dragons, pulling back the curtain on an amazing
          vista in which:

                         

                         

                         

                         
          "Dragon" DeBlois/Sanders Final Draft (Rev.19) 02-13-2010 103.
          Vikings and dragons mill about by the dozen, basking on the
          rooftops, weaving along the plaza. No one seems upset, there
          isn't a sword in sight.
          Under the framework of a MASSIVE BARN, a Nadder BLASTS fire
          onto a metal brace. It steps back to let a Viking hammer it
          into shape. Nearby, a Gronkle lands, carrying a tree trunk in
          his mouth. He shows a Viking what he's found. The Viking pats
          his head. Another Viking backs a Zippleback into a stall to
          check it for size.
          Hiccup takes a step outside, finding Stoick waiting for him
          on the step.

                         HICCUP
          I knew it. I'm dead.
          Stoick laughs.

                         STOICK
          No, but you gave it your best shot.
          He puts his arm around Hiccup, steadying him. He gestures to
          the transformed village.

                         STOICK (CONT'D)
          So? What do you think?
          Hiccup just shrugs, amazed.
          Below, the plaza, villagers take notice.

                         VIKING #1
          Hey look! It's Hiccup!
          They rush over, surrounding him with a hero's welcome.

                         VIKING #2
          Hiccup, how you doin' mate?

                         VIKING #3
          It's great to see you up and about.

                         STOICK

                         (SWEETLY)
          Turns out all we needed was a
          little more of...

                         (GESTURES NON-SPECIFICALLY

                         AT HICCUP)
          ... this.

                         HICCUP

                         (PLAYING ALONG)
          You just gestured to all of me.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          "Dragon" DeBlois/Sanders Final Draft (Rev.19) 02-13-2010 104.

          GOBBER (O.S.)
          Well. Most of you.
          Gobber pushes through the crowd, beaming proudly.

          GOBBER (CONT'D)
          (re: the prosthetic leg)
          That bit's my handiwork. With a
          little Hiccup flare thrown in.
          Think it'll do?

                         HICCUP
          (bittersweet, coming to

                         TERMS)
          I might make a few tweaks.
          Astrid appears and jabs Hiccup in the arm. Hiccup recoils
          with a grumble.

                         ASTRID
          That's for scaring me.

                         HICCUP

                         (PROTESTING)
          What, is it always going to be this
          way? Cause I...
          She grabs him aggressively... then kisses him. Hoots and
          hollers follow.

          HICCUP (CONT'D)
          ... could get used to it.
          Gobber presents Hiccup with a rebuilt saddle, rigging, and
          tail.

                         GOBBER
          Welcome home.
          Suddenly, Toothless pounces on the crowd, crushing several
          unsuspecting Vikings under his weight.

                         VIKING
          Night Fury, get down!
          Toothless eyes the new tail excitedly, tongue wagging. Amidst
          the groans and grumbles, Hiccup and Astrid exchange a
          sheepish grin.

                         CLOSE ON

                         CLOSE ON
          Hiccup's prosthetic foot, snapping into the modified stirrup.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          "Dragon" DeBlois/Sanders Final Draft (Rev.19) 02-13-2010 105.
          The two pieces click together, forming a single shape.
          Astride Toothless, he's whole again. He rotates the pedal.
          The new tail opens. Bright red with a skull and Viking horns
          emblazoned on it. Hiccup approves.

          CUT BACK TO REVEAL...
          Hiccup and Toothless, saddled up and ready to fly. Astrid
          backs her Nadder into position.

                         HICCUP

                         (TO TOOTHLESS)
          You ready?
          Toothless SNORTS an excited 'yes!'
          From his mount, Hiccup looks out over the changed world.

          HICCUP (V.O.) (CONT'D)
          This... is Berk.

                         (BEAT)
          It snows nine months of the year...
          and hails the other three.
          They LEAP into the bright blue sky, together as one. Astrid
          follows, giving chase.

          HICCUP (CONT'D)
          Any food that grows here is tough
          and tasteless. The people that grow
          here are even more so.
          Hiccup and Astrid race their dragons through the village --
          under eaves, over rooftops, down cliff-sides, and between
          ship masts. It's a high energy, romantic dance of sorts.

          HICCUP (V.O.) (CONT'D)
          The only upsides are the pets.
          While other places have...ponies or
          parrots, we have...
          Their fellow recruits join them as they take to the open sky,
          rocketing far above the village. The Northern sky swirls with
          blazing, multicolored dragons.
          Hiccup and Toothless break from the pack, spinning into the
          blinding sun.

          HICCUP (V.O.) (CONT'D)

                         (PROUDLY)
          ... dragons.

           EXT. OPEN SEA - DAY


                         
           Hiccup and Toothless BLUR PAST, leaving a wake that leads...                         

                         

           EXT. BERK - DAY

           (Sequence 0200 - New Berk)
           To the island village of Berk, festively adorned with flags
           and banners. Major new additions alter its familiar skyline.

           HICCUP (V.O.)
           This... is Berk. The best kept
           secret this side of, well,
           anywhere. Granted, it may not look
           like much, but this wet heap of
           rock packs more than a few
           surprises.

          ON A CLUSTER OF SHEEP, hiding nervously between buildings as
          shadows of passing dragons race by. The group moves as one,
          receding into a shadowy alley, pushing one sheep out into the
          light. It's suddenly snatched and carried into the air!

                         

           HICCUP (V.O.)
           Life here is amazing, just not for
           the faint of heart. See, where most
           folks enjoy hobbies like whittling
           or needlepoint, we Berkians prefer
           a little something we like to call--

          WHOOSH, WHOOSH, WHOOSH! A wash of VIBRANT COLORS blurs by.
          DRAGONS BARREL PAST at a dizzying speed. Their RIDERS SWIPE,
          KICK, and ROLL into one another while they WEAVE neck in neck
          between the houses, docks, and revamped structures of Berk.

           HICCUP (V.O.)

           DRAGON RACING!

          It's like an aerial version of the Monte Carlo race.
          Spectators ROAR from wooden bleachers, fastened to cliff
          faces and perched over the sea.

                         
          FISHLEGS, now 20 and even larger, rides his gronkle, MEATLUG,
          who carries the sheep in her claws, until...

                         
          SNOTLOUT, also 20, but every bit as juvenile, and his
          Monstrous Nightmare, HOOKFANG, steal the sheep from them.
           HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 2.

                         

                         

                          SNOTLOUT
           Oh, I'm sorry, Fishlegs! Did you
           want that?

                         

                          FISHLEGS
           Snotlout! That's mine!
          Snotlout FALLS BACK toward RUFFNUT and TUFFNUT, who lag on
          their two-headed Zippleback, BARF & BELCH.

                          SNOTLOUT
           Here ya go, babe.
          With a chivalrous grin, Snotlout tosses the sheep to Ruffnut.
          She SNATCHES it with a sneer and a GRUMBLE.

                          SNOTLOUT (CONT'D)
           Did I tell you that you look
           amazing today? `Cause you do.

                          RUFFNUT
           Come on, Barf. It's starting to
           stink around here.
          Barf starts to peel off, spewing gas. Tuffnut mocks Snotlout
          with a mugging grin.

                          TUFFNUT
           Nope. Still hates you. Let's blow
           this place, Belch!
          Belch ignites the gas, sparking a flashy explosion, and
          leaving Snotlout behind in the smoke.
          As they rush past the main bleachers, Ruffnut DROPS her sheep
          into one of five baskets suspended over a chasm at the lap
          crossing. Each backboard bears an image of its corresponding
          dragon. The Barf/Belch basket filled to the brim with sheep.
          Presiding over the game, STOICK turns to the frenzied crowd.

                          STOICK
           That's nine for the Twins, Astrid
           lags with three, Fishlegs and
           Snotlout trail with NONE!
          Stoick eyes an empty basket at the far end, its backboard
          painted with an image of Toothless.

                         

                          STOICK (CONT'D)
           And Hiccup is... nowhere to be
           found. Hmmm.
           HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 3.

                         

                         

                          GOBBER
           Scared him off with the big talk,
           didn't ya, Stoick?
          WHACK! Snotlout, still smoldering from the blast, gets
          CLIPPED from behind. ASTRID, rolls in, astride STORMFLY --
          spirited and competitive as ever, and beautiful despite
          herself.

                          ASTRID
           What are you doing, Snotlout?!
           They're going to win now!

                          SNOTLOUT
           She's my princess! Whatever she
           wants, she gets.

                          ASTRID
           Ruffnut?! Didn't she try to bury
           you alive?!

                         

                          SNOTLOUT
           Only for a few hours!
          BACK TO THE RACERS, as they peel away, pouring on the speed.

           HICCUP (V.O.)
           Dragons used to be a bit of a
           problem here. But that was five
           years ago. Now they've all moved
           in. And, really, why wouldn't they?
          The racers chase each other through a sprawling hangar and
          into a vast cave, teeming with colorfully painted dragon
          stables. They exit through the far side and circle back
          through the village, blasting past many of its dragon-
          friendly additions.

           HICCUP (V.O.)
           We have custom stables... all-you-
           can-eat feeding stations... a full
           service dragon wash...

                         
          In the village, a baby Gronkle sneezes, accidentally setting
          one of the Viking houses aflame.

           HICCUP (V.O.)
           Even top-of-the-line fire
           prevention, if I do say so myself.
          Astrid rolls her eyes, peels away from the other dragon
          racers, and yanks open a spout on the overhead network of
          aqueducts, dousing the flames with a surge of water.
           HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 4.

                         

                         
          BACK TO STOICK, amused as he watches the racers round the
          island, searching for sheep. He turns to Gobber and nods.

                         

                          STOICK
           It's time, Gobber.

                         

                          GOBBER
           Righty-ho!
           (aloud, to the crowd)
           Last lap!
          A HORN sounds. The racers all turn to each other, excited.

                          ASTRID
           The black sheep! Come on, Stormfly!
           We can still win this thing!

                         

                          RUFFNUT
           Come on, Barf!

                         

                          TUFFNUT
           Let's go!

                         

                          FISHLEGS
           Go, Meatlug!
          GOBBER loads the BLACK SHEEP onto a catapult.

                         

                          GOBBER
           This is your big moment. Have a
           nice flight!

                         
          He pulls the trigger, LAUNCHING the black sheep into the air.
          Astrid spots it and steers Stormfly into a steep climb toward
          it.

                         

                          ASTRID
           Up, up, up!
          In a flash, Fishlegs and Meatlug blur past, NABBING the
          sheep.

                          ASTRID (CONT'D)
           No!

                          FISHLEGS
           Good job, Meatlug!
          Fishlegs tosses his captured prize to Ruffnut.

                          FISHLEGS (CONT'D)
           Here you go, darling. Mine's worth
           ten!
           HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 5.

                         

                         

                          RUFFNUT
           Yeah! The Black Sheep!
          Snotlout sighs, frustrated.

                          ASTRID
           You guys are fighting for Ruffnut?!

                          RUFFNUT
           I'm totally winning!

                         
          Fishlegs hovers up nest to Ruffnut with a starry-eyed smile.

                         

                          FISHLEGS
           We're winning together!
          She RAMS BARF into Meatlug, sending Fishlegs into an
          uncontrolled SPIN. He SLAMS into Snotlout, sending their
          dragons TUMBLING head over tail. The crowd goes wild.

                          RUFFNUT
           No one can stop me now!

                          TUFFNUT
           Except for me. We're attached,
           genius!

                         
          He GRABS at the sheep. Ruffnut fights back, inciting a tug-of-
          war.

                          TUFFNUT (CONT'D)
           Quit trying to steal all my glory!
          And while they're distracted, Astrid steers Stormfly toward
          them, CLOSING IN.

                         

                          STOICK
           Get `em, Astrid!

                         

                          TUFFNUT RUFFNUT
          It's MY glory! No sheep, no You're always ruining
          glory! EVERYTHING!
          Astrid leaps off of Stormfly, runs up Belch's spindly neck,
          and PLUCKS the black sheep from the Twins' hands.

                          ASTRID
           Gotcha!

                         
          She tumbles through the air onto Stormfly, sticking a perfect
          landing, black sheep in hand.

                         

                          RUFFNUT
           Astrid!
           HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 6.

                         

                         

                         
          BACK TO STOICK, beside himself. The crowd ROARS.

                         

                          STOICK
           Well played! Hahaha!
           (gloating, to the crowd)
           That's my future daughter-in-law!

          BACK TO ASTRID ON STORMFLY
          eyeing the fast-approaching FINISH LINE, unaware as...
          FISHLEGS suddenly RAMS Meatlug into Stormfly, sending Astrid
          off-course. She recovers and sees Snotlout flying headlong
          toward her, war hammer cocked, aiming at Astrid.

                          SNOTLOUT
           Uh, excuse me.

                          ASTRID
           Stormfly!
          Snotlout HURLS his hammer. Astrid ducks and rolls Stormfly
          out of the way. The hammer catches Fishlegs in the face with
          a CLANG. The crowd collectively winces.

                         
          Astrid and Stormfly recover from their roll, loop over the
          water, and they BLAST past the finish line, DUNKING the black
          sheep into their basket!

                         

                          STOICK
           That's thirteen! Astrid takes the
           game!
          The crowd COMES UNHINGED. Astrid flies over the crowd,
          basking in her victory.

           HICCUP (V.O.)
           Yep. Berk is pretty much perfect.
           All of my hard work has paid off.
           And it's a good thing, too, because
           with Vikings on the backs of
           dragons, the world just got a whole
           lot bigger.

                         

          EXT. OPEN SKY/ISLAND COASTLINE - DAY

          (Scene 0300 - AWOL Part One)
          A boundless sky. Vast. Clear. Crisp. And from it, a BLACK
          SPECK rockets across the horizon. The image of unbridled
          freedom.
           HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 7.

                         

                         
          Tucked into his riding position, HICCUP appears to be part of
          TOOTHLESS. They dip, roll and dive, over a sea teeming with
          Thunderdrums, pulling off daring maneuvers with honed
          refinement, making them seem effortless.

                          HICCUP
           Yeah!
          They jackknife, heading skyward, rolling and tumbling through
          the ethereal cloud-scapes and joining high-flying Timberjacks
          as they soar in formation.
          Hiccup is bound head-to-toe in a snug, aerodynamic flight
          suit -- an asymmetrical, functional design of leather and
          articulated plates. It has an air of Viking bike leather.

                         

                          HICCUP (CONT'D)
           What do you think, bud? Wanna give
           this another shot?

                         
          Toothless grumbles in protest.

                         

                          HICCUP (CONT'D)
           Toothless! It'll be fine.
          With a click of a lever, he LOCKS the pedals in the flared
          tail position. Hiccup then unhooks himself from the saddle.

                         

                          HICCUP (CONT'D)
           Ready?
          Toothless SNORTS unenthusiastically.
          Suddenly, Hiccup SLIDES OFF of Toothless, peeling away from
          him like a skydiver from a plane, YELLING as he plummets.

                         
          Toothless dives after him. They spiral through the air, face-
          to-face. Toothless is having fun, despite himself.
          Hiccup slips his forearms through a pair of tucked leather
          flaps... and YANKS, unfurling SHEETS OF LEATHER as he extends
          his arms. They catch the wind, SNAPPING OPEN like WINGS...
          and sending him GLIDING -- out of control, at first, then
          stabilizing. The turbulence buffets his flight suit heavily.
          But he's flying!
          Toothless unfolds his wings, too, catching up with Hiccup.
          The freedom is palpable. Hiccup and Toothless are, for the
          moment, the same. Feeling the same rush of adrenaline.
          Independently together.
          They PLUNGE past cloud formations, splitting apart then
          crossing paths again.
           HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 8.

                         

                         
          Impressive as it is, Hiccup is gliding at a steep angle.
          Toothless launches fireballs ahead of Hiccup, boosting him
          higher with the expanding heat bursts.

                         

                          HICCUP (CONT'D)
           This is amazing!
          A cloud layer washes past, exposing a towering ROCK
          FORMATION, dead ahead.

                         

                          HICCUP (CONT'D)
           No longer amazing! Toothless!
          Hiccup tries to steer himself away, to no avail.
          Toothless POURS ON THE SPEED, trying to catch Hiccup as he
          HURTLES toward collision. His locked tail makes maneuvering
          difficult. He's UNABLE TO PULL UP at a steep enough angle.

                         

                          HICCUP (CONT'D)
           Oh, no!
          At the last second, Toothless BLASTS the jagged rocks just
          ahead of Hiccup, then WRAPS Hiccup in his wings as they fly
          through it. The obliterated peak rains down around them.
          Toothless emerges through the cloud of debris and HURTLES
          into the trees of a neighboring peak. They tumble down the
          uneven terrain, coming to rest on a small plateau.
          Hiccup emerges from the cocoon of Toothless' wings. He
          switches his prosthetic riding foot to his walking foot and
          stows his leather wings.

                         

                          HICCUP (CONT'D)
           That really came out of nowhere.
          The blown up sea stack collapses.

                          HICCUP (CONT'D)
           We gotta work on your solo gliding
           there, bud. That locked-up tail
           makes for some pretty sloppy rescue
           maneuvers, eh?
          Hiccup reels in his dorsal fin and removes his helmet,
          revealing a 20 year old Hiccup framed by wild hair, complete
          with a Viking braid.
          He walks to the edge of the cliff, taking in the NEW LAND
          stretching off into the horizon, its tall cliffs and sea-
          stacks adorned with swaying gold birch trees basking in the
          dappled afternoon sunlight.
           HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 9.

                         

                         

                          HICCUP (CONT'D)
           Looks like we found another one,
           bud.
          Toothless FUSSES and SNORTS, not amused, shaking off dust and
          pebbles like a wet dog.
          Hiccup flinches as a pebble WHACKS him on the back of the
          head. He looks back to Toothless, who averts his eyes.

                          HICCUP (CONT'D)
           Oh, what? Do you want an apology?
           Is that why you're pouting, big
           baby boo? Well... try this on!
          Hiccup TACKLES Toothless and tries to put him in a headlock.

                          HICCUP (CONT'D)
           Ya feeling it yet? Huh? Picking up
           on all my heartfelt remorse?
          Toothless simply stands on his hind legs, lifting Hiccup off
          of his flailing feet and dangling him over the cliff's edge.

                          HICCUP (CONT'D)
           Oh, come on. You wouldn't hurt a

                          ONE-LEGGED--

                         
          Hiccup looks down, seeing the precipitous drop below.

                         

                          HICCUP (CONT'D)
           You're right! You're right! You
           win! You win!
          WHAM! Toothless flips him over, pinning him to the ground.
          Hiccup squirms, throwing mock punches. Toothless playfully
          retaliates with feline taps to Hiccup's head.

                          HICCUP (CONT'D)
           He's down! And it's ugly! Dragons
           and Vikings, enemies again, locked
           in combat to the bitter -- URFFF!
          Toothless rests his head on Hiccup -- SQUEEZING THE AIR out
          of him. Toothless then suddenly starts grooming Hiccup,
          lapping at his face and covering him in slobber.

                         

                          HICCUP (CONT'D)
           Gaaaaagh!

                         
          Hiccup fights to get free, finally springing to his feet and
          shaking off the viscous saliva.

                          HICCUP (CONT'D)
           You KNOW that doesn't wash out.

                         
          Toothless LAUGHS, pleased with himself.

                         
          Shifting his attention back to the new land stretched out
          before them, Hiccup reaches beneath his chest plate and
          produces a leather-bound book.

                         
          He unfurls it to reveal an EXPLORERS MAP, modified with added
          strips in every direction to accommodate their ever-expanding
          world. Drawings indicate new lands, new tribes, and many new
          dragons.
          Hiccup peels a fresh strip of paper from a hidden fold in his
          flight suit and holds it out for Toothless to lick.
          Hiccup affixes the moistened strip to the map's outer edge,
          then whittles a pencil and consults a compass affixed to his
          forearm.

                          HICCUP (CONT'D)
           So what should we name it?
          Toothless GURGLES as he gnaws under his wing, preoccupied.

                          HICCUP (CONT'D)
           "Itchy Armpit" it is.
          Hiccup carefully draws the new island's outline.

                          HICCUP (CONT'D)
           Whaddya reckon, bud? Think we might
           find a few Timberjacks in those
           woods? The odd Whispering Death or
           two in the rocks? Who knows...
           maybe we'll finally track down
           another Night Fury.

                          (BEAT)
           Wouldn't that be something?

                          (BURDENED)
           So, whaddya say? Just keep going?
          Toothless' ear plates suddenly SHOOT UP. He ROARS, and his
          call is answered by a familiar SCREECH. Hiccup turns to
          see...

          ASTRID rising into view, astride Stormfly. Stormfly grabs
          talon-fulls of rock to slow her landing.

                          HICCUP
           `Afternoon m'lady. Where have you
           been?

                         
          Astrid dismounts and throws back her fur hood as Toothless
          rushes up to greet them.

                         

                          ASTRID
           Winning races. What else? The real
           question is... where have YOU been?

                         

                          HICCUP
           Avoiding my dad.

                         

                          ASTRID
           Oh, no. What happened now?

                         
          Astrid sits beside Hiccup, inspecting his latest addition to
          the map. Behind them, Toothless greets Stormfly, inciting a
          play fight.

                         

                          HICCUP
           Oh, you're gonna love this. I wake
           up. The sun's shining. Terrible
           Terrors are singing on the rooftop.
           I saunter down to breakfast,
           thinking all is right with the
           world, and I get...

                         
          He gets to his feet and puffs out his chest.

                         

                          HICCUP (CONT'D)

                          (APING STOICK)
           ... Son, we need to talk.

                         
          Astrid smiles and adopts Hiccup's sloppy slouch.

                          ASTRID

                          (APING HICCUP)
           Not now, Dad. I've got a whole day
           of goofing off to get started.

                         
          Hiccup breaks character, grimacing at her impression of him.

                         

                          HICCUP
           Okay, first of all, I don't sound
           like that. What is this character?
           And second... what is that thing
           you're doing with my shoulders?

                         
          Astrid laughs, jostling her shoulders in an awkward way.
           HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 12.

                         

                         

                          HICCUP (CONT'D)
           A truly flattering impersonation.
           Anyway, he goes...
           (resuming Stoick's brogue)
           You're the pride of Berk, son, and
           I couldn't be prouder...

                         

                          ASTRID
           (continuing her impression

                          OF HICCUP)
           Aw, thanks, Dad. I'm pretty
           impressed with myself, too.

                         

                          HICCUP
           WHEN have I ever done that with my
           hands?

                         

                          ASTRID
           You just did.

                         
          She laughs, playfully.

                         

                          HICCUP
           Okay... just...
           (holding her arms, mock-

                          STERN)
           Hold still. It's very serious.

                         
          She giggles, trying to hold a straight face.

                         

                          HICCUP (CONT'D)
           (resuming Stoick's brogue)
           You're all grown up, and since no
           chief could ask for a better
           successor, I've decided--

                         
          Astrid straightens, her face brightening.

                          ASTRID
           --TO MAKE YOU CHIEF! Oh, my gods!

                         
          She jumps to her feet, beaming...

                         

                          ASTRID (CONT'D)
           Hiccup, that's amazing!

                         
          And socks Hiccup in congratulations, deliberately hitting the
          dorsal fin release button and triggering it to pop up. She
          laughs as Hiccup reels it back in, self-consciously.

                         

                          HICCUP
           You're gonna wear out the spring

           sensitive!

          They're suddenly BOWLED OVER by Toothless and Stormfly.

                         

                          HICCUP (CONT'D)
           Yeah, so... this is what I'm
           dealing with.

                         
          Astrid helps him up and dusts him off.

                         

                          ASTRID

                          (EXCITED)
           What did you tell him?

                         

                          HICCUP
           I didn't. By the time he turned
           around, I was gone.

                         
          Astrid picks up the map, folding it as she paces around him,
          processing it all.

                         

                          ASTRID
           Well, it's a lot of responsibility.
           The map will have to wait for sure,
           and I'll need to fly Toothless,
           since you'll be too busy...

                         
          She pauses, wincing in sympathy. She turns to Hiccup. He nods
          knowingly, taking the map from her.

                         

                          HICCUP
           It's not me, Astrid. All those
           speeches, and planning, and running
           the village... that's his thing.

                         

                          ASTRID
           I think you're missing the point. I
           mean, chief. What an honor. I'd be
           pretty excited.
          Hiccup shakes his head.

                         

                          HICCUP
           I'm not like you. You know exactly
           who you are. You always have.
           But...

                         
          He shuffles to the cliff's edge, gazing out at the new land.

                         

                          HICCUP (CONT'D)
           I'm still looking. I know that I'm
           not my father... and I never met my
           mother... so, what does that make
           me?

          He sits at the edge, looking burdened, restless. Astrid
          approaches and settles beside him, joining him in looking out
          at the distant horizon. She weaves another braid into his
          hair as she speaks.

                         

                          ASTRID
           What you're searching for... isn't
           out there, Hiccup.

                         
          She places a hand on his chest.

                         

                          ASTRID (CONT'D)
           It's in here.

                          (BEAT)
           Maybe you just don't see it yet.

                         
          She kisses his cheek, but gets a mouthful of Toothless'
          slobber. She grimaces, wiping it off.

                         
          Distracted, Hiccup eyes the horizon keenly.

                         

                          HICCUP
           Maybe. But, y'know... there is
           something out there.

                         

                          ASTRID

                          (EXASPERATED)
           Hiccup...

                         
          He turns her face to the horizon. A distant smoke plume rises
          from a misty valley.

                         

                         

          EXT. LAPLAND WOODS/TRAPPER'S FORT - MOMENTS LATER


                         
          (Scene 0400 - Shot Down!)
          Hiccup and Toothless fly over the fjord, winding deep through
          undulating crimson and gold forests.

                         
          Astrid and Stormfly catch up as the autumn colors suddenly
          give way to charred timbers. They fly deeper, through ash and
          wafting smoke. Ahead, in a sheltered harbor, an explosion of
          ice stands as an eerie marker of what used to be a TRAPPER'S

          FORT.

                         

                          HICCUP
           Stay close.

                         
          They fly through the suspended remains of the buildings,
          splintered, and frozen in mid-destruction.

                         

                          HICCUP (CONT'D)
           What happened here?

          It's at once harrowing and puzzling. Toothless spots an
          enormous DRAGON FOOTPRINT in the muddy shoreline below,
          leaving him uneasy.

                         

                          HICCUP (CONT'D)
           Easy, bud.

                         
          As they crest the ice formations, Astrid spots a CREW OF MEN
          at the stern of a moored ship below.

                         

                          ASTRID
           Hiccup!

                         

           ERET (O.S.)
           Fire!

                         
          The men fire a stern-mounted cannon. The projectile unfurls
          into a NET. Hiccup and Toothless dart out of its way.

                         

                          HICCUP
           Astrid! Look out!

                         
          It HITS Stormfly, TANGLING her wings and causing her to spin
          uncontrolled. Astrid struggles to free her as they HURTLE
          toward a collision.

                         

                          ASTRID

           HICCUP!

                         
          Astrid falls off of Stormfly, but Toothless SNATCHES her at
          the last second.

                         
          Stormfly hits the ground, tangled in the net. Trappers rush
          out of hiding, piling onto her with ropes and weapons. She
          whips her tail, sending spikes flying.

                         

                          ERET
           Watch the tail!

                         
          A large, raven-haired trapper lunges over the spray of spikes
          and lands upon Stormfly's head, twisting it and taking her
          down like a rodeo cowboy.

                         

                          ERET (CONT'D)
           Tie those legs up!

                         
          Eret deftly ties her gnashing jaws shut, wrangling her into
          submission -- clearly a pro among pros. He looks up,
          revealing a handsome face and gleaming, intelligent eyes that
          search the sky as Toothless' tell-tale BANSHEE scream rings
          out.

          Toothless suddenly streaks across the sky, banking and
          landing with a FEROCIOUS ROAR.

                         

                          HICCUP

           STOP!

                         

                          ASTRID

           STORMFLY!
           (to the trappers)
           What are you doing?

                         
          Astrid and Hiccup leap off of Toothless, rushing toward
          Stormfly.

                         
          Eret's men immediately draw weapons. Hiccup extends and
          ignites his DRAGON BLADE -- a telescoping fiery sword --
          impressive enough to wow Eret's men.

                         

                          ERET
           Back again?

                         
          Eret steps forward, focused only on Toothless.

                         

                          ERET (CONT'D)
           Soil my britches... that is a Night
           Fury. Thought they were all gone
           for good.
           (to his fellow trappers)
           Looks like our luck's had a turn
           for the better, lads! Don't think
           Drago has one of those in his
           dragon army.

                         
          His men sound out in agreement. Hiccup eyes Astrid, confused.

                         

                          ASTRID
           Dragon army?

                          HICCUP
           Look, we don't want any trouble.

                         

                          ERET
           Ha! You should've thought of that
           before you stole all of our dragons
           and blasted our fort to bits!

                         

                          HICCUP
           Wait...

                         

                          ASTRID
           What are you talking about?

                         
          Astrid and Hiccup take in the icy destruction, putting it
          together.

                          HICCUP
           You think we did this?

                         

                          ERET
           Dragon trapping is hard enough work
           as it is, without do-gooder dragon
           riders sneaking in to rescue them.

                         

                          HICCUP
           What do-gooder -- there are other
           dragon riders?

                         

                          ERET
           You mean, other than your thieving
           friend from last night? You tell
           me.

                         
          Eret approaches. Toothless snarls, protectively.

                         

                          ERET (CONT'D)
           You may have an ice-spitting dragon
           on your side, but we still have a
           quota to fill. How do you suppose
           we explain this mess to Drago
           Bludvist?

                         

                          HICCUP
           Drago what-fist? Does anything you
           say make sense?

                         

                          TEENY
           He's expecting a new shipment of
           dragons for his army by tomorrow.

                         

                          NO-NAME
           And Drago don't take well to
           excuses.
          Eret parts his tunic, revealing a large branding-iron scar on
          his torso, in the shape of a dragon skull, split by a sword.

                         

                          ERET
           This is what he gave me last time I
           showed up empty-handed. He promised
           to be far less understanding in the
           future.

                         

                          HICCUP

                          (EXASPERATED)
           Look, we don't know anything about
           a dragon thief, or an ice-spitting
           dragon, or your lunatic boss and
           his dragon army, okay?

           Just give us back our dragon, and
           we'll go, strange, hostile person
           whom we've never met.

                         
          Eret bows playfully.

                         

                          ERET
           Oh, where are my manners? I'm Eret.
           Son of Eret. Finest dragon trapper
           alive.

                         
          He pulls a dagger from behind his back, waving it cockily.
          His men ready their weapons and net cannons.

                         

                          ERET (CONT'D)
           After all, it's not just anyone who
           can capture a Night Fury.

                         
          Toothless ROARS a warning.

                         

                          HICCUP
           And this is Toothless. He says
           we're going. Now.

                         

                          ERET
           Heh. They all say that.

                          (BEAT)

           RUSH `EM, LADS!

                         
          Eret lunges toward them. Toothless BLASTS, bringing down a
          massive spire of ice. It shatters as it hits the ground,
          forcing Eret and his men to dive out of the way.

                         
          Making quick use of the distraction, Hiccup re-ignites his
          dragon blade and slashes through the ropes binding Stormfly.

                         

                          ASTRID
           Stormfly! C'mon, go! Go!

                         
          Eret gets to his feet in time to see Toothless and Stormfly
          take to the air, carrying Hiccup and Astrid out of reach of
          the volley of arrows.

                         

                          ERET

           YOU WILL NEVER HOLD ON TO THOSE

           DRAGONS, YOU HEAR ME?! DRAGO IS

           COMING FOR THEM ALL!

          The GANG joyrides past GOTHI'S house, scattering her
          assortment of terrible terrors. She waves a fist at them as
          they sweep past, WHOOPING AND CHORTLING, leading us down
          to...

                         
          THE UPPER PLAZA, where a GATHERED CROWD of Vikings and their
          dragons are cued up outside of Gobber's BLACKSMITH STALL,
          awaiting their turns. Stoick maneuvers through the crowd,
          spouting JOVIAL GREETINGS in passing.

                         
          He makes a bee-line for GOBBER, who is busily grinding a
          metal dragon tooth into shape. A Zippleback waits patiently,
          his head cocked open like a car hood while the other head
          watches, sympathetically.

                         

                          STOICK
           Any sign of him?

                         
          Gobber flips up his welding guard, revealing a matching area
          of unsoiled skin.

                         

                          GOBBER
           Ah, he's probably flown off the
           edge of the world by now. You sure
           you want that kid running the
           village? You can still delay your
           retirement.

                         

                          STOICK
           Oh, he's ready. You'll see.

                         
          A SUDDEN EXCITEMENT in the crowd heralds Hiccup and Astrid's
          return. They touch down on Toothless and Stormfly.

                         

                          STOICK (CONT'D)
           Haha! There he is!
           (to Gobber, proving his

                          POINT)
           Huh? The pride of Berk!

                         
          Hiccup stows his helmet and heads toward Stoick with urgency.

                         

                          GOBBER
           Who finally decided to show up for
           work. Yay.

                         

                          HICCUP
           Sorry. Got held up.
           (privately, to Stoick)
           Hey, Dad, could I have a word?

                         

                          STOICK
           Something you're itching to tell
           me?

                          HICCUP
           Not quite the itch you're thinking
           of, but yes.

                         
          Stoick hands him an apron and guides him to the front desk.

                         

                          STOICK
           Good man! Now, lesson one. A
           chief's first duty is to his
           people. So...

                         
          Stoick changes the rune on the "being served" placard.

                         

                          STOICK (CONT'D)
           Forty one? Forty --

                         

                          HICCUP
           Could we just talk in private for--

                         

                          STARKARD
           --That's me! That's me! I'm next!
           (pushing his way through)
           I was ahead of you! Excuse me, I've
           been here all day!

                         
          STARKARD reaches the counter, giddy with excitement.

                         

                          STARKARD (CONT'D)
           Okay, I want one of those high
           seaters, with lots of spikes and a
           big stowage compartment.

                         

                          STOICK
           Absolutely! You got it, sir!

                         
          Stoick spins Hiccup around, steering him back into the shop.

                          HICCUP
           Dad, this is actually a little more
           important than building saddles.

                         

                          STOICK
           Ah-ah! Lesson two. No task is too
           small when it comes to serving your
           people. Excuse us, Grump.

                         
          They step over the tail of a large, snoring oaf of a dragon,
          stirring him awake with a fussy start.

                         

                          GOBBER
           Grump! You let the forge die down
           again!

          Grump coughs a slug of molten lava into the forge. It
          splatters everywhere, igniting a rash of fires. Hiccup side-
          steps them as he gathers materials in the back of the stall.
          Gobber pulls the fire extinguisher, dumping water everywhere.

                         

                          GOBBER (CONT'D)
           That's it, Grump. You're going up
           for adoption!

                         
          Stoick fills a toolbox with tools from Hiccup's workbench.

                         

                          STOICK
           One of these. And this...

                         

                          HICCUP

                          DAD --

                         

                          STOICK
           -- There you go! Go on. Have away.

                         

                          HICCUP
           But, seriously, I really need to
           tell you about this new land we
           came across.

                         

                          GOBBER
           Another one?!

                         
          Fishlegs walks in, followed by the Twins and Snotlout.

                         

                          FISHLEGS
           Any new dragons?

                         
          Stoick slaps a sheet of leather onto a dragon mold, and hands
          Hiccup pencil. Exasperated, Hiccup begins tracing an outline
          as he speaks.

                          HICCUP
           We didn't stick around to find out.
           These folks weren't particularly
           friendly.

                         

                          GOBBER
           Oh, really? Your Night Fury and
           Deadly Nadder didn't bring them
           cheering to the rooftops?

                         
          Gobber spins his prosthetic arm dispenser.

                         

                          HICCUP
           No, this was different. Not the
           standard run-for-the-hills hoo-ha
           I've come to enjoy. These guys were
           trappers. Dragon trappers.

                          ASTRID
           You should've seen their fort. All
           blown apart and stuck in giant
           spikes of ice. It was weird.

                         

                          HICCUP
           I've never seen anything like it.
           And worst of all, they thought we
           did it!

                         
          Gobber pops off his prosthetic tongs and selects a wire brush
          from his dispenser...

                         

                          GOBBER
           Y'know, you two are gonna get
           yourselves in SERIOUS trouble one
           of these days. Not everyone
           appreciates this way of life.

                         
          Which he uses to brush his mustache and eyebrows.

                         
          Stoick takes the sheet of leather to the table saw...

                         

                          STOICK
           Gobber's right, son. Best we keep
           to our own. Besides, you'll have
           more important uses for your time --

                         
          And pulls a lever, starting it up.

                         

                          STOICK (CONT'D)
           (sing-songy, under his

                          BREATH)
           Once we make the big announcement!

                         
          Hiccup pulls the lever, shutting the saw down.

                          HICCUP
           They are building a dragon army.

                         
          Silence fills the stall. Vikings exchange worried glances.

                         

                          HICCUP (CONT'D)
           Or at least the guy they work for
           is. Dargo Bloody Fist or something.

                         
          Stoick's eyes widen. He turns to Gobber, with growing alarm.

                         

                          TUFFNUT
           I'll bloody his fist with my face
           if he tries to take my dragon!

                         

                          RUFFNUT
           Or mine.
           HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 23.

                         

                         

                          TUFFNUT
           You're such a moron.

                         

                          FISHLEGS
           A beautiful moron.

                         

                          SNOTLOUT
           Yeah...

                         
          Ruffnut grumbles, revolted by their advances.

                         
          Stoick grabs Hiccup by the shoulders, wide-eyed and intense.

                         

                          STOICK
           Bludvist? Drago Bludvist?

                         

                          HICCUP
           Uh, yeah. Wait. You know him?

                         

                         

          INT. BERK - DRAGON STABLES - MOMENTS LATER


                         
          Stoick rushes down a circular stone staircase into the vast,
          bustling cave that houses the dragon stables.

                         

                          STOICK

           GROUND ALL DRAGONS!

                         

                          HICCUP
           What? Why?!

                         
          Hiccup, Astrid, Gobber, and Toothless chase after Stoick.

                         

                          STOICK

           SEAL THE GATES! LOWER THE STORM

           DOORS!

                          HICCUP
           Whoa, whoa, whoa. Wait! What is
           happening?

                         

                          GOBBER
           You heard the man! Lock it down!

                         
          Behind him, the massive storm doors rattle as they're
          lowered.

                         

                          STOICK
           No DRAGON or VIKING sets foot off
           this island until I give the word!

                          HICCUP
           Because some guy you knew is
           stirring up trouble in some faraway
           land?

                         
          Stoick turns to Hiccup, gravely serious.

                         

                          STOICK
           Because Drago Bludvist is a madman.
           Without conscience or mercy. And if
           he's built a dragon army... gods
           help us all.

                         
          Stoick continues on shouting orders, leaving Hiccup stewing.

                         

                          STOICK (CONT'D)
           Get them into their pens! Quickly!

                         
          Hiccup chases around to confront Stoick.

                         

                          HICCUP
           Then let's ride back out there.
           We'll follow those trappers to
           Drago and talk some sense into him.

                         

                          STOICK
           No. We fortify the island.

                         

                          HICCUP
           It's our duty to keep the peace!

                         

                          STOICK
           Peace is over, Hiccup. I must
           prepare you for war.

                         

                          HICCUP
           War? Dad, if Drago's coming for our
           dragons, we can't wait around for
           him to get here. Let's go find him
           and change his mind.

                         

                          STOICK
           Some minds won't be changed,
           Hiccup. Berk is what you need to
           worry about.

                          (BEAT)
           A chief protects his own.

                         
          Stoick heads off, calling out more orders...

                         

                          STOICK (CONT'D)

           SECURE THE STABLES! LATCH EVERY

          ... leaving Hiccup eyeing Toothless as the storm doors close.
          Astrid approaches him, seeing the determination on his face.

                         

                          ASTRID
           Hiccup, don't.

                         

                          HICCUP
           I have to.

                         
          He gives her a quick peck on the cheek.

                         

                          STOICK

           THIS WAY! QUICKLY!

                         
          Hiccup and Toothless BLAST PAST, heading for the exit.

                         

                          STOICK (CONT'D)

           HICCUP!

                         
          They try to fly through one door, but it seals shut.

                         

                          HICCUP
           Come on!

                         
          Toothless spins around and DIVES through the gap in the
          second lowering storm door.

                         

                          STOICK
           Hiccup!

                         
          Astrid and Stormfly blow past Stoick and slip through the
          storm door before it shuts, leaving Stoick fuming.

                         

                         

          EXT. OPEN SEA - MIDDAY


                         
          (Scene 0700 - Eret's Lesson)
          Eret's ship carves a defiant path North, leaving the last
          glimpses of Lapland in its wake.

                         
          Eret stands on the bowsprit, eyeing the waves intently,
          searching the surface. He turns toward the deck, where his
          crewmen man the gunwale cannons, sights trained to the sky.

                         

                          ERET
           Keep your eyes peeled, lads! With
           this wind, we'll reach Drago by
           daybreak, so best we fill this ship
           up with dragons and quick! It's no
           time to be picky. Not if we want to
           keep our --
           HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 26.

                         

                         

                          UG
           Uh... Eret?

                         
          Eret turns in the direction Ug is pointing to see a pair of
          dragons flapping toward them.

                         

                          ERET

           HEADS! OFF THE PORT QUARTER!

                         
          The crewmen swing the net cannons toward the back-lit,
          silhouetted dragons, drawing ever closer.

                         

                          ERET (CONT'D)
           Net `em, lads! Take `em down!

                         
          Eret loads a cannon and takes aim. He spots Hiccup and Astrid
          riding the dragons. His eyes narrow, determined.

                         

                          ERET (CONT'D)
           You're not getting away this time.

                         
          Nets fly through the air. Hiccup and Astrid outmaneuver them
          and dive toward the ship, landing on the deck with a clatter.

                         

                          ERET (CONT'D)
           And here I was worried we might
           turn up empty-handed.

                         
          Astrid brandishes her axe in invitation. Hiccup indicates for
          her to lower it, then holds up his hands in surrender.

                         

                          HICCUP
           Nope. It's your lucky day. We give
           up.

                         
          Eret's crew exchange confused stares. As does Astrid.

                          HICCUP (CONT'D)
           That's one Night Fury, one Deadly
           Nadder, and...

                         
          He dismounts Toothless and tosses a net over Astrid.

                         

                          HICCUP (CONT'D)
           ... two of the finest dragon riders
           west of Luk Tuk. That oughtta make
           the boss happy, right?

                         
          Astrid grumbles. He takes her axe, hands it to Eret, and
          escorts Astrid past the men to the open live well.

                         

                          HICCUP (CONT'D)
           Excuse us.
           HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 27.

                         

                         
          He leads Astrid down the ladder. She glares at him, plainly
          hating the plan.

                         

                          ASTRID
           What are you doing?

                         
          Toothless tries to follow them, but Hiccup holds him back.

                         

                          HICCUP
           Toothless, stay.

                         
          Hiccup flips the latch, lowering the grate as Eret watches,
          confounded.

                         

                          HICCUP (CONT'D)
           The dragons don't really care for
           cramped spaces, so they'll just
           hang out with you. They won't be
           any trouble.

                         
          Eret's men nervously direct their swords and spears toward
          Toothless. HE SNARLS.

                         

                          HICCUP (CONT'D)
           Unless you do that. Wooden boat,
           big ocean. How's your swimming?

                         

                          NO-NAME
           Not good.

                         
          A burst of flame erupts from the live well, causing the
          crewmen to jump back. Hiccup thrusts his Dragon Blade through
          the grate.

                         

                          HICCUP
           Oops. Almost forgot. Can't have
           armed prisoners!

                          ASTRID
           How is this a plan?

                         
          He retracts the blade and offers it up. A crewman cautiously
          takes it, looking it over. The pommel of the hilt is
          expelling green gas.

                         

                          HICCUP
           Just what every dragon trapper
           needs. One end coats the blade in
           Monstrous Nightmare saliva. The
           other sprays Hideous Zippleback
           gas. All it takes is a spark and...

                         
          A curious crewman clicks the lighter, igniting the gas.
          Hiccup ducks as the sudden explosion sweeps over the deck.
           HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 28.

                         

                         

                          HICCUP (CONT'D)
           Oh, yeah, there you go!

                         
          Toothless paws at the embers.

                         

                          HICCUP (CONT'D)
           Once they see you as one of their
           own, even the testiest dragons can
           be trained, right, bud?

                         
          Toothless gurgles and falls over.

                         

                          ERET
           Give me that!

                         
          Eret snatches the dragon blade and HURLS it overboard.
          Stormfly bolts after it...

                         

                          ERET (CONT'D)
           What game are you playing?

                         

                          HICCUP
           No game. We just want to meet
           Drago.

                         
          And returns in a flash, dropping it at Eret's feet like a
          fetching dog, tongue wagging. Eret throws it again,
          frustrated. Stormfly returns with it just as quickly.

                         

                          ERET
           Why?

                         

                          HICCUP
           Because I'm going to change his
           mind about dragons.

                         
          Eret and his crew LAUGH. Astrid pokes out of the well.

                          ASTRID
           He can be really persuasive.

                         
          Hiccup pets Toothless, thoughtfully.

                         

                          HICCUP
           Once you've earned his loyalty,
           there is nothing a dragon won't do
           for you.

                         

                          ERET
           Puh! You won't be changing any
           minds around here.

                          HICCUP
           I can change yours. Right here.
           Right now.

                         
          Hiccup sets Toothless' tail in the locked, splayed position.
          Eret sneers, suspicious.

                         

                          HICCUP (CONT'D)
           May I?

                         
          Suddenly, Hiccup is snatched into the air! Dragons blur past.

          The crewmen SCRAMBLE to the NET CANNONS as a FLURRY OF WINGS
          streak past, GASHING holes in the sails and SLICING through
          rigging.

                         

                          ERET
           Dragon riders!

                         
          Toothless SHRIEKS and bounds up the mast, spotting Hiccup in
          the talons of a Monstrous Nightmare. Toothless relaxes,
          realizing that it's Hookfang.

                         

                          HICCUP
           Put me down! Snotlout! What are you
           doing?

                         
          Snotlout looks back to see if Ruffnut witnessed the save.

                         

                          SNOTLOUT
           See how well I protect and provide?
          Ruffnut GRUMBLES at the incessant courting. A FLYING NET
          whizzes past her head.

                         

                          TUFFNUT
           Aggh! What is with all the nets?!

                         

                          RUFFNUT
           Hey watch it! That was close...

                         
          Ruffnut spots Eret, FIRING nets from the deck of the ship.

          The net unravels in SLOW MOTION...

                         

                          RUFFNUT (CONT'D)
           Me likey.

                         
          ... enveloping Ruffnut as she yields to it, blissfully.

          As Hiccup FLIPS upside-down in the Hookfang's talons and
          KICKS off, pulling his wing-suit flaps.

                         
          Eret takes aim, but Astrid SHOVES him, throwing off the shot.

                         

                          ASTRID

           HOLD YOUR FIRE!

                         
          Hiccup glides unsteadily towards the ship and collides with
          its sail. He slides down the canvas and drops to the deck.
          Toothless lands behind him.

                         

                          HICCUP

           WHAT ARE YOU GUYS DOING HERE?!

                         
          Gobber and Grump land on the deck, scattering Eret's crew.

                         

                          GOBBER
           We're here to RESCUE you!

           I DON'T NEED to be rescued!

           STOICK (O.S.)

           ENOUGH!

                         
          The bow dips heavily as Stoick touches down on SKULLCRUSHER.
          He dismounts, fuming.

                         
          Eret blocks Stoick, cocky and confident.

                         

                          ERET
           Well, didn't you just pick the
           wrong ship, eh? I am Eret, son of --

                         
          Stoick shoves his face aside, sending Eret SLAMMING into
          Grump. Before he can react, Gobber CLUBS Eret on the head,
          sending him collapsing to the deck. Grump then sits on him,
          smothering him into submission.

          Gobber turns to the other crewmen, with a smile.

                         

                          GOBBER
           Anyone else?

                         
          Eret's men eye the Vikings, armed and flanked by their
          dragons. They set down their swords.

                         

                          GOBBER (CONT'D)
           That's what I figured.

           No.

                          STOICK

           BECAUSE WAR IS WHAT HE WANTS, SON!

                         
          Hiccup glares, frustrated.

                         
          Stoick SIGHS, realizing that he has to explain.

           Years ago, there was a great
           gathering of chieftains to discuss
           the dragon scourge we all faced.

          A hulking, cloaked figure strides confidently into fire-lit
          hall, interrupting a council meeting of Viking chieftains.
          His face is masked in silhouette.

           STOICK (V.O.)
           Into our midst came a stranger from
           a strange land, covered in scars
           and draped in a cloak of dragon
           skin. He carried no weapon and
           spoke softly, saying that he, Drago
           Bludvist, was a man of the people,
           devoted to freeing mankind from the
           tyranny of dragons.

                         
          ON STOICK, some twenty years younger, seated in a throne,
          studying the impudent stranger with suspicion.

                         

           STOICK (V.O.)
           He claimed that he alone could
           control the dragons and that he
           alone could keep us safe, if we
           chose to bow down and follow him.

                         
          The Viking council erupts in mocking laughter.

           Stupid.

                         

                          TUFFNUT
           Good one.

                         

                          STOICK
           Aye. We laughed, too...

           cloak and cried out, "Then see how
           well you do without me!"

                         
          Drago Bludvist pulls the dragon skin cloak over himself and
          marches toward the door. Above, dragon fire rips through the
          ceiling, bringing down flaming timbers, followed by dragons
          covered in heavy metallic armor. They BLAST FIRE as panic
          ensues.

                         

           STOICK (V.O.)
           The rooftop suddenly burst into
           flames, and from it, armored
           dragons descended, burning the hall
           to the ground.

           be reasoned with.

           Maybe.

                         
          Hiccup turns and stomps toward Toothless, determined. Eret
          watches intently.

                         

                          STOICK

           I'm still going to try.

                         
          Hiccup jumps onto Toothless and locks eyes with Stoick.

           This is what I'm good at. And if I
           could change your mind... I can
           change his, too.

                          (TO TOOTHLESS)
           Come on.

                         
          Toothless and Hiccup TAKE TO THE AIR, leaving everyone
          stirring in awkward silence.

                         
          Astrid mounts Stormfly, about to go after him.

           Let's go.

           NO! Lead the others back to Berk.
           I've had enough mutiny for one day.

                         
          Astrid stirs, conflicted, as Stoick stomps toward
          Skullcrusher, fuming. He passes Ruffnut, who's busily
          fondling Eret's biceps as he lays crushed under Grump.

                         

                          RUFFNUT
           Ooh, I like that.

          EXT. SKY - NIGHT

          (Scene 1100 - Ambushed!)
          Hiccup stares ahead, frustrated, as Toothless glides over a
          bed of clouds, glowing in the low, Arctic sun.
          Hiccup YELLS, then slumps back onto the saddle.
          Toothless recoils, sensitive to Hiccup's upset. The steam
          from their breath mixes in the frigid air.

                          HICCUP
           Don't worry, bud. I'm not gonna let
           anything happen to you. I promise.
          Toothless' ear plates perk up. He glances over his shoulder
          to see a disturbance in the blanket of clouds.
          A strange and arresting MASKED WARRIOR rises from the clouds,
          standing upon something unseen. Its armor and cape flap in
          the buffeting turbulence.
          The warrior eyes Toothless and Hiccup, pulling up alongside
          them. Hiccup senses the approaching figure in his periphery
          and sits up, flustered.

           AW, COME ON, DAD! REALLY?!
          He whirls around expectantly then FREEZES, mouth agape.
          The warrior stares blankly, tilting his head in curiosity
          while cutting a menacing silhouette.
          Then, just as gradually as he rose, the warrior dips back
          beneath the clouds, disappearing.

                         

                          HICCUP (CONT'D)

           Okay.

                          (TO TOOTHLESS)
           No sudden moves.
          Suddenly, the warrior EXPLODES out of the clouds before them,
          standing atop a large dragon. They circle Hiccup and
          Toothless, forcing them to TREAD AIR.

                         
          The warrior points a staff toward Hiccup, unnervingly, as he
          returns to face them.

           Hold on, hold on.
          Toothless GROWLS a warning.
          Suddenly, they're ambushed from behind. Hiccup is plucked off
          of Toothless by another DRAGON and carried off.

                          HICCUP (CONT'D)
           Toothless!
          With the tail unmanned, Toothless PLUMMETS helplessly. He
          FLAPS wildly then CRASHES through the ice into the black,
          frigid water. FLAILING and CRYING OUT, he struggles to stay
          afloat as he watches...
          Hiccup disappear into the night sky, carried off in the
          talons of the strange dragon -- one of TENS that accompany
          the warrior in a cavalcade.
          Toothless BELLOWS in distress, desperately trying to take to
          the air. As he LEAPS and CRASHES, time and again...
          A group of SPINY DORSAL FINS split the ice, carving a path
          toward Toothless.
          Beneath the ice, a pod of SEASHOCKERS approach, two-headed,
          with Manta Ray like wings GLIDING silently in the gloom.
          Fixated on Hiccup, Toothless is caught by surprise as the
          Seashockers surface and DRAG HIM UNDER.
          Hiccup's helmet bobs to the surface, marking all that
          remains.

          (Scene 1300 - Dragon Lady)

                         
          Hiccup shivers in the claws of the dragon, surrounded by the
          strange flock full of breeds he's never seen. He looks back
          for Toothless, now long gone.

                         

                          HICCUP

           HEY! YOU LEFT MY DRAGON BACK THERE!

           HE CAN'T FLY ON HIS OWN! HE'LL

           DROWN!

                         
          The warrior offers no response, seemingly immune to the cold
          as he leads the dragon flock across the polar night -- an
          alien landscape, harsh and foreboding.

          Out of the fog looms an EPIC ICE FORMATION -- jagged, spiked,
          and similar to the icy aftermath of Eret's fort, but many
          times its size.

                         
          The DRAGON ESCORT dives into its jagged folds.

                         

                         

          INT. DRAGON MOUNTAIN - CONTINUOUS


                         
          The WILD RIDE suddenly gives way to a MULTILEVEL, CAVERNOUS
          CHAMBER made of ice and columns of basalt rock. It's heavily
          populated with dragons of all kinds, looming in the shadows.

                         
          Hiccup is dropped in the center. He scrambles to his feet,
          calling out into the darkness.

                         

                          HICCUP
           We have to head back for my dragon!

                         
          A HISSING dragon CLOSES IN, sniffing, leering, aggressive.

                         
          Hiccup extends and lights his telescoping dragon blade,
          waving a swirl of fire around himself. The dragon pauses,
          intrigued, and then watches hypnotically as Hiccup pacifies
          him with calculated sweeps of the fiery blade.

                         
          The warrior watches keenly from the shadows.

                         
          Several aggressive dragons close in behind Hiccup. Hearing
          their hisses, he quickly stows the blade, replaces a
          cartridge in its hilt, then flips it around and sprays a
          perimeter of Zippleback gas around himself. He clicks the
          lighter, igniting a flash ring. The testy dragons recoil.

                         
          He then reaches through the smoke, offering his open hand.
          The dragons re-approach, sniffing him with calmed curiosity.

          ON THE WARRIOR

                         
          ... tilting his masked head, curious. He dismounts his dragon
          and approaches Hiccup.

                         

                          HICCUP (CONT'D)
           Who are you? The Dragon Thief?
           Drago Bludvist?

                         
          The warrior circles Hiccup in silence, taking in his gear,
          his dragon blade, his face.

                         

                          HICCUP (CONT'D)
           Do you even understand what I'm
           saying?

          The warrior whirls and HAMMERS his staff. In response, a
          large dragon ASCENDS from the depths, carrying...

                         

                          HICCUP (CONT'D)
           Toothless!

                         
          Toothless is dumped on the ground next to Hiccup, sopping
          wet. Hiccup rushes to him, petting him reassuringly.
          Toothless coos in relief.

                         

                          HICCUP (CONT'D)
           It's okay. I'm glad to see you,
           too, bud. You really had me worried
           there.

                         
          The warrior rattles his staff at a nearby dragon. In
          response, it and the surrounding dragons produce firelight
          from their throats, spotlighting Hiccup and Toothless.

                         
          The warrior sets down his staff and shield, then approaches
          Hiccup, cautiously and animal-like.

                         
          Toothless SNARLS and circles Hiccup defensively, but then
          instantly yields to the stranger's outstretched hand. With a
          quick, disarming gesture, the warrior lays Toothless down in
          a state of bliss. Hiccup is astounded.

                         
          The warrior's hand continues toward Hiccup's face. He
          recoils, but the warrior persists, finding the faint scar on
          Hiccup's chin, glinting in the firelight.

                         
          The warrior GASPS and retreats a few steps.

           Could it be? After all these years?
           How is this possible?

                         
          The voice is surprisingly female.

                         

                          HICCUP
           Uh, should I... should I know you?

                         

                          WARRIOR
           No. You were only a babe...

                         
          The warrior slowly removes the strange mask, revealing VALKA,
          40, beneath. Her eyes meet his, equally wide-eyed and aghast.

                         

                          VALKA

          Hiccup stammers, tongue-tied, aghast.

                         

                          VALKA (CONT'D)

          Stoick and Gobber search over the frigid waves that lap
          against the pack ice.

                         

                          STOICK
           Boar-headed! Just like his mother!
           She could never stay put either.

                         
          Gobber glances over at Stoick, who's hunched over, brow
          furrowed and solemn.

                         

                          GOBBER
           Ah, he's just twenty. And a Viking.
           I mean, could there be a worse
           combination? Ha! When I think of
           how stubborn and senseless YOU were
           back in the day... well, not much
           has changed, actually.

                         

                          STOICK
           You know what he's like. He won't
           give up, Gobber. And if Hiccup
           finds Drago, before we find him...

                         

                          GOBBER
           Bah! NOTHING can hurt Hiccup so
           long as that Night Fury's around.
           It's a Night Fury!
          Framed by a hole in the ice, a glistening object bobs on the
          surface below. Stoick squints and CIRCLES BACK, leading
          Skullcrusher in a DIVE toward it. Stoick SNAGS it out of the
          water. It's Hiccup's helmet.

                         
          Gobber pulls alongside Stoick, seeing his look of dread.
          Stoick holds the helmet out for his dragon to SMELL.

                         

                          STOICK
           Find him, Skullcrusher. Find him.

                         
          Skullcrusher SNIFFS the helmet like a bloodhound, ROARS, and
          suddenly CHANGES HEADING.

           You can't just say something like
           that and run off! You're my
           mother?! I mean, what the -- do you
           grasp how INSANE it sounds?!

          Hiccup follows her over the difficult terrain. He tries to

           Where have you been all this time?

                         
          Toothless boosts him over. Hiccup lands on the other side.

          filled with dragons of every shape and kind.

           What? No. I don't know. It's a bit
           much to get my head around, to be
           frank. It's not every day you find
           out your mother is some kind of
           crazy, feral, vigilante dragon
           lady.

                         
          Valka chuckles, and using her dragon's wing, lowers herself
          to the ground like a skilled acrobat.

           I suppose there is that...

           ... one... specific... thing...

                         
          Excited dragons rush up to greet Hiccup and Toothless. Hiccup
          pets a few, marveling at the vast dragon utopia before him.

           I don't have the words.

                         
          Toothless SNARLS in annoyance as the curious, smothering
          dragons SNIFF every part of him.

          She inspects his talons as Toothless rolls onto his back,
          nuzzling her.

                         

                          VALKA (CONT'D)
           And look, he's your age! No wonder
           you get along so well.

                         
          Hiccup smiles, astounded by Toothless' affection for Valka.
          She checks his teeth. They recede into the gums at her touch.

                         

                          VALKA (CONT'D)
           And retractable teeth? Ah!
           How did you manage to--

                         

                          HICCUP
           --I found him in the woods. He was
           shot down and wounded.

                         
          She winces and offers a sympathetic nod as she stands to
          caress a few of her own rescued dragons.

                         

                          VALKA
           This Snafflefang lost his leg to
           one of Drago Bludvist's iron traps.
           This Raincutter had her wing sliced
           by razor netting. And this poor
           Hobblegrunt was blinded by a tree
           snare... then left to die alone and
           scared.
           (re: Toothless' tail)
           And what of this? Did Drago or his
           trappers do this, too?

                          HICCUP
           Heh. Well, crazy thing is... I'm
           actually the one who shot him down.

                         
          She glares, confused.

                         

                          HICCUP (CONT'D)
           It's okay though. He got me back.
           (playfully, to Toothless)
           Right, bud? You couldn't save all
           of me, could you? You just had to
           make it even. So... peg leg!

                         
          Hiccup rattles his prosthetic leg with a smirk. Valka
          observes their playful rapport with curiosity.

                          VALKA
           What did your father think of your
           Night Fury friend?

                         

                          HICCUP
           He didn't take it all that well.

                         
          She mutters in agreement.

                         

                          HICCUP (CONT'D)
           But then... he changed. They all
           did. Pretty soon everyone back home
           had dragons of their own.

                         
          She smiles at Toothless, dismissive.

                         

                          VALKA
           If only it were possible.

                         

                          HICCUP
           No, really, I --

                         

                          VALKA
           -- Believe me, I tried, as well.
           But people are not capable of
           change, Hiccup. Some of us... were
           just born different.

                         FLASHBACK

                         
          Dragons sweep from the sky, blowing FIRE, carrying off sheep
          and dried fish. Vikings chase them down, hurling weapons.

                         

           VALKA (V.O.)
           Berk was a land of kill or be
           killed, but I believed peace was
           possible.

                         
          A Viking is about to finish off a felled dragon, but Valka
          chases up to him and tugs at his arm.

                         

                          VALKA
           Stop! You'll only make it worse!

                         
          The dragon takes wing, escaping to safety... leaving the
          Viking warrior glaring at Valka.

                         

           VALKA (V.O.)
           It was a very unpopular opinion.

          As he rushes off, Valka hears a clatter and whirls around to
          see a DRAGON (Cloudjumper) clawing its way through the roof
          of a house.

                         

                          VALKA
           Hiccup!

                         

                         

          INT. STOICK'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS


                         

                         FLASHBACK CONTINUED

                         
          Cloudjumper enters the house through the hole in the roof,
          sniffing out a baby's cradle in the corner.

                         
          Valka rushes in, panicked.

                         

           VALKA (V.O.)
           One night, a dragon broke into our
           house, finding you in the cradle.

                         
          Valka draws a sword quietly, slipping up to the dragon, only
          to find it huddled protectively over the cradle as BABY
          HICCUP innocently plays with one of its talons.

                         

           VALKA (V.O.)
           I rushed to protect you, but what I
           saw... was proof of everything I
           believed.

                         
          Valka's careful approach causes a floorboard to squeak.
          Spooked, Cloudjumper whips around to face her, accidentally
          SCRATCHING baby Hiccup's chin.

                         
          Their eyes meet. Valka lowers her sword, transfixed.

                         

           VALKA (V.O.)
           This wasn't a vicious beast, but an
           intelligent, gentle creature, whose
           soul reflected my own.

                         
          Stoick's AXE spins through the air between them, barely
          missing Cloudjumper and planting into a pillar.

                         

                          STOICK
           Valka, run!

                         
          Alarmed, Cloudjumper WHIRLS around at Stoick and BLASTS!

                         
          Stoick DIVES out of the way as the FIRE SPLATTERS against the
          wall, burning a hole and setting the room ablaze.

                         
          The dragon moves toward Stoick, but Valka grabs hold.

                          VALKA
           Don't!

                         
          It turns to face her again, locking eyes, agitated.

                         

                          STOICK
           Hold on!

                         
          Stoick dashes through the fire toward Hiccup and pulls him
          out of the cradle. He pulls his axe from the pillar...

                         

           VALKA (O.S.)
           No! Stoick!

                         
          ... but in a WHOOSH of smoke and embers, the dragon and Valka
          are GONE.

                         

                          STOICK

           VALKA!

          Stoick and baby Hiccup watch helplessly as the dragon spirits
          Valka away into the night sky.

          HICCUP'S FACE, with the matching scar.

                         

                          VALKA
           You and your father nearly died
           that night, all because I couldn't
           kill a dragon.

                         

                          HICCUP
           Yeah, it runs in the family.

                         

                          VALKA
           It broke my heart to stay away, but
           I believed you'd be safer if I did.

          Hiccup considers this, then raises his eyes to hers, seeing
          the sting of remorse.

                         

                          HICCUP
           How did you survive?

                         

                          VALKA
           Oh, Cloudjumper never meant to harm
           me. He must've thought I belonged
           here...

                         
          She leads him to the edge of raised natural terrace,
          overlooking the steamy oasis with its flowing hot spring
          waterfalls. Half-submerged in the warm lake below, a massive
          white dragon with pronounced, mammoth-like tusks rests
          benevolently on the banks, his stately countenance like that
          of a lion surrounded by his pride.

                         

                          VALKA (CONT'D)
           In the home of the great
           Bewilderbeast. The alpha species.
           One of very few that still exist.

           is king of all dragons.

                         
          Dragons land and bow reverentially to the Bewilderbeast.
          Valka gestures to the spiked ice ceiling that acts as a
          sweating greenhouse.

                         

                          VALKA (CONT'D)
           With his icy breath, this graceful
           giant built our nest. A safe haven
           for dragons everywhere.

                         
          On HICCUP, putting it together.

                          HICCUP
           Wait, that's the ice-spitter? He's
           responsible for all that
           destruction?

                         

                          VALKA
           He protects us. We all live under
           his care. And his command.

                         
          They pass an eggshell-littered NURSERY. HATCHLINGS dart out
          of it, greeting them excitedly and inciting chaos. Toothless
          is overwhelmed by their manic picking and scratching.
          Cloudjumper balks and sends them scattering.

          The hatchlings clamber on top of the Bewilderbeast and play
          on his massive tusks, despite his authority. Valka laughs.

                         

                          VALKA (CONT'D)
           ... who listen to no one.

                         
          The Bewilderbeast lets out a frosty SNORT, sending off the
          youngsters to spread more mischief.

                         
          Now awakened, The Bewilderbeast raises his gargantuan head to
          take a closer look at Hiccup, coming eye to massive eye.
          Valka bows in his presence. As does Toothless.

                         

                          VALKA (CONT'D)
           I've lived among them for twenty
           years, Hiccup, learning their ways,
           discovering their secrets...

                         
          He acknowledges Hiccup with another icy snort, slicking back
          Hiccup's hair in a frosty veneer. Valka laughs.

                         

                          VALKA (CONT'D)
           He likes you.

                         

                          HICCUP
           Wow.

                         
          She chuckles, delighting in his awe.

                         

                          VALKA
           You must be hungry.

                         

                          HICCUP
           Uh, yeah. I could eat.

                         

                          VALKA
           Good. It's feeding time.
          Toothless tucks himself beneath Cloudjumper's wing, trying to
          befriend him, but Cloudjumper isn't having any of it. He
          grimaces and follows Valka out.

           It doesn't matter what he said, if
           they've all been captured. Come on!

                         
          She flies off, determined.

                         

                         

          EXT. ICE FLOES - NIGHT


                         
          Eret's ship is beset by ice floes. The crew stirs on deck as
          he paces, grumbling, while nursing his head with a large
          chunk of ice.

                          NO-NAME
           Do we go back?

                         

                          ERET
           We've nowhere to go! Nothing to
           sell! And no heads to call our own,
           if we don't turn up with dragons
           and fast --

                         
          He's suddenly scooped up in Stormfly's talons.

                         

                          ASTRID

          Nets whiz past as Astrid and the Gang rocket out of range.

                         

                         

                          ERET
           What is this?!

                         

                          ASTRID
           A kidnapping.

                         
          Ruffnut grabs his leg, clutching him possessively.

                         

                          RUFFNUT
           Yay! Can he ride with me? Can he?
           Can he?

                         
          Both Eret and Tuffnut groan in protest.

                         

                          ASTRID
           You're gonna show us the way to
           Drago.

                         

                          ERET
           And help dragon riders sneak into

                          ASTRID
           That can be arranged. Stormfly,
           drop it.

                         
          In enthusiastic response, Stormfly pops open her talons,
          sending Eret plummeting. He wails and flails as he hurtles
          toward the ice far below.

                         

                          ASTRID (CONT'D)
           Good girl! Stormfly, fetch.

                         
          She dives after him, just as enthusiastically.
          ON ERET, terrified, as the ground rushes up at him.

                         

                          ERET

           ALL RIGHT! OKAY! I'LL TAKE YOU TO

           DRAGO!

                         
          Stormfly suddenly SNATCHES him out of his free-fall just
          before hitting the ice. Astrid giggles and cracks her
          knuckles.

          EXT. SKY - EARLY MORNING


                         
          (Scene 1600 - Momma's Boy)

                         

                         BEGIN MONTAGE

                         
          Hiccup and Toothless follow Valka and Cloudjumper over a
          majestic fjord in the long rays of the low Arctic sun.

                         
          Hiccup peers over his shoulder to see that a thick flock of
          dragons -- nearly all of Valka's rescues -- are close on
          their tail. He turns back to his mother, confused.

                         

                          HICCUP
           Hey, I thought we were going to
           eat?

                         

                          VALKA
           (with a mischievous grin)
           Oh, we are.

                         
          She directs his gaze below, where in the choppy water of the
          fjord, a group of Seashocker dragons are corralling a dense
          shoal of fish near the surface.

                         
          Suddenly, the Bewilderbeast rises from deep below, scooping
          the fish up in its vast mouth as its tusks break the surface.
          It breaches just below Hiccup and Toothless, giving them a
          fright before spitting the fish into the air and crashing
          back down into the sea.

                         
          Valka laughs at Hiccup's surprise as the hungry dragons race
          for the flailing fish, scooping them out of the air. Hiccup
          gestures to Toothless to join in and he gladly scoops up a
          mouth full.

          MONTAGE CONTINUES...

                         
          Hiccup has his map spread out in the snow, explaining the
          various lands he's discovered during his explorations.

                         

                          HICCUP
           And from Dragon Island, I found
           this archipelago...

                         
          He looks up to see that Valka is no longer next to him, but
          she has sketched out the rest of the northern land masses in
          the snow, wowing Hiccup with just how far and wide she has
          explored.

          She returned to Hiccup's side with a smile. But his amazement
          is interrupted by Toothless joining in, drawing all over
          Valka's map with a giant icicle.

                         
          Hiccup simply shrugs as his mother giggles, and Cloudjumper
          sneers.

                         

                         

          EXT. WINDSWEPT CLIFF - LATER


                         
          Valka and Hiccup rise on their dragons, carried skyward by a
          strong coastal wind that thrusts vertical up shoreline cliff.

                         
          One by one, dragons leap from the cliff and catch the strong
          updraft, popping their wings open like kites. They ride the
          wind and orbit around each other in a colorful, mesmeric
          dance. It's clearly a form of dragon play.

                         
          Hiccup, lifted off of his saddle by the force of the wind,
          laughs giddily as he watches Valka walk across Cloudjumper's
          wing and onto several others, dragon-hopping from one to
          another, until she gracefully crosses Toothless from wing tip
          to wing tip. She then drops out of sight, reappearing a
          moment later standing atop Cloudjumper. Hiccup is in utter
          awe of her.

                         
          Valka breathes in the frigid air. Lets it out blissfully.

                         

                          VALKA
           When I'm up here, I don't even feel
           the cold. I just feel...

                         

                          HICCUP
           Free.

                         
          She smiles at Hiccup. He gleams back.

                          VALKA
           This is what it is to be a dragon,
           Hiccup.

                         
          Hiccup LOCKS the pedals in the flared tail position and
          unbuckles himself. Valka watches, curious.

                         

                          HICCUP
           It's all well and good to call
           yourself a dragon.

                         
          Hiccup RUNS OFF of Toothless, pulling his stowed wings.

                         

                          HICCUP (CONT'D)
           But can you fly?

                         
          They catch the air, SNAPPING OPEN... and sending him GLIDING.
           HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 51.

                         

                         
          Valka GASPS, astonished. She flies her dragon alongside him,
          marvelling, as...

                         
          ... Hiccup SOARS, riding the wild air currents like an eagle,
          the image of freedom. Toothless descends steadily with him,
          hovering protectively.

                         
          Hiccup grins, pleased at having impressed Valka... until he
          realizes that he is once again racing toward a collision with
          a fast approaching mountain top.

                         

                          HICCUP (CONT'D)
           Oh no. Toothless!

                         
          But, with his tail locked, Toothless can't make the tight
          jackknife turn skyward to rescue Hiccup.

                         
          Realizing that they're in trouble, Valka and Cloudjumper pour
          on the speed. All four of them collide just as they reach the
          mountain top, sending them crash-landing in an explosion of
          snow.

                         
          They all TOPPLE head over tail to a messy landing on the wind-
          swept ridge and pop up LAUGHING.

                         

                          HICCUP (CONT'D)
           Man! Almost! We just about had it
           that time!

                         
          Toothless raises his snow-packed face, glowering. He tail-
          swipes Hiccup off of his feet and back into the powder.

                         
          Valka inspects Hiccup's wing suit with utter fascination.

                         

                          VALKA
           Incredible.

                          HICCUP
           Well, not bad yourself.

                         
          She caresses his cheek, staring deep into his eyes. Hiccup
          doesn't recoil this time.

                         

                          VALKA
           All this time, you took after me.
           And where was I?

                          (REMORSEFUL)
           I'm so sorry, Hiccup. Can we start
           over? Will you give me another
           chance?

                         
          Hiccup smiles, a simple acknowledgement that all is forgiven.
           HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 52.

                         

                         

                          VALKA (CONT'D)
           I can teach you all I've learned,
           these past twenty years. Like...

                         
          Valka finds a spot at the top of Toothless' neck and rubs in
          a circular pattern. In response, his dorsal blades slowly
          crack, split and extend, forming a pronounced, aerodynamic
          `V' down the length of his back and tail.

                         

                          VALKA (CONT'D)
           Now you can make those tight turns.

                         
          Toothless shudders, as if experiencing a much-needed
          chiropractic adjustment. He bounds over to Hiccup, giddily
          retracting and splaying his dorsal blades like a kid with a
          new toy.

                         

                          HICCUP
           Did YOU know about this?

                         
          Valka smiles, delighting in their mutual amazement.

                         

                          VALKA
           Every dragon has its secrets.

                         
          Toothless pounces around, showing off to Cloudjumper, who
          seems thoroughly unimpressed.

                         

                          VALKA (CONT'D)
           And I'll show them all to you.
           We'll unlock every mystery, find
           every last species, together, as
           mother and son.

                          (BEAT)
           This gift we share, Hiccup... it
           bonds us. This is who you are, son.
           Who we are. We will change the
           world for all dragons! We will make
           it a better, safer place!

                         

                          HICCUP
           That sounds... amazing.

                         
          She pulls him into a hug -- forceful, bursting with emotion.
          Hiccup hugs Valka back. They share a cathartic moment, before
          Hiccup peels away from her.

                         

                          HICCUP (CONT'D)
           This is so great! Now you and I can
           go talk to Drago -- together!

                         
          She chuckles, incredulous.

                          VALKA
           What? There's no talking to Drago.

                         

                          HICCUP
           But we have to --

                         

                          VALKA
           -- No. We must protect our own.

                         
          Hiccup stares, exasperated by the familiar line. Cloudjumper
          lumbers over, eager to be rid of Toothless' puppy-like
          energy. Valka pets him.

                         

                          VALKA (CONT'D)
           Now come on, we should be getting
           back.

                         
          Before Hiccup can say anymore, he hear heavy breathing next
          to him, and looks over to see Toothless with a gaping grin,
          clapping his dorsal blades.

          (Scene 1350 - Meet Drago)

                         
          Astrid and the gang stealthily approach a cluster of tabular
          icebergs, collapsed against each other at the mouth of a
          maze. Stormfly drops Eret to the snow, but before he can
          flee, she lands atop him and nests like a hen with her egg.

                         

                          ERET
           Agghh! Okay! I got you here, now
           get this thing off me!

                         

                          ASTRID
           Never take a toy from a dragon.
           Don't you know anything?

                         
          Stormfly crushes him in place under her weight.

                         

                          ERET

                          (STRAINED)
           Gah! Why does this keep happening
           to me?

                         
          Astrid crawls up the rising ridge to reveal...

                         
          A MASSIVE FLOTILLA, moored together like a floating camp in
          the deep water between collided icebergs.

                         
          Thick chains run deep into the water, where great blasts of
          bubbles erupt on the surface. The unseen creature rocks the
          ships. Its effect alone describes it as gargantuan.

                          ASTRID
           What's down there?

                         
          Fishlegs rifles through his note cards contained in his belt
          pouch.

                         

                          FISHLEGS
           Large diameter bubbles, massive
           lungs, cold water deep dweller, I'm
           thinking class five leviathan,
           maybe six.

                         
          Suddenly, Stormfly is alerted to an encroaching menace and
          takes wing. BLOW DARTS whiz through the air, hitting the
          other dragons. The effect is immediate -- they fall to the
          ground, unconscious. Drugged.

                         

                          HICCUP
           Meatlug! What's wrong, girl?

                         
          Eret spring to his feet and draws his blades. Astrid and the
          Gang find themselves surrounded by soldiers, camouflaged in
          polar bear furs, and poised to fire darts. They're
          outnumbered. Fishlegs raises his hands, dropping the cards.

                         

                         

          EXT. DRAGO'S SHIP - DECK - MOMENTS LATER


                         
          DRAGO BLUDVIST, a hulking figure draped in a dragon skin
          cloak, crouches over the prow of the fleet's grisly flagship,
          adorned in massive dragon bones and skulls. His scarred face
          is masked by thick, grizzled dreadlocks.

                         

           ERET (O.S.)

           DRAGO!

                         
          Drago turns to see Astrid, Eret, and the Gang being forcibly
          escorted onto the deck. Eret SHAKES HIMSELF FREE.

                         

                          ERET (CONT'D)
           Get off me!

                         
          In the background, a sledge, loaded with Hookfang, Meatlug,
          Belch and Barf -- all unconscious -- is dragged onto the deck
          by armored dragons.

                         

                          ERET (CONT'D)
           Always great to see you, my friend!
           Keeping warm up here?

                         
          The soldiers disarm him, pushing him forward as Drago
          approaches.

                          ERET (CONT'D)
           Well, as you can see, I'm right on
           time with a new batch of dragons,
           just like I promised.

                         
          Hookfang awakens, groggily shaking off the effect of the blow-
          dart. He rears as soldiers struggle to reign him in.

                         

                          SOLDIER #1
           Watch out! He's waking up! Keep him
           steady!

                         

                          SOLDIER #2
           Give me some backup here!

                         

                          DRAGO
           Drop the ropes.

                         
          They do so. Hookfang bucks and roars, chasing off the
          soldiers, then focusing on Drago as he closes in. The armored
          dragons avert their eyes and cower as Drago passes.

                         
          Hookfang HISSES a warning, but Drago approaches, undaunted.

                         
          Hookfang BLASTS. In a blur, Drago wraps himself in his dragon
          skin cloak. The sticky, napalm-like fire splatters against
          the fireproof scales, enveloping Drago in dripping flames as
          he persists forward without missing a step.

                         
          As the blast ends, Drago drops the cloak, closing in and
          holding a cold stare. Hookfang lets out a ferocious ROAR.

                         
          Drago YELLS back with a fierce, savage scream, interrupting
          Hookfang and causing him to recoil. Drago whirls his bull-
          hook overhead and STABS it into the deck planks.

                         
          Hookfang stirs, his aggression fading in the face of Drago's
          unflinching show of dominance.

                         
          After a moment, Hookfang averts his eyes and lowers his head
          in submission. Drago places his boot upon Hookfang's snout,
          pressing it into the deck planks.

                         

                          SNOTLOUT
           Hookfang!

                         

                          RUFFNUT
           Hey!

                         

                          ASTRID
           What are you doing?

                          DRAGO
           (quiet, to the dragon)
           You belong to me now.

                         

                          ERET
           And as an added bonus, I also
           caught you their riders. No extra
           charge.

                         
          Drago notices the saddle on Hookfang's back. His eyes wander
          to the saddle on Meatlug. Alarm flashes in Drago's eyes.

                         

                          ASTRID
           What?! Are you kidding me?!

                         

                          RUFFNUT
           But you were so perfect!

                         

                          ERET
           Turns out, there's a whole bunch of
           them out there. They --

                         
          In a flash, Drago stops toward Eret and seizes him by the
          throat.

                         

                          DRAGO
           How many?

                         
          As Eret chokes, stammering, Astrid whispers to the gang.

                         

                          ASTRID
           Drago doesn't have them after all.

                         

                          DRAGO

           HOW MANY?!

                         

                          ASTRID
           Hundreds! A whole island full!

                         
          His grip tightens around Eret's neck as he turns to Astrid.

                         

                          ERET
           I wouldn't worry about it. My men
           are hunting them down as we speak.
           They won't know where you're
           hiding. I promise you that.

                         
          Astrid nods a covert signal to the Gang -- she has a plan.

                         

                          ASTRID
           Oh, yes they will!

                         
          Drago drops Eret as Astrid advances, staring Drago down. Eret
          tries to signal her to stop, but it's no use.

                          DRAGO
           -- Hiccup?

                         

                          ERET
           He's not a problem. Really. Trust
           me.

                         

                          ASTRID
           He's only the son of Stoick the
           Vast...

                         
          Drago's eyes narrow upon hearing Stoick's name.

                         

                          ASTRID (CONT'D)
           ... his heir to the throne of

           Nope.

                         

                          FISHLEGS
           Sorry!

                         

                          ASTRID
           And unless you let us go, right
           now, he will blast through here on
           his Night Fury and blow your entire
           fleet of ships to splinters!

                         
          Eret slips away, trying to distance himself from the tension.

                         

                          RUFFNUT
           Then they'll be crying like babies!

           Real tiny ones...

                         
          Drago grabs Eret by the face and bears down on him.

                         

                          DRAGO
           First there was one rider. And now
           all of Berk.

                          (TO ERET)
           And YOU led them to me.

                         
          He THROWS Eret across the deck.

           You're overreacting!

                         

                          DRAGO
           And get rid of him.

          The soldiers HURL throwing knives at Eret...
          But Stormfly lands in a blur of wings, shielding Eret from

          all directions.

          Stormfly ROARS protectively, hiding Eret within her wings,

          Hiccup reattaches his flight suit while standing on a ledge
          overlooking the utopian nest, teeming with dragons. Several
          babies race in to hassle Toothless as he naps.

                         

                          HICCUP

                          (DETERMINED)
           Well, bud, we can't wait around for
           Drago to attack this place. We've
           gotta find him first. Let's go.

                         
          Suddenly, a thick hand clamps down over Hiccup's face --
          muffling his scream!

                         
          Toothless whirls around to find STOICK, towering over Hiccup.
          He calms Toothless with a touch and releases Hiccup.

                         

                          STOICK
           Easy now.

           The same way we're getting you out.

           Toothless. Come.

                         
          They hurry back into the winding corridor.

                         

                          HICCUP
           Dad! There's something you need to
           know!

                         

                          STOICK
           Yeah, yeah, tell me on the way.

                         

                          HICCUP
           This isn't an on-the-way kind of
           update, actually...

                          STOICK
           I've heard ENOUGH, Hiccup.

                         

                          HICCUP
           ... more of the earth-shattering
           development variety.

                         

                          STOICK
           Yeah, just add it to the pile.

                         

                          HICCUP
           Dad, unlike most surprises I spring
           on you, this is one you'll like. I
           promise! You just have to handle it
           delicately, so...

                         
          They round a tight bend in the corridor to find Gobber
          staring blankly at something unseen in the next chamber. He
          shuffles past Stoick and Hiccup, dazed.

                         

                          GOBBER
           Uh, you might want to take this
           one. Oh, boy.

                         
          Stoick draws his SWORD, then braves into the chamber ahead.

                         

                          HICCUP
           Dad, can you put the sword away...
           please?

                         
          Stoick GASPS as if seeing a ghost... and drops his sword with
          a clatter.

                         
          Valka stands some twenty paces ahead of him, blocking the
          path. She lets out an audible SHUDDER upon seeing him.

                         
          He removes his helmet slowly as Hiccup, Gobber, and Toothless
          appear at Stoick's side.

                         

                          VALKA

                          (RATTLED)
           I know what you're going to say,
           Stoick. How could I have done this?
           Stayed away all of these years. And
           why didn't I come back to you? To
           our son.

                         
          Stoick steps towards her, wide-eyed and speechless. Dragons
          emerge from the recesses behind Valka, hissing protectively.

                         

                          VALKA (CONT'D)
           Well, what sign did I have that you
           could change, Stoick? That anyone
           on Berk could?

                          VALKA (CONT'D)
           I pleaded so many times to stop the
           fighting, to find another answer,
           but did any of you listen?

                         

                          GOBBER
           This is why I never married.

                          (BEAT)
           This and one other reason.

                         
          Stoick continues to close the gap, mesmerized. With every
          step, Valka becomes increasingly flustered. She backs into an
          ice wall, with nowhere to go, and Stoick just a few paces
          away.

                         

                          VALKA

                          (TEARFUL)
           I know that I left you to raise
           Hiccup alone... but I thought he'd
           be better off without me. And I was
           wrong, I see that now, but...

                         
          Stoick gently reaches a hand toward her face.

                         

                          VALKA (CONT'D)
           Oh stop being so stoic, Stoick. Go
           on... SHOUT, SCREAM, SAY SOMETHING!

                         

                          STOICK
           You're as beautiful as the day I
           lost you.

                         
          His words snuff her retort, rendering her speechless. She
          softens despite herself, yielding her cheek to his palm. He
          caresses her skin as a reluctant tear runs through his
          fingers. He PULLS her into a KISS. She resists briefly, then
          gives in. The surrounding dragons softly RETREAT in kind.
          Hiccup gapes, warmed by the sight of his parents reunited.

                         

                         

          EXT. ICE CHANNEL - DAY


                         
          (Scene 1750 - Eret's Turn)

                         
          Drago's massive flagship leads the flotilla, pulled along
          forcefully by whatever's at the other end of the enormous
          chain.

                         
          Drago WHACKS the chain with his bullhook, spurring it
          forward.

                         

          ON DRAGO'S SHIP

          Eret, Astrid, and the Gang are escorted to the stern,
          surrounded by several of Drago's soldiers. Wrists bound.
          Spear tips pressed into their backs.

                         

                          SNOTLOUT
           Could this day get any worse?

                         

                          TUFFNUT
           Uh, let me see. You'll jump into
           freezing cold water and then die
           from drowning.

                         
          They reach the gang plank. Eret peers overboard at the deep,
          icy water below.

                         

                          ERET
           Looks refreshing.

                         
          He turns to Astrid, meeting her glare with mock chivalry.

                         

                          ERET (CONT'D)
           Please, ladies first.

                         
          A pair of soldiers GRAB Astrid by the arms.

                         

                          ASTRID
           You are a steaming heap of dragon --

                         

                          ERET
           -- Duck.

                         
          Eret WHIRLS around, ROUND-HOUSING both soldiers. They GO
          DOWN, heavily.

                         
          He catches one of their spears with his bound hands and
          slices his ropes free. They fall away as he catches the other
          spear, twirling both in invitation.

                          SOLDIER
           Warn the others!

                         
          One soldier runs to send up the alarm... while the last two
          raise BLOW DART TUBES.

                         
          Eret SWIPES the first off of his legs, sending the dart into
          the neck of the second.

                         

                          RUFFNUT
           Get `em, you son of an Eret!

                         
          As the downed soldiers SCRAMBLE to their feet, Fishlegs FALLS
          OVER, CRUSHING them under his weight.

          Eret CATCHES the falling tube from the second soldier and
          BLOWS the dart at the fleeing third. The soldier DROPS,
          unconscious -- just shy of the Captain's Quarters.

                         

                          RUFFNUT (CONT'D)
           Okay, I love you again.

                         
          Ruffnut skips past Snotlout on her way to Eret. Snotlout
          watches, crestfallen.

                         

                          TUFFNUT
           Ugh. Pathetic. You can still jump.

                         
          Eret avoids Ruffnut and turns to Astrid.

                         

                          ERET
           So? Are we going to save your
           dragons and get out of here or not?

                         
          Astrid narrows her eyes, not knowing what to make of him. He
          reclaims his sword and dagger from the unconscious soldier
          who took them and cuts Tuffnut free.

                         

                          ERET (CONT'D)
           Check every trap. They're here
           somewhere.

                         

                         

          EXT. DRAGO'S SHIP - MOMENTS LATER


                         
          Astrid slips under a tarp and cranks open a metal trap. She
          peers between its massive iron teeth, discovering Meatlug
          within, bound and chained to its base as bait.

                         

                          ASTRID
           Meatlug?

                         ON ERET

                         
          Carefully cranking another trap, wincing at the sound. The
          iron jaws of the trap open wider with every CLICK.

                         

                          ERET
           Anyone coming?

                         
          Ruffnut "stands guard," fixated on Eret's rippling biceps.

                         

                          RUFFNUT
           I don't know. You just keep doing
           what you're doing. Keep crankin'...

                         
          Eret squeezes between the cocked teeth, finding Stormfly
          within, muzzled and chained. She looks up at Eret, calming
          immediately. He pauses, then approaches slowly.

          Eret carefully reaches out and strokes Stormfly's muzzle.

                         

                          ERET
           Thank you for saving my life.

                          (BEAT)
           Now let me return the favor.

                         

                         

          INT. DRAGON MOUNTAIN - VALKA'S LIVING QUARTERS - LATE


                         AFTERNOON

                         
          (Scene 1850 - The Last Dance)

                         
          As Toothless and Cloudjumper hover for scraps, Stoick and
          Valka prepare skewers of fish. She's overwhelmed, lost in her
          thoughts, and covering it up poorly.

                         

                          HICCUP
           Mom, you'd never recognize it!
           Where we used to make weapons, we
           now build saddles, wing slings --
           we even fix dragon teeth! You
           wouldn't believe how much
           everything's changed!

                         
          Valka offers a skittish half-smile and hands him a plate.

                         

                          STOICK
           Our son's changed Berk for the
           better. I think we did well with
           this one, Val.

                         

                          HICCUP
           Thanks, Dad.

                         
          Stoick places his hands on Valka's shoulders. She flinches,
          dropping the plate.
          Cloudjumper steals the fish before Toothless can get to it.
          Toothless whimpers, and as a sign of acceptance, Cloudjumper
          regurgitates the fish so Toothless can have some.

                         

                          VALKA
           I'm... a little out of practice.

                         

                          STOICK

                          (SWEETLY)
           Well, y'know... I didn't marry you
           for your cooking.

                         

                          GOBBER
           (to Hiccup and Grump)
           I hope not. Her meatballs could
           kill more beasts than a battle axe.

           I've still got a few knocking
           around in here. Ha ha!

                         
          Gobber takes a bite, gags, and dump the entire plate of fish
          skewers into Grump's mouth like a trash can.

                         

                          HICCUP
           And once you move back in, with all
           of your dragons, Drago won't even
           stand a chance. Everything will be
           okay!

                         
          Stoick can see that Valka is overwhelmed. He lays a hand upon
          Hiccup's shoulder, calming him.

                         

                          STOICK
           Slow down, son. It's a lot to take
           in.

                         

                          HICCUP
           Oh. Gotcha.

                         
          Valka crosses the room to fill a flask with water, back
          turned to the group, as Stoick eyes her sympathetically. He
          decides on a different approach... and whistles a familiar
          tune.

                         
          ON VALKA, as her eyes widen, stirred, recognizing the melody.
          She turns away from Stoick, as the water overflows from the
          flask.

                         

                          GOBBER
           Oh, I love this one!

                         
          Stoick approaches her delicately.

                         

                          STOICK

                          (WHISPERED)
           Remember our song, Val?

                         
          Hiccup watches him, curious, as Stoick FUMBLES THROUGH THE
          FIRST VERSE of an old Viking courting song:

                         

                          STOICK (CONT'D)

                          (SINGING SOFTLY)
           I'll swim and sail on savage seas,
           with ne'er a fear of drowning. And
           gladly ride the waves of life, if
           you will marry me.

                         
          Valka avoids his gaze, wallowing in a mess of emotions.

                          STOICK (CONT'D)

                          (SINGING)
           No scorching sun, nor freezing cold

                          WILL --

                         

                          GOBBER

                          (SINGING)
           -- will stop me on my journey!
           (catching himself,

                          EMBARRASSED)
           Sorry.

                         
          Stoick scowls at him, then returns his attention to Valka.

                         

                          STOICK

                          (SINGING)
           If you will promise me your
           heart...

                         
          Stoick pauses, setting Valka up for her part of the duet.

                         

                          STOICK (CONT'D)
           And love...

                         
          Stoick hangs eagerly, awaiting her words, but Valka closes
          her eyes, rejecting his invitation. He lets out a heavy-
          hearted sigh. But nostalgia gets the better of Valka. She
          softly SINGS HER PART:

                         

                          VALKA

                          (SINGING)
           And love me for eternity.

                         
          Stoick beams. She brushes past him, setting into the center
          of the chamber and holding her forearm aloft in invitation.
          Stoick crosses his forearm against hers, initiating a
          beautiful dance to accompany the song.

                          VALKA (CONT'D)

                          (SINGING)
           My dearest one, my darling dear,
           you mighty words astound me. But
           I've no need of mighty deeds, when
           I feel your arms around me.

                         
          The dance is full of charming missteps as Stoick and Valka
          recreate a moment from their past, before Hiccup's wonder-
          struck eyes.

                         

                          STOICK

                          (SINGING)
           But I would bring you rings of
           gold. I'd even sing you poetry.

                          STOICK (CONT'D)
           And I would keep you from all harm,
           if you'd stay here beside me.

                         

                          VALKA

                          (SINGING)
           I have no use for rings of gold. I
           care not for your poetry. I only
           want your hand to hold. I only want
           you near me.

                         
          Gobber can't help himself. He drags Hiccup onto his feet so
          that he can join in the dancing, too.

                         

                          GOBBER
           C'mon, Hiccup!

                         

           VALKA, STOICK, & GOBBER

                          (SINGING)
           To love and kiss, to sweetly hold.
           For the dancing and the dreaming.
           Through all life's sorrows and
           delights, I'll keep your love
           inside me.

                         
          Hiccup is amazed by the sight of his giddy parents, spinning
          and laughing in each others' arms, reunited.

                         

           VALKA, STOICK, & GOBBER (CONT'D)

                          (SINGING)
           I'll swim and sail through savage
           seas, with ne'er a fear of
           drowning. And gladly ride the waves
           of life, if you will marry me!

                         
          Gobber carries the last note...

                         

                          GOBBER

                          (SINGING)
           I'm still going...

                         
          Hiccup taps him.

                         

                          HICCUP
           Gobber!

                         

                          GOBBER
           I'm done.

                         
          Valka and Stoick slow to a stop, WINDED and LAUGHING.

                         

                          STOICK
           Ah... I thought I'd have to die
           before we'd have that dance again.

                          VALKA
           No need for drastic measures.

                         

                          STOICK
           For you, my dear... anything.

                         
          She smiles sweetly. Stoick's eyes well with tears. He goes
          down on one knee, proposing to her anew.

                         

                          STOICK (CONT'D)
           Will you come home, Val? Will you
           be my wife once again?

                         
          Toothless nudges Valka closer to Stoick. They laugh as Hiccup
          joins them. Stoick throws his arm around him.

                         

                          STOICK (CONT'D)
           We can be a family! What do you
           say?

                         
          Valka, between tears and laughter, turns to Hiccup.

                         

                          VALKA
           Yes!

                         
          Gobber pops his head in.

                         

                          GOBBER
           Great! I'll do the cooking!

                         
          They laugh.

                         

                          STOICK
           Thank Odin you didn't listen to me,
           son. We never would have found each
           other.
          Suddenly, Toothless and Cloudjumper suddenly perk up, sensing
          something unheard. Hiccup notices.

                         

                          HICCUP
           Toothless?

                         
          Dragons SWARM past Valka's chamber, racing toward some
          unknown disturbance.

                         

                          HICCUP (CONT'D)
           What's happening?

                         
          They're answered by subsequent HEAVY BOOMS that reverberate
          through the fortress.

          EXT. DRAGON MOUNTAIN - MOMENTS LATER


                         
          (Scene 1900 - Surprise Guests)

                         
          Valka rushes out to find...

                         
          DRAGO'S ARMADA in the lagoon below and his forces of
          thousands now landed upon the beach.

                         
          They launch catapults and ballistas into the icy spires,
          gaining entrance into the mountain's tunnels.

                         
          Hiccup, Stoick, and Gobber catch up to Valka.

                         

                          HICCUP
           Oh, no...

                         
          Valka tries to hurry off, fuming. Stoick stops her.

                         

                          STOICK
           Val! It's all right, it's all
           right. We're a team now.

                          (BEAT)
           Now what do you want to do?

                         
          She glances from Hiccup to Stoick.

                         

                          VALKA
           We have to save the dragons.

                         

                          STOICK

                          (DETERMINED)
           Aye. You got it!

                         
          He throws an arm around Hiccup.

                         

                          STOICK (CONT'D)
           Come on, son.

                         

          ON THE BATTLEFIELD

                         
          VALKA'S DRAGONS SWOOP down to engage the attackers, picking
          up soldiers and carrying them off while Drago stands in the
          line of fire, unflinching.

                         
          The catapults continue to bring down the icy defenses of
          dragon mountain. Drago's men pour into the tunnels. 

                         

                          DRAGO
           Whatever comes, keep hitting the
           mountain! We need to draw the alpha
           out.

          Drago's armored DRAGON ARMY takes wing, clashing with Valka's
          dragons in the skies.

                         

                          DRAGO (CONT'D)
           Ready the traps!

                         
          Iron jaws are opened like bear traps, revealing screeching
          `bait' dragons within. Valka's dragons swoop down to rescue
          them, only to be SNAPPED UP in the fearsome jaws.

                         
          A second set of traps are cocked open, but instead of dragon
          cries, ZIPPLEBACK GAS seeps out... followed by an EXPLOSION.
          The TWINS rocket out of the trap, riding BARF and BELCH.

                         

                          TUFFNUT
           Surprise! Yeah!

                         

                          DRAGO

           WHAT?!

                         
          They're joined by Astrid and the rest of the GANG, bursting
          out of the traps atop Meatlug and Hookfang.

                         
          Eret comes flying out last, WAILING aboard Stormfly. He
          struggles to hold on, as she rejoins Astrid (riding Meatlug,
          along with Fishlegs). He gives them a sheepish shrug.

                         

                          ASTRID
           You really are full of surprises.

                         
          She leaps onto Stormfly, steadying them.

                         

                          ASTRID (CONT'D)
           Let's go!

                         
          Together they rocket across the sky...

                          TUFFNUT
           Dragon Riders coming through!

                         
          And DIVE-BOMB the traps, setting them aflame. The yokes and
          leather bindings restraining the bait dragons are
          incinerated, freeing them to fly away, unharmed.

                         

                          DRAGO

           CUT THEM DOWN!

                         
          Projectiles are launched, one of which KNOCKS Ruffnut off her
          dragon. She PLUMMETS past Eret toward the rocky shore below.

                         

                          RUFFNUT
           Eret, son of Eret!

                         
          She suddenly grabbed by both arms before hitting the rocks.

          RUFFNUT'S POV: of Snotlout on one side... and Fishlegs on the
          other. SOFT and ROMANTICIZED as her epiphany dawns.

                         
          Above them, more catapults fire, bringing down massive spires
          of ice, directly over Astrid and Eret.

                         

                          ASTRID
           Up, girl! To the left, Eret! That's
           it! Look out!

                         
          It's about to crush them when... it's BLOWN TO PIECES by
          Toothless' fireball. Hiccup, Stoick, and Gobber come bursting
          through the flames on their dragons.

                         
          Hiccup and Toothless arc across the sky triumphantly and set
          their sights on a downed dragon surrounded by soldiers.

                         
          Toothless BLASTS one of Drago's net launchers, knocking it
          onto its side. Stoick then CHOPS the trigger line, FIRING the
          catapult and NETTING the throng of soldiers, freeing the
          dragon.

                         
          Drago's ARCHERS target Stoick with their arrows.

                         

                          ARCHER
           Take `em down!

                         

                          GOBBER
           Heads up!

                         
          Gobber flies up from behind, KNOCKING the archers out with
          Grump's tail. Gobber chuckles.

                         
          DRAGO hears Toothless' tell-tale BANSHEE scream and turns to
          see him streaking across the sky.

                         

                          DRAGO
           Dragon Master.

                         
          Hiccup catches up to Astrid and Eret on Stormfly.

                         

                          HICCUP
           Welcome aboard, dragon rider!

           Thanks. I think.

                         
          Astrid glares, both relieved and annoyed to see Hiccup.

                         

                          ASTRID
           Where have you been?

                         

                          HICCUP
           Oh, y'know. Catching up with Mom.

          Astrid shoots him a confused glare. He nods skyward. Astrid
          and Eret look up to see...

                         
          VALKA, in full warrior garb, rising from the towering ice
          spikes, atop Cloudjumper.

                         

                          ERET
           Whoa...

                         
          An earth-trembling roar follows as the Bewilderbeast rises
          behind Valka.

                         

                          ASTRID
           That's your mother?!

                         

                          HICCUP
           Well, now you know where I get my
           dramatic flair.

                         
          ON DRAGO, gawking in awe as the great BEWILDERBEAST BLASTS
          an epic explosion of ice upon the attackers.

                         

                          DRAGO
           The alpha! Now we have a fight!

                         
          Valka blasts overhead on Cloudjumper, commanding swarms of
          dragons to swoop down and attack Drago's army. A swarm of
          Zipplebacks set themselves aflame and roll like fiery wagon
          wheels through the battlefield, scattering soldiers and
          destroying war machines.

                         
          One of them gets CAUGHT under a Dragon Swatter, but Hiccup
          and Toothless double-back for a rescue.

                         

                          HICCUP
           There! Come on, Toothless! Show
           them what you got, bud.
          Toothless dive-bombs the swatter and DESTROYS it with a
          plasma bolt, freeing the dragon.

                         

                          HICCUP (CONT'D)
           Thatta boy!

                         
          BACK TO VALKA, on Cloudjumper as they pry Drago's armored
          dragons off of the flailing wild ones. A net suddenly
          envelops Cloudjumper. They CRASH heavily, but Valka cuts
          herself free, sliding to a stop just paces away from Drago.

                         

                          DRAGO
           I've waited a long time for this!

                         
          Drago cocks his bull hook, ready to strike, but Valka
          deflects Drago's hit and attacks him.
           HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 73.

                         

                         

                          VALKA
           You cannot take our dragons! They
           are controlled by the alpha!

                         

                          DRAGO

                          (SMUG)
           Then it's a good thing I brought a
           challenger.

                         
          He turns to the flagship and YELLS savagely, whirling his
          bullhook overhead.

                         
          The heavy chains are released. The underwater creature, now
          freed, breaks the surface in an epic cascade of seawater. It
          rises toward the shoreline, revealing itself to be...

                         
          A SECOND BEWILDERBEAST -- bigger, meaner, and covered in
          scars that indicate years of training and abuse. The chains
          fall away from iron cuffs fastened to its massive tusks.

                         
          Valka GASPS.

                         

                          HICCUP

                          (HORRIFIED)
           Another one?

                         

                          FISHLEGS

           I WAS WAY OFF! THAT IS A CLASS TEN!

           CLASS TEN!

                         
          Drago's challenger lumbers onto the beach, focused on Valka's
          Bewilderbeast.

                         

                          VALKA
           No. No.

                         

                          DRAGO
           Come on! Take down the alpha!

                         
          Valka attacks Drago with her bullhook, trying to stop his
          commands, but Drago strikes back, knocking her forcefully
          onto her back. He pins her as she struggles, removing her
          mask and staff. He's about to finish her off, when WHAM! He's
          knocked to the ground. He looks up, fuming, to see Stoick
          helping Valka to her feet.

                         

                          VALKA
           Thank you.

                         

                          STOICK
           For you, my dear... anything.

          As Drago gathers his weapon and drops his heavy cloak,
          circling Stoick, Drago's Bewilderbeast confronts Valka's in a
          threat display.

                         

                          STOICK (CONT'D)
           Val, do you think you can stop
           them?

                         

                          VALKA
           I'll do my best! Come on,
           Cloudjumper!

                         
          Valka cuts the nets away and hops onto Cloudjumper, flying
          off toward the Bewilderbeasts as they charge each other,

          CLASHING TUSKS.

                         
          Drago LUNGES at Stoick, SWIPING his bullhook.

                         

                          DRAGO
           You... I watched you burn!

                         
          The two imposing warriors CLASH WEAPONS, SLASHING and LANDING

          PUNCHES.

                         

                          STOICK
           It takes more than a little fire to
           kill me!

                         
          Valka flies between the Bewilderbeasts, waving her staff
          commandingly, but to no effect.

                         

          BACK TO STOICK AND DRAGO

                         
          As Drago hooks and yanks the axe out of Stoick's hands.
          Gobber flies by and HURLS his mace attachment.

                         

                          GOBBER
           Stoick!

                         
          Stoick catches it and lands a direct hit on Drago.

                         
          But, with a devastating SWIPE, DRAGO's Bewilderbeast takes
          down Valka's, plunging in its tusks and burying its
          opponent's lifeless body under an avalanche.

                         

                          VALKA
           No!

                         
          Hiccup and the others watch in horror as dragons everywhere
          land and bow their heads in acknowledgement of the new alpha -

          - DRAGO'S ALPHA.

                         

                          DRAGO
           We've won.
           HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 75.

                         

                         
          Drago points his bullhook toward Valka and Cloudjumper.

                         

                          DRAGO (CONT'D)
           Now finish her!

                         
          Stoick whirls around, spotting Valka and Cloudjumper in the
          alpha's sights.

                         

                          STOICK
           No!

                         
          Drago's Bewilderbeast INHALES... and BLASTS! Valka steers
          Cloudjumper out of the way, but ice HITS his tail, causing
          them to SPIRAL out of control toward the icy spires.

                         

                          STOICK (CONT'D)
           Hold on!

                         
          He LEAPS onto Skullcrusher, spurring him into the air.

                         

                          STOICK (CONT'D)
           Skullcrusher, go! Come on, Gobber!

                         
          Stoick tosses the mace back to Gobber in passing, who follows
          brazenly, waving it aloft.

                         

                          GOBBER
           Right behind ya, Stoick!

                         

                         

          EXT. DRAGON MOUNTAIN - CONTINUOUS


                         
          (Scene 2000 - Stoick's Sacrifice)

                         
          With his tail impaired, Cloudjumper struggles against a
          throng of oncoming dragons. Valka is knocked off, but manages
          to cling to her dragon's neck.
          As she loses her grip and FALLS...

                         
          Stoick LEAPS from Skullcrusher and CATCHES Valka. He sinks
          his axe into an icy column, and they slide to a safe landing.
          Drago's Bewilderbeast presses closer, sniffing them out.

                         
          BACK TO HICCUP, spotting Drago on the battlefield, commanding
          the Bewilderbeast to finish the job.

                         

                          HICCUP
           STOP! Stop!

                         
          Hiccup lands Toothless a few paces from Drago and brazenly
          removes his helmet. Drago eyes him, incredulous, then begins
          to CHUCKLE.
           HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 76.

                         

                         

                          DRAGO
           This... is the great dragon master?
           The son of Stoick the Vast? What
           shame he must feel.

                         
          Toothless snarls, ready to blast, but Hiccup calms him with a
          hand gesture.

                         

                          HICCUP
           All of this loss, and for what? To
           become unstoppable? To rule the
           world?

                         
          Drago smirks and turns away from Hiccup.

                         

                          HICCUP (CONT'D)
           Dragons are kind, amazing creatures
           that can bring people together.

                         

                          DRAGO
           Or tear them apart.

                         
          Drago LAUGHS mockingly, then removes his FALSE ARM, revealing
          a stump at his shoulder. Hiccup is taken aback.

                         

                          DRAGO (CONT'D)
           You see, I know what it is to live
           in fear. To see my village burned,
           my family taken.

                         
          He reattaches the prosthesis, circling Hiccup menacingly.

                         

                          DRAGO (CONT'D)
           But even as a boy, left with
           nothing, I vowed to rise above the
           fear of dragons and liberate the
           people of this world.

                          HICCUP
           Then why a dragon army?

                         

                          DRAGO
           (grinning, smug)
           Well, you need dragons to conquer
           other dragons.

                         

                          HICCUP
           Or maybe you need dragons to
           conquer people.

                          (BEAT)
           To control those who follow you...
           and to get rid of those who won't.
           HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 77.

                         

                         

                          DRAGO
           Clever boy.

                         
          Drago grabs his bullhook and re-approaches Hiccup. Toothless
          readies himself.

                         

                          HICCUP
           The world wants peace. And we have
           the answer, back on Berk. Just let
           me show you.

                         

                          DRAGO
           NO! Let ME show YOU.

                         
          Drago SHRIEKS madly, summoning the Bewilderbeast. Toothless
          circles Hiccup, protectively.

                         
          ON THE BEWILDERBEAST, about to blast Stoick and Valka. It
          hears Drago's distant wails, and approaches obediently.

                         

                          STOICK
           What...?

                         
          Stoick follows its stare to the distant battlefield below. He
          spots Hiccup and Toothless a few paces from Drago.

                         

                          STOICK (CONT'D)

                          (PANICKED)
           Hiccup!

                         
          He rushes off. Valka follows, racing past Gobber as he
          finally joins them, winded from having run up the mountain.

                         

                          STOICK (CONT'D)
           Come on, Gobber!

                         

                          GOBBER
           Okay, change of plans.

                         
          He hurries back down the mountain after them.

                         

          BACK TO DRAGO

                         
          jabbing his bullhook into the ground commandingly. The
          Bewilderbeast flinches and stops, submissive.

                         

                          DRAGO
           No dragon can resist the alpha's
           command. So he who controls the
           alpha, controls them all.

          Drago points to Toothless. The Bewilderbeast stares and
          HISSES, forcing Toothless to cower under a hypnotic
          ultrasonic broadcast. Toothless struggles against the alpha's
          command, writhing and grinding his head against the ground.

                         

                          HICCUP
           Toothless? You okay, bud? What's
           going on?

                         
          Toothless fights the command, shaking his head in protest.
          The Bewilderbeast insists, with a mesmerizing glare and a
          low, throaty grumble... until Toothless finally succumbs to
          its control. He raises his head, his stare vacant and
          robotic, as his pupils turn to slits.

                         
          Drago then points to Hiccup. The Bewilderbeast responds,
          HISSING again at Toothless.

                         

                          DRAGO
           Witness true strength. The strength
           of will over others. In the face of
           it, you are nothing.

                         
          Toothless slowly turns to face Hiccup. Advancing.

                         

                          HICCUP
           Uh, what did he just tell you?

                         

                         ON STOICK

                         
          Bounding across the ice, pushing himself to make it to Hiccup
          in time.

                         

          BACK ON HICCUP

                         

                          HICCUP (CONT'D)
           Toothless, what's the matter with
           you? What're you doing?

                         
          Hiccup is backed against fallen ice, with Toothless advancing
          mindlessly, and nowhere to run.

                         
          Toothless opens his yawning mouth. Gas seeps from his throat.

                         

                          HICCUP (CONT'D)
           Knock it off! Stop! Snap out of it!

                         
          Stoick barrels through ice formations and over war machines,
          racing against time.

                         

                          HICCUP (CONT'D)
           Toothless! No! Toothless! Don't!
           HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 79.

                         

                         

                          STOICK
           Hiccup!

                         

                          HICCUP

           STOP!

                         

                          STOICK

           SON!

                         
          Hiccup sees Stoick about to run into the fray.

                         

                          HICCUP

           DAD! NO!

                         
          Toothless BLASTS.

                         
          Stoick leaps in front of it, shoving Hiccup out of the way
          and absorbing the blast in the process. He's thrown against
          the ice with great impact.

                         
          ON VALKA, hearing the blast, horrified.

                         
          Drago glances back, seeing Stoick laying lifeless in the
          aftermath, pleased by the sudden turn of events. He shuffles
          off, satisfied.

                         
          Stunned, Hiccup comes to and sees Stoick in the rubble. He
          rushes past the still-entranced Toothless, straining to
          scatter the ice boulders on top of Stoick's body.

                         

                          HICCUP (CONT'D)
           Dad!

                         
          Valka arrives, winded and aghast.

                         

                          VALKA
           Stoick...
          She helps Hiccup to turn Stoick's body over. Valka presses
          her ear to Stoick's heart, confirming his death with a mere
          glance to Hiccup. He tears up, overwhelmed.

                         

                          HICCUP
           No... you...

                         
          Gobber, Astrid, Eret, and the Gang arrive, slack-jawed.

                         
          Satisfied, the Bewilderbeast turns away, releasing Toothless
          of the trance-like state. Toothless blinks, coming to and
          confused. He approaches the group, sniffing Stoick's hand.
          Hiccup SHOVES him.

                         

                          HICCUP (CONT'D)
           No! Get away from him!

          Toothless recoils, innocently.

                         

                          HICCUP (CONT'D)

           GO ON! GET OUT OF HERE! GET AWAY!

                         
          Toothless retreats like a scolded dog, ear plates back and
          head hung low. Valka watches, broken-hearted, as Hiccup falls
          upon Stoick, inconsolable.

                         

                          VALKA
           It's not his fault. You know that.

                         
          On the battlefield, the alpha BELLOWS, calling all of the
          dragons to gather. Meatlug, Stormfly, Hookfang and the others
          all follow the command as the Gang calls after them.

                         

           VALKA (O.S.) (CONT'D)
           Good dragons under the control of
           bad people do bad things.

                         
          Drago notices Toothless tumble down a snow-bank, once again
          slit-eyed and entranced, but unable to fly to the alpha
          without a rider. Drago pins him down, eyeing the saddle,
          pedals, and prosthetic tail.

                         
          ON HICCUP and VALKA

                         
          In tears as Toothless rises into view, with Drago in the
          saddle.

                         

                          DRAGO

           GATHER THE MEN AND MEET AT BERK!

                         
          His soldiers cheer in the thousands.

                         

                          HICCUP
           Toothless!
          Hiccup tries to go after Toothless, but Valka holds him back.

                         

                          VALKA
           No, don't!

                         
          Drago JABS his bull hook and points toward the horizon. The
          alpha BELLOWS, commanding an exodus as it leads the way.

                         

                          DRAGO
           Move out!

                         
          Hiccup watches, powerless as all dragons TAKE WING and
          follow.

          EXT. DRAGON MOUNTAIN - LAGOON - DUSK


                         
          (Scene 2100 - Viking Funeral)

                         
          A KEEL grinds against the shoreline pebbles as a listing,
          battered ship is pushed into the still iceberg-filled lagoon.

                         

           GOBBER (V.O.)
           May the Valkyries welcome you, and
           lead you through Odin's great
           battlefield. May they sing your
           name with love and fury, so that we
           might hear it rise from the heights
           of Valhalla... and know that you've
           taken your rightful place at the
           table of kings.

                         
          Bows and pitch-dipped arrows are gathered from the
          battlefield. Gobber hands a set to Hiccup, meeting his eyes
          with sympathetic glance.

                         

           GOBBER (V.O.)
           For a great man has fallen. A
           warrior. A chieftain. A father. A
           friend.

                         
          Hiccup dips his arrowhead in a smoldering chunk of wreckage,
          igniting the pitch that coats the tip.

                         
          He releases his arrow, which sails through the air and lands
          on the deck of the ship, where Stoick is laid out on a pyre,
          covered by a sail, his axe upon his chest.

                         
          The others follow Hiccup's lead. They DRAW BACK in unison and
          LOOSE their arrows, filling the sky with crisscrossing,
          flaming streaks. They arc over the lagoon and set the ship
          alight.
          ON HICCUP, fighting back emotion and losing the battle.

                         

                          HICCUP
           I'm sorry, Dad.

                         
          He eyes the engulfed ship.

                         

                          HICCUP (CONT'D)
           I'm not the chief that you wanted
           me to be. And I'm not peacekeeper I
           thought I was. I don't know...

                         
          Valka watches him, her heart breaking. She steps forward.
           HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 82.

                         

                         

                          VALKA
           You came early into this world. You
           were such a wee thing. So frail, so
           fragile. I feared you wouldn't make
           it.

                         
          Hiccup lowers his eyes, but Valka lifts his chin.

                         

                          VALKA (CONT'D)
           But your father... he never
           doubted. He always said you'd
           become the strongest of them all.

                          (BEAT)
           And he was right.

                          (BEAT)
           You have the heart of a chief and
           the soul of a dragon. Only you can
           bring our worlds together. That is
           who you are, son.

                         
          Hiccup meets her bolstering stare. He turns to the ship and
          watches it in silence, silhouetted in its glow.

                         

                          HICCUP
           I was so afraid of becoming my dad.
           Mostly because I thought I never
           could. How do you become someone
           that great? That brave? That
           selfless?

                          (BEAT)
           I guess you can only try.
           (to the others)
           A chief protects his own. We're
           going back.

                         

                          TUFFNUT
           Uh, with what?

                          RUFFNUT
           He took all the dragons.

                         

                          HICCUP
           Not all of them.

          WHOOSH! WHOOSH! WHOOSH! JUVENILES BLUR past, like flying
          raptors, ZIGZAGGING wildly.

                         
          Riding bareback, Hiccup & Co. HURTLE through the narrow ICE
          CHANNELS -- created by massive splits in the iceberg shelves.

                          RUFFNUT
           Fly straight!

                         

                          FISHLEGS
           I don't want to die!

                         

                          TUFFNUT
           We can't fly these things!

                         

                          FISHLEGS
           Yeah, no kidding!

                         
          Fishlegs barrels into a snow bank, sending several chunks
          right into Eret's face as rides inverted and HOLLERING.

                         

                          ASTRID
           But won't that Bewilderbeast just
           take control of these guys, too?

                         

                          HICCUP
           They're babies. They don't listen
           to anyone!

                         

                          TUFFNUT
           Yeah, just like us!

                         
          Gobber follows up the rear clumsily, STRUGGLING for control.

                         

                          GOBBER
           This... is... very dangerous!

                         
          He PULLS ALONGSIDE Hiccup and Valka.

                         

                          GOBBER (CONT'D)
           Some might suggest this is poorly
           conceived.

                          HICCUP
           Well, it's a good thing that I
           never listen.

                         
          A SHARP RIDGE RUSHES up at them. They're going to CRASH.
          Hiccup ROUNDS one side of it, and Gobber flies down the other
          side. They shout through gaps in the iceberg.

                         

                          GOBBER
           So what IS your plan?!

                         

                          HICCUP
           Get Toothless back and kick Drago's-

                         
          He's interrupted by another closure in the gaps of ice. They
          blast out of the other side.
           HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 84.

           Heads up!

                         
          They SPLIT to avoid another peak and then reconvene, only to
          find another icy outcropping directly in their path.

           And that thing.

                         
          Gobber HITS it, with a THUD and a YELP.

          (Scene 2450 - Hiccup Vs. Toothless)

                         
          Torches burn in their braziers as Berk slumbers... until the
          Bewilderbeast approaches, STOMPING down on the monolithic
          Viking statues that guard the harbor.

                         

                         

          INT. GOTHI'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS


                         
          The sound of destruction rouses a flock of Terrible Terrors
          and Gothi, who was sleeping under the dragons. Their pupils
          turn to slits, and heeding the ultrasonic call, they fly off.

                         
          Gothi shuffles onto her deck, confused, then GASPS at
          horrifying sight.

                         

                         

          INT. VIKING HUT - CONTINUOUS


                         
          A Gronckle lounges peacefully by the fire, as his Viking
          owner lavishes him with scratches.

                         

                          HOARK
           Ah, that's a good boy!

                         
          The Gronckle's eyes suddenly turn to slits and it, too, takes
          wing, knocking over a chair and table as it heads for the
          door.

                         

                          HOARK (CONT'D)
           Watch the furniture! Where are you
           going?

                         
          It barrels out of the hut and into the night sky as the
          Viking rushes to the doorway, spotting the same arresting
          sight with a gasp.

          EXT. GREAT HALL - CONTINUOUS


                         
          Vikings pour out of the Great Hall as all of Berk's dragons
          fill the night sky and join the ranks of Drago's growing

          DRAGON ARMY.

                         
          The Bewilderbeast rises out of the sea, bearing down on the
          people of Berk as Drago hovers on Toothless, leading the
          charge. The Vikings stare, aghast.

                         

                          DRAGO
           Your chief is dead.

                         
          Waves of shock and whispers of "Stoick?" spread through the
          crowd.

                         

                          DRAGO (CONT'D)
           No one can protect you now.

                         
          He thrusts his bull-hook, commanding the Bewilderbeast to
          fire. The Vikings watch in horror as the Bewilderbeast opens
          its yawning jaws and BLASTS.

                         

                         

          EXT. SKIES/BERK - NIGHT


                         
          Dragon roars grow louder as Hiccup & Co. approach through
          clouds, racing against time.

                         
          They collectively GASP at the sight of Drago's Bewilderbeast
          having now covered most of the village in explosions of ice.
          Berk's now commandeered dragons circle in a huddle behind
          him, joining Valka's flock, and corralled by Drago's armored
          dragons.

                         

                          HICCUP
           No...

                          FISHLEGS

           Have you forgotten who you're
           riding with?

                         
          He brazenly aims his baby dragon toward the Bewilderbeast.

           There isn't a dragon alive that I
           can't wrangle!

                         
          His baby dragon dives toward the sea instead.

                         

                          ERET (CONT'D)
           Except for this one!

          The others shrug and follow. As they get closer, the
          Bewilderbeast looms bigger and BIGGER.

                         
          Berk's Vikings in hiding notice Hiccup and the others as they
          approach.

                         

                          VIKING #1
           Look, it's Hiccup!

                         
          The Vikings CHEER.

                         
          ON DRAGO, surprised to see Hiccup and the others approaching.

                         

                          DRAGO
           What?

                         
          With an irate HUFF, the Bewilderbeast focuses on Hiccup,
          gaining ever closer to Toothless.

                         
          Suddenly, a SHEEP appears in its sight, rising and falling
          out of view. The Bewilderbeast blinks, confused.

                         
          It looks down to see Eret catching the falling sheep and
          reloading it into the game launcher, as Tuffnut cocks the
          mechanism and Ruffnut pulls the trigger.

                          RUFFNUT
           Keep `em coming!

                         
          Snotlout tosses the black sheep to Tuffnut.

                         

                          SNOTLOUT
           Black sheep, baby!

                         
          Exasperated, the alpha inhales, about to blast, when... HONK!
          The game horn blares, breaking his concentration.

                         
          He turns, finding the horn unmanned. The Bewilderbeast then
          returns his focus to the sheep launcher, until the BLACK
          SHEEP LANDS on the his face, bouncing down his facial spines
          and becoming lodged.

           Ten points!

                         
          The Bewilderbeast shakes the black sheep off and prepares to
          blast again.

                         

                          SNOTLOUT (CONT'D)
           Uh-oh...

                         
          HONK! The alpha whips around -- still no one at the horn.

                         
          ON FISHLEGS, giggling and hiding behind the game horn.

                         
          The Bewilderbeast finally lets loose the ice blast, covering
          the entire horn in jagged spikes... as Fishlegs leaps from
          the platform.

                         

                          FISHLEGS
           I'm okay!

                         

          BACK TO HICCUP

                         
          as he reaches Drago, hovering directly in Toothless' sights.

                         

                          DRAGO
           You certainly are hard to get rid
           of. I'll say that.

                         
          Hiccup ignored him and focuses on Toothless' slitted pupils.

                         

                          HICCUP
           Toothless? It's me, bud. It's me.
           I'm right here. Come back to me.

                         
          TOOTHLESS' POV: Hiccup appears as an unfamiliar red blur,
          still firmly under the control of the Bewilderbeast.

                          DRAGO
           He is not yours anymore. He belongs
           to the alpha!

                         
          Drago smugly sits back in the saddle, his arms open in
          invitation.

                         

                          DRAGO (CONT'D)
           But, please, oh great dragon
           master, try to take him. He will
           not miss a second time.

                         
          Hiccup holds strong, maintaining eye contact with Toothless.
          He reaches out to touch him.

                          HICCUP
           It wasn't your fault, bud. They
           made you do it.

                         
          Drago's amusement fades as Toothless stirs. His pupils
          DILATE, then NARROW again.

                         

                          HICCUP (CONT'D)
           You'd never hurt him.

                          (BEAT)
           You'd never hurt me.

                         
          Drago watches, amazed, as Toothless fights the control.

                         

                          DRAGO
           How are you doing that?

                         
          Hiccup holds the stare, tears in his eyes.

                         

                          HICCUP
           Please. You are my best friend,
           bud.

                         
          Bewilderbeast ROARS a forceful command.

                         

                          HICCUP (CONT'D)
           My best friend.

                         
          Toothless' pupils jitter, then DILATE fully. He coos
          sympathetically.

                         

                          HICCUP (CONT'D)
           Thatta boy! That's it! I'm here!

                         
          Toothless' eyes finally dilate fully and resolve on Hiccup's
          familiar face.
          Drago goes from astounded to alarmed. Drago STRIKES Toothless
          with the bull hook in a vain attempt to regain control.

                         

                          DRAGO
           No!

                         
          Toothless ROARS defiantly, snatches the bull hook in his
          jaws, and PULLS... yanking Drago off of his back and sending
          him both PLUMMETING to the sea.

                         

                          HICCUP
           Yeah!

                         
          But without a rider, Toothless drops out of the sky as well.
          Hiccup leaps from the baby dragon, diving after him.

           Hang on!

                         
          Drago breaks his fall, landing heavily upon the
          Bewilderbeast's tusk...

                         
          As Hiccup tucks in his arms, trying to close the gap between
          he and Toothless before they both make impact with the ocean.

                         

                          HICCUP (CONT'D)
           Almost there, buddy. Almost there!

                         
          Hiccup reaches Toothless. They pair up, mid-air, and
          skyrocket past Drago as he hobbles to the top of the alpha's
          head.

          (Scene 2500 - One True Alpha)

                         
          Hiccup looks back at Drago, now issuing commands from the top
          of the Bewilderbeast's head.

                         

                          DRAGO
           Do something!

                         

                          HICCUP
           We need to get those two apart.

                         
          Hiccup flies Toothless past a flag pole tears a strip of the
          flag.

                         
          The Bewilderbeast BLASTS in their direction, barely missing
          them as they disappear around the back of a mountain.

                         

                          HICCUP (CONT'D)
           We gotta block him out, Toothless.
           Do you trust me, bud?

                         
          Toothless coos, allowing Hiccup to BLINDFOLD him with the
          flag. Hiccup calms him with a touch.

                         

                          HICCUP (CONT'D)
           We can do this. You and me. As one.

                         
          Hiccup SPLAYS Toothless' mechanical tail. Toothless responds,
          MATCHING the move with the natural half.

          They PEEL around the other side of the mountain, heading
          back toward Drago and Bewilderbeast, passing Astrid and the
          cheering Vikings on the ground.

                         

                          ASTRID
           Take them down, babe!

                         
          The Viking roar in support as Hiccup and Toothless race past.

                         
          Valka watches with pride as her son hurtles towards Drago and
          the alpha.

           Take control of it!

                         
          The Bewilderbeast's HISS becomes a furious ROAR, but to no
          avail. Hiccup clamps his hands over Toothless' ear plates,
          muffling the alpha's commands.

                         

                          HICCUP
           Shut it out, Toothless!

                         

                          DRAGO

           STOP THEM!

                         
          The Bewilderbeast BLASTS!

                         

                          HICCUP

           NOW!

                         
          Toothless suddenly PULLS UP, ARCING over Drago's head! Drago
          LAUGHS, victorious, then pauses in shock.

                         
          DRAGO'S POV: as Toothless climbs inverted through the sky,
          the blindfold falls free, revealing an EMPTY SADDLE.

                         
          Drago WHIRLS around, wide-eyed, to see...

                         
          HICCUP ZOOMING TOWARD HIM, his wing-suit deployed, and his
          Dragon Blade trailing Zippleback gas. Drago SWIPES but misses
          him. Hiccup clicks the lighter and ignites the gas, blasting
          Drago off his Bewilderbeast with a SCREAM.

                         
          Drago PLUMMETS, BREAKING HIS FALL against the massive
          dragon's spines and landing hard on the ground, his bullhook
          landing just out of reach.

                         
          The Bewilderbeast WHIPS its tail, trying to SWAT down Hiccup.

                          HICCUP (CONT'D)
           Not again.

                          (BEAT)

           TOOTHLESS! IT'S NOW OR NEVER!

                         
          Toothless pops open his dorsal blades, arcs skyward, and
          rejoins Hiccup just before colliding with the alpha's tail.

                         

                          HICCUP (CONT'D)
           Come on, bud!

                         
          Together again, they speed along the length of the thrashing
          tail...

                         

                          HICCUP (CONT'D)
           Hold on!

                         
          And shoot past the tip of the tail, narrowly making it!

                         

                          HICCUP (CONT'D)
           Yeah! We did it!

                         
          They arc through the sky and LAND a few paces from Drago,
          kicking up a trail of dust.

                         
          Battered and weary, Drago reaches for his bullhook. Hiccup
          extends and fires up his Dragon Blade, hurling it like a
          javelin, and sticking it in the ground between Drago and his
          weapon, singeing his outstretched hand.

                         

                          DRAGO
           Agghh!

                         

                          HICCUP
           Hold him there Toothless!

                         
          Toothless SNARLS a warning, ready to blast.

                          HICCUP (CONT'D)
           It's all over now.

                         
          But the cloud of dust settles, revealing the Bewilderbeast,
          rising behind Hiccup, ready to blast him instead.

                         

                          DRAGO

                          (GRINNING KNOWINGLY)
           Or is it?

                         
          Hiccup spins around, alarmed, as a RUSH of water THUNDERS up
          the Bewilderbeast's throat.

                         

                          HICCUP
           Oh, no!
           HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 92.

                         

                         
          It BLASTS, but Toothless leaps into the way, shielding Hiccup
          beneath him. The freezing explosion envelops them both.

                         
          Drago laughs to himself as Valka lands her baby dragon and
          rushes to the icy explosion, hammering away at it
          desperately.

                         

                          VALKA
           No! No...

                         
          ON ASTRID and GOBBER, watching from a distance, horrified. As
          Valka POUNDS at the ice, a GLOWS forms from deep within. She
          realizes what is about to happen and backs away.

                         
          A BLAST thunders from inside the ice, SHATTERING it.
          Toothless emerges from the debris, revealing Hiccup curled
          safely under his wings.

                         
          Toothless is steaming, his black skin glowing blue with rage,
          his split dorsal blades searing with blue heat, a glow
          emanating from his flared nostrils.

                         
          He turns back to Hiccup, to check if he's unharmed, then
          turns his full attention back to the Bewilderbeast. He leaps
          out of the crater and lands upon an ice spire, roaring
          ferociously.

                         
          The Bewilderbeast bellows back at this affront. Toothless
          unleashes a salvo of plasma into the Bewilderbeast's face,
          not letting up.

                         

                          HICCUP
           He's challenging the alpha!

                         

                          VALKA
           To protect you.
          The Bewilderbeast ROARS at this act of insubordination.
          Toothless fires back, time and again, fully in control.

                         
          The alpha thrashes his tusks through the ice, trying to smash
          Toothless, but he deftly spring from spire to spire,
          continuing his unrelenting attack.

                         
          In the midst of the mayhem, the horde of commandeered dragons
          -- both Berk's and Valka's -- break free from the control to
          witness Toothless' retaliation.

                         
          Toothless lands protectively by Hiccup and Valka, commanding
          the dragons to shift sides. The follow, amassing behind
          Toothless.

                         
          Seeing this, Drago panics and rushes toward the
          Bewilderbeast.

                          DRAGO
           No, no, no, no! Fight back! Fight!

           FIGHT!

                         
          Drago clambers up the Bewilderbeast's tusk, totally unhinged.

                         

                          DRAGO (CONT'D)
           (to the defecting dragons)
           What's the matter with you?

                         
          The Berkians swell in to show their unified support. Drago
          fumes as Hiccup and Toothless fly up together onto an ice
          spire.

                         

                          HICCUP
           Now do you get it? This is what it
           is to earn a dragon's loyalty.

                          (BEAT)
           Let this end now.

                         

                          DRAGO
           Never! Come on!

                         
          He hammers the Bewilderbeast, spurring it into a charge.

                         
          Toothless calls over his shoulder, commanding the dragons to
          ready themselves. He then BLASTS the Bewilderbeast, mid-
          charge. Suddenly, Skullcrusher fires. Followed by another,
          and another.

                         
          Hiccup looks around, amazed to see the flock of dragons
          opening fire on Drago and his Bewilderbeast. They've started
          a rebellion.

                         
          Drago is forced to hide from the fiery barrage by taking
          cover in the tall spines of the giant's crown.

                          DRAGO (CONT'D)

           FIGHT! BLAST THEM!

                         
          His prosthetic arm is blasted clean off by one of his own
          armored dragons.

                         
          The Bewilderbeast rears back to cover them all in ice, but
          Toothless lets loose a powerful shot. The Bewilderbeast's
          head is KNOCKED backward by a blue-flame fireball.

                         
          As the smoke clears, one of its massive TUSKS FALLS to the
          ground, sheared clean off. Drago glares at Toothless.

                         
          Toothless ROARS commandingly, calling an end to the fight.

                         

                          HICCUP
           The alpha protects them all.

          Overwhelmed and overpowered, the Bewilderbeast yields to the
          new alpha and heeds Toothless' command, retreating into the
          sea in an explosive splash.

                         
          The Berkians CHEER in victory!

                         
          As the smoke clears, Hiccup and Toothless see nothing but
          bubbles on the waves to mark their disappearance. No sign of
          the Bewilderbeast... or Drago.

                         
          Toothless hops down from the spire, cooling off, as people
          celebrate all around them.

                         
          All of the dragons -- Berk's, Valka's, even Drago's -- land
          around Toothless. Cloudjumper bows to Toothless, starting a
          wave of bows, acknowledging their new alpha.

                         
          Toothless looks around, surprised, then lets out a majestic
          ROAR. The assembled dragons join in, roaring in tribute.

                         
          Toothless turns to Hiccup as he approaches.

                         

                          HICCUP (CONT'D)
           You never cease to amaze me, bud.
           Thank you.

                         
          Toothless GURGLES and licks Hiccup's face. Hiccups squeals,
          trying to get away.

                         

                          HICCUP (CONT'D)
           Toothless! You know that doesn't
           wash out.

                         
          The crowd laughs. All around them, Berk's dragons reunite
          with their Vikings.

                         

                          ASTRID
           Stormfly!

                         
          Stormfly bounds into Astrid.

                         

                          GOBBER
           Oh, give me a cuddle, Grumpy!

                         
          Grump lands ON TOP of Gobber, flattening him.

                         
          Relieved to the point of tears, Snotlout and Fishlegs race
          towards the expectant Ruffnut...

                         

                          FISHLEGS
           Who's my little princess?

                         
          ... and then right PAST her to embrace their dragons.

           I missed you so much!

                         

                          SNOTLOUT
           Don't you ever leave again,
           Hookfang!

                         
          Ruffnut GRUMBLES, dejected. Barf dips his head in to console
          her.

                         

                          RUFFNUT
           Oh Barf!

                         
          She hugs him. Belch looms in for some affection, but Ruffnut
          pushes him away...

                         

                          RUFFNUT (CONT'D)
           Not you.

                         
          And into Tuffnut who glowers back at her.

                         
          Hiccup smiles, taking in the happy reunions. Skullcrusher
          approaches him, without an owner to reunite with. Hiccup pets
          him, as Eret approaches.

                         

                          ERET
           That was some pretty fine dragon
           wrangling back there. You'd make a
           good trapper.

                         
          Before Hiccup can respond, Skullcrusher nuzzles Eret
          affectionately. Eret chuckles and gently strokes him.

                         

                          HICCUP
           Y'know, Skullcrusher's gonna need
           somebody to look after him now.

                          ERET
           Me?

                         
          Hiccup nods reassuringly. Eret looks at Skullcrusher, pausing
          to consider it.

                         

                          ERET (CONT'D)
           I'd be honored.

                         
          Valka walks up to her son, bursting with pride.

                         

                          VALKA
           Your father... he'd be every bit as
           proud as I am.

           Thank you. I'm really glad you're

                          VALKA
           And here I'll stay.

                         
          Toothless arrives, purring at Valka's touch as Astrid strides
          toward Hiccup, beaming proudly.

                         

                          ASTRID
           See? I told you it was in here.

                         
          She places her hand upon his chest, then quickly pokes the
          dorsal fin button, popping it open. She GIGGLES.

                         

                          HICCUP
           Ha, ha. Still doing that one?
           That's hilarious.

                          (THEN)
           Come here, you.

                         
          He scoops Astrid close and pulls her into a kiss. Gobber
          covers a gawking boy's eyes.

                         

                          GOBBER
           Ooh.

                         
          Gothi, the elder, taps Hiccup's shoulder, interrupting the
          romantic moment. She gestures for Hiccup to kneel. He does
          so, respectfully.

                         
          Using ash from a heap of burnt wreckage, Gothi traces a
          Viking symbol onto Hiccup's forehead. She bows.

                         
          Hiccup stands, meeting Gobber's proud, smiling eyes. Gobber
          turns to the silent crowd and throws up his arms.

                          GOBBER (CONT'D)
           The chief has come home!

                         
          The Berkians erupt with cheers and applause as Hiccup takes
          in the moment, acknowledging the weight of responsibility now
          upon him.

                         
          Toothless throws back his head and BLASTS in celebration,
          spurring all other dragons to follow suit, lighting up the
          sky in a spectacular display.

          A sheep grazes lazily on the grass as a Terrible Terror
          struggles in vain to carry him off. Suddenly, both are
          snatched up by a passing dragon.

                         

                         

          IN THE AIR

                         
          Ruffnut and Tuffnut wrestle over the sheep atop Barf & Belch.
          Ruffnut send the sheep flying toward Fishlegs. Snotlout nabs
          it instead, blowing a kiss mockingly.

                         

           HICCUP (V.O.)
           This... is Berk. A bit trampled and
           busted and covered in ice, but it's
           home. It's our home.

                         
          They swoop past a gathered crowd on the battered bleachers as
          Snotlout dunks the sheep in his basket. Eret joins the race
          atop Skullcrusher.

                         
          They fly past Hiccup and Toothless, who are steadily hoisting
          a palette of timber and supplies onto a rooftop where workers
          are rebuilding the damaged houses.

                         
          Hiccup then turns his attention to a massive statue of
          Stoick, presently under construction. He grins with pride.

                         

           HICCUP (V.O.)
           Those who attacked us are
           relentless and crazy. But those who
           stopped them? Oh, even more so!

                         
          He looks to the horizon, scanning it from east to west to
          ensure that no trouble is approaching.

                         
          Astrid and Stormfly buzz past him playfully, coaxing him to
          join the game. He smiles.

           HICCUP (V.O.)
           We may be small in numbers, but we
           stand for something bigger than
           anything the world can pit against
           us.

                         
          Astrid soars past the blacksmith stall, waving to Valka and
          Gobber as they remove the armor from Drago's freed battle
          dragons.

                         

           HICCUP (V.O.)
           We are the voice of peace. And bit
           by bit, we will change this world.

          Realizing that he's late, Gobber hurries over to the sheep
          launcher and pulls the trigger, sending the black sheep
          hurtling into the air.

                         
          Astrid and Stormfly close in on the black sheep, about to
          snatch it out of the air, when suddenly, Hiccup and Toothless
          dart past, beating them to it. Toothless looks back with a
          gummy smile.

                         

           HICCUP (V.O.)
           You see, we have something they
           don't. Oh sure, they have armies
           and they have armadas...

                         
          Toothless and Hiccup dive toward the line of baskets. As they
          approach, Toothless bounces Hiccup into the air, allowing him
          to dunk the black sheep into Astrid's basket. They reunite on
          the other side. The crowd cheers!

                         

           HICCUP (V.O.)
           But we... we have...

                         
          Hiccup and Toothless land upon the chief's dais, joined by
          Astrid, Stormfly, and the other dragon riders.

                         

           HICCUP (V.O.)

           OUR DRAGONS!

                         
          Toothless lets out a proud roar as Hiccup look out over Berk,
          gleaming with pride.

     FADE IN:

     EXT. VINCI COUNTRYSIDE - RENAISSANCE - DAY

     Beneath a jawdroppingly storybook castle, a small
     Renaissance Fair with florid awnings, demented ACROBATS
     and roaring puppets is unfolding.

     RUSTIC FARMERS and their families rumble with enjoyment
     at the Sabbath afternoon entertainment.

     Encircled by children, A JUGGLER WITH AN UNFORGETTABLY
     ETCHED FACE elegantly plucks the red balls from a pouch
     on his mule.  As he begins to juggle, a LOUD EXPLOSION
     is heard, causing him to ungracefully drop his balls
     and collapse in a heap.

     Everyone at the fair, including the puppets, looks up.

                             UNFORGETTABLE JUGGLER
               Leonardo, che pazzo.

     The juggler shakes his fist up to a swish pan that swings
     up toward a smoking window of the awesome castle...

     INT. ROOM OF THE GOLD MACHINE

     where the charismatic LEONARDO DA VINCI laughs down at
     him.  Da Vinci wears a pair of very early, very cool sun-
     glasses with his trademark beard.

     He turns and loses his smile, something extraordinary
     reflecting off his glasses.  Removing his shades, Da
     Vinci moves to the Something, a gloriously incredible
     machine.  The opening CREDITS REVEAL its dazzling idio-
     syncrasies.

     TWO COUGHING APPRENTICES haplessly try to disperse smoke
     from the still billowing, mysteriously spectacular
     Machine.  Mirrors attached to parts of it reflect beams
     of light which cut through the smoke like a Renaissance
     laser show.

                             DA VINCI
                       (silencing authority)
               Basta vapore.

     The apprentice throws a lever.  A shunt near the furnace
     turns.  Steam escapes upwards.  The machine immediately
     slows down.  Da Vinci oh-so-gently coughs and moves for-
     ward with tongs.

     A LITTLE TROUGH - IN THE MACHINE'S INNARDS

     comes to a trembling, mystical halt.  Right behind this
     trough is a CONPLEX POLYHEDRON CRYSTAL as intricately
     modulated as any Rubik stocking stuffer, but much more
     dazzling in beauty.  It gleams like a jewel in the yellow
     glow which pours from a PLEASANTLY GRINNING DEMONHEAD into
     a trough--a glow of heat--and something more than heat.

     The tongs enter the frame.

     Da Vinci brings the object closer to his face.  A murmur
     goes up from the awestruck apprentices as the Master
     peers at the smoking yellow bar.

                             APPRENTICE TWO
               Maestro, che meraviglia!

                             APPRENTICE THREE
               Lei e' proprio fantastico!

     Da Vinci's pride goes dead as the implications hit.

                             DA VINCI
               Lasciatemi, solo.  Solo!

     The apprentices scurry out.  Mind reeling, Da Vinci turns
     his back to the viewer, before a wall of frescoes.

                             DA VINCI
               L'ho fatto.

     Spinning back around, using the edge of his cloak, Da
     Vinci pulls out the large gleaming crystal with a pop.

     INT. DA VINCI'S WORKSHOP

     With an accompanying blast of smoke, Da Vinci bursts
     through some double doors into his workshop, sadly
     reflecting upon the crystal in one hand and the tonged
     bar in the other.

     His workshop is a spendiferously enigmatic blend of
     laboratory and studio; On a table in the foreground is
     a fresh clay equestrian statue; a large VOLUME of
     sketches, the inkwell nearby; a MODEL of what looks like
     a HELICOPTER; Da Vinci flings the tonged bar on the table
     among these goodies.

     Pocketing the crystal, Da Vinci meanders through his work-
     shop casually tinkering with various experiments.  He
     snaps his fingers at a BATHING SUITED APPRENTICE, wearing
     a diving helmet prototype.  The Apprentice jumps into a
     pool of water.

     Leonardo next stops at an easel displaying a finished-
     except-for-the-mouth portrait of Mona Lisa, who happens
     to be seated in a stool before the easel.  She broadly
     smiles, revealing the worst dental work of her epoch.
     Da Vinci shakes his head and moves out onto a

     EXT. CASTLE TERRACE

     A FLYING APPRENTICE sails past Leonardo in a bat winged
     glider, enthusiastically shouting.  Da Vinci grins back
     until he touches his pocket.  He pulls out the crystal
     and, after a beat, angrily twists it apart into two
     separate, geometric pieces revealing a small intricate
     mirror.  He quickly folds the surprisingly shapable
     geometric pieces.

     Calming down, Da Vinci looks from the three components of
     the crystal to each of the three unfinished works on the
     table in his workshop.  He ponders then looks back out to
     the Vinci vista.

     The bat winged glider DISSOLVES into:

     A HAWK

     who is revealed to be flying over Sing Sing prison.

     INT. A SING SING PRISON CELL

     The shadow of the hawk passes through a cell window, over
     the face of EDDIE HUDSON HAWKINS causing him to break out
     of an eye-closed trance.

     Before the viewer can get a good look at him, Hudson
     Hawk turns to an oddball version of the "Mona Lisa" that
     has his face and tears it off the cell back-wall.

     INT. PRISON BLOCK WALKWAY

     TWO PRISON GUARDS, One WISE and BLACK, the other YOUNG
     and GREEN march down a cell block.  The Former is smoking
     a pipe which the Young Guard lights with a lighter.

                             WISE GUARD
               We're losing our biggest celebrity
               today.

                             YOUNG GUARD
               You're kidding, Petey the Paint
               Thinner Killer is getting paroled?

                             WISE GUARD
               Not that slime, you Fizzhead.
               Hudson Hawk.  The last of the
               great cat burglars.

     INT. PRISON CELL WALL

     A hand tears down a picture of a happy Hudson Hawk and
     a LITTLE MONKEY, identically dressed in black cat
     burglar gear.

     THE BLOCK

     The Wise Guard and the Young Guard rumble forward.

                             WISE GUARD
               As a thief, Hawk was a poem.
               Iambic fucking pentameter.  You
               know, Crime used to have a little
               class.  A hundred reporters were
               here when he came in, now they're
               probably out covering some tired
               crack gang war...

     The Guards approach Hawk's cell.  Hawk, with his back
     turned, hefts on a nifty blazer.

                             HAWK
               Remind me to fire my publicist.

     The Wise Guard chuckles as the Young Guard fumbles with
     his key-ring.

                             YOUNG GUARD
               Darn, these are for L-block...

     Hawk's hand reaches through the bars and grabs a pipe
     cleaner from the Wise Guard's pocket.  Then the lighter
     from the Young Guard's pocket--BURNS OFF the fabric fuzz
     with the lighter beside it--bends the now blackened
     wire--and with a quick turn of the wrist uses it to
     UNLOCK the door.

                             YOUNG GUARD
               - go back down to security and-

     He stops, dumbfounded, as the door clunks open.  The
     Guards double-take as Hawk, finally in full view, struts
     past them, down the hall.  The Guards hustle to catch
     up.  The wise guard puts his finger in the air and
     sarcastically pretends to be stung by the heat emanating
     from Hawk.

                             WISE GUARD
               Guess this means, Hawk, you'll
               be able to let yourself back in...

                             HAWK
               Never happen.  Bet.  Ten bucks.

     Hawk and the Wise Guard hit fists, half-smiling.  Hawk
     unfolds the painting.

                             HAWK
               Oh, give this back to Petey in A
               block.  Tell him it was a sweet
               gift, but I think he got some
               wrong ideas about our friendship.

                             YOUNG GUARD
               The Paint Thinner Killer did
               this?  I think you picked a good
               day to get out...

     The trio comes to the final checkpoint.  Hawk takes a
     deep breath.

                             WISE GUARD
               Hope I lose the bet.  Have that
               cappuccino on me.

                             HAWK
                       (flipping him the
                        pipe cleaner)
               You got it.  A double.

     EXT. OUTSIDE THE PRISON--DAY

     Hawk strides to the Massive Sliding Concrete Door/Wall
     between him and freedom.  As music crescendos and
     Hawk glows his first smile, the door opens to reveal two
     Mafioso brothers, CESAR and ANTONY MARIO, the latter
     sitting upon the hood of a tinted window Lincoln
     Continental.  Cesar is of cool, hair-slicked-back
     attitude, his scumbag brother is not.

                             ANTONY
               Welcome back, buddy ol' pal.
               We've got a proposition...

                              HAWK
               Answer's no, not even if you
               bathe.  Cesar Mario, Antony Mario,
               how's the "Family?"  Kill any
               monkeys lately?

                              CESAR
               How many times do I have to say
               it?  I didn't put the hit on
               Little Eddie... Never had anything
               against that kooky chimp.  I
               actually found him, "endearing."

                             HAWK
               Sure.  Face down.  Two endearing
               shots to the back of the head.
               That's your mark, man.  What did
               Little Eddie ever do to...

     Smouldering, Hawk struts off.  Cesar takes a black
     canvas bag from a SCARFACED DRIVER and hustles up to
     Hawk.  The Lincoln rumbles behind them, Antony riding
     on the hood.

                             CESAR
               You're hitting Rutherford's
               Auction House.  Easy as my
               brother's wife.  Directions are
               in the bag.  Just open the seventh
               floor safe and take out the
               thingie...

                             HAWK
               Or you cut off my thingie.
               Directions even your brother
               would understand.
         
                             ANTONY
                       (defensively)
               Yeah, directions even I could
               understand.

     The car squeals to a stop.  Antony bounds off.  Cesar
     shove-throws the canvas bag into Hawk's unwilling
     hands.

                             CESAR
               Hawk, you're a great thief.  Got
               set up, did some time, nothing to
               be ashamed of.  Don't give me a
               sonata about you always just
               really wanted to settle down,
               open a hardware Store and sell
               spatulas...

                             HAWK
               If the Mario brothers weren't
               Jersey's third largest family,
               I'd say kiss my ass.  But
               considering your status, I'll
               say slurp my butt.

     Hawk fiercely push-shoves the canvas bag back into
     Cesar's hands.

                             CESAR
               What's your favorite sport, Hawk?

                             HAWK
               Baseball, why?

     Antony opens the back door of the Lincoln and says
     "Baseball."  He is handed a baseball bat.  Hawk backs
     up as Antony moves threateningly toward him.

                             HAWK
               I meant, ping pong.  Listen, I'd
               rather go back in than whore for
               you...
                       (stopping)
               Oh, I need to borrow ten dollars.

     A PRISON GUARD from above turns as not to be a witness.
     Hawk feebly calls up to him.

                             HAWK
               Help?  Police?

     Antony swings at Hawk, who pretends not to notice until
     the last second.  Hawk ducks and slam-kicks his calf.
     Antony crumples, using the bat as a crutch.  Hawk boots
     up the bat for a two-handed catch then savagely pivots
     it across Antony's face, knocking him into the backseat
     of the car.

                             CESAR
                       (unfazed)
               You need some time to think.
               That's cool, but next time, I'm
               not going to say "Please."

     Cesar floats into the backseat.  The Lincoln takes off.
     Hawk seethes...

                             HAWK
               I don't believe this.  I've been
               out forty seconds...

     A BACKFIRE rings out.  Hawk hits the ground, thinking
     it is a gunshot.

     HAWK'S ON THE GROUND P.O.V.

     A gasping 1960 Caddy comes to a stop and a pair of a too-
     fancy-to-be-tasteful shoes comes out.  Hawk looks up to
     see ALEX MESSINA, his older, maybe-maybe-not-wiser best
     friend.

                             ALEX
               That's the first thing I did.
               Smooch the ground and taste the
               freedom.  Sorry I was late.  Miss
               anything?

                             HAWK
                       (getting up)
               Your timing, and your shoes, are
               impeccable...  Good to see you,
               Alex, been having a lousy day.

                             ALEX
               Lousy day?  The man's getting out
               of prison and he's having a
               lousy day.  What, you missing out
               on the Cell Block Water Ballet
               pageant?  Believe me, it's
               overrated.

     Hawk pauses to say something, then just hugs Alex.

                             ALEX
               Where's the kiss?  No tongue this
               time, I promise.

     A laughing Hawk gives Alex's stomach a slap before
     getting in the car....

                             HAWK
               Looks like you've been expanding
               your...

                             ALEX
               Don't say it, Hawkins.  I'm
               incredibly sensitive about my
               fucking figure.

                             HAWK
               My next word was gonna be
               "consciousness."  Swear to God...
               tubby.

     EXT. THE ROAD INTO HOBOKEN--DAY

     The Caddy thunders past a sweet Manhattan view. "Come
     Fly With Me" is playing on the radio.  Hawk casually com-
     pletes an intimidating hand puzzle.

                             HAWK
               That's your definition of "Hard?"

                             ALEX
               Show off.  Hey, boss tune.  "Come
               Fly with Me."

                             HAWK
               Three minutes, 51 seconds.

                             ALEX
               Still do the puzzles, still know
               the running times of songs, and
               I'll bet you're still the best
               damn cat burg--

                              HAWK
               Not anymore.  Now I'm the laziest
               damn cat burg--I'm going to take
               it so straight that I won't tape
               a Mets game without the expressed
               written consent of the National
               Baseball League.

                             ALEX
               Now that you're born again,what
               do you wanna do?  Statue of
               Liberty?  Entertain some ladies?
               Miss Saigon tix?  Seduce some
               women?  Play Nintendo?  Bone some
               chicks?

                             HAWK
               Come on, Alex, let's just get to
               Alex's.  Your bar's the only
               place that's going to cheer me.
               God, I'd kill for a damn
               cappuccino.  What the hell's a
               Nintendo?

                             ALEX
               Oh man, you still got a thing for
               those unmasculine European coffees?
               Who's your buddy?

     Alex pulls a styrofoam cup from a paper bag.

                             HAWK
               The man knows, the man knows!

     Hawk takes off the cap with a stimulating whiff.

                             ALEX
               So Mr. Coffee, what went down
               outside the prison?

                             HAWK
               Oh, not much.  Mario Brothers want
               me to do a job.

     Alex brakes and cappuccino flies.  Hawk half-heartedly
     tries to lick up with his fingers.

                             ALEX
               Those dago-guinea-I can say
               this shit I'm Italian-wop
               motherfu--

                             HAWK
               Ah, had the perfect amount of
               foam.  Just get me to the bar...
               It's the one good thing in my
               life that'll never change....

     EXT. OUTSIDE ALEX'S BAR--NIGHT

     The Guys move through the personably Jersey face of the
     bar.  The Empire State Building beams in the background.
     Sinatra cuts off.

     INT. ALEX'S BAR--NIGHT

     It's changed.  Hawk and Alex enter into what has become
     the ultimate pseudo-art deco-fern littered-nightmare,
     packed with noisy, INSUFFERABLY SELF-ABSORBED YUPS.
     A violently erotic and pretentious video plays upon
     elevated T.V. sets set up all around the place.

     Hawk's mouth gapes as he drifts by a sickening COUPLE
     toasting wine coolers, and two very YOUNG BROKERS high-
     fiving each other after missing a dartboard.

                             ALEX
               I didn't know how to tell you.  A
               couple brokers stopped in for
               Stoley Spritzers one night.  Next
               thing I know Fast Track Digest
               votes us "Watering Hole of the
               Month."  Now, I'm shopping for
               Aqua Salmon wallpaper.

                             HAWK
               I read about these people in
               Newsweek.  Where's all the
               regulars, Crazy Jeff Cava, the
               Todd sisters, Indian Joe?  Where's
               Ed Kranepool's autograph?  Captain
               Bob's steering wheel?

                             ALEX
               Hey, get this irritable guy a
               cappuccino.  I gotta go be a boss.

     Alex lifts a piece of the bar and moves behind it.
     Snatching up a menu, Hawk calls out...

                             HAWK
               This is Pizza?  Reindeer Goat
               cheese?  I admit, I've been known
               to go wild and order a Canadian
               Bacon in my time, but..

     Hawk lights up a cigarette.  A TORTOISE SHELL NON-SMOKER
     immediately turns to him wearing a "Yes, I mind if you
     smoke" button.

                             TORTOISE SHELL NON-SMOKER
               Can you read.... smoker?

                             HAWK
               Can you take a sunrise and
               sprinkle it with dew?

                              TORTOISE SHELL NON-SMOKER
                       (Huh?)
               No.

                              HAWK
               The Candy Man can, Felix.  You
               know, I thought this was a country
               where you could do any stupid
               thing you wanted; drive to work
               naked, make love to a V.C.R.
               Guess I'm wrong.  Maybe that's
               why I became a serial arsonist.

                             TORTOISE SHELL NON-SMOKER
               Hey, it's okay, big guy.  Smoke
               all you want.  Have mine....

     The Non-smoker fumbles out a pack of cigarettes and
     flees.  A cappuccino in cup and saucer slides down the
     bar saloon-style.  A smiling Hawk picks it up, turns away
     from the bar and closes his eyes, bringing the cup to his
     lips until a POLICE BADGE swirls into frame and splashes
     into the cup, splattering coffee over Hawk's blazer.

                             GATES (O.S.)
               You're under arrest...

     Hawk makes eye contact up to a crude, coarse, and
     cackling island of a man, OFFICER GATES, amid the sea
     of oblivious and self-obsessed yuppitude, standing by
     a table.

                             GATES
               Have a seat.  Good to see you,
               buddy ol' pal...

                             HAWK
               The pleasure's all yours, Officer
               Gates.

     BACK OF THE BAR

     With concern, Alex watches Hawk sit at Gates' table.

     GATES' TABLE

     Gates pillages a plate of spaghetti and meatballs with
     terrifying precision.  Hawk tosses the badge onto the
     food.  Gates eats around it.

                             GATES
               Why do you show your parole
               officer such disrespect?
               Especially after I got you such
               a nice job.

                             HAWK
               What job?

     Gates pulls up the black canvas bag and puts it on the
     table.

                             GATES
               The auction house, asshole.  One
               night's work and you're free like
               no ex-con's ever been.  No
               checking in with a shrink, no
               community service teaching
               retards how to play air hockey.
               It's a great deal, I can't lie.

                             HAWK
               The only thing you can't do is
               get sex for free.  I know I was
               in prison for like basically the
               80's, but, call me daffy, aren't
               you supposed to stop me from
               committing crimes.  You know,
               Book-em-Dano, Call-for-backup,
               Give-a-Hoot-Don't-Pollute.

     Gates thunders out of his chair and moves around to sneer
     down at Hawk.  Behind Gates, on the T.V. screens, are
     analogous images of DISGUSTING ANIMALS AND MONSTERS.

                             GATES
               You wouldn't be out if it wasn't
               for me!  I did dog and pony for
               you!  You think they would have
               let you out after what you did,
               you told the board members they
               looked like the Three Stooges...

                             HAWK
               How was I supposed to know they
               were women?  Besides one of them
               was bald and kept saying
               "Soitinly."

     Gates simmers into his seat with a self-control smile.

                             GATES
               Remember that guy in the cell
               next to you who hung himself?

                             HAWK
               Yes.

                             GATES
               Remember that shoe you lost...

                             HAWK
               Uh, yeah.  Cut to the chase.

     Gates pulls up a shoe and puts it on the table.

                             GATES
               One phone call and your shoe
               will become a piece of evidence
               and that suicide'll become a
               murder.

     Hawk bobs under the table and up.

                             HAWK
               What else do you got under there
               ... I don't want to be rude, but
               this is all pretty lame.

                             GATES
               That's the beauty.  It's bullshit,
               but I can make it stick because
               I'm a good guy parole officer and
               you re a bad guy who's about to
               find out that there's a thin line
               between ex-con and escape con.

     Alex suddenly approaches the table.

                             ALEX
               How is everything tonight, sir?

                             GATES
               Beat it, Alex.  You're a dinosaur.

                             HAWK
               Alex, did you know this ape was
               going to be here...

                             ALEX
               Sure.  That's why his meatballs
               are made out of marinated Chuck
               Wagon.

                             GATES
                       (mouthful)
               You're full of shit.

     As Alex speaks, an eating dog is on the screens.

                             ALEX
               No, man, actually you are.  Just
               add water and it makes its own
               gravy.  Keeps your teeth healthy
               and your coat shiny.

     Gates grabs the shoes and races off, gagging.  Hawk gets
     up to laugh next to Alex.  Their laughter dies as they
     turn to look at the black canvas bag left on the table
     between them.

     INT. BACK ROOM--DAWN

     Hawk stares mournfully at a black and white photo of a
     monkey-sized chalk-outline on a city street.  Behind him,
     Alex pulls out blueprints from the black bag.  Sinatra's
     "Witchcraft" blares on the radio....

                             ALEX
               Hmmmm.....

                             HAWK
               Yo Pandora, quit hummm-ing... look
               at this.

     Hawk is rummaging through stockpiled remnants of an old,
     "true" bar.  Round lamps, tacky mirrors, pictures of Hawk
     and the Regs at the bar.  Managing a weary smile, Hawk
     lifts a ship steering wheel, while Alex puts on a pair of
     granny classes and pulls out blueprints.

                             HAWK
               It's Captain Bob's steering wheel!
               Remember when the Captain.....

                             ALEX
               Hmmm, nasty little safe on the 7th.

     Hawk nervously picks up a Rubik's Cube and holds it
     behind his back.  He brings it back around, completed.
     Sighing, Hawk drops the cube and rubs his scalp.  Alex
     starts rubbing his stomach.  They pace in pre-job
     syncopation and speak rapid-fire.

                             HAWK
               The safe's a Simpson 71.  Last
               time I played the game, Simpson
               only had a 40.

                             ALEX
               Just means it'll take you an extra
               31 seconds to seduce.  You re
               still the best, I know it.

                             HAWK
               But you got three guards who...
               Shit, what am I doing?  Where's
               the want ads?  Gonna sell some
               spatulas.

                             ALEX
               Hey, I'm sorry, man.  I'm putting
               out a fire with kerosene.

     Alex gives Hawk a consoling two-hand-shake then jumps
     back to reveal he has put Hawk into thumbcuffs.

                             HAWK
               This isn't funny.  I'm not into
               this.  I...

                             ALEX
               There goes five seconds...My
               record's eighteen.

                             HAWK
               You're not...LISTENING!

     Out of annoyance, Hawk breaks out of the cuffs and
     violently throws them at Alex, who sits down a little
     wounded.

                             HAWK
               I'm sorr--Goddamn Mario Brothers.
               Goddamn Gates.  Goddamn Rutherford
               Auction House.  By the way, how
               many seconds?

                             ALEX
               Rutherford Auction... that name...

     Alex jumps up excitedly and then convulses in pain.

                             HAWK
               Alex!

                             ALEX
               Don't wet your diapers.  I'll have
               to change them.  "Witchcraft."
               What's the running time?

     Alex flops down behind a work table before a wallfull of
     drawings of different kinds of vaults.  He sets himself
     up for an insulin injection.

                             HAWK
               3:48.  I can't get you involved,
               man.  This is my sewage and...
                       (re drawings)
               God, you love all this, don't you,
               you bastard.  Haven't you ever
               heard of stamp collecting, or
               curling?

     Hawk leans in and administers the shot of insulin to
     Alex.

                             ALEX
               I'm in.  Have you seen the public
               service announcements for Diabetes.
               We can ride horses, play LaCrosse,
               and knock off auction houses.  I
               got a plan.  You won't have to hail
               Cesar or Gates.

     Hawk collapses next to Alex, resigned to his fate.

                             HAWK
               I'm a bum.

     EXT. NICE, BUSINESS NEIGHBORHOOD--NIGHT

     TWO GRUBBY DERELICTS, one pushing a shopping cart, the
     other inside it, situated atop the usual two Glad bags.
     They are drunkenly warbling "Witchcraft."  IMPECCABLY
     DRESSED NIGHT-LIFERS give them a wide berth.

     Our derelicts pass beneath a MASSIVE RED CANOPY of a
     distinguished eight story edifice, upon which is written
     RUTHERFORD'S AUCTION HOUSE.  A DOORMAN shoos them away...

     A NEWSPAPER TRUCK pulls up in front of the Auction House.
     The Driver pops out with a bundle of papers and moves to
     a Dispenser on the corner.  The Bums wheel around the
     truck.  The Driver loads the papers and bounds back.

     The Truck pulls away from the corner.  The shopping cart
     rolls off--the bums nowhere to be seen.

     The Truck turns the corner, revealing the derelicts
     climbing up the back of it, with Glad bags around their
     necks.  The Truck moves toward an enclosed Walkway Bridge
     that connects the Auction House with another Building.

     Launching low-tech grapples, the Vagrants latch them-
     selves onto the Walkway window as the Truck passes
     beneath.

     AT THE WINDOW

     The viewer's viewpoint moves into a tighter view of the
     dangling derelicts, revealing them to, of course, be Hawk
     and Alex.  Getting a footing, on the small window ledge,
     each man cuts a hole in the window while holding onto a
     plunger.

                             HAWK
               Whoa, you better cut a bigger hole
               than that.

                             ALEX
               Hey, you promised......Don't worry,
               I'm wearing my girdle.

     INT. INSIDE THE WALKWAY WINDOW--NIGHT

     Hawk and Alex come through their window holes.  Hawk
     immediately flattens himself against a wall, whisper-
     ing...

                             HAWK
               Cameras?

                             ALEX
               No need.  Guards' station's right
               there.

     Alex points to an open doorway just down the hall where
     laughter and shadows emerge.  Hawk tries to flee, but a
     grinning Alex pulls him toward it.

     Hawk and Alex slide across the wall to a closed room
     marked POWER, which is right next to the open Guards'
     Station.  The viewer's viewpoint moves past Hawk and
     Alex lock-picking into the Power room to...

     INT. THE GUARDS' STATION

     Two Security Guards sit before a console of seven
     security screens still chuckling over an unheard joke.
     Wires coming out of the security console run across the
     floor and through the wall into...

     INT. THE POWER ROOM

     The wires go up to a row of seven humming, RECORD button
     flashing V.C.R.s.  Hawk and Alex stand before them,
     sharing a cig.

                             ALEX
               They record everything their
               video surveillance takes in...

                             HAWK
               Yes, master-thief, I can see that.
               You said something about a plan...

     Alex presses the REWIND buttons on the V.C.R.'s.

                             ALEX
               Am I boring you, smartass?  Watch.
               A little rewind and re-wire action
               and the Guards are going to be
               watching a rerun and miss out on
               our exciting episode.

     Alex pulls from a nearby shelf six tapes marked MONDAY.

     INT. SEVENTH FLOOR AUCTION AUDITORIUM--NIGHT

     Moving beneath a video camera and a dazzling Set of
     Hanging Horse Mobiles, a Heavyset guard, BIG STAN, moseys
     through the dimly lit main auction house auditorium.  The
     auditorium chairs are strewn out in the middle beside a
     turbo Floor Washer.

     Next to a painting of Happy Children Riding Horses at the
     back of the auditorium stage, Big Stan hefts himself upon
     a comparatively TINY BLUE CHAIR and begins to tip back
     and snooze.

     INT. GUARDS' STATION

     The Security Guards look to the seventh floor screen to
     see an unfolding shot of Big Stan mid-snooze.

                             SECURITY GUARD ONE
               Check out Big Stan...
                       (walkie-talkie)
               Big Stan!

     THE AUCTION AUDITORIUM

     Startled by his walkie-talkie, Big Stan falls back on the
     little chair, crunching it to the ground.

     THE FIRST FLOOR

     The laughing security guards see the crunch.

     INT. THE POWER ROOM

     Alex puts the last of the Monday tapes into a V.C.R.

                             ALEX
               You got about five minutes and
               change.

                             HAWK
               5:32.  "Swinging on a Star."

                             ALEX
               You know they invented something
               while you were inside.  Called a
               watch.

     A freight elevator pings.  Hawk opens it up as the music
     of "Swinging on the Star" kicks in on the soundtrack.

                             HAWK
               "A mule is an animal with long
               funny ears."

                             ALEX
               "He kicks up at anything he
               hears.

     Hawk crams himself into the freight elevator with his
     Glad bag.  Strenuously upbeat Ray Conniffesque singers
     continue to sing the song, orchestrally accompanied, when
     Hawk isn't.

     INT. THE FREIGHT ELEVATOR

     Hawk takes over the song, sardined in the elevator.

                             HAWK
               "Or would you rather swing on a
               star, carry moonbeams home in a
               jar."

     POWER ROOM

     Alex goes up to a Circuit Box and pulls down two large
     Switches.  The soundtrack singers continue to warble.

     THE GUARDS' STATION

     The lights of the floor wobble and die.  The console
     screens blink off.  The Security Guards stop laughing.

                             SECURITY GUARD TWO
               Hell-o.  Check the Power room,
               bud...

     Security Guard One harrumphs into a standing position...

     POWER ROOM

     Alex speedily hooks and rehooks the backs of the V.C.R.S.
     They now all have their PLAY buttons lit up.

                             ALEX
               swing on a star, carry moonbeams...

     OUTSIDE THE POWER ROOM

     Security Guard One fishes for keys to open the power
     room.  The soundtrack singers whisper as not to give away
     Alex.

     INSIDE THE POWER ROOM

     Alex briskly slams back up the switches.

     OUTSIDE THE POWER ROOM

     The singers go louder as the lights come back on.
     Security Guard One harrumphs and heads back to the
     Guards' Station.

     THE AUCTION AUDITORIUM

     Hawk scrambles out of the freight elevator in the left
     wall of the Auditorium, glancing to the clock.

                             HAWK
               "Or would you rather be a fish?"

     He pulls out the black canvas bag from his Glad bag and
     takes out the blueprints.  Hawk follows them toward the
     painting on-stage.

     THE GUARDS' STATION

     Big Stan comes up from behind his fellow guards, dumping
     the remains of the chair on the floor.

                             BIG STAN
                       (moving back off)
               Very funny.

     The Seventh Floor Screen shows a peaceful auction
     auditorium.  And the Blue Chair.

     THE AUCTION AUDITORIUM--CAMERA P.O.V.

     From the exact angle, the viewer sees the current state
     of the room with Hawk flinging off the painting of the
     horseback children, revealing a safe.  But no Blue chair.

     HAWK

     spits on the rubber cup of an electronic sensor, plugged
     into a Walkman, and affixes it to the safe above the
     dial.

                             HAWK
                       (lyric trouble)
               "A fish is annuh nan na nan na
               brook.

     THE FREIGHT ELEVATOR

     Alex is now packed into the freight elevator.

                             ALEX
               "He can't write his name or read
               a book.  To fool people is his
               only thought."

     THE AUCTION AUDITORIUM

                             HAWK
                       (remembering)
               "And though he's slippery, he
               still gets caught."

     Wearing headphones, Hawk cranks up the Walkman and spins
     the dial.  The CLICKS from the dial are so loud he winces
     and turns down the volume.  Then there's a CLUNK.

     THE GUARDS' STATION

     With the soundtrack singers taking over, Guard Two sips
     a cup of coffee.  He doesn't swallow.

     His sights zero in on the Blue Chair on the seventh
     screen.  He looks to the chair remains, then back again.

                             SECURITY GUARD TWO
               Uh, Jerry.  I'm looking at the
               seventh floor and I don't know
               how to say this, I see the Blue
               Chair.

                             SECURITY GUARD ONE
               What the... You think that's weird,
               check out screen two.....

     Screen Two shows THE TWO SECURITY GUARDS THEMSELVES
     hatching open some on-duty beers, going down a hall.
     Guard Two looks to the empties atop the console....

                             SECURITY GUARD TWO
               Somebody rewired the recorders!

     AUCTION AUDITORIUM

     Hawk ditches his accessories and swings the safe door
     open.

     Inside the safe, along with the "holy" Da Vinci music
     cue, is the clay equestrian model from Leonardo's
     worktable.

     Hawk belts out as he put it in the black canvas bag.

                             HAWK
               "And all the monkeys aren't in
               the zoo."

                             ALEX (V.O.)
               "Every day you meet quite a few."

     Alex gives Hawk a congratulatory pat.

                             HAWK AND ALEX
               "So you see it's all up to you.
               You can be better than you are.
               You could be swinging on a star."

     THE AUCTION ROOM

     BIG STAN reconnects the wires of the seventh V.C.R.

     THE GUARDS' STATION

     Suddenly, on the seventh screen, the image and voices
     of Hawk and Alex in-process comes on.

                             SECURITY GUARD ONE
               Shit, let's roll!

     THE AUCTION AUDITORIUM

     Hawk puts the painting back up, but stops to stare at the
     playful children.

                             ALEX
               The song's over!  Come on!
               "You could be swinging on a star."

                             HAWK
               What am I doing here?  There are
               so many things I wanna do that
               aren't this.  Paint a lighthouse.
               Kiss a woman in Italy.

                             ALEX
                       (more frantically)
               "You could be swinging on a star."

                             HAWK
               Paint a woman in a lighthou--I
               don't want to steal a horse.
               Life is...

     Hawk's soliloquy is cut short as Security Guards One and
     Two crash into the auction auditorium.

                             ALEX
                       (DEADPAN)
               "You could be swinging on a star."
               You couldn't have waited to see
               a psychiatrist.  No, you had...

     Alex whips his chair at the floor washer, tipping it
     forward and causing its electrical cord to pull up and
     trip the Guards into a bellyflop.

     Hawk bolts right at the bustling up guards and locks them
     into Alex's thumbcuffs.  He then limbos under their
     connected arms and springs over the outstretched washer
     cord.  The Security Guards clumsily turn and re-trip
     themselves.

                             HAWK
               Let's go down the freight elevator.

     Big Stan suddenly unhatches from the freight elevator.

                             ALEX
               Keep those ideas coming.

     Hawk and Alex run toward an office located at the right
     wall.  They both do a Gene-Kellyesque-chair-tip-over
     before simultaneously bashing through the office door.

     INT. DARKENED AUCTION AUDITORIUM OFFICE

     Hawk and Alex stop in the office to painfully laugh and
     rub their funny bones.  Alex stops laughing.

                             ALEX
               I'm not as unpleasantly plump as
               that Guard am I.

     Big Stan fires off a warning shot.  Hawk and Alex quickly
     tear up a window.

     Moving out on to a ledge, Hawk and Alex look down to the
     huge auction house awning and trade gulps.

     Big Stan wobbles into the mouth of the office door.

                             HAWK AND ALEX
               I got a bad feeling....

                             HAWK
               I can't even swim.

                             ALEX
               Hell, the fall'll probably kill
               ya...

     Big Stan raises his gun.

     Hawk and Alex jump and AAAGH down the face of the
     building....

     Closer and closer to the awning....

     The viewer focuses upon Hawk as he free-falls......

                                                CUT TO:

     RIGHT INTO A LAZ-Y-BOY CHAIR

     Hawk continues his "fall" into a ridiculously huge
     reclining chair.  The foot stand swooshes out with a
     thump.  A HAND pulls away the canvas bag with a cackle.

     INT. GATES APARTMENT--LATE NIGHT

     Hawk's weirdly reclining viewpoint makes Gates and his
     pad more grotesque than they are (No small feat.)
     A sub-Radio Shack stereo coughs next to a scary punch
     bowl of red, margarita-like substance, beneath the
     instantly recognizable framed picture of Those Dogs
     Playing Poker, all atop a Jungle Shag.

     Gates, in shorts and a Hawaiian shirt-over-a-KEEP ON
     TRUCKIN'-T-shirt, raises a loud tumbler with one hand,
     the black canvas bag in the other.

                             GATES
               Hudson Hawkins gets the chair of
               honor.  How about a Gates-arita?
                       (toward bowl)
               I used real hot dogs.

                             HAWK
               Weren't you the bartender at
               Jonestown?

     Suddenly a light is turned on in the corner, revealing a
     seated Cesar and Antony Mario, the latter taking a painful
     Gatesirita sip.

                             CESAR
               Good job, not pretty, but good.

                             HAWK
               Ah, the mafia, the cops; do I know
               how to party or what?

     Gates pulls out the horse and looks at it.

                             GATES
               All this trouble for a horsey.
               I may not know art, but I know
               what I like.

                             HAWK
                       (to Dog picture)
               You certainly do.

                             GATES
               So when's that Sebastian-Cabot-
               Buckingham-Palace-looking-
               Butlerhead getting here?

                             ALFRED
               Any minute now, dear Mr. Gates.

     A malevolently snobbish British Butler, ALFRED, enters in
     distaste.  He makes a stressful glance to three VANITY
     FAIRS on a coffeetable that has a photo of a MAGNETIC
     HUSBAND-WIFE-DOG COMBO with the caption: MAYFLOWER POWER.
     Hawk notices this.

                             GATES
               Oh, sorry Jeeves.  Gates-arita?

                             ALFRED
               I'll pass.  May I?

     Alfred takes the equestrian model and with a jeweler's
     loupe, studies it carefully.

                             ALFRED
               Ah, such craftsmanship.  Leonardo
               Da Vinci's last commission for the
               Duke of Milan.  Irreplaceable.

                             GATES
               Hey, Mr. French, I'm delirious
               for you.  Now where's my cut?

     With dignity, Alfred SMASHES the ancient horse over
     Gates's head.  Alfred rummages through the debris
     REVEALING a perversely labyrinthine CRYSTAL PIECE.
     (recognizable from Da Vinci's workshop).

                             GATES
               You son-of-a......I don't believe
               this!  You come into my house!

     Alfred pockets the goodies, but not before Hawk can give
     them a confused peruse.

                             GATES
               I ought to take Big Ben and shove
               it up your limey blimey bunghole!

     A blade slides down Alfred's arm.  Half-yawning, he...

     ALFRED'S 180 DEGREE POV

     spins before Gates and the bystanders behind him.
     THE BLADE goes back up Alfred's arm.

     The room's only sound is the stereo's inappropriate
     music.  Gates shrugs but his voice is off.

                             GATES
               Like I said.  Where's my cu-u-...

     Suddenly a line across Gates's neck turns red and blood
     begins to gush like a tourist attraction.  Gates crashes
     down upon the table holding the punch bowl and the stereo,
     sending it to the ground, cutting off the music.  The Dog
     Poker picture falls atop the carnage like a lid.

     Blown away, Hawk tries to wiggle his way out of the
     recliner.  Alfred pats some stain remover on the blood
     on his shirt.

                             ALFRED
               So much for his "cut."
                       (post-chortle)
               Excuse my dry British humor.

                             CESAR
                       (rising)
               Lovely work, Alfred, taking the
               Concorde back?

                             ALFRED
               Indeed I am, Mr. Mario.  I'm
               really racking up those frequent
               flyer points...

                             HAWK
               I hate to interrrupt you two
               lovebirds...

                             ANTONY
               You know, I think Gates promised
               Hawk a cut, too....

     The Mario brothers cackle out.  Hawk tries to flail out
     of his chair.  Alfred turns to him and flicks up his arm.
     Hawk sees his life pass before his eyes until he realizes
     Alfred is merely pulling him up off the chair.

                             ALFRED
               Ta ta, Hudson Hawk.

                             HAWK
                       (breathless)
               Too-do-loo, babe.

     INT. ALEX'S RESTAURANT--DAWN

     Hawk bursts into the bar.  Alex sits on a stool, reading
     the paper.

                             ALEX
               Did I miss anything?

                             HAWK
               Oh, not much.  Gates just had his
               tonsils taken out.  The hard way.
         
                             ALEX
               Geez, Gates was killed.  Who do we
               send the thank you note to?
         
     Hawk does a combat jump over the bar and begins to fiddle
     with the cappuccino machine.

                             HAWK
               The Butler did it.  Guy was a cross
               between Alistair Cook and a Cuisinart.
               Dude took Mr. Ed and humptied
               dumptied it over Gates's head.  He
               said it was made by, get this,
               Leonardo..

                             ALEX
                       (professorial)
               Ah yes, a rare Renaissance piece.
               Da Vinci's "Sforza," an equestrian
               model of a never executed statue.
               I consider it to be the prize of
               tonight's auction of objets
               d'equestrian.  Horse things.

     The cappuccino machine sparks.  A perplexed Hawk takes
     a couple extra seconds to back off.

                             HAWK
               Okay, you got me, Mr. PBS.

                             ALEX
                       (holding up newspaper)
               Morning edition.  Seems two thieves
               "attempted" to steal it last night,
               but thanks to three "courageous"
               guards, it will be ready for tonight.

                             HAWK
               "Attempted."  At-tempt-ted!  I'm
               not happy about having to steal
               that horse, but I do have my
               pride.  Face it, when it comes to
               burglary, and sex, I....

     Hawk takes the newspaper.  There is a picture of the
     Three Security Guards in a cheery pose behind the
     "Sforza."  Hawk squints to see that Security Guards One
     and Two are still wearing the thumbcuffs.

                             HAWK
               Boing.  Uh, this I don t understand...

                             ALEX
               Why try?

                             HAWK
                       (hurdling the bar)
               Because I'm tired of not
               understanding things.  Cops,
               Mafia, and butlers forcing me to
               bust my ass to steal something,
               which it turns out I really didn't
               steal--it's fucked up.

                             ALEX
                       (pulling back newspaper)
               You re not thinking of going to...

                             HAWK
               Alex, my man, it's time to play a
               little offense.  Where's your tux?

     INT. RUTHERFORD'S AUCTION HOUSE--NIGHT

     Dressed in a not-quite-fitting but suave tuxedo, Hawk
     enters the now well-lit auction house auditorium (chairs
     all set out).  Bored WORKMEN in coveralls lug equestrian
     items on to a podium from the familiar freight elevator.

                             ECCENTRIC BALD AUCTIONEER
               ...fan-taas-tic example of
               Florentine marble... Who will start
               at 160,000...160,000......180,000.

     Someone raises their paddle as Hawk passes beneath the
     hanging horses and finds an aisle seat near the stage.
     Hawk scans everyone in the room before coming to the one
     seated next to him, AN ENCHANTINGLY BEAUTIFUL WOMAN.

                             HAWK
               All these years of attending auctions,
               I still get goosebumps.  The paintings,
               the sculptures....the things that
               aren't really paintings or sculptures...

                             THE WOMAN
               .... the pretentious vultures who
               don't even look up from their
               calculators to see what they're
               buying.  Now that gives me
               goosebumps.  Auctions are
               disgusting.

                             HAWK
               I couldn't agree more.  Savages.

     The Woman laughs at his gear switch then catches herself.

                             ECCENTRIC BALD AUCTIONEER
               Lot Fifteen, an equestrian sconce
               attributed to the Cellini school..

     AUCTION ENTRANCE

     Big Stan, the hefty guard from the heist, enters the area
     wearing a blue ribbon.

     AUCTION AREA

     Big Stan is walking in back of the seated bidders:  An
     oblivious Hawk in the foreground starts to scan VARIED
     BIDDER-TYPES, raising their paddles to babble out dollar
     figures; a GAUDY ROCK STAR and his GLOOMY-CHIC ENTOURAGE,
     A KING FAROUK-TYPE with a BORED TEENAGE AMERICAN HOOKER,
     and a scary NORDIC PRINCESS in a monocle and a tiara.

     THREE STANDING ASSISTANTS frantically man a table of
     phones set up down before the stage.  One raises his
     arm.

                             ECCENTRIC BALD AUCTIONEER
               Sold!  To the caller from
               Newfoundland.

     A STYLISH FEMALE ASSISTANT takes out an impressive replica
     of the "Sforza" from the safe behind the podium and brings
     it to the Auctioneer.  The crowd a-a-hs... Hawk laughs
     and shakes his head.

                             ECCENTRIC BALD AUTIONEER
               And finally, Lot number 17,
               thought to be lost in the war,
               and again last night, the Da
               Vinci "Sforza," the jewel of the
               sale.  Fan-taas-tic...

                             HAWK
                       (re: Auctioneer)
               Is looking like a constipated
               warthog a prerequisite to getting
               a job in the art world?

                             ECCENTRIC BALD AUCTIONEER
               There have naturally been questions
               of its authenticity, so to verify
               we have Doctor Anna Baragli of the
               Vatican.  Doc?

                             ANNA
                       (rising, to Hawk)
               Some of us warthogs are more
               constipated than others.

     Hawk uneasily laughs as Anna makes her way up the stage
     and pulls out a large magnifying glass.  A look of
     distress passes over her face.  Hawk closes his eyes in
     anticipation.

                             HAWK
               Oh, the shit is going to hit the
               fa--

                             ANNA
                       (suddenly serene)
               Fantastic.  Perfection.  The
               Vatican extends its jealousy to
               the lucky bidder.

                             ECCENTRIC BALD AUCTIONEER
               We'll begin the bidding at 82.5
               million dollars.  To you, sir.
               Eighty-three, Ninety--your bid,
               madame--Ninety point five.....

     Hawk opens his eyes in confusion.  He scans Anna coming
     off the stage, gliding toward the phone table.  Hawk
     floats into the aisle, curling toward her as she picks
     up a phone and murmurs into it.

                             DARWIN MAYFLOWER
               lOO million clams, Francesco!

     The crowd orgasms as Vanity Fair cover boy, DARWIN
     MAYFLOWER works the aisle, playfully mussing up the
     appreciative, tiaraed Princess's hair, giddily high-
     fiving the Rock Star, and sloppily frenching the Hooker.

                             ECCENTRIC BALD AUCTIONEER
               100 million dollars to Mr. Darwin
               Mayflower.

     Hawk turns to gaze at the enigmatically familiar figure.
     Anna looks up from the phone to do the same.  She
     swerves her attention to the back-turned Hawk.

     Darwin moves to one of two reserved empty seats as his
     wife, Minerva, makes her entrance par excellahnce.  She is
     outrageously dressed with a mammoth Tiffany watch that
     extends from her wrist down to, acting as a leash,
     her obnoxious little dog, BUNNY.

                             MINERVA
               Francesco, 100 million and one.

     Darwin, to the crowd's delight, holds his struck heart.

                             DARWIN
               Outbid by my own wench, quelle
               bummere.

                             MINERVA
               Poor baby..... Here, Bunny.

                             ECCENTRIC BALD AUCTIONEER
               Fan-taas-tic, the bid is at 100
               million and one dollars.

     Commencing a slow motion sequence, Big Stan comes out
     of the nearby office, zipping up his fly.  He immedi-
     ately scopes Hawk in the space before the stage.

     The Mayflowers lower themselves into their seats with
     devoured canary smiles.

                             ECCENTRIC BALD AUCTIONEER
               Go-ing!

     Big Stan pulls out his gun, untheatrically, as not to
     cause a scene.  Anna sees this and follows Big Stan's
     eyeline to Hawk.

     Hawk turns to re-pursue but stops dead at the sight of
     the gloating Big Stan.

                             ECCENTRIC BALD AUCTIONEER
               Go-ing!

     Big Stan launches a gallop toward Hawk, who spins and
     veers back round up the aisle.

     The Mayflowers zero their sights on the activity.

                             ECCENTRIC BALD AUCTIONEER
               Gone!

     The gavel comes down in super slow-motion.

     Anna's leg pokes out of the aisle, tripping the guard.

     Hawk brakes at the end of the Mayflower's row and smiles
     in relief, casually turning to Darwin and Minerva.

     The gavel continues to come down in super slow-motion.

     Both Darwin and Minerva Mayflower suddenly DUCK DOWN.

     Smile vanishing, Hawk spins toward the stage.

     The Gavel hits.

     Breaking out of slow-motion into wide-angle, the entire
     podium explodes sending debris, equestrian pieces, and
     eccentric bald pieces searing into the screaming,
     battered crowd.

     Knocked off his feet, Hawk gropes into a standing
     position.  He sees the Mayflowers make a smooth exit.
     He starts to give chase until he sees a battered Anna
     rising from the ground.

     A hanging white Tri-Star Pegasus, cracks from the
     damaged ceiling and swooshes down towards Anna.

     Hawk bolts upon some auction chairs and makes a flying
     leap.  He slams Anna out of the Pegasus's pulverizing
     Path.  They weary up off the ground and move down the
     aisle, calm in a storm of packed art patrons.

                             ANNA
               My God, that was bold of you,
               you didn't have to do that...

                             HAWK
               Forget about it--it was nothing--
               anybody would have done the same
               thing--It's an impulse...

                             ANNA
               No, I meant you didn't have to
               tackle me and rip my dress.  A
               polite push, perhaps?  A clear
               shout of "watch out, Anna"
               would have done nicely...

                             HAWK
               Excuse me, Milady.  I would have
               flown over and carried you up to
               a pink cloud, but I left my cape
               at the cleaners.

     Anna touches Hawk's lips and laughs.

                             ANNA
                       ("Hey, I was kidding")
               Thanks tough guy, thanks a lot.
               Why was the guard chasing you?

                             HAWK
                       (Serious answer?
                        Na-a-h?)
               Because Danger, Doc, is my middle...

     Before Hawk can finish, a hanging horse out of nowhere
     hammers him into the ground and the viewer into
     darkness.

     FADE IN:

     INT. VAN-TYPE AMBULANCE--NIGHT

     Hawk stirs into consciousness strapped on an elevated
     gurney.

                             HAWK
               Saint Pete, hey I know, the whole
               cat burglar thing, it sounds bad,
               but I'll take the worst cloud you
               got...

     Hawk's eyes focus.  The Mario Brothers hover over him.

                             CESAR
               News flash.  You're not in
               heaven.  Yet.  30 seconds and
               counting, if you know what I'm
               saying.  Couldn't just play along,
               could you...

     EXT. THE BROOKLYN BRIDGE--NIGHT

     The ambulance careens onto the Brooklyn Bridge.

     INT. INSIDE THE AMBULANCE

     Antony raises up a mammoth gun.

                             HAWK
               Pretty class way of covering your
               tracks.  I think that auctioneer
               landed at La Guardia.

                             ANTONY
               Subtlety was never one of our
               strong points.

                             HAWK
               Neither's flossing.

     A confused Antony touches his teeth with his gun hand.
     Hawk escapes from one of his straps and launces a nearby
     trayful of syringes into Antony's face where they ghoul-
     ishly quiver.  Antony fires a wild shot, shattering the
     partition.

     FRONT SEAT OF THE AMBULANCE

     The Scarfaced Bodyguard/Driver, now in paramedic white,
     freaks at the starred windshield.

     THE BROOKLYN BRIDGE

     The ambulance bumper-pools off some innocent cars.

     INSIDE THE AMBULANCE

     Hawk frantically tries to undo his other strap but a
     howling Cesar, side-stepping his vibrating-on-the-floor
     brother, latches onto the back of the gurney and wrenches
     it backward.

     OUTSIDE BACK OF AMBULANCE

     The elevated gurney blasts out the back with a now
     unstrapped but terrified Hawk whoa-a-ing atop it.

     The gurney wheels hit the road, sparking.

     A sheet from the gurney, caught on the door, yanks TAUGHT
     --Hawk is "water skiing" on his stomach atop the elevated
     gurney!

     Screeching cars are weirded out by the new vehicle on the
     road.

     THE GURNEY

     Battered by wind and fear, Hawk clutches to the gurney
     and the sheet with a grit teeth stoneface.

     The sheet is torn from the gurney sending it rocketing
     off to the side on its own crazed volition.

     Hawk skis toward a TOLL BOOTH WITH A LARGE GATE-ARM.

                             HAWK
               Life don't get much better than
               this.

     He then sees he's heading toward an EXACT CHANGE lane.

     Whizzing wildly forward on the gurney, Hawk scrambles
     into his pocket and wiggles out some change.  He fran-
     tically winnows out some pennies and then maniacally
     FLINGS the change from twenty feet away.

     TOLL BOOTH

     The change ker-chunks into the basket and Hawk and the
     gurney JUST BARELY streak underneath the rising Gate-arm.

     EXT. THE AMBULANCE

     CRASHES through a gate-arm of another lane.  Hawk and the
     still-wildly whooshing gurney cut it off.

     FRONT SEAT OF THE AMBULANCE

     Cesar pops his head through the partition.

                             CESAR
               Make him into Roadkill!

     Antony, seemingly oblivious to the syringes porcupined in
     his skull, pokes his head next to Cesar's.

                             ANTONY
               Yeah, run him down!

     Cesar and the Bodyguard/Driver turn to Antony and scream,
     then all three look out the windshield and scream.

     THE AMBULANCE

     jackknifes over a stopped car and somersaults into a
     fiery ball.

     In the foreground, Hawk's gurney coasts down

     A PEACEFUL OFF-ROAD

     Hawk, with an unchanged expression of pure white knuckle
     fear, comes to a tranquil gurney-wheels-gently-squeaking
     stop.

     Lit by the flames of the ambulance crash, a sneering
     young man in wire rim glasses emerges from the darkness,
     carrying a steel suitcase.  He kneels before Hawk and
     opens the suitcase revealing a complex computer appara-
     tus.  He begins mumbling into a cellular phone.

     A malevolent, SILENT DEADPAN WRAITH passes him and
     approaches Hawk.  Both men are dressed in outfits that
     seem to be a melange of fascist uniform and haute
     couture.

     On the fingers of one Wraith hand is carved the word
     HATE.  On the other hand is the word FROG.  The Frog Hand
     hands a befuddled Hawk a card.  It reads: MY NAME IS KIT
     KAT AND THIS IS NOT A DREAM.

     Hawk looks up with a "huh" expression as Kit Kat chops
     his neck, knocking him off the gurney.

     The sneering computer guy hangs up his phone and pulls
     forward a small cattle prod from his apparatus.

                             HAWK
               This is the worst night...

                             SNICKERS
               When it rains, it pours.  Name's
               Snickers.  The plane leaves in 40.

     Snickers zaps Hawk in the leg with his device.  Hawk a-
     a-ghs into a kneeling position.  Snickers returns to his
     suitcase and is passed by a PLEASANT YOUNG BLACK WOMAN in
     the "outfit."

                             ALMOND JOY
               Almond Joy.  I know, pretty silly.
               But it's better than when we first
               started out, our code names were
               Diseases.  You don't know what
               it's like being called Clymidia
               for a year.
                       (walking off)
               Whoops, forgot....

     She deftly kicks Hawk across the face.  Hawk angrily
     bounds back up until he sees the BIGGEST MEMBER OF THE
     GROUP Fe-Fi-Fo-Fum his way toward them.  Suddenly, the
     Giant clumsily trips over Snickers' suitcase apparatus
     and ram-collapses into Hawk and the gurney.  Laying atop
     Hawk, Butterfinger goofily speaks...

                             BUTTERFINGER
               My name's Butterfinger.

                             HAWK
               No shit.

     The mysterious group parts to reveal a much more mature
     and cynically subdued man dressed in big lapels and a hat
     that screams Old Time CIA.  His name will be GEORGE
     KAPLAN.

                             KAPLAN
               Don't you just hate kids...

                             ALMOND JOY
               George, you promised.  No Old CIA/
               New CIA jokes...

                             KAPLAN
               I call them the MTV.I.A.  Punks
               think Bay of Pigs is an herbal tea.
               They think the Cold War involves
               penguins and...

                             HAWK
               Don't I know you...

                             KAPLAN
               You just might.  I'm the guy who
               tricked you into robbing a
               government installation and then
               had you sent to prison for it.  At
               the time, I was bald with a beard,
               no moustache, and I had a different
               nose, so if you don't recognize me,
               I won't be offended.

                             HAWK
               Bastard, you're going to need
               another nose!

     Hawk explodes upward.  Everyone but cool Kaplan draws a
     gun.

                             HAWK
               But I'm not the type of guy to
               hold a grudge.

                             KAPLAN
               I used you as a diversion.  while
               you were getting captured upstairs,
               I was shredding documents in the
               basement.  Deep down, I guess I
               was just jealous.  You were one
               incredible thief...

                             HAWK
               To what do I owe the dishonor of a
               reunion, you centrally intelligent
               scumsicle.

     As Kaplan converses, Snickers and Butterfinger bring out
     a mammoth empty suitcase and open it behind Hawk.

                             KAPLAN
               I Want to make things up to you.
               That's why I got you this gig,
               doll.  Hawk, my name's George
               Kaplan and to quote the late,
               great Karen Carpenter, "We've only
               just begun."

                             HAWK
               Three minutes, twenty-three
               seconds.  If you think I'm doing
               another...

                             KAPLAN
               Hush.  My employer wants a meeting.

                             HAWK
               Employer?  The president?

                             KAPLAN
               No, somebody powerful.  Oh.  Look.
               what's that up there?

                             HAWK
               I'm supposed to fall for that?

                             KAPLAN
               Shucks.  Guess not.

     Kaplan savagely point-blank punches Hawk in the face,
     knocking him out cold and into the mammoth suitcase.
     Snickers slams it shut revealing a KENNEDY INTERNATIONAL
     sticker.

     INT. MYSTERIOUS BARE ROOM--DAY

     Hawk slowly awakens on an exotic couch.  He has been put
     in an aggressively fashionable Italian outfit.  He eyes
     and touches his new duds with complete bafflement.  He
     then stumbles into a standing position to, mouth gaping,
     take in a wondrous 360 degree view of Rome, Italy as "O
     Solo Mio" blares on the soundtrack.

                             HAWK
               No.  Way.

     Hawk's spinning view and the music on the soundtrack slam
     to a halt as he zeroes in on the sight of Scary Butler
     Alfred elegantly reaching the top of the staircase.

                             ALFRED
               Welcome to Rome, sir.

                             HAWK
               Yes way.

     EXT. OUTSIDE INTERESTING BUILDING--DAY

     Alfred opens the back door of an omnipotent, Mayflower-
     logoed LIMOUSINE.  The car moves off as Hawk slides in...

     INT. THE BACK SEAT OF THE MAX-TECH LIMOUSINE

     facing Darwin Mayflower who is blustering into the
     cellular.

     While he talks, Darwin shakes Hawk's bewildered hand,
     then holding up one finger in a "be with you in a sec"
     facial move.

                             DARWIN
               For those kind of wages, I could
               have built the factory in America!
               They're Vietnamese, can't we just
               give them more Bart Simpson shirts?
               I hear depressing news like this
               and I want to commit genocide!
                       (slamming phone)
               Alfred, hold my calls.  So, Hawk!
               The Hawkster!  What do you think
               of the vehicle?

                             HAWK
               You could host American Bandstand
               in here.  Why did you duck at the
               auction, asshole?

                             DARWIN
               Because I didn't want to get hurt,
               taterhead.

     A FAX MACHINE comes to life as Darwin babbles.

                             DARWIN
               What can I tell you, I'm the
               villain.  Initially it was a
               priority to keep a lot of buffers
               between you and me, but since most
               of them are dead now, I thought
               what the heck.  Hawk, you come
               highly recommended.  I would have
               done some things differently at
               the auction house, but hey, I want
               to be in business with you.

     Darwin scans the Fax message with annoyance, and then
     shoves it into a violent paper shredder.

     OUTSIDE THE LIMO SHREDDER

     Shredded paper litters out of a vent on the outside door.

     INSIDE THE LIMOUSINE

     A simmering Hawk tries to explode but the phone rings.

                             HAWK
               My life is not some deal.  I...

                             ALFRED (O.S.)
               It's Boston, Mr. Mayflower.

                             DARWIN
               I'm sorry, I have to take this.
               Those are valid points though...

     Darwin picks up the phone and goes Mr. Hyde, while giving
     Hawk "Can you believe this guy"-type gestures.

                             DARWIN
               You better have a good excuse...
               You better have a better excuse!
               You are so weak!  I'm only
               thankful your ancestors didn't
               settle America or else my name
               would be Running Brave or Vomiting
               Antelope...Really.  Well, listen
               close, babe.

     Darwin holds the phone over a 50 cent piece-size siren in
     his armrest.  Darwin presses a button and a PIERCING
     NOISE fills the car as it comes to a stop.

                             DARWIN
               Shall we?

     Darwin bolts out.  Hawk hangs back, waiting for Rod
     Serling to explain things, then bolts out too.

     EXT. E.U.R. DISTRICT BUILDING--DAY

     Hawk and Darwin head up the steps of an overpowering
     fascistly marble superstructure.  Alfred brings up the
     rear.

                             DARWIN
               So Hawkasaurus, I won't mince
               words...

                             HAWK
               Whatever.  You own Boardwalk, you
               own Park Place, you own the four
               railroads.  You think you're God.
               For all I know, you're probably
               right.  I just wanted to have a
               damn cappuccino, maybe play some
               Nintendo after I find out what it
               is.  Man, why didn't you just buy
               the horse?  What am I saying, you
               did buy it...

                             DARWIN
               Oh... Let's see.  There are
               organizations that think we wanted
               the "Sforza" for reasons other
               than putting it in the Da Vinci
               museum we're building in Vinci.
               Hopefully, these organizations
               think our plan has been ruined
               with the explosion of our replica.
               If I seem vague, grand.  We want a
               low profile on this, that's why I
               got Kaplan and the Candy bars
               involved.  I helped George help
               the Mario Brothers and Gates help
               get you out....

                             HAWK
               If you're pausing for a "thank you,"
               give it up.  So boss, you going to
               tell me what the crystal piece
               inside the pony means?

                             DARWIN
               Way to go, Alfie!  How many people
               did you break that thing in front
               of.   Good help's hard to find.

                             HAWK
               I guess that's a no.

     INT. MASSIVE CONFERENCE ROOM--DAY

     A mind-blowingly pretentious painting of Darwin, Minerva,
     and Bunny hangs above a mammoth M-shaped conference table.

     Lying atop the table in heels, shades, and a heart-
     stopping dark outfit is Minerva.  NASTY Metal riffs semi-
     audibly spew from a headset she wears.

     Surrounding the table is a VARIED GROUP OF OLD MONEY AND
     NEW MONEY BOARD MEMBERS ranging from a nine year old
     INDIAN PRINCE to a SWEET ELDERLY AMERICAN WOMAN.  They
     converse to the person at their side in businesslike
     tones, oblivious to Minerva.

                             DARWIN
               Ladies and gentlemen of the board...

     The board members go into tableau silence.  Minerva con-
     tinues a brief sing-a-long before Darwin scolds...

                             DARWIN
               And Min-er-va.  Let's give it up
               for Hudson Hawk.

     The board applauds as Alfred pushes Hawk inside.

                             MINERVA
               Hello......Bunny, Ball-Ball!

     Minerva lobs a ball in the air.  Bunny, the annoying dog,
     scurries beside Hawk to catch it.

     Moving down toward the other end of the table, Hawk takes
     in the surreal surroundings with battle fatigue.  He sees
     ONE BOARD MEMBER take a luxurious sip of cappuccino.
     Minerva paces up upon the table.

                             DARWIN
               Hawkmeister, we got you clothes,
               great hotel, and a 250,000 lira
               per diem.

                             MINERVA
               That's two hundred dollars a day?
               So he can get a hooker and some
               tequila.  Veto, Darwin.

                             HAWK
               Guess I know who wears the penis
               in this family.

                             MINERVA
                       (jumping off table)
               For God's sake, chain this
               convict.

     With a yawn, Alfred pulls out a pair of state-of-the-art
     handcuffs.

                             HAWK
               Alfred, you're a very polite
               psychopath, but if you...

     Hawk kicks out at Alfred, who nimbly moves slightly and
     gives a pummel to Hawk's body somersaulting him over the
     edge of the table, into an empty seat.

     The Board Members politely applaud.  Alfred pulls Hawk's
     hands around his back and cuffs him.  Bunny intensely
     sniffs his crotch.

                             MINERVA
               We want Da Vinci's sketchbook,
               what do they call it, the Codex.

                             DARWIN
               Listen Hawk, this might be hard to
               believe, but I'm a regular joe.  I
               just want to be happy and happiness
               comes from the achieving of goals.
               It's just when you make your first
               billion by the age of 19, it's
               hard to keep coming up with new
               ones.  But now finally I got my
               new goal.  World domination.  With
               your help...Bunny....quit that!

                             MINERVA
               Bunny, ball-ball!  Bad bunny!

                             HAWK
               Think he's already got today's
               ball-balls.  Five more minutes
               please, it's been so long...

     Minerva yanks away the yelping dog.

                             HAWK
               Anybody have a cigarette?  But
               seriously, do me a favor and
               Concorde me back to prison.  I
               don't care anymore.  I hope you
               have the receipts for the threads.

                             MINERVA
               You go back, you won't be alone.
               You'll have a diabetic barkeep
               cellmate.  You're still young
               enough to have fun shanking child
               molesters for a pack of smokes,
               but "Alex" will go in knowing that
               the next time he gets out it'll be
               to attend his own funeral.
               Depressing.

                             HAWK
               You wouldn't risk the dime to call
               the police.  You have no proof.

                             DARWIN
               Ah, the magic word...

     Alfred plants a slide machine on the table and Darwin
     starts clicking gorgeous images of Hawk and Alex robbing
     the auction house, on a bare wall.

     The Board members gush.  The Elderly Woman gives a
     thumbs-up.

                             DARWIN
               It's veja du, Hawkhead.  Something
               you wish never happened.  We shot
               the entire operation with hidden
               cameras behind the hidden cameras.
               Hired the guy who did the last
               Sports Illustrated Swimsuit issue.
               Excellent work... whoops, damn
               Fotomat assholes...

     A slide hits the wall of himself and Minerva kneeling in
     Big Baby clothes with Alfred snarling over them, decked
     out in leather.  He clicks ahead...

     Hawk looks away and sees that the Board members have an
     annual Report-type booklet in front of them that reads--
     THE DA VINCI/ALCHEMY PROJECT.

     Minerva leans over in front of him.

                             MINERVA
               Tomorrow, you're going to hit a
               church.

                                               CUT TO:

     EXT. A MASSIVE WIDE SHOT OF ST. PETER'S--DAY

     The Vatican stands in its glory, mobbed by HUNDREDS OF
     LOCALS AND SIGHTSEERS.  The viewer's viewpoint zeroes in
     on the Mayflower limousine circling around it.

     INT. THE LIMOUSINE

     Hawk looks out from the back seat of the limousine
     in stylish Italian sunglasses.

                             HAWK
               I'm robbing the Vatican.  The nuns
               at St. Agnes predicted that I'd end
               up doing this...

     Two identical Twin Flunkies sit across from him, grinning
     stupidly.  Hawk pushes up his sunglasses with his middle
     finger.

     INT. VATICANESQUE MAP ROOM

     Mentally casing the joint, Hawk gets some distance
     between him and the flunkies as he enters into a room
     that has a glorious, ancient Map of the World Mural.

     INT. ANOTHER VATICAN ROOM

     Hawk makes a scribble in a notepad before coming to a
     Vatican guard, standing before a painting of a Pope
     performing a Coronation.

                             HAWK
                       (half-hearted)
               Excuse me, I'm being blackmailed
               into robbing the Vatican by a
               psychotic American corporation
               along with a CIA...

                             VATICAN GUARD
               "You're being".....uh, I don't,
               uh...

     A jaded Hawk laughs and pats the cop on the back.

                             HAWK
               Forget it, man.  Go tackle a
               jaywalker.

     INT./EXT. CIRCULAR OPEN AIR HALLWAY

     Hawk comes out onto a circular open-air hallway.  He
     scans up to some rooftops and makes a note...until he
     sees a line of International Phone Boothettes.  Checking
     for Flunkies, he rips one up.

                             HAWK
               Operator, I want to make a collect
               call to Alex Messina, New York....

     The Flunkies drift into view.  Hawk hangs up and seethes
     off.

     INT. HALLWAY LEADING TO CODEX ROOM

     Hawk saunters down a long resplendent hallway toward a
     room at the end bustling with excitement.  Coming to the
     mouth of the room, he looks to two gold framed mirrors on
     either side of the opening, rubs his head, and scribbles.

     INSIDE THE CODEX ROOM

     Hawk takes in the majestic beauty, and practical details,
     of the room--windows, statues, a Massive Ornate Lighting
     Fixture--as he moves down one of the twin winding stair-
     cases leading to a path of people behind velvet ropes and
     the object of their gaze...

     THE DA VINCI CODEX

     --an old book enclosed in a glass case, propped open to
     the familiar BEAUTIFUL DRAWING of a MAN inside a CIRCLE.

     The case is located between two informational tablets
     enclosed in glass columns.  Enter Holy Da Vinci theme.

                             ANNA (V.O.)
               But it is his gift as an inventor
               who drew together science and art
               that is most incredible.

     Hawk brightens to the return of Anna, carrying a portfolio
     bag, striding down the stairs with a group of INVESTORS
     AND FAMILIES.  She brightens back, giving him a quick
     verbal breath and a hand squeeze.

                             ANNA
               Tough guy.  What are you--How's
               your head.

                             HAWK
                       (vegetable)
               Yes, and my giraffe loves it, too...

     She laughs, going into her public voice.

                             ANNA
               As you know, the Da Vinci Codex,
               has lived in the Vatican for
               centuries and will continue to
               live here for centuries more.

                             HAWK
                       (under his breath)
               That's what you theenk.

                             ANNA
               Question, sir?   His untiring pen
               predicted the airplane, the
               submarine, the bicycle, the
               helicopter, and even the tank.
         
     A LITTLE BRAT trailing the group, moves next to Hawk,
     bitching away to her STUFFED ELEPHANT, POKEY.

                             LITTLE BRAT
               This is so bor-ing!  Do you hate
               Italy as much as I do, Pokey?
                       (bad ventriloquism)
               Si, senor!  Italy sucks the big
               one!  why can't we go to the Epcot
               Center!

     The Little Brat stops and lets Pokey the elephant dangle
     from her side.  Hawk eyes the elephant strangely.

                             ANNA
               These more dangerous designs
               inspired him to develop a secret
               code that ....

     The stuffed elephant suddenly goes flying over Anna's
     head.

     The ALARM goes off.  The Massive Ornate Lighting Fixture
     swoops down from the ceiling, inverting in air, and slams
     down over the Codex, transformed into a makeshift cage.

     Strange green gas comes billowing out of the vents.
     Needless to say, everyone goes crazy.

     Coughing gas, Hawk peeks to see that a line of light
     sensor alarms imbedded in the tablets are what set the
     alarm off.

     Two GAS MASKS drop airlinesquely from the mouth of the
     entranceway and TWO RACING-IN GUARDS wrangle them on.

     The Little Brat sees that Pokey the stuffed elephant has
     been beheaded by the cage/lamp.  She is pulled away and
     spanked.

                             LITTLE BRAT
               Pokey, come back!

     Anna yanks a notetaking Hawk away as the gas blusters in
     around him.  The Two Flunkies, eyes on Hawk, are hap-
     lessly making their way up the opposite staircase.

                             ANNA
               Come on, this stuff will knock you
               out.  Have you ever had the feeling
               you were being followed, Mr. Bond.

                             HAWK
               Never, why do you ask?

     Reaching the top of the stairs, just outside the door,
     Anna briskly pulls Hawk into a PIECE OF WALL THAT IS
     REALLY A DOOR.  The wall closes as the Flunkies come
     flying out, baffled.

     INT. CIRCULAR STAIRCASE

     Hawk, mucho impressed, and Anna move down a tight, dark
     circular staircase.

                             HAWK
               Whoa.  Name's Hawkins, Eddie
               Hawkins.
               My nickname's Hudson Hawk, but don't
               call me Hudson, not even as a joke.
               The Nuns at St. Agnes called me
               that and they're the ones who
               helped make me what I am today.
               Not a compliment...

                             ANNA
               Sure Hudson.  Are you going to
               tell me why you did that back there
               or are you going to blame it
               on Dumbo?

                             HAWK
               Could you believe that crazy
               elephant?

     Anna shakes her head as she opens a door into...

     INT. A LITTLE UNDERGROUND SUBWAY--DAY

     A four foot high mail train rumbles down the track of a
     mini-underground station.  Workers latch onto mail bags.
     Hawk and Anna emerge from a small door.

                             HAWK
               Whoa, part 2.  Does it go to Times
               Square?

                             ANNA
               Delivers up to ten at night.  The
               Pope has an obsession with his
               Easter Seals.  It's actually not
               that an unusual set-up.  The
               secret passageway on the other
               hand....

                             HAWK
               The Vatican is made of constant
               mysteries meant to be enjoyed,
               not explained.

                             ANNA
               Nice.  But right out of our
               brochure.

                             HAWK
               Oh, you read that.

                             ANNA
               Actually I wrote it.  It's a good
               sentence.  It can apply to people.

                             HAWK
               You're not an unmysterious thang
               yourself.

                             ANNA
               I don't steal stuffed elephants
               from little girls.
                       (smoothing his
                        jacket)
               And I buy my own clothes.  My
               life's a little boring...

                             HAWK
               God, I wish I could say the same
               thing.  What about having a nice,
               dull dinner with me tonight.
               Scrabble, Knock-knock jokes,
               Anecdotes about famous dead
               Italians....

                             ANNA
               I'll bring my entire repertoire...

     The Two Flunkies stumble into the station, looking
     around.  Anna and Hawk crouch down.

                             HAWK
               And I'll bring my entourage...

                             ANNA
               Secret passageways don't mean as
               much as they used to.  There's
               a place two blocks east of here.
               Enzo's.  Say 10:30.

                             HAWK
               Said.

     Hawk and Anna peck each other with a smile.  He crawls
     out an exit door.  As he leaves, Anna's smile disappears.
     She pulls out a rosary and gives herself a self-scolding
     bang on the head.  She then darts to a large crucifix
     and looks up.

                             ANNA
               Father, it's obvious.  He's up to
               something.

     Suddenly a speaker in Jesus's mouth gently crackles.

                             JESUS (Italian)
               Report downstairs at once.

                             ANNA
               Yes, sir.

     INT. CATACOMBLIKE AREA

     A CARDINAL paces in an enigmatic Vatican area.  Anna
     clacks up to him.

                             CARDINAL
               Did he mention the Mayflowers?

                             ANNA
               No, your Eminence.  I think he's
               going to steal the Codex, as
               early as next week.

                             CARDINAL
               Attempt, you mean.  The vanity
               of this man, Hudson Hawk.  The
               Vatican has foiled the advances
               of Pirates and Terrorists.  We
               will not lie down for some
               schmuck from New Jersey.  Must
               you flirt with him so realistically?

                             ANNA
               That's the best kind.  A wise
               woman once said "Polite
               conversation is rarely either."

                             CARDINAL
                       (chuckling)
               Let me be the one to quote
               Scripture.  ....As an agent of
               our organization, you are put in
               awkward situations.  Just
               remember, Hudson Hawk is an evil,
               evil man.

                             ANNA
                       (unconvinced)
               Yeah.  The big E.

     EXT. NAVONA PIAZZA--DAY

     The evil Hawk clumsily strides around a fountain, looking
     off in all directions, soft-shoes past some sedate
     painters and swings into...

     INT. A BIG QUIRKY PHONE BOOTH

     Hawk grabs up the phone and dials....

                             HAWK
               Hello, operator.  I'd like to
               make a collect call to New York
               number...

     The Mayflower limousine creeps to the edge of the piazza,
     behind an oblivious Hawk.

                             HAWK
               Thank you, operator, thank you.

     Hawk turns, putting a finger in his ear.  Seeing the
     limo, he FREAKS and balls himself into a corner.

                             HAWK
               Come on, Alex, pick up, you
               Reindeer goat cheese-eating
               motherfucker.

     INT. ALEX'S RESTAURANT--NIGHT

     It is late night in New York.  A phone rings atop the
     bar of Alex's restaurant with no one in sight.

     INT. PIAZZA--DAY

     Hawk pokes his head to see a Darwin and Minerva (holding
     Bunny) emerge from the limousine.  As he turns his con-
     centration back to the phone, ALEX HIMSELF flows out from
     a building to cheerfully speak with Darwin and Minerva
     and get licked by Bunny, before they all pile into the
     limo.

                             HAWK
               A-lex, A-lex, come on Alex.

     Hawk slams down the phone and turns to see the limousine
     pull off.

     Hawk angrily bursts from the door and is painfully
     CLOTHESLINED by agent Butterfinger, who is dressed as
     a mailman.

     Crumpled on the ground, Hawk kicks out with his foot,
     into Butterfinger's stomach, doubling him. Hawk then
     grabs him by the head and rams into the glass of the
     booth.

     Hawk rotates off for an escape...but the rest of the
     CIA crew cuts him off holding barely concealed guns;
     Snickers dressed as a maitre 'd, Almond Joy as a Bermuda
     tourist, and Kaplan in his usual emsemble.  Kit Kat is
     dressed exactly like Hawk, right down to a bloody lip.
     Hawk gives him a double take.

                             KAPLAN
               Hawk, Hawk, Hawk.  Enjoying
               Italy?  I always had a soft spot
               for Rome.  Did my first barehanded
               strangulation here.  Communist
               politician.

                             HAWK
               Why George, you big softie...

                             KAPLAN
               God, I miss communism.  The Red
               Threat.  People were scared, the
               Agency was respected, and I got
               laid every night.

     A humiliated Butterfinger comes waddling out, holding
     the phone.  Kaplan rolls his eyes.

                             BUTTERFINGER
               Sorry, coach...

                             KAPLAN
                       (shaking his head)
               If his father wasn't the head of
               Shit, I hate this, the
               government's got me farmed out,
               working for the Mayflower
               corporation now, money beats
               politics.  War isn't Hell anymore,
               it's Dull.  Don't slaughter their
               men and rape their women, just
               steal their microchips.

                             HAWK
               You know Kaplan, if you weren't
               the slimiest pinata of shit that
               ever lived, I'd feel sorry for
               you.

                             SNICKERS
               Good news, bud, the Mayflowers
               have moved up the time-table.
               You're hitting the Vatican to-night.

                             HAWK
               Tonight?  You're whacked.  The
               timing's off, I'm underequipped
               Damnit, I have a date!

     Almond Joy smoothly extracts Hawk's notebook and reads...

                             ALMOND JOY
               Grapple, Biker's bottle, hairspray,
               black turtleneck, Pocket
               Fisherman, acid, collapsible
               yardstick, softball, and 72 stamps.
               Gee Stud, this is going to be
               some date.  No Harvey's Bristol
               Cream?

                             KAPLAN
               Snickers, make the list happen.
               Oh and it's one thing to play
               hide and seek with the Mayflower's
               pathetic staff, but we're sore
               losers.  I've put jumper cables
               on the nipples of children and
               not always in the line of duty.

                             HAWK
               Thanks for sharing.

                             KAPLAN
               We blow up space shuttles for
               breakfast.  You and your friend
               Alex would be a late afternoon
               Triscuit.

                             HAWK
               If you do anything to my friend...

                             KAPLAN
               Yeah, right.  By the way, as long
               as I'm getting things off my
               chest, I'm the one who killed your
               little monkey.  Made it look like
               a Mafia hit.  Did it for fun.
               Ciao.

     Kaplan and the crew quickly disperse in different
     directions as Hawk howls in frustration.  Kit Kat moves
     behind Hawk and perfectly mimics him.

                             HAWK
               What did you have against Little
               Eddie, motherfucker?  He was just
               a monkey who liked to laugh.
               Come back without your yuppie
               army.  I'll triscuit you, you
               space shuttle eating...Shit.!

     Without looking, Hawk elbows the mimic Kit Kat in the
     face.  Kit Kat gives Hawk a strange smile and hands him
     a card that reads:  BEWARE THE ODD STEPS.

     Hawk looks up from the card.  Kit Kat is gone, but
     Butterfinger scampers in his place.

                             BUTTERFINGER
               Hey, Mr. Hawk, I got those 72
               stamps!

     Sighing, Hawk takes the huge sheath of stamps.

     EXT. INDOOR TRAIN TRACK

     One of the small Vatican mail trains bullets across an
     indoor track.  The viewer's viewpoint whooshes to catch
     up, focusing on a very large package, addressed to the
     Pope, that has Hawk's sheath of stamps slapped onto it.
     The train zips into a tunnel.

     INT. THE VATICAN UNDERGROUND SUBWAY

     The train rumbles into the Vatican mini-station.  TWO
     HARRIED WORKERS heave up the strange cargo onto a sorting
     table.

     A bell rings as a clock hits 10.  The workers do a sigh
     of relief.  Shucking off their uniforms, they head out.

     A hand rips out of the huge package.

     INT. OUTSIDE THE CODEX ROOM--NIGHT

     Hawk pops out of the secret passageway door and moves to
     the mouth of the doorless Codex room.  He pauses to
     hand-comb his hair in the two large, framed mirrors at
     the sides.

     THE CODEX ROOM

     Carrying the now frameless mirrors in each hand, Hawk
     hustles to the top of the steps and suddenly stops.

                             HAWK
               "Beware the Odd Steps."

     Hawk crouches down and notices the step below him has a
     clear magnetic tape running across it to a dime sized
     alarm button.

                             HAWK
               Why Kit Kat, aren't you a
               gentleman...

     Hawk bounds down every other one of the steps down to
     where the Codex is bathed in a holy light.

     He hefts up the two now frameless mirrors and puts them
     each in a groove of a collapsible yardstick running
     across the top.  The parallel mirrors now face out from
     each other.  Hawk sprays a blast of Clairol to reveal the
     light sensor beams, and then with a deep breath, he
     thrusts the mirrors into the beams.

     The light bounces harmlessly off the mirrors and Hawk
     exhales.  He balances the connected mirrors then crawls
     through his tent-like passageway.

     Hawk squirts acid from a biker's bottle on the cracks of
     the rectangular glass case that holds the Codex.  The
     acid sizzles.

     INT. VATICAN LIBRARY HALLWAY--NIGHT

     A BURLY GUARD thoughtfully stares at a painting, fingers
     propping his chin like an critic then continues ambling
     on.

     THE CODEX ROOM

     Rubbing his head, Hawk gives an excited smile as the glass
     cracks of the rectangular case loosen.  Hawk pulls out a
     pocket fisherman....

     The viewer's viewpoint moves upward to reveal, through
     the mouth of the room, the Burly Guard is coming down
     the hall.

     OUTSIDE THE CODEX ROOM

     Burly Guard approaches the outskirts of the Codex room.
     He combs his hair into the piece of wall in the now
     empty mirror-frame then REALIZES.

     Muttering Italian into his walkie-talkie, Burly Guard
     rushes into the room and looks down to the sensor
     deflecting mirrors.

     He passes a statue, behind which, Hawk is revealed to
     be standing.

     Burly Guard approaches the Codex and sees the dripping
     acid.  He also notices a fishing hook attached to the
     binding of the Codex.  The fishing wire leads out of
     the glass case.  The Guard reaches to touch it when
     suddenly the wire is pulled tightly upward by a
     moving-out-from-behind-the-statue Hawk.

     The Codex FLIES off its perch, setting off the ALARM and
     sending the bizarre cage/lamp CRASHING DOWN and AROUND
     the hapless Burly Guard.  The green gas commences its
     noxious billowing as the Codex swooshes into Hawk's
     hands.  He then hurls a softball, smashing a window
     on the other side of the room.

     The familiar Vatican Guard and a Guard Three barrel
     down into the mouth of the codex room.  Only one
     Gas Mask drops from the doorway.  The Vatican Guard
     pulls it on and gives a "That's Life" shrug of
     shoulders to the fainting Guard three.

     Hawk puts on the missing gas mask and launches a grapple
     around the ceiling cord of the dropped Ornate Lighting
     Fixture.  Hawk then Tarzans from one staircase to
     another.  He then ungrapples and heads toward the
     shattered window.

     The Vatican Guard waits a stunned moment before giving
     chase.

     EXT. THE ROOF

     Hawk flings off his gas mask and begins a classical
     skipping-across-the-rooftop jaunt.  Suddenly a brick
     on the slightly slanted roof gives way and Hawk FALLS.
     His canvas bag goes skipping down across the roof,
     landing against the antennae.

     INT. THE POPE'S BEDROOM

     A T.V. showing Mr. Ed. speaking to Wilbur in Italian
     goes fuzzy.  THE POPE, wearing his famous hat and a Notre
     Dame bathrobe angrily bangs on it.

     EXT. THE ROOF

     Hawk harvests his grapple on the level part of the roof
     and slides down toward the dangling-off-the-antennae bag.

     The Vatican Guard pops out of the window and fires a
     warning shot.

     Hawk stretches to the bag.  His fingers touch as the
     Guard continues to bound forward.

                             HAWK
               Please God, Please God.......let
               the guard shoot me.

     Hawk pulls up the bag and turns himself to see Vatican
     Guard hovering over him on the roof.

                             VATICAN GUARD
               The worm's on the other foot,
               yankee noodle candy.

     Hawk sees the Vatican Guard's foot move toward the
     grapple.  Hawk ferociously tugs, ripping the Guard
     off-balance and knocking down a side of the roof.

     EXT. TOP OF A NEARBY WALL

     Hawk dashes atop a nearby wall and hurls his grapple
     across a road around a tree branch.  Hawk ties the end of
     grapple line, tosses on a friction belt, takes a breath
     and JUMPS OFF THE WALL.  The viewer follows him on his
     breathtaking ride.

     The brused Vatican Guard flops back atop the roof.  He
     gets off a wild shot before crumpling back down.

     HAWK

     is alnost to the other side when the Guard's bullet hits
     the friction belt.  Hawk drops with a wild scream...
     and lands with a painful straddle atop a street lamppost.
     His eyes bug out with the thought of a life without
     children.  He slowly spins off the lamppost and sails
     down upon...

     EXT. A BUS

     and the comfortable luggage housed on top of it.  Hawk
     tries to maintain his balance upon the wobbling
     baggage, but the bus makes a quick turn and Hawk goes
     flying off...

     EXT. RIGHT INTO A CAFE CHAIR--NIGHT

     Panting and discombobulated, Hawk looks across the table
     to the female hands holding open a menu.  The menu comes
     down.  It is Anna.  Hawk unpretzels and laps his canvas
     bag.

                             ANNA
               Oh Hudson, I was worried you
               weren't going to drop by....

                             HAWK
               I never break a date.  Scout's
               honor.

     Hawk does the honor sign with his black gloved hand
     then quickly rips it off as a WAITER comes to the
     table.

                             HAWK
               Fettucini con Funghi Porcini.

                             WAITER
               Bellissimo, signor.

                             HAWK
               Oh, and could I have some ketchup
               with that.

     Anna hits her forehead with the palm of her hand while
     the waiter's entire body sinks in disappointment.  Other
     TABLE OCCUPANTS sadly shake their heads.

     EXT. ANOTHER TABLE--NIGHT

     At a comfortable distance curled behind a heat lamp,
     Snickers is being an Uglier American to an UNCOMPREHENDING
     WAITER, while Almond Joy chuckles and Butterfinger spreads
     butter over an entire baguette.

                             SNICKERS
               Come on, Pierre, Steak-bur-ger,
               Fren-n-ch Fries.  This is France,
               you gotta have French.....

                             ALMOND JOY
               Actually we're in Italy, Snickers,
               she said as if it made a difference.

     The Waiter sneaks off.  Butterfinger devours his bread.

                             SNICKERS
               Italy, France, Moscow.  They all
               just wanna be Nebraska.  Old Man
               Kaplan thinks since Communism is
               dead, we got nothing to do.  Man,
               Democracy isn't free elections.
               We gotta teach the world that
               Democracy is Big Tits, College
               Football on Saturdays, Eddie
               Murphy saying the word "Fuck"
               and Kids putting their hands down
               garbage disposals on "America's
               Funniest Home Videos."

                             ALMOND JOY
               Damn baby, when's the last time
               you had a vacation...Jesus, I
               gotta get out of this job.  If
               my Mom knew her daughter
               assassinated the leader of the
               anti-Apartheid movement....

                             SNICKERS
               Quit bitching, you got the
               employee of the month plaque for
               that shit...Ah to be in Pari-is
               and in love.

     They look off to....

     HAWK AND ANNA'S TABLE

     Physically sarcastic, the Waiter brings a tall wine
     basket with a bottle of ketchup in it.  Hawk nabs it.

                             HAWK
               This is bueno.  They had the worst
               ketchup in prison.....uh...

                             ANNA
               Prison?

                             HAWK
               I was the Warden?

                             ANNA
               How long were you in?

                             HAWK
               Let's just say, I never saw E.T.

                             ANNA
               Wow, you were "in the joint."
               "Doing hard time."  It's funny,
               but that excites me.  I seem to
               have a thing for sinners.

                             HAWK
               I seem to have a thing for sinning.
               sinning.  Check please....

                             WAITER
               Ah, anything for dessert?

                             ANNA
                       (she shoots)
               Yes.  Something to go.

                             HAWK
                       (she scores)
               I'll bring the ketchup.

       INT. ANNA'S HOUSE--NIGHT

       The viewer's viewpoint pulls back, past the black canvas
       bag on a table, to reveal a barefoot Anna is straddling
       a bare-backed Hawk, demurely and tentatively studying his
       bruises.

                             ANNA
               What have you been doing?

                             HAWK
               Uh....old badminton injury.

     Anna giggles and bends to kiss a bruise.  She stops
     herself and opts for tickling.

                             HAWK
               tickles, ticKleS, TICKLES.

                             ANNA
                       (not stopping)
               Oh, I'm so sorry...

     Roaring with laughter, they capsize onto the floor.
     Hawk slithers around to devour her toes.  Anna closes
     her eyes and arches her back.....

     She opens her eyes and sees a large crucifix staring
     right at her.  With a gasp, she rolls away from Hawk
     and stands up, trying to brush off her sins.

                             ANNA
               I'm sorry.  I can't.  I....

                             HAWK
                       (softly approaching)
               Hey now, outside of a very
               friendly dog this morning, it's
               been a slow decade.  I don't make
               love every ten years, I get a
               little cranky.

                             ANNA
               It's also been a long time for
               me.  I--

     Their heads fuse for a semi-classic screen kiss until
     THE CRUCIFIX LIGHTS UP AND BEGINS SHOUTING IN ITALIAN.

                             HAWK
               Catholic girls are scary...

                            ANNA
               Somebody robbed the Vatican.

                            HAWK
               Oh.  No.

     Anna slides on her shoes and makes a hasty retreat.
     She bumps into the canvas bag.  The Codex slides out.
     They both catch it in mid-air.  Anna's eyes pop.  She
     wrenches the Codex away and kicks.  Hawk pulls her into
     a compassionate back-against-his-stomach hug.  The Codex
     falls to the floor unharmed.

                             HAWK
               It's not what you think.  Okay,
               maybe it is....

                             ANNA
               You really went and did it.  With
               one day, not even a day, of
               planning, you did it.  Nobody
               does it better, Hudson.  You
               started the week stealing the
               Sforza and you ended it swiping
               the Codex.

                             HAWK
               Wha--

                             ANNA
               What are your plans for the
               weekend?  Hoisting away the
               Colosseum?  Tell me, did the
               devil make you do it or did
               Darwin and Minerva Mayflower?

     EXT. A CAR OUTSIDE OF ANNA'S PLACE--NIGHT

     Crammed together in the front seat, Snickers, Almond
     Joy, and Butterfinger are watching the shadows of
     Hawk and Anna up in the window.  Snickers snaps a
     cartridge into a gun while Butterfinger attacks a
     goo-ey pastry.

                              SNICKERS
               What's going on in there?

                              BUTTERFINGER
               Do you want me to rape them?
                       (throwing pastry down)
               Dunkin does it better.

                              SNICKERS
               Just read, Butterfinger.

     Butterfinger pulls up the book on Da Vinci that Anna
     wrote and starts reading like a schoolboy.

                             BUTTERFINGER
               "Da Vinci had fears about his
               more dangerous designs, so he
               created a shorthand code in
               reverse script..."

                             ALMOND JOY
               To yourself!.....What are they
               doing?  In twenty seconds, we go
               in.

     INT. ANNA'S PLACE

     Foam shoots out over the coffee.  Hawk smiles down at
     it as Anna works a cappuccino machine.

                             ANNA
               For two years, I've been tracking
               the Mayflowers' peculiar interest
               in three Da Vinci pieces.  Their
               Sforza replica was as fake as
               the "gas leak" that supposedly
               destroyed it.

                             HAWK
               Does everyone in the world know
               more than me?  Jesus, I'm just
               some guy who happens to be good
               at swiping stuff.....Lifted a
               piece of licorice when I was one
               and a half.  Who knew it would
               lead... They even got the CIA
               involved!

                             ANNA
               The C.I. what?  God, no...

                             HAWK
                       (raising his cup)
               Ooh, I guess I do know something
               Here's looking at you, kid...

     THE CAR OUTSIDE

     The agents burst from the car, guns raised.

                             ALMOND JOY
               Now.

     ANNA'S HOUSE

     Hawk sips the cappuccino.  His face immediately contracts.

                             HAWK
               This doesn't taste like
               cappuccino.

                             ANNA
               Oh, I must have put too much
               ethyl-chloride in it.

     Anna throws a pillow on the ground and holds out her
     hand.  Hawk collapses.  His coffee cup lands perfectly in
     Anna's outstretched hand and his head lands perfectly
     on the pillow.

     The candy bars bash the door open, guns raised.

                             ANNA
               Why didn't you tell me at the
               restaurant that he had hit the
               Vatican tonight.  My people will
               not be happy.  I want to see Kaplan.

                             ALMOND JOY
               That's not overly possible.  He...

                             BUTTERFINGER
               But guys, remember, he's in the
               castle at Vinci....

     Snickers and Almond Joy grimace into fake smiles.

     EXT. THE CASTLE--NIGHT

     A helicopter thunders up to the awesome castle from the
     opening Da Vinci sequence.

     INT. HELICOPTER

     Anna pets the head of Hawk on her lap.  She is pondering.

     INT. A MYSTERIOUS DARK ROOM--NIGHT

     A sparse circle of light houses a chair and a pacing
     Kaplan.

     Snickers and Butterfinger flop Hawk onto the lit chair.

     Kit Kat is dressed exactly like Anna.  She reacts as she
     comes into the light.  Kaplan takes the Codex from her.

                             KAPLAN
               Way to go, Anna.

                             ANNA
               When the Mayflowers find out we
               have the Codex, they're going to
               want to make a deal...

                             KAPLAN
                       (gung-ho lying)
               And then we'll arrest those
               greedy pigs... Is that it?

     Hawk stirs.  The viewer gets his woozy P.O.V.

                             ANNA
               Actually George, it's not it.
               What are we doing in this castle?
               I happen to know the Mayflowers
               bought this castle last year when
               they found out Da Vinci used to
               do...

     The lights in the room come on to the sound of holy Da
     Vinci theme, revealing an almost perfect refurbishing of
     the exact same workshop Da Vinci toiled in in the
     opening.

                             KAPLAN
                       (trying to be solemn)
               It's the site of their new museum
               and we're taking it over.  Operation
               Deflower Mayflower is going full
               speed ahead.

                             ANNA
                       (taking it in)
               Oh Lord.... the only reason I ask is
               that Hudson, uh, Mr. Hawk, Hawkins,
               had some "neat" things to say about
               Darwin, Minerva, and you.
               Basically that you're part of the
               same car pool.

                             KAPLAN
               Anna.  Anna.  Anna.  If that were
               true, Almond Joy would have
               handed you your heart right
               after you handed me the Codex.
               Now, get some sleep.  Kit Kat...

     Kit Kat in drag spookily moves inches away from Anna.

                              ANNA
               Cat got his tongue?

                              KAPLAN
               Actually he never told us what it
               was.

     Kit Kat smiles, revealing the fact he has no tongue.

                             ANNA
               How sweet.  I trust you will see
               Hudson Hawk is given to the proper
               authorities.  I recommend
               leniency...

                             SNICKERS
                       (holding in a laugh)
               Oh, I think we all do.

     Hawk gives her a look of honesty and pain that causes
     Anna to guiltily gulp as she heads out with the mimicking
     Kit Kat.

                             SNICKERS
               Do you think she has any idea that
               Operation Deflower Mayflower is as
               bogus as Kit Kat's tits?

                             KAPLAN
               I don't think so, although bringing
               her to the castle gave her a big,
               juicy hint.

                             ALMOND JOY
               With all due respect to that great
               blouse, why didn't I cut out her
               heart?

                             KAPLAN
               Close call, but she's our only way
               of keeping tabs on that damn
               mysterious Vatican organization.
               Hawk, it's time to go to the
               principal's office....

     EXT. OUTSIDE THE CASTLE--NIGHT

     Moving into the chopper, Anna glimpses, Bunny, the
     obnoxious dog, in a Mayflower logo dog tag, taking a leak
     on some bushes.  She fakes a yawn to the like dressed Kit
     Kat who fakes one back.

     INT. THE G. MACHINE ROOM--NIGHT

     Kaplan, Hawk, and the other agents march into the mammoth
     room of the opening scene.  In the place of where one
     remembers the gold machine are undulating sheets, beneath
     which are unassembled parts of the machine.

     Inside, a ball goes whizzing out of a tennis ball
     machine.  In tennis gear and goggles, Darwin Mayflower
     thwacks it against the wall of (now faded) frescos.

     Also in tennis threads, Minerva is laying on a chaise
     lounge holding a gadget in her hand.

                             DARWIN
               Seven!

     Minerva turns the gadget up to SEVEN and presses a
     button.  Another tennis ball shoots out, a little faster.
     Darwin batters it.  The ball ricochets into the forehead
     of an "amused" Alfred who is retrieving balls in sweat
     pants.

                             ALFRED
               Jolly.  Good.  Shot.  Sir.

                             MINERVA
               Ooh, it's Hudson Hawk, you cease
               to amaze me, convict.  You are a
               terrible cat burglar!

                             DARWIN
               Haven't you ever seen, like David
               Niven?  You know tiptoe in, tiptoe
               out.

                             MINERVA
               Like a "cat", one could say.

                             HAWK
               Shucks, I'll just take it back.

     Hawk reaches for the Codex.  Kaplan pulls it over to
     Darwin, who pulls up his goggles and fondles the ancient
     binding.  Taking a knife from Kaplan, he begins to slit
     it open.

                             MINERVA
                       (bouncing up)
               No, let me!

                             DARWIN
                       (pout)
               I don't care.

     Hawk looks away to the billowing sheets and the strange
     machine parts behind them.

     Minerva slits the bindings and tugs out another geometri-
     cally perverted crystal.

                             HAWK
               Another piece of the puzzle for
               the Da Vinci Alchemy project.

     Kaplan, Darwin, and Minerva look up to Hawk, then to each
     other, all start to speak, then all stop.

     This quandary is deferred by the entrance of the twin
     Flunkies.

                             DARWIN
               Oh, you.  There's nothing more I
               hate than failure.  All you had to
               do was follow the Hawk, it's not
               like I said "Teach our nation's
               children how to read."

     Hawk uses the distraction to amble toward the sheets.

                             DARWIN
               I guess we're just going to have
               to kill 'em...

     Shockingly swift, Minerva pulls a small gun from beneath
     her tennis dress and blasts a burning hole between each
     set of Flunky eyes, splattering them to the ground.

                             DARWIN
               God Minerva, I was kidding.

     A SHOCKED HAWK

     quickly turns from the blithe carnage and pulls up a
     sheet.  He reveals the familiar Gold Machine Demonhead.

     THE MAYFLOWERS

     reverberate off each other with laughter.  Bloodstained,
     Kaplan and Almond Joy exchange an eye bulge.  Minerva's
     smile disappears as she sees Hawk by the sheets.

                             MINERVA
               Get away from there, convict!

                             HAWK
               Just browsing.  Don't touch me....

     Snickers touches him.  Hawk smashes him in the jaw.
     Snickers rears back to reciprocate....

                             DARWIN
               Don't hurt him!  We need him for
               the final job!

     Snickers stops himself, snarling in frustration.  Hawk is
     suddenly the happiest man he's been in Italy.

                             HAWK
               Oh weeeeelly, don't hurt me?  Even
               if I do this....

     Hawk pulls Snickers' glasses off and stamps them.

                             HAWK
               And this....

     Hawk knees Butterfinger in the stomach.

                             HAWK
               Surely this must offend....

     Hawk body-block-dominoes Butterfinger and Snickers to the
     ground.  Kaplan and Almond Joy aim their guns.

                             KAPLAN
               That's it!

     Playfully lifting his shirt, Hawk grabs Minerva and
     manually swivels her hips to the beat of his.

                             HAWK
               Things are getting a little loose
               at the Da Vinci workshop tonight.
               "Put your left leg in, take your
               right foot out."  May I call you
               Minnie....

     Hawk mambos to Alfred who rifles his blade up to Hawk's
     crotch.  Hawk stops dancing.

                             DARWIN
               Come to think of it there is a part
               of your body that you won't need for
               your next job...

                             HAWK
               Hey, guys, I've always wanted to sing
               like Franki Valli and the other seasons,
               but come on....

     Alfred moves the blade a little upward.  Hawk a-a-ghs.

                             MINERVA
               Big girls don't cry-I-eye.

                             HAWK
               Two minutes, 35 seconds.  Damnit,
               I'm involved in this thing, so I
               just wanna know what this thing is.
               I wanna be treated as an adult.

                             DARWIN
               That's fair.  Tomorrow.  Back in
               Rome.  Now go to your room.

     Alfred strategically Vulcans Hawk on the neck.  He falls.

     INT. DARK CONFESSION BOOTH--MORNING

     The lips of Anna come into light.

                             ANNA
               Forgive me Father for I have
               sinned.  It's been 1200 hours
               since my last confession.

     INT. THE CARDINAL'S SIDE OF THE CONFESSION BOOTH

     The cardinal suppresses a yawn.

                             CARDINAL
               Hit me with your best shot.

                             ANNA (O.S.)
               I betrayed a man.  A good man.  An
               innocent man.  A thief.

                             CARDINAL
               Anna, what are you trying to say...

     ANNA'S DARKENED LIPS

                             ANNA
               He came into a world where crime
               is a legitimate business tactic
               and a legitimate government
               procedure.  But he knew Right and
               Wrong.  Oh, and we kind of messed
               around...

     THE CARDINAL

     freaks and goes into some Italian gibberish before...

                             CARDINAL
               "Messed around" messed around?  I
               know-- I don't want to know.  First
               base?  Second Base?  Stop me when
               I'm getting warm...

                             ANNA (O.S.)
               A little petting is not the issue!

                             CARDINAL
               Sorry.  Seventeen Hail Marys and
               five minutes outside.

     INT. OUTSIDE THE CONFESSION BOOTH--MORNING

     The Cardinal emerges and stands by Anna's confessional
     curtains.

                             CARDINAL
               So let me get this straight,
               sister, you're saying Hudson Hawk
               is not willingly working for the
               Mayflowers but Kaplan and the
               Candy Bars are?

     Anna moves out of the confessional curtains, wearing a
     FULL NUN HABIT for she is a Nun.  The gaspingly beautiful
     church unfolds as they walk.

                             ANNA
               You got it.  Operation Deflower
               Mayflower is a bad joke and I'm the
               punchline.  I thought we were using
               the CIA to help us to get Mayflower,
               but really the CIA was using me to
               keep us away from Mayflower.

                             CARDINAL
               Oh, why couldn't I be the Cardinal
               in charge of catering.... If the
               Mayflowers get the three sections
               of Da Vinci's crystal and his
               instructions for the gold machine--
               Aie-yi--Do we got anything?  What of
               Alex, Hawk's friend, where is his
               loyalty?

                             ANNA
               I'm going to find out.

                             CARDINAL
               I'm sorry for losing it back there,
               but you must remember, sister, you
               have vows to God as well as a mission
               to the world.

                             ANNA
               I know, I know, your Eminence, just say
               "God go with me."

                             CARDINAL
               God go with you, sister.

     Anna puts on the coolest pair of sunglasses, deliciously
     contrasting with her habit.  She moves off....

     INT. ROME CONFERENCE ROOM--DAY

     Beneath the wacky portrait, Darwin circles the board-
     member filled conference table as Minerva smooches Bunny.
     Everyone watches Alfred place a bar of Gold and of Lead
     in the hands of a blindfolded Hawk at the middle of the M.

                             DARWIN
               So, Captain Hawk, in one of your
               paws you got a gold bar worth
               about 8 thou.  In the autre, you
               got lead that won't get you
               gelato.

                             MINERVA
               Surely a master-thief like you can
               tell the difference.

                             HAWK
                       ("What's my Line")
               That's two down to Kitty
               Carlisle...

     Hawk "weighs" the two bars in his hands--digs with his
     fingernails.  He rips off the blindfold in subdued
     frustration.  As Minerva speaks, she unconsciously
     molests Alfred.

                             MINERVA
               Cool, isn't it?  Weight, feel,
               mal1eability, they're all but
               identical.  On the periodic chart
               of elements, they're but one
               proton apart.  Great minds worked
               for centuries to turn worthless
               into priceless.

                             HAWK
               Alchemy.

                             DARWIN
                       (casually goosing Alfred)
               Alchemy!  Is the business term of
               the 90's, my man!  Minerva read
               about it in an airline magazine
               about four years ago.  I dumped
               some lira into research... Shazam,
               we come across a diary by one of
               Da Vinci's apprentices detailing
               La Machine de Oro, the gold machine
               for those at home, and the rest is
               about to become history.  Money
               isn't everything, gold is.  Fuck
               blue chip stocks!  Fuck T-bills!
               Fuck Junk Bonds!  I got the real
               deal!  Money will always be paper
               but gold will always be gold!

                             MINERVA
               Market crashes.  Bomb drops.
               Greenhouse effect affects.  We'll
               still be the richest, most powerful
               people in the world.  In 1992,
               Europe is coming together to become
               one business superpower.  It's one
               party we'd love to poop.

                             DARWIN
               Well, that said, the last
               ingredient in the recipe is in, get
               this, you're gonna die, the Kremlin.

                              HAWK
               Sure.  The Kremlin.  Makes sense.
               The Kremlin.  Why not?  Listen,
               this is all too Indiana Jones and
               the Lost City of King Tut for me,
               man.  Throw me in jail and go ahead,
               just try and throw Alex...

                             MINERVA
               Jail, you asshole!  Our foot
               soldiers will blow your brains
               out!  Bunny, Ball-Ball!

     Minerva angrily throws the dog off her lap and whips a
     tennis ball into its mouth.

                             DARWIN
               I'll torture you so slowly you'll
               think it's a career!  I'll kill
               your family, your friends, and the
               bitch you took to the Prom!

                             HAWK
               You want an address on that last
               one?

     Bunny barks up at Hawk in anger.

                             HAWK
               Bunny, not you too?

                              MINERVA
               You've got a dilemma, tiger.  I
               think I know what's going to help
               you solve it.

     Alfred quickly latches on the state-of-the-art handcuffs
     and the blindfold.  The viewer's viewpoint stays on a
     writhing Hawk.

                              HAWK
               I'll kill all you.  Even the old
               lady.


     Hawk kicks back on the table, "jump ropes" the cuffs,
     then picks the lock with his teeth.  Hawk rips off the
     blindfold to see that the entire room is empty except
     for Alex, standing at the other end, in an incongruous
     Italian leather coat.

                             ALEX
               I hated cigarettes until I saw my
               first No Smoking sign.  Keep off
               the Grass?  Let's play Soccer.
               Only law I cared about was
               friendship.  Broke that one too,
               didn't I?  This Gates-Mario
               Brothers-CIA-Mayflower-Da Vinci
               thing seemed like a sweet deal.
               Visit foreign lands, take their
               treasures.  I don't know, I thought
               you'd get into it.  It's better
               than playing darts with M.B.A.'s at
               the bar.  I didn't know it was
               going to be like this.  Them using
               me to use you... I'm sorry, there's
               only one way out of this and it's
               gonna hurt me more than it's gonna
               hurt you.

     Alex pulls out a gun from his jacket and clicks it in.

     EXT. FAMILIAR PIAZZA--DAY

     The piazza from the fascist E.U.R. building are bustling
     with office workers laughing, smoking, and hustling.
     Darwin, Minerva and Kaplan are a solid troika in the
     center of the steps.  The other agents stroll in the
     periphery....

                              KAPLAN
               I just don't think it was a
               smoking hot idea to leave them up
               there alone.

                             MINERVA
               Don't worry George, this is the
               reason we put the old diabetic
               guinea on the payroll to begin
               with.  To keep Hawk in line.
               They'll talk about "being buddies"
               and "chugging brewskis."

                             DARWIN
                       (raising glass)
               You gotta love male bonding.

     As Darwin slaps Kaplan on the back, behind them, Hawk and
     Alex come crashing out of the windowed doors of the building.

                              KAPLAN
               You were saying...

     Moving to the edge of the stairs, Hawk and Alex, latter
     holding his gun, sprout up from their own debris and
     continue savagely brawling.  The wigging out passers-
     by give them space.

                             HAWK
               You bastard!  You fucked my
               freedom for a lousy job!

     Alex trembles, going into a diabetic seizure.  He shakily
     raises his gun.

                             ALEX
               Hawk... I'm so sorry...

     Hawk roars forward like a bull and helmets Alex.  They
     roll together down the massive staircase past Darwin,
     Minerva, and the CIA who react with "This can't be
     happening" catatonia.

     Two SHOTS go off as Hawk and Alex crash to the bottom of
     the staircase.  Hawk rises up in a daze to see Alex on the
     ground with two bloody bullet holes.

                             HAWK
               No.....Alex!  Wake up, you can't
               go out like this.

     Hawk falls to his knees as Snickers hustles toward him.
     Suddenly, sirens are heard as a police van pulls up.
     Snickers stops.

     Four policemen blast from the back of the van.  One holds
     back the crowd.  One strenuously pulls Hawk into the van.
     The other two drag in Alex.

     The villains look to each other for non-existent guidance
     as the van pulls away.

                             MINERVA
               Plan B, anyone...

     Using initiative, Snickers hops on a Vespa and roars off
     after them.  The van can be seen swerving off.....

     AROUND A CORNER

     where it bolts up into a much larger truck marked VATICAN
     SOUVENIRS.  TWO SEEMINGLY-INNOCENT-BYSTANDER PRIESTS break
     demeanor to flop up the wheel ramps, slam close the back
     of the truck, lock it shut, and continue on their solemn
     way.

     The TRUCK BELLOWS off as the Vespa spins around the corner.
     Snickers brakes and looks around for the police van.  He
     hits his handle with frustration.

     EXT. BEAUTIFUL ROME OVERVIEW

     Out of her habit but still in her incredible sunglasses,
     Anna looks out to a lovely view of Italy.  The Vatican Truck
     pulls up behind her.  A giddy, blood-stained Alex and a not-
     so-giddy Hawk bound out of the back.  Alex excitedly gives
     himself an insulin shot.

                             ANNA
               Oh thank God, you're dead...

                             ALEX
               It was so beautiful!  When the
               blanks went off, they...

     Hawk's fist whooshes into frame and blasts Alex's jaw.

                             HAWK
               You bastard.  You fucked my
               freedom for a lousy job.

                             ALEX
               But I said I was sorry....

                             HAWK
               No sweat, Alex, you only made the
               biggest mistake of my life.  What
               was your per-diem?

                             ALEX
               Don't act like you've never committed
               a crime before, Hawkins?  I know, I
               made call, when Anna tracked me down I...

                             ANNA
               Hudson, don't you understand...

                             HAWK
               And you, Dr. Cappucino, you're lucky
               I don't hit women, assuming you are
               a woman.  I'm not taking anything for
               granted anymore.

                             ANNA
               I-work-for-a-covert-Vatican-humanitarian-
               organization.  The-CIA-made-a-fool-of-me.
               I-care-for-you...

                             HAWK
               Oh.  Well, what's this?

     Hawk pulls out the Demon Head that was in the Mayflower
     Museum from out of his pocket.  Anna turns white.

                             ANNA
               Where did you get this?

                             HAWK
               You know, the place where you gave
               the bad guys the Codex.... the
               Mayflower Museum.

                             ANNA
               It's from the machine.  All they
               need is the crystal to run it and
               they have 2/3 of it already.  We
               can't let that happen.

                             ALEX
               You're saying you want us to beat
               them to the crystal and save the
               world from financial disarray.

                             ANNA
               Something like that.

                             ALEX
                       (pulling out plane
                        tix)
               Well, forget about it.  Hawk and I
               are going to Rio.  We're hurt,
               we're tired, and a hero ain't
               nothing but a sandwich.  Right,
               buddy?...

                             ANNA
               Hudson, God's given you a gift for
               cat burglary, you can t just...

                             HAWK
               You better believe I can.  I'm
               sick of people telling me what I
               have to do.

                             ANNA
               It's that kind of selfish attitude
               that...

                             HAWK
               Selfish attitude?  I'm just some
               guy who wants a little nap and a
               cappuccino for when he wakes up,
               not too much foam...

                             ANNA
               You re not "some guy" anymore,
               Hudson.  Right now, you're the
               only guy.  Without your help, I....

     Anna looks to Hawk with a choked-up expression.  The
     weight of the world on his shoulders, Hawk turns away
     to a lovely view, his mind painfully raging and
     swirling toward peaceful clarity.

                             HAWK
               The world is beautiful.  Every day
               in prison I made sure to remember
               that.  It's only when I actually
               got out that I forgot.  If I was
               sane, I'd be on that plane to Rio.
               But being beaten and abused to
               fulfill some corporation's
               perverted vision does something to
               your mental health.  The world is
               beautiful and I'm tired of being
               fucked.
                       (turning around)
               It's Darwin and Minerva's turn to
               bite the pillow...

     Anna involuntarily does the sign of the cross.  Alex
     goodnaturedly does a jerking off motion.

                             ANNA
               That was beautiful.

                             ALEX
               I laughed, I cried.

     Shaking his head, Hawk swipes the plane tickets from
     Alex.

                             HAWK
               Rio, Alex?  After all they've
               done to...Hey, these tickets are
               for Moscow!

                             ALEX
                       (knowing smile)
               Damn travel agency.  That Kremlin
               thing is in Moscow, isn't it?

     A proud Hawk slaps Alex on the back as some passing
     ITALIAN LOCALS stop to stare, horrified, at Alex's
     bullet holes.  Anna sweetly intervenes.

                             ANNA
               Ketchup.  Stupido Americani...

     The locals give off a slightly dazed "A-a-h" and move off.

     INT. THE CONFERENCE ROOM--DAY

     Wind blows through the shattered conference room window.
     Snickers is banging on his computer apparatus at the
     table with the Mayflowers and the other agents.

                             KAPLAN
               We're all family now.  My team
               has done a lot of rougher things
               than steal the model of a
               helicopter.

                             SNICKERS
               We're going to whack this place
               so fast we'll have time to shop
               for American imports.

     Darwin and Minerva politely smile and then turn away to
     each other with knowing looks.  The computer screen shows
     the familiar image of the Kremlin building that turns
     into a complex look at interiors the viewer will later
     see.

                             ALMOND JOY
               Lucky for us, the Da Vinci is
               located in a wing of the Kremlin
               that they used to throw the Miss
               Ukraine pageant and stuff.  It'll
               have the least number of guards....

                             KAPLAN
               As for our plan of action,
               anybody'd be insane to go in
               from the ground floor...

     INT. A VAN-BUS--NIGHT

     A head-rubbing Hawk and a stomach rubbing Alex kneel on
     the floor of a moving van, over a barely legible drawing
     of what was so neatly delineated on the CIA computer.
     Both guys are dressed as priests and are chewing gum.

                             ALEX
               We're going in from the ground
               floor.

                             HAWK
               Geez, this Art Treasures Room
               looks like a burnt diaphragm.

     Hawk laughs and pops up into the passenger seat.  Anna
     is revealed to be driving in her habit.  Hawk gives her
     a kiss.

                             HAWK
               Hey, don't take your disguise so
               seriously.

                             ANNA
               Uh, yeah.  Guess I'm a wee bit
               nervous.  I'm sorry I could only
               score clergy passports.

                             HAWK
               Fits my new image.  A thief for
               the masses.  This is one job I'm
               not going to feel guilty about
               enjoying.  Gum.

     Hawk, Alex, and Anna all spit out their gum into a bag
     Hawk holds.

                             ALEX
               The security's actually not that
               severe.

                             ANNA
               It doesn't have to be.  Everybody
               knows that if you mess with the
               Kremlin, you'll end up in a
               Siberian gulag eating your own
               fingernails.

     Hawk takes in some views of Moscow that remind one of
     Budapest.

                             HAWK
               Shwoof, that makes me feel better.
               I can't believe this is the Iron
               Curtain.  All the guy at Airport
               customs wanted to know was "Who
               Shot J.R.?"

                             ALEX
               You sound disappointed.

                             HAWK
               Yeah, I mean, come on, going
               through the Iron Curtain is
               supposed to be crawling
               underneath barbed wire, it's
               supposed to be strangling a
               guard...

     THE VAN

     passes a textbook shot of the Kremlin in the distance.

                             HAWK (V.O.)
               It's supposed to be parachuting
               in the moonlight....

     EXT. THE TOP OF THE KREMLIN--NIGHT

     Kaplan, Snickers, Almond Joy, and Butterfinger slam down
     upon the roof of the Kremlin and discard their
     parachutes.

     Snickers opens up his computer screen, upon which is the
     image-map of the Kremlin with a flashing blue light at
     the top of the building and a flashing green one inside.

                             SNICKERS
               We are the blue light.  The green
               light is where the Art Treasures
               room is.

                             KAPLAN
               Let's go make a purple light.
               Where's Kit Kat?

     EXT. THE KREMLIN GROUNDS

     Dressed in cat burglar black and all chewing gum, Hawk,
     Alex, and Anna crawl across the Kremlin grounds.  They
     scope out a shabby Delivery Entrance.

                             ALEX
               Delivery Entrance.  Low Security.

                             ANNA
               Gum.

     All three spit out their gum into Hawk's bag.

                             HAWK
               Count of three?

                             ALEX
               Why not just go now?

                             HAWK
               Okay.

     The Trio rush for the door.

     THE KREMLIN ROOF

     SOVIET GUARD ONE comes out on the roof to light a cig-
     arette.  He looks in the distance to the motivating CIA
     team.  Suddenly a card floats down into his hand.

     It reads:   WILLIAM TELL.  ADAM'S APPLE.  GET IT?

     The not-getting-it Guard looks up from the card as a
     grinning Kit Kat parachutes behind him.  The Guard
     swerves around and Kit Kat savagely skewers him with a
     crossbow shot to his Adam's apple.

     THE DELIVERY ENTRANCE

     Hawk, Anna, and Alex race to the door, the latter
     bashes it...

     INT. GRUNGY WHITE FOYER

     open and sets off an annoying hammer-against-bell alarm.
     Alex all-fours beneath the alarm.  Hawk does a Michael
     Jordan vault off Alex's back and slam dunks A MASSIVE
     BALL OF USED-GUM, pulled from his bag, between the
     hammer and the bell, cutting off the sound.  They rush
     ahead.

     EXT. THE KREMLIN ROOF

     The agents are trotting across the roof when a phone on
     Snickers' apparatus rings.  Kaplan answers it.

                             KAPLAN
               Everything's going fine, Minerva,
               thanks for asking...

     INT. NONDESCRIPT HALLWAY

     Minerva chats on a cellular moving down a hallway, with
     Darwin, who is holding in his laughter as if this was a
     great crank.

                             MINERVA
               I say who needs this Hudson Hawk
               anyway....

     INT. A GRAND BALLROOM

     The good guys scurry upon the second level of an epic
     and gorgeous ballroom.  Two lush staircases lead up from
     the floor.  From behind a pillar, the gang checks out
     the activity below.

     A tablecloth is being wrangled over a large table at
     the opposite end of the ballroom by SERVANTS.  Threaten-
     ing SOVIET SOLDIERS maneuver on the floor.

                             HAWK
                       (Wizard of Oz)
               Oh-Eee-Oh-A-Whoa-Oh.

     They then make a mad scuffle across their side of the
     second level, hunkering down by the level railing.

     As they move into another wing hallway, the viewer's
     viewpoint moves back down to the ballroom floor to see
     a gloating DARWIN AND MINERVA ENTER, the latter still
     on the phone.

                             MINERVA
               Everybody here, in Rome, wishes
               you tinsel boxes of love...

     The servants move away from the tablecloth and the
     table, revealing that it is shaped like an M.  A GROUP
     OF SERIOUS SOVIET V.I.P.'s come out to join the
     Mayflowers at the table.

     THE ROOF

     Kaplan hangs up the phone.

                             KAPLAN
               Lazy, rich, condescending bitch.

     The team moves up to the rooftop doorway where Kit Kat
     is.  He holds up an "About Time" card.  The agents laugh
     and greet them.

     INT. A VERY LONG, ENIGMATIC HALLWAY

     Hawk, Alex, and Anna pass through a set of windowed
     double doors into a very long hallway that leads into a
     pitch darkness.  A MURAL OF A HAPPY, ARM-STRETCHED LENIN
     looms above the doors.  They give it a a quick glance
     before pulling out screwdrivers and wire hangers.

                             ALEX
               Eighth room down, babe...

                             ANNA
               Guards come exactly every three
               minutes....

                             HAWK
               Three.  Oh.  Oh.  "Side by Side."

     Our trio charges down the hallway.

                             HAWK
               "Oh, we ain't got a barrel of
               money.

                             ALEX
               "Maybe we're ragged and funny."

     They reach a MASSIVE SPOOKY DOOR WITH AN ODD, ANCIENT
     LOCK.  They go to work on it.  Not losing the beat.

                             HAWK AND ALEX
               "But we'll travel along, singing
               a song.  Side by Side..."

     INT. TOP FLOOR HALLWAY

     With a gust of wind, Kaplan and the Candy Bars bluster
     through the rooftop door into another hallway, where
     SOVIET GUARDS TWO AND THREE are taking it easy.

                             KAPLAN
               Create a diversion.

     Snickers and Butterfinger calmly blow away both guards
     with silenced mini-Uzis.

     SOVIET GUARD FOUR rushes out a door before the agents,
     zipping up his fly.  Almond Joy twists his neck with an
     agonizing SNAP.

     THE LONG HALLWAY

     Hawk, Anna, and Alex retreat beneath the Lenin mural
     through the windowed double doors.

     Behind the doors, they poke up to see a BESPECTACLED
     GUARD emerge from the darkness to check out the door.

                             ALEX
               Now that's a lock.

                             HAWK
               Don't worry, we'll get it...

                             ANNA
               Can I sing this time, too?
               Please?

     Hawk and Alex are not thrilled about the idea, but Anna's
     eye flutter does it.

                             HAWK
               Uh, I guess so.

     The Bespectacled Guard moves back into the darkness.

     THE BALLROOM

     The Soviet V.I.P.'s open up presents of pink L.A. GEAR
     tennis shoes, silly T-shirts, and Nintendo joysticks
     as a standing Darwin hypnotizes them.

                             DARWIN
               I look at you Soviet people and I
               feel... pity... superiority.  Most
               of your life, your government has
               told you that Capitalism turns
               people into robots who'd rather
               eat microwave sushi, naked in the
               back of a Cadillac than hear the
               laughter of children.

                             MINERVA
                       (smiling)
               We're here to say, your government
               was right.

                             DARWIN
               So let's get busy.  Have some fun
               and make some deals.

     AT THE LOCK

     Alex holds a lit match into the lock, while Hawk
     does something incomprehensible with a screwdriver.
     They are improvising...

                             HAWK
               "Oh this lock is a pain in the bu-utt"

                             ALEX
               "How'd we ever get such in a ru-utt"

     Anna suddenly, booms out the chorus in a way that Hawk and
     Alex can barely concentrate.

                             ANNA
               "But we'll travel the road, Sharing
               the load.  Side by Side!"

     THE HALLWAY ABOVE

     The CIA team saunters through corpses up to a door
     similar in lock and design to the one Hawk and Alex
     are working on.

     Snickers's computer screen shows the blue light directly
     above the green light.

                             SNICKERS
               This is the room above the Art
               Treasures room.  The lock is a
               Natalya Z-Z, first created...

                             ALMOND JOY
               Snickers, baby, I love you like a
               brother, but really, who cares?
               Silencer bomb...

     Butterfinger pulls from around his shoulder a strange
     rifle.  He attaches to the front of it;, a glass encased,
     suctioning time-bomb from a waist satchel.  He fires
     the bomb against the door and it starts ticking.

     BEHIND THE WINDOWED DOUBLE DOORS

     come Hawk, Alex, and Anna, panting.

                             HAWK
               That was close....

                             ALEX
               Anna, I think you better stay....

                             HAWK
               You can be lookout!.....  Take
               Alex's gun.

     Alex hands Anna his gun, who glumly takes it like a Little
     Sister not allowed to play.  Hawk and Alex go back through
     the doors.

     THE HALLWAY ABOVE

     The CIA bomb blows up the door with a weird silencer
     sound.  Kaplan and the Candy Bars giddily whoop as they
     rush through the smoking door.

     THE BALLROOM--SECOND LEVEL

     Anna meanders across the second level muttering to herself
     in Italian and amusingly imitating Hawk's condescension.

                             ANNA
               "You can be the lookout."

     Anna suddenly moves past the pillar to see the Mayflowers
     and the V.I.P.S.  She gasps and hurls herself behind the
     second level railing.

     THE BALLROOM FLOOR

     A VERY DIGNIFIED SOVIET LEADER, in a SHIT HAPPENS baseball
     cap, addresses Darwin.

                             SOVIET LEADER
               Before we serve you "the main course,"
               hee, hee, we need to know specifics
               about what you can do for us.  We--

                             DARWIN
               Bluntness.  How amusingly Hungarian.
               Listen up, for reasons I don't want
               to get into, I recently had to close
               down a petroleum factory, but I'm
               going to re-build it here and
               Madonna's going to cut the ribbon!
               Frozen burritos in Leningrad.  1982
               fantasy.  1992 reality.

     THE LOCK OUTSIDE THE DOOR

     Hawk and Alex more frantically toil on the lock.

                             HAWK
               "We all had our quarrels and
               parted..."

                             ALEX
               "But we'll be the same as we started...

     The lock clunks open.  They race through the doors into...

     INT. THE ART TREASURE ROOM

     Hawk and Alex weave through the room which is crammed,
     with little nuance, to the gills with great art treasures
     including an impressive array of Faberge eggs.  A solid
     gold hammer and sickle hang on one wall...

                             HAWK AND ALEX
               "Just traveling along, singing a
               song.  Side--"

                             HAWK
               Geez, this place is a mess...

                             ALEX
               Voila...

     They rumble toward an opening in the wall of the room
     covered by a small curtain that has the Da Vinci Man in
     the Circle drawing emblazoned across it.  Hawk reaches
     for the curtain.  Alex puts his arm around him and speaks,
     not sings.

                             ALEX
               Side by side, man...

     Suddenly, the roof above them explodes.  Kaplan and the
     Candy Bars drop down behind them.

                             ALMOND JOY
               What the hell....

                             SNICKERS
               You're supposed to be dead!

                             ALEX
               I'm a ghost.  Boo.

                             HAWK
               I don't want to sound immature,
               but we were here first...

                             KAPLAN
               I wish I could think of those cute
               quips the way you can, Hawk, but
               I can't, so I'll just shoot Alex.

     Kaplan point blank shoots Alex in the chest.  Alex
     crumples backward, moaning.  Butterfinger, casually, but
     with incredible strength, holds Hawk's arms behind his
     back.

                             HAWK
               No....

                             ALMOND JOY
               That was pretty uncool, George...

                             KAPLAN
               Sorry, you know he kind of reminds
               me of Little Eddie.  But I digress.
               Ah, victory is so sweet....

     Kaplan pulls back the Da Vinci curtain.  Nothing is there.

     THE BALLROOM BANQUET

     A SOVIET CHEF lifts up a silver domed serving tray,
     revealing the Da Vinci helicopter model.

                             MINERVA
               Yum.  This is the best meal I
               ever had...

     ANNA

     bulges her eyes at the revelation.  She pulls out Alex's
     gun and bangs herself in the head.  What to do....

     THE ART TREASURES ROOM

     Kaplan is bugging out.

                             KAPLAN
               Damnit, this isn't the plan!
               Blue light, green light, shit!
               Snickers, Kit Kat, A.J., scramble,
               see if you can find out anything.

     They thunder out.  Hawk, still in Butterfinger's
     oblivious clutches, shouts..

                             HAWK
               Can't you see the Mayflowers
               double-crossed you...

                             KAPLAN
               They may be scum, but if I get the
               Da Vinci model back, then we'll be
               roasting weenies on the beach.

                             HAWK
               I don't think you'll appreciate
               their choice of weenie.

     Kaplan raises his gun.

     THE BALLROOM BANQUET

     Darwin holds the Da Vinci model in one hand and raises
     a glass of vodka in the other.

                             DARWIN
               You're helping us achieve a goal
               and in return, I'm giving you a
               key to the world's executive
               washroom.  Don't piss it away....
               Skoal, amigos...

                              ANNA (O.S.)
               Stop or I'll shoot.

     Minerva and some various Soviet VIPS spew their vodka to
     look up to Anna pointing a gun down at them from the
     second level.  She is shivering, shaking the gun.

                              ANNA
               You people are immoral and
               narcissitic and I won't let you...

     In unison, the Soviet Soldiers surrounding the table
     begin machine gunning up at her.  She dives behind the
     railing.

     THE ART TREASURES ROOM

     Kaplan lowers his gun.

                             KAPLAN
               I can't believe this.  I'm in
               fucking Russia, or do I have to
               say, the fucking Soviet Union and
               I'm shooting a non-Bolshevick.
                       (raising back up
                        his gun)
               I never thought I'd say "I'm just
               in this job for the money."  Sad.
               Any last immature quips?

                             HAWK
               No.
                       (a beat)
               But why do you let Butterfinger
               keep those blood stains on his
               shirt?

     Falling for the oldest trick in the book, Butterfinger
     looks down to his shirt.

                             BUTTERFINGER
               What blood stains....

     Hawk bounces up to savagely head-butt Butterfinger.
     Butterfinger slams back against a wall causing the Gold
     Sickle to fall down around his neck and knock him to the
     ground, pinning his head to the floor.  The Gold Hammer
     next trembles off the wall and crushes Butterfinger's
     skull.

                             HAWK
               You want immature, how 'bout an
               egg fight...

     Hawk flings a Faberge egg, smashing the gun out of Kaplan's
     hand.  Hawk pelts a batch more at him.  Kaplan sloppily
     whips some eggs back.  Hawk finally smashes one in half
     and beans the jagged piece into Kaplan's eye.  He squeals
     to the ground, geysering blood.

     Hawk swoops down to a wheezing, breath controlling Alex.

                             HAWK
               Alex, are you....

                             ALEX
               I can't believe you didn't notice.
               My weight.  I lost ten pounds in
               Rome

                              HAWK
               You're a reed, man.  I gotta get
               Anna.  Hang in there...

     THE BALLROOM

     Bullets stop splintering around Anna at the railing as
     the soldiers fling out their empty cartridges to reload.

     Snickers, Almond Joy, and Kit Kat race out of the hall-
     way area into the ballroom area.  They stop at the sight
     of Anna....

                             ALMOND JOY
               Anna-bannana-fo-fanna, I guess I
               have to cut out your heart for
               real now.  It's not personal.

     Anna feebly raises her gun.  Almond Joy laughs and
     pulls out a knife.

                             ALMOND JOY
               You won't shoot.  I read your
               dossier... Sister.

     The Soviet Soldiers snap in new cartridges as Almond Joy
     moves out from behind the pillar towards Anna.  The
     Soldiers blast away at this newly appearing figure.

     Almond Joy ruptures and vibrates in a Sonny Corleone
     ballet.

                             ALMOND JOY
               I gotta get a new job...

     Snickers and Kit Kat militarily roll on either side of
     Anna as their partner wilts to the ground.  The men,
     Snickers with his mini-Uzi, Kit Kat with his cross-
     bow rifle, briefly leap up to fire down at the soldiers
     with some graphic success.

     Anna watches Darwin and Minerva head up the stairs to
     her level.  She bolts off....

     BALLROOM FLOOR

     The last of the Soviet VIPS flee as the Soldiers tip
     over the M shaped table on its side, using it for
     cover, firing upward.

     KIT KAT

     breaks off and scurries around the second level to get
     a position behind the M.

     He fires down an arrow for a successful kill.  Another
     guard tries to fire up, but Kit Kat impales him to the
     back of the table with a quality shot.

     Kit Kat grins and reloads as Alfred, the butler, regally
     creeps behind him.

     HAWK

     comes out of the long hallway double doors up to where
     Anna is bustling.  They hug...

                             ANNA
               The Mayflowers got...

     Hawk and Anna turn to see the Mayflowers hastening in
     their direction.  Noticing them back, the model-toting
     Mayflowers halt.

     KIT KAT

     turns to Alfred and fires his crossbow.  Alfred effort-
     lessly cuts it in half with his blade and continues
     to move forward.  Still smiling, Kit Kat tries to reload.

     MINERVA

     breaks the standstill.

                             DARWIN
               What a pleasant surprise.  You're
               probably wondering...

                             HAWK
               But you're going to tell us
               anyway...

                             MINERVA
               I hate a man with a sense of
               humor.  While you corn dogs were
               comparing the lengths of your
               masculinity, we obtained the
               helicopter the new fashioned
               way: a thoroughly corrupt business
               deal.

                             HAWK
               If you think you're getting past
               me...

     Grunting behind them, Snickers gun-butts Hawk to the
     ground.

                             HAWK
               Don't be stupid...they...

                             SNICKERS
               Bastard!  If you were a true
               American.

                             HAWK
               Just shut up and hit me!

     Snickers swings a punch.  Hawk blocks it then whomps
     him in the chest.

     As they battle, Darwin grabs Anna's hair, slams her
     into a pillar, and watches her crumple.

     KIT KAT

     gets in an arrow but it's too late.  Alfred stabs
     him deep, deep, deeply, and lifts him from the ground.

     A shower of cards reading "OUCH" "PAIN" and "THIS REALLY
     HURTS" rain from out of Kit Kat's coat.

     Alfred discards him over the edge.

     Kit Kat sails down upon the M.

     The lone card of "FUCK" plops from his open eyed corpse.

     HAWK

     and Snickers trades fierce blows, stumbling down a
     staircase.

     DARWIN

     and Minerva watch the fight with amusement.  Alfred
     approaches.

                             DARWIN
               Alfred, the getaway car...

     SNICKERS

     slashes Hawk in the arm with a small but sinister blade.

                             HAWK
               Damnit, I hate this!  I'm a cat
               burglar!  Nobody said anything
               about this fight-to-the-death
               shit.

                             SNICKERS
               Too bad.

     Snickers goes for a final thrust when suddenly one of the
     silencer time bombs suctions to his head.

     Hawk turns to see Alex, barely standing, at the top of
     the stairs, holding the strange rifle.

     Darwin and Minerva turn to this dramatic entrance.  They
     start to trot off...

                             MINERVA
               I knew it!  I told you it was a
               fake.

                             DARWIN
               That New-York-Italian-Father-
               made-twenty-bucks-a-week-son-
               of-a-bitch.  What was our bet?  A
               million?

                             MINERVA
               Million five, lover...

     HAWK

     boots Snickers down the stairs.  Snickers somersaults
     up and frantically tries to pull off the bomb.

     Snickers wails to the soldiers, who have lowered their
     guns and are poking their heads out of the M to watch.

                             SNICKERS
               Help me you Democratic Reform
               lovers!  Get a screwdriver, you
               Stupid Eskimoes!  Screw-dri-ver!
               Oh God, I always wanted to know
               how to play the harp, there
               just was so little time!  Rosebud!

     The soldiers high-tail it out.  Snickers plugs his ears.
     Nothing happens.

                             SNICKERS
               Maybe it was just a....

     Snickers blows up gloriously before the M.

     THE STAIRCASE

     Hawk bounds up to Alex, who puffs down onto the steps.

                             ALEX
               Get 'em.  They went down the
               hallway.

                             HAWK
               Let's just forget it, I mean...

                             ALEX
               Get em....

     Hawk rushes up the. stairs, gives a "What can I do?" glance
     to the unconscious Anna, and then continues rushing, past
     a pillar.  Minerva emerges from behind the pillar and
     moves forward.

     THE LONG ENIGMATIC HALLWAY

     Hawk chugs beneath the Lenin mural and down the hall-
     way.  He sees Darwin breezing in front of him.  Darwin
     looks back to Hawk then runs forward into the darkness.

     THE BALLROOM

     Minera sits down next to the pained Alex.

                             MINERVA
               Alex.  How's it going?

                             ALEX
               Go, go to Hell, to Hell.

     Minerva pulls out a candy bar and rips it open.

                             MINERVA
               Where's your insulin....No?  Well,
               Bon Appetite.

     Minerva savagely slams Alex's head down and shoves the
     candy bar in his mouth.

     THE HALLWAY

     Hawk moves closer and closer to the darkness of the
     hallway when a one-eyed and bleeding George Kaplan dives
     out of the Art Treasures room and tackles him.  Hawk
     kicks him off...

                             HAWK
               Oh, come on....

     THE BALLROOM

     Alex gulps down the last of the candy bar, shivering.

                             MINERVA
               Very good, Alex, but you re
               still alive....

     She pulls out another candy bar.  Alex, with a last
     burst of strength, punches her across the face.

                             MINERVA
               That's fair.

     THE LONG HALLWAY

     Hawk and Kaplan lock onto each other's throats.

                             HAWK
               Why does this have to be so hard...

                             KAPLAN
               Tell me about it...

     Suddenly, of all things, a car is heard rumbling in the
     darkness.

     Hawk and Kaplan stop fighting and turn to see THE MAY-
     FLOWER LIMOUSINE screeching out of the darkness with
     Darwin standing out of the sunroof firing a gun.

     Bullets fly around them.  From his back pocket, Hawk
     slaps the nice picture of him and Little Eddie into
     Kaplan's hands.

                             HAWK
               Take this to Hell with you...

     Hawk jumps up and grabs a hanging lamp.

     Deranged with confusion, Kaplan turns from the picture
     to the charging limousine.

                             KAPLAN
               My pension.....

     The driving Alfred smiles through the windshield.

     Kaplan's body slams into a vivid somersaulting crash
     into the windshield.

     Hawk's hands burn and sizzle on the hanging lamp.

     Passing beneath, Darwin raises up his gun.

     Hawk lets go of the lamp and drops down on Darwin,
     locking his legs around his neck and crushing him
     down into....

     THE BACKSEAT OF THE LIMOUSINE

     Hawk and Darwin grapple on the floor of the limo.  The
     Da Vinci helicopter model bobs on the backseat.  Darwin's
     gun goes off..

     right through Alfred's throat.  He slumps over, pressing
     down on the accelerator.

     THE LIMOUSINE

     blasts down the hallway, sparking off the wall, and
     bashing off paintings and mirrors.

     THE BACKSEAT

     Darwin flicks on his paper shredder and shoves the side
     of Hawk's hand into its teeth.

     OUTSIDE THE LIMOUSINE

     A mist of blood coughs out of the shredder vent and makes
     a weird bloody line across the wall.

     INT. BACKSEAT

     Hawk yanks his hand from the shredder and grabs the meg-
     lomaniac by the hair and shoves his head down on the
     arm rest.  Hawk turns on the piercing siren and Darwin's
     eyes try to escape his head with a high pitched scream.
     Darwin's entire body bucks wildly.

     Darwin back-elbows Hawk and moves down for his gun.
     Hawk pulls him back by his hair, grabs him by the balls,
     and pushes him upward through the sunroof.

                             DARWIN
               God-damnit, I only wanted to
               destroy the world in my own image.
               I'm a regular Joe...

     Darwin pounds his fists on Hawk's head as Hawk hits the
     sunroof switch sliding it shut on Darwin, pinning
     his arms below the roof, but leaving his torso twisting
     in the wind.

     The mural of a happy Lenin with his arms outstretched
     looms ahead waiting to greet Darwin.

     Putting two and two together, Darwin loses it....

                             DARWIN
               Not Lenin, anybody but Lenin.  God,
               let's talk abut this.

     The limousine charges through the double doors and Darwin's
     body connects with the mural.

     INSIDE THE LIMO

     Hearing the crunch, Hawk flips into the front seat and
     brakes the vehicle.  Alfred's head bounces against the
     steering wheel.  Hawk reaches over with a grin and picks
     up the Da Vinci model.  He looks to Alfred, Kaplan
     crunched in the windshield, and Darwin's dangling legs.

                             HAWK
               Wow, this is really gonna hurt the
               resale value...

     THE BALLROOM

     Hawk runs up to a woozy Anna and helps her up.  She has
     a cross-shaped blood stain on her forehead.

                             HAWK
               Oh, honey....

     Hawk looks to Alex, sitting on the stairs, the same way
     he left him.  Hawk rushes to him.

                             HAWK
               We did it man, we...

     Hawk grabs Alex's shoulder.  Alex falls back.  Written
     over his face in red lipstick is REALLY DEAD.

     Engaging a slow motion sequence, Minerva saunters behind
     Anna, putting on red lipstick.  Minerva slams her back
     to the ground.

     Hawk howls then turns to see stiff-upper-lip Alfred,
     bleeding from the neck.  Hawk tries to throw a punch,
     but Alfred blocks it and crunches him across the face.

     The Da Vinci helicopter model bounces down the stairs
     in slow motion and cracks open, revealing the intricate
     mirror of the opening scene.

     INT. DARK ROOM ATOP MAYFLOWER MUSEUM--DAY

     A damaged Hawk awakens in a dungeonish room and stumbles
     to some shutters.  "O Solo Mio" returns on the sound-
     track as the shutters open to a postcard view of Vinci.

     Hawk closes the shutters and cuts off the music.  A
     slightly more composed Anna touches his shoulder causing
     him to jump slightly.  They melt into a kiss.

                             ANNA
               Oh Hudson...

                             HAWK
               I told you not to call me Hudson.
               The only people who called me that
               were the nuns at...

                             ANNA
               Oh Hudson, I'm a sister of the
               Catholic church as well as an
               agent.

                             HAWK
                       (cut-off laugh)
               This is too bad to be false.

     Alfred enters the room in his favorite outfit with a
     bandage around his neck.  His voice is strange, but still
     polite.

                             ALFRED
               Welcome back to Vinci.

                             HAWK
               Last rites, sister?

                             ANNA
               Please, no nun jokes...They're a
               bad habit to get into....get it?

     Hawk and Anna unconvincingly laugh then sadly pause.

                              HAWK
               She killed Alex.

     Alfred gives them a push.

     INT. THE DA VINCI WORKSHOP

     Alfred leads them through the Da Vinci workshop past the
     bat winged glider and incongruously crammed-in tennis ball
     machine.

     INT. THE ROOM OF THE GOLD MACHINE--DAY

     Alfred grandly opens double-doors to reveal that Da
     Vinci's gold machine has been majestically re-created
     piece by piece.  In the periphery, the 90's rears its
     head in the form of THREE TECHNICIANS wearing headsets
     and gun holsters who consult computer terminals.

                              MINERVA (O.S.)
               GOLD-FI-ING-ER!

     Hawk and Anna turn to see Minerva splashily enter in
     sexy funeral-wear.

                              MINERVA
               Sorry, I couldn't resist.  You're
               probably wondering why you're
               still alive.  Anna.....

     As Minerva speaks, TECHNICIAN ONE forcibly escorts Anna
     toward a stand near the gold machine and tightly
     handcuffs her to it.

                              MINERVA
               I want you to monitor the Da
               Vinci's directions from the
               apprentice diary.  And Hawk, I
               didn't want you to go to hell
               without knowing that Darwin and
               I's dream came true.
                       (suddenly sheepish)
               Beside that, none of us can seem
               to put that damn crystal together.
               Alfie and I were up all night with
               the thing.

     TECHNICIAN TWO commences a forcible escort of Hawk to the
     gold machine.  Hawk cold-cocks him to the ground.

                              HAWK
               You killed a friend.  Why should I
               help you go for the gold?

                              MINERVA
               It'll take a couple of years of
               steady production, but I'll flood
               the market with so much gold that
               gold itself, the foundation of all
               finance, will lose its meaning.
               Brokers, economists, and fellow
               entrepreneurs will drown in the
               saliva of their own nervous
               breakdowns.  Markets will crash-
               crash.  Financial Empires will
               crumble-crumble.

                              HAWK
               Except yours-yours.  The goal of
               world domination.  Well, if you
               put it that way, Minnie.  How can
               I resist?

                              MINERVA
               You can't, convict!  You're just
               a shmoe!  Every shmoe has the
               fantasy the planet revolves around
               them.  It rains, car crash stops
               traffic, you say "How could this
               happen to me?"  It's a natural
               inclination.  But for I, this
               isn't a fantasy, it is reality!
               You are on my planet!  You walk
               around the corner for coffee, out
               of my sight, you do not fucking
               exist!  The lives of shmoes like
               you have meaning only in relation
               to the rich, to the powerful, to ME!

     Anna looks at the oil cloth diary before her.  She pulls
     a compact from her pocket and holds the compact mirror
     over the scribblings.  Reading off the reflection, her
     eyes widen.

                              ANNA
               Do it.  There's no reason to fight
               anymore.  She's a force of nature.

     Trying to get a grip on Anna's words, Hawk lets himself
     be escorted to another stand before the gold machine that
     has the two complex crystal parts and the weird mirror.

                              MINERVA
               If you pull this off, I can't
               promise I won't kill you.  I mean,
               who we trying to kid?  But I will
               spare the Flying Nun here....

                              HAWK
               And to think I thought you were
               Evil Incarnate in pumps.

                              MINERVA
               I killed some lovable working
               class Italian-diabetic, but you
               killed the most significant male
               figure of the decade and a kind,
               gentle lover.  So don't play with
               me.

     Minerva flicks a switch on the stand Anna's handcuffed
     to.  Anna vibrates, being electrocuted.

                              HAWK
               Okay, fine!

     Minerva switches it off.  Giving himself a head rub, Hawk
     bears down on the three oddly malleable objects.  He
     TANGLES and BENDS and with a loud SNAP, puts them
     together, forming the Crystal from the opening scene.
     Minerva snatches it from him and puts on a head-set.

                              MINERVA
               Oh Hawk, don't ever change.  Go,
               team, go!

     Minerva giddily sets the crystal in the same place as Da
     Vinci had it in his machine.

     Using a long steel pole, Technician One adjusts a myriad
     of mirrors so they are in a proper angle with a series
     of lenses culminating on the top of the machine.

     Technicians Two (black-eyed) and Three pour various
     chemical powders and liquids into corresponding compart-
     ments on the machine, beautifully decorated by the
     chemical's zodiac sign.

     Alfred places a lead bar in its proper place.

     Hawk glides to Anna and undoes her handcuff.

                              HAWK
               I hope you know what....

                              ANNA
               Trust Leonardo....

                              HAWK
               Wha.....

     Anna puts her fingers on his lips.

     Minerva throws a lever.  Steam begins to percolate from
     the furnace towards the machine.

                              MINERVA
                       (into the headset)
               We're for real.

     THE MACHINE

     begins to rotate, at first clunkily, then faster.
     The Crystal rotates comfortably in its compartment.

     The machine throws out its folding arms, each with an
     element.  The arms click higher.

     The goggled technicians stand before a time-coded video
     monitor, taking notes.

     The chemical housings open and the chemicals begin to
     spill and drop through brass tubes.

     ANNA

     murmurs to Hawk.

                              ANNA
               Da Vinci made the real directions
               in a secret script that I decoded.
               The way the machine is running
               now, the gold will produce too
               quickly, clog, and the machine
               will shut itself down.  Isn't it
               wonderful?

                              HAWK
               Yeah, but what would happen if that
               little mirror came out of the
               crystal.

                              ANNA
               Wha -- you don't want to know...

     Hawk pulls out the mirror from his pocket.

                              HAWK
               I wanna know...

                              ANNA
               Holy sh-h--things are going to
               get very interesting, very fast.
               Da Vinci would be proud of you.

     IN THE MACHINE

     The chemicals snake down their individual paths to the
     Lead Bar spinning its trough.  There's a FLASH and a
     controlled but jarring explosion.

     EVERYONE

     doubletakes.  Hawk reaches down to the six foot steel
     pole and with one swing slams the faces of all three
     deep in concentration Technicians to the ground.

     Oblivious to the violence behind her, Minerva, pulling
     on goggles over her head-set, moves closer with a
     religious purr.

     THE MACHINE

     triggers a fresnel lens and laserlike beams bounce around
     the mirrors faster and faster, circling the room.

     OUTSIDE THE MACHINE

     Hawk and Anna squint, blinded.  Flinging off her goggles,
     A literally beaming Minerva giggles forward.

     THE MACHINE

     Beams of light converge on the top mirror and bounce into
     the innards of the machine with a mighty roar!

     MINERVA

     sees that the center of the machine gleams yellowish and
     molten.  She moves closer, shouting into her head-set.

                              MINERVA
               Eureka, motherfuckers!

     The machine thunders and spins at a more aggressive
     pace.

     Hawk's voice suddenly comes on Minerva's head-set.

                              HAWK'S VOICE (head-set)
               Minnie, hate to interrupt your
               orgasm, but....

     HAWK AND ANNA

     stand above the unconscious Technicians.  Hawk is on
     head-set.

                              HAWK
               Me, Anna, and Leonardo just wanna
               say you got the Midas touch, baby...

     MACHINE

     Minerva turns toward the machine in anger and confusion.

     The center of the machine blows.  The pool of molten gold
     rockets at the viewer.

     Mirrors explode and the lasers slash at the walls.

     Minerva tumbles from the machine, screaming, that is to
     say, trying to scream, because molten gold covers her
     face.  It bubbles and cascades, turning her into a
     bizarrely beautiful echo of Nefertiti.

     HAWK AND ANNA

     turn to retreat, and see, standing in the mouth of the
     open double doors, in an open shirt, wearing Indian war
     paint on his face and the words RULE BRITANNIA painted
     on his chest, ALFRED!

                              ALFRED
               How.

                              HAWK
               You're unemployed, Alfie.  Boss
               is dead.  Her plan is over.

                              ALFRED
                       (strange voiced)
               My plan is just beginning.  I'll
               forgive you for denying me the
               pleasure of slaughtering my
               boorish employers, but I'm afraid
               the birth of the new British
               Empire can have no witnesses!

                              HAWK
               Ooh-kay...

     Alfred rushes forward with a howl.  Hawk meets him
     halfway.  They trade savage punches and then lock onto
     each other's throats.

     Anna pulls a gun from a technician's holster and prays
     for forgiveness.  She aims steadily, and fires...

     right into Hawk's arm.  This allows Alfred to knock him
     back with a strong punch.

                              ANNA
               Sorry!

     She fires again.  The bullet pings off Hawk's belt buckle.

                              HAWK
               Stop helping me!  Thou shalt not
               kill!

     Hawk's turning to chastize Anna, allows Alfred to kick
     Hawk back against a wall.  Alfred lunges out with his
     blade, hitting the wall off-angle.  Hawk yanks the shaft.
     Alfred goes with the flow and presses the shaft on Hawk's
     throat.

     Gasping, Hawk looks to a rip in Alfred's shirt and sees
     a hinge and lever on the shaft.  With an all or nothing
     jerk, Hawk flicks the lever.  The shaft clicks on the
     hinge.

     Alfred's greater strength and narrower grip makes it fold
     away from Hawk and suddenly it is Alfred's throat which
     is caught in the V-shaped trap!  The momentum of the
     sudden change makes Alfred stumble towards the wall until
     the point of the "V" hits it--

                              HAWK
               Don't lose your head over this.

     Hawk takes the six foot steel pole and gives a Babe Ruth
     swing right onto the V.  The blades slam together and
     POP ALFRED'S HEAD OFF, SENDING IT SCREAMING DISEMBODIED,
     HIGH IN THE AIR.

     ALFRED'S SCREAMING HEAD P.O.V.

     Hawk and Anna are seen waving up to the viewer (Alfie's
     head).

                              HAWK
               Excuse my crass American humor.

     The machine thunders with another explosion.

     THE DA VINCI WORKSHOP

     Hawk and Anna rush into the Da Vinci workshop.  She
     guiltily touches the surface wound on his arm.  He
     delicately takes the gun from her and laughs until he
     sees...

     BUNNY THE DOG!! standing in the open mouth of the
     workshop.  Anna turns to Hawk...

                              ANNA
               Allow me.

     Anna confidently moves toward the dog until Bunny leaps
     up and savagely clamps his teeth into her throat sending
     her crashing to the ground.

     Hawk pauses in disbelief before raising the gun.

     Bunny continues to viciously gnaw away on the convulsing
     Anna, blood gently starts to emerge.

     Hawk can't get off a shot.  He throws down the gun in
     exasperation.  It lands next to The Gadget that is
     connected to the Tennis Ball Machine.  Hawk rushes
     forward, picks up the gadget, turns the dial to Ten, and
     then smiles sweetly toward the dog.

                              HAWK
               Oh Bunny, Ball-Ball.

     Bunny stops his violent behavior and perkily looks up
     blood droplets drizzling from his mouth.

     Hawk slams down on the gadget.

     A tennis ball comes rocketing out of the machine.

     Bunny leaps and catches the rocketing ball but the force
     of it sends him FLYING AND CRASHING out a window.

     Hawk pulls up Anna as the machine completely EXPLODES.

     A huge chunk of the roof THUDS before the workshop door.

     Hawk suddenly looks off-camera and smiles.  Anna shakes
     her head vigorously.  He pulls her out of the frame.

     EXT. A VINCI COUNTRYSIDE TREE

     A man awakens from a nap and pulls up his hat.  It is THE
     TRAVELING JUGGLER WITH THE UNFORGETTABLY ETCHED FACE.

     He pulls his three red balls from a pouch on his mule.
     He begins a stoic juggle when another loud BOOM sends him
     to the ground.

     EXT. OUTSIDE THE GRAND CASTLE--DAY

     An explosion of steam and gas blows out the windows!
     Debris frisbees toward the camera along with....

     Anna, hanging on Hawk's waist, and Hawk, hanging from
     the bar on DA VINCI'S BAT WINGED GLIDER.

     The glider gracefully swooshes down through the castle -
     through the glorious vista.

     EXT. THE ROAD TO THE CASTLE

     The glider floats to a perfect landing before the
     Unforgettable Juggler.

                             JUGGLER
                         Che pazzo....

     Hawk and Anna collect themselves and look up to the smoke
     billowing castle.  They smile and gush in relief.  They
     wrap arms around the confused but warming up Juggler and
     laugh again.

     A SMALL PIAZZA

     The mule trots into a small storybook piazza in the hush
     of dawn.  Hawk, Anna, and the unforgettable Juggler ride
     atop it.

     A WOMAN WITH AN UNFORGETTABLY ETCHED FACE moves to a cafe
     table with a luminous smile.  She unfolds a table cloth
     atop it and then mystically sets down two cappuccinos.

     Hawk and Anna dismount, thank the Juggler, then cozy into
     the table.

                             HAWK
               Have I ever told you the world is
               beautiful...
                       (semi-seductively)
               I'd really like to play
               Nintendo with you, or something...

                             ANNA
               Hudson, I'm afraid I'm sticking
               with God.
                       (smiling)
               But you're a close second, tough
               guy.  What is that smile?

                             HAWK
                       (broadly grinning)
               I got my planet back.

     Hawk puts on a pair of sunglasses that look exactly like
     the ones Da Vinci wore in the opening and raises his cup.

                             HAWK
               The first one's for Alex.  Cheers.

     The viewer's viewpoint moves into Hawk's lips having a
     sip of that damn unmasculine European coffee.

                                                FADE OUT.

     FADE IN:

     EXT. VINCI COUNTRYSIDE - RENAISSANCE - DAY

     Beneath a jawdroppingly storybook castle, a small
     Renaissance Fair with florid awnings, demented ACROBATS
     and roaring puppets is unfolding.

     RUSTIC FARMERS and their families rumble with enjoyment
     at the Sabbath afternoon entertainment.

     Encircled by children, A JUGGLER WITH AN UNFORGETTABLY
     ETCHED FACE elegantly plucks the red balls from a pouch
     on his mule.  As he begins to juggle, a LOUD EXPLOSION
     is heard, causing him to ungracefully drop his balls
     and collapse in a heap.

     Everyone at the fair, including the puppets, looks up.

                             UNFORGETTABLE JUGGLER
               Leonardo, che pazzo.

     The juggler shakes his fist up to a swish pan that swings
     up toward a smoking window of the awesome castle...

     INT. ROOM OF THE GOLD MACHINE

     where the charismatic LEONARDO DA VINCI laughs down at
     him.  Da Vinci wears a pair of very early, very cool sun-
     glasses with his trademark beard.

     He turns and loses his smile, something extraordinary
     reflecting off his glasses.  Removing his shades, Da
     Vinci moves to the Something, a gloriously incredible
     machine.  The opening CREDITS REVEAL its dazzling idio-
     syncrasies.

     TWO COUGHING APPRENTICES haplessly try to disperse smoke
     from the still billowing, mysteriously spectacular
     Machine.  Mirrors attached to parts of it reflect beams
     of light which cut through the smoke like a Renaissance
     laser show.

                             DA VINCI
                       (silencing authority)
               Basta vapore.

     The apprentice throws a lever.  A shunt near the furnace
     turns.  Steam escapes upwards.  The machine immediately
     slows down.  Da Vinci oh-so-gently coughs and moves for-
     ward with tongs.

     A LITTLE TROUGH - IN THE MACHINE'S INNARDS

     comes to a trembling, mystical halt.  Right behind this
     trough is a CONPLEX POLYHEDRON CRYSTAL as intricately
     modulated as any Rubik stocking stuffer, but much more
     dazzling in beauty.  It gleams like a jewel in the yellow
     glow which pours from a PLEASANTLY GRINNING DEMONHEAD into
     a trough--a glow of heat--and something more than heat.

     The tongs enter the frame.

     Da Vinci brings the object closer to his face.  A murmur
     goes up from the awestruck apprentices as the Master
     peers at the smoking yellow bar.

                             APPRENTICE TWO
               Maestro, che meraviglia!

                             APPRENTICE THREE
               Lei e' proprio fantastico!

     Da Vinci's pride goes dead as the implications hit.

                             DA VINCI
               Lasciatemi, solo.  Solo!

     The apprentices scurry out.  Mind reeling, Da Vinci turns
     his back to the viewer, before a wall of frescoes.

                             DA VINCI
               L'ho fatto.

     Spinning back around, using the edge of his cloak, Da
     Vinci pulls out the large gleaming crystal with a pop.

     INT. DA VINCI'S WORKSHOP

     With an accompanying blast of smoke, Da Vinci bursts
     through some double doors into his workshop, sadly
     reflecting upon the crystal in one hand and the tonged
     bar in the other.

     His workshop is a spendiferously enigmatic blend of
     laboratory and studio; On a table in the foreground is
     a fresh clay equestrian statue; a large VOLUME of
     sketches, the inkwell nearby; a MODEL of what looks like
     a HELICOPTER; Da Vinci flings the tonged bar on the table
     among these goodies.

     Pocketing the crystal, Da Vinci meanders through his work-
     shop casually tinkering with various experiments.  He
     snaps his fingers at a BATHING SUITED APPRENTICE, wearing
     a diving helmet prototype.  The Apprentice jumps into a
     pool of water.

     Leonardo next stops at an easel displaying a finished-
     except-for-the-mouth portrait of Mona Lisa, who happens
     to be seated in a stool before the easel.  She broadly
     smiles, revealing the worst dental work of her epoch.
     Da Vinci shakes his head and moves out onto a

     EXT. CASTLE TERRACE

     A FLYING APPRENTICE sails past Leonardo in a bat winged
     glider, enthusiastically shouting.  Da Vinci grins back
     until he touches his pocket.  He pulls out the crystal
     and, after a beat, angrily twists it apart into two
     separate, geometric pieces revealing a small intricate
     mirror.  He quickly folds the surprisingly shapable
     geometric pieces.

     Calming down, Da Vinci looks from the three components of
     the crystal to each of the three unfinished works on the
     table in his workshop.  He ponders then looks back out to
     the Vinci vista.

     The bat winged glider DISSOLVES into:

     A HAWK

     who is revealed to be flying over Sing Sing prison.

     INT. A SING SING PRISON CELL

     The shadow of the hawk passes through a cell window, over
     the face of EDDIE HUDSON HAWKINS causing him to break out
     of an eye-closed trance.

     Before the viewer can get a good look at him, Hudson
     Hawk turns to an oddball version of the "Mona Lisa" that
     has his face and tears it off the cell back-wall.

     INT. PRISON BLOCK WALKWAY

     TWO PRISON GUARDS, One WISE and BLACK, the other YOUNG
     and GREEN march down a cell block.  The Former is smoking
     a pipe which the Young Guard lights with a lighter.

                             WISE GUARD
               We're losing our biggest celebrity
               today.

                             YOUNG GUARD
               You're kidding, Petey the Paint
               Thinner Killer is getting paroled?

                             WISE GUARD
               Not that slime, you Fizzhead.
               Hudson Hawk.  The last of the
               great cat burglars.

     INT. PRISON CELL WALL

     A hand tears down a picture of a happy Hudson Hawk and
     a LITTLE MONKEY, identically dressed in black cat
     burglar gear.

     THE BLOCK

     The Wise Guard and the Young Guard rumble forward.

                             WISE GUARD
               As a thief, Hawk was a poem.
               Iambic fucking pentameter.  You
               know, Crime used to have a little
               class.  A hundred reporters were
               here when he came in, now they're
               probably out covering some tired
               crack gang war...

     The Guards approach Hawk's cell.  Hawk, with his back
     turned, hefts on a nifty blazer.

                             HAWK
               Remind me to fire my publicist.

     The Wise Guard chuckles as the Young Guard fumbles with
     his key-ring.

                             YOUNG GUARD
               Darn, these are for L-block...

     Hawk's hand reaches through the bars and grabs a pipe
     cleaner from the Wise Guard's pocket.  Then the lighter
     from the Young Guard's pocket--BURNS OFF the fabric fuzz
     with the lighter beside it--bends the now blackened
     wire--and with a quick turn of the wrist uses it to
     UNLOCK the door.

                             YOUNG GUARD
               - go back down to security and-

     He stops, dumbfounded, as the door clunks open.  The
     Guards double-take as Hawk, finally in full view, struts
     past them, down the hall.  The Guards hustle to catch
     up.  The wise guard puts his finger in the air and
     sarcastically pretends to be stung by the heat emanating
     from Hawk.

                             WISE GUARD
               Guess this means, Hawk, you'll
               be able to let yourself back in...

                             HAWK
               Never happen.  Bet.  Ten bucks.

     Hawk and the Wise Guard hit fists, half-smiling.  Hawk
     unfolds the painting.

                             HAWK
               Oh, give this back to Petey in A
               block.  Tell him it was a sweet
               gift, but I think he got some
               wrong ideas about our friendship.

                             YOUNG GUARD
               The Paint Thinner Killer did
               this?  I think you picked a good
               day to get out...

     The trio comes to the final checkpoint.  Hawk takes a
     deep breath.

                             WISE GUARD
               Hope I lose the bet.  Have that
               cappuccino on me.

                             HAWK
                       (flipping him the
                        pipe cleaner)
               You got it.  A double.

     EXT. OUTSIDE THE PRISON--DAY

     Hawk strides to the Massive Sliding Concrete Door/Wall
     between him and freedom.  As music crescendos and
     Hawk glows his first smile, the door opens to reveal two
     Mafioso brothers, CESAR and ANTONY MARIO, the latter
     sitting upon the hood of a tinted window Lincoln
     Continental.  Cesar is of cool, hair-slicked-back
     attitude, his scumbag brother is not.

                             ANTONY
               Welcome back, buddy ol' pal.
               We've got a proposition...

                              HAWK
               Answer's no, not even if you
               bathe.  Cesar Mario, Antony Mario,
               how's the "Family?"  Kill any
               monkeys lately?

                              CESAR
               How many times do I have to say
               it?  I didn't put the hit on
               Little Eddie... Never had anything
               against that kooky chimp.  I
               actually found him, "endearing."

                             HAWK
               Sure.  Face down.  Two endearing
               shots to the back of the head.
               That's your mark, man.  What did
               Little Eddie ever do to...

     Smouldering, Hawk struts off.  Cesar takes a black
     canvas bag from a SCARFACED DRIVER and hustles up to
     Hawk.  The Lincoln rumbles behind them, Antony riding
     on the hood.

                             CESAR
               You're hitting Rutherford's
               Auction House.  Easy as my
               brother's wife.  Directions are
               in the bag.  Just open the seventh
               floor safe and take out the
               thingie...

                             HAWK
               Or you cut off my thingie.
               Directions even your brother
               would understand.
         
                             ANTONY
                       (defensively)
               Yeah, directions even I could
               understand.

     The car squeals to a stop.  Antony bounds off.  Cesar
     shove-throws the canvas bag into Hawk's unwilling
     hands.

                             CESAR
               Hawk, you're a great thief.  Got
               set up, did some time, nothing to
               be ashamed of.  Don't give me a
               sonata about you always just
               really wanted to settle down,
               open a hardware Store and sell
               spatulas...

                             HAWK
               If the Mario brothers weren't
               Jersey's third largest family,
               I'd say kiss my ass.  But
               considering your status, I'll
               say slurp my butt.

     Hawk fiercely push-shoves the canvas bag back into
     Cesar's hands.

                             CESAR
               What's your favorite sport, Hawk?

                             HAWK
               Baseball, why?

     Antony opens the back door of the Lincoln and says
     "Baseball."  He is handed a baseball bat.  Hawk backs
     up as Antony moves threateningly toward him.

                             HAWK
               I meant, ping pong.  Listen, I'd
               rather go back in than whore for
               you...
                       (stopping)
               Oh, I need to borrow ten dollars.

     A PRISON GUARD from above turns as not to be a witness.
     Hawk feebly calls up to him.

                             HAWK
               Help?  Police?

     Antony swings at Hawk, who pretends not to notice until
     the last second.  Hawk ducks and slam-kicks his calf.
     Antony crumples, using the bat as a crutch.  Hawk boots
     up the bat for a two-handed catch then savagely pivots
     it across Antony's face, knocking him into the backseat
     of the car.

                             CESAR
                       (unfazed)
               You need some time to think.
               That's cool, but next time, I'm
               not going to say "Please."

     Cesar floats into the backseat.  The Lincoln takes off.
     Hawk seethes...

                             HAWK
               I don't believe this.  I've been
               out forty seconds...

     A BACKFIRE rings out.  Hawk hits the ground, thinking
     it is a gunshot.

     HAWK'S ON THE GROUND P.O.V.

     A gasping 1960 Caddy comes to a stop and a pair of a too-
     fancy-to-be-tasteful shoes comes out.  Hawk looks up to
     see ALEX MESSINA, his older, maybe-maybe-not-wiser best
     friend.

                             ALEX
               That's the first thing I did.
               Smooch the ground and taste the
               freedom.  Sorry I was late.  Miss
               anything?

                             HAWK
                       (getting up)
               Your timing, and your shoes, are
               impeccable...  Good to see you,
               Alex, been having a lousy day.

                             ALEX
               Lousy day?  The man's getting out
               of prison and he's having a
               lousy day.  What, you missing out
               on the Cell Block Water Ballet
               pageant?  Believe me, it's
               overrated.

     Hawk pauses to say something, then just hugs Alex.

                             ALEX
               Where's the kiss?  No tongue this
               time, I promise.

     A laughing Hawk gives Alex's stomach a slap before
     getting in the car....

                             HAWK
               Looks like you've been expanding
               your...

                             ALEX
               Don't say it, Hawkins.  I'm
               incredibly sensitive about my
               fucking figure.

                             HAWK
               My next word was gonna be
               "consciousness."  Swear to God...
               tubby.

     EXT. THE ROAD INTO HOBOKEN--DAY

     The Caddy thunders past a sweet Manhattan view. "Come
     Fly With Me" is playing on the radio.  Hawk casually com-
     pletes an intimidating hand puzzle.

                             HAWK
               That's your definition of "Hard?"

                             ALEX
               Show off.  Hey, boss tune.  "Come
               Fly with Me."

                             HAWK
               Three minutes, 51 seconds.

                             ALEX
               Still do the puzzles, still know
               the running times of songs, and
               I'll bet you're still the best
               damn cat burg--

                              HAWK
               Not anymore.  Now I'm the laziest
               damn cat burg--I'm going to take
               it so straight that I won't tape
               a Mets game without the expressed
               written consent of the National
               Baseball League.

                             ALEX
               Now that you're born again,what
               do you wanna do?  Statue of
               Liberty?  Entertain some ladies?
               Miss Saigon tix?  Seduce some
               women?  Play Nintendo?  Bone some
               chicks?

                             HAWK
               Come on, Alex, let's just get to
               Alex's.  Your bar's the only
               place that's going to cheer me.
               God, I'd kill for a damn
               cappuccino.  What the hell's a
               Nintendo?

                             ALEX
               Oh man, you still got a thing for
               those unmasculine European coffees?
               Who's your buddy?

     Alex pulls a styrofoam cup from a paper bag.

                             HAWK
               The man knows, the man knows!

     Hawk takes off the cap with a stimulating whiff.

                             ALEX
               So Mr. Coffee, what went down
               outside the prison?

                             HAWK
               Oh, not much.  Mario Brothers want
               me to do a job.

     Alex brakes and cappuccino flies.  Hawk half-heartedly
     tries to lick up with his fingers.

                             ALEX
               Those dago-guinea-I can say
               this shit I'm Italian-wop
               motherfu--

                             HAWK
               Ah, had the perfect amount of
               foam.  Just get me to the bar...
               It's the one good thing in my
               life that'll never change....

     EXT. OUTSIDE ALEX'S BAR--NIGHT

     The Guys move through the personably Jersey face of the
     bar.  The Empire State Building beams in the background.
     Sinatra cuts off.

     INT. ALEX'S BAR--NIGHT

     It's changed.  Hawk and Alex enter into what has become
     the ultimate pseudo-art deco-fern littered-nightmare,
     packed with noisy, INSUFFERABLY SELF-ABSORBED YUPS.
     A violently erotic and pretentious video plays upon
     elevated T.V. sets set up all around the place.

     Hawk's mouth gapes as he drifts by a sickening COUPLE
     toasting wine coolers, and two very YOUNG BROKERS high-
     fiving each other after missing a dartboard.

                             ALEX
               I didn't know how to tell you.  A
               couple brokers stopped in for
               Stoley Spritzers one night.  Next
               thing I know Fast Track Digest
               votes us "Watering Hole of the
               Month."  Now, I'm shopping for
               Aqua Salmon wallpaper.

                             HAWK
               I read about these people in
               Newsweek.  Where's all the
               regulars, Crazy Jeff Cava, the
               Todd sisters, Indian Joe?  Where's
               Ed Kranepool's autograph?  Captain
               Bob's steering wheel?

                             ALEX
               Hey, get this irritable guy a
               cappuccino.  I gotta go be a boss.

     Alex lifts a piece of the bar and moves behind it.
     Snatching up a menu, Hawk calls out...

                             HAWK
               This is Pizza?  Reindeer Goat
               cheese?  I admit, I've been known
               to go wild and order a Canadian
               Bacon in my time, but..

     Hawk lights up a cigarette.  A TORTOISE SHELL NON-SMOKER
     immediately turns to him wearing a "Yes, I mind if you
     smoke" button.

                             TORTOISE SHELL NON-SMOKER
               Can you read.... smoker?

                             HAWK
               Can you take a sunrise and
               sprinkle it with dew?

                              TORTOISE SHELL NON-SMOKER
                       (Huh?)
               No.

                              HAWK
               The Candy Man can, Felix.  You
               know, I thought this was a country
               where you could do any stupid
               thing you wanted; drive to work
               naked, make love to a V.C.R.
               Guess I'm wrong.  Maybe that's
               why I became a serial arsonist.

                             TORTOISE SHELL NON-SMOKER
               Hey, it's okay, big guy.  Smoke
               all you want.  Have mine....

     The Non-smoker fumbles out a pack of cigarettes and
     flees.  A cappuccino in cup and saucer slides down the
     bar saloon-style.  A smiling Hawk picks it up, turns away
     from the bar and closes his eyes, bringing the cup to his
     lips until a POLICE BADGE swirls into frame and splashes
     into the cup, splattering coffee over Hawk's blazer.

                             GATES (O.S.)
               You're under arrest...

     Hawk makes eye contact up to a crude, coarse, and
     cackling island of a man, OFFICER GATES, amid the sea
     of oblivious and self-obsessed yuppitude, standing by
     a table.

                             GATES
               Have a seat.  Good to see you,
               buddy ol' pal...

                             HAWK
               The pleasure's all yours, Officer
               Gates.

     BACK OF THE BAR

     With concern, Alex watches Hawk sit at Gates' table.

     GATES' TABLE

     Gates pillages a plate of spaghetti and meatballs with
     terrifying precision.  Hawk tosses the badge onto the
     food.  Gates eats around it.

                             GATES
               Why do you show your parole
               officer such disrespect?
               Especially after I got you such
               a nice job.

                             HAWK
               What job?

     Gates pulls up the black canvas bag and puts it on the
     table.

                             GATES
               The auction house, asshole.  One
               night's work and you're free like
               no ex-con's ever been.  No
               checking in with a shrink, no
               community service teaching
               retards how to play air hockey.
               It's a great deal, I can't lie.

                             HAWK
               The only thing you can't do is
               get sex for free.  I know I was
               in prison for like basically the
               80's, but, call me daffy, aren't
               you supposed to stop me from
               committing crimes.  You know,
               Book-em-Dano, Call-for-backup,
               Give-a-Hoot-Don't-Pollute.

     Gates thunders out of his chair and moves around to sneer
     down at Hawk.  Behind Gates, on the T.V. screens, are
     analogous images of DISGUSTING ANIMALS AND MONSTERS.

                             GATES
               You wouldn't be out if it wasn't
               for me!  I did dog and pony for
               you!  You think they would have
               let you out after what you did,
               you told the board members they
               looked like the Three Stooges...

                             HAWK
               How was I supposed to know they
               were women?  Besides one of them
               was bald and kept saying
               "Soitinly."

     Gates simmers into his seat with a self-control smile.

                             GATES
               Remember that guy in the cell
               next to you who hung himself?

                             HAWK
               Yes.

                             GATES
               Remember that shoe you lost...

                             HAWK
               Uh, yeah.  Cut to the chase.

     Gates pulls up a shoe and puts it on the table.

                             GATES
               One phone call and your shoe
               will become a piece of evidence
               and that suicide'll become a
               murder.

     Hawk bobs under the table and up.

                             HAWK
               What else do you got under there
               ... I don't want to be rude, but
               this is all pretty lame.

                             GATES
               That's the beauty.  It's bullshit,
               but I can make it stick because
               I'm a good guy parole officer and
               you re a bad guy who's about to
               find out that there's a thin line
               between ex-con and escape con.

     Alex suddenly approaches the table.

                             ALEX
               How is everything tonight, sir?

                             GATES
               Beat it, Alex.  You're a dinosaur.

                             HAWK
               Alex, did you know this ape was
               going to be here...

                             ALEX
               Sure.  That's why his meatballs
               are made out of marinated Chuck
               Wagon.

                             GATES
                       (mouthful)
               You're full of shit.

     As Alex speaks, an eating dog is on the screens.

                             ALEX
               No, man, actually you are.  Just
               add water and it makes its own
               gravy.  Keeps your teeth healthy
               and your coat shiny.

     Gates grabs the shoes and races off, gagging.  Hawk gets
     up to laugh next to Alex.  Their laughter dies as they
     turn to look at the black canvas bag left on the table
     between them.

     INT. BACK ROOM--DAWN

     Hawk stares mournfully at a black and white photo of a
     monkey-sized chalk-outline on a city street.  Behind him,
     Alex pulls out blueprints from the black bag.  Sinatra's
     "Witchcraft" blares on the radio....

                             ALEX
               Hmmmm.....

                             HAWK
               Yo Pandora, quit hummm-ing... look
               at this.

     Hawk is rummaging through stockpiled remnants of an old,
     "true" bar.  Round lamps, tacky mirrors, pictures of Hawk
     and the Regs at the bar.  Managing a weary smile, Hawk
     lifts a ship steering wheel, while Alex puts on a pair of
     granny classes and pulls out blueprints.

                             HAWK
               It's Captain Bob's steering wheel!
               Remember when the Captain.....

                             ALEX
               Hmmm, nasty little safe on the 7th.

     Hawk nervously picks up a Rubik's Cube and holds it
     behind his back.  He brings it back around, completed.
     Sighing, Hawk drops the cube and rubs his scalp.  Alex
     starts rubbing his stomach.  They pace in pre-job
     syncopation and speak rapid-fire.

                             HAWK
               The safe's a Simpson 71.  Last
               time I played the game, Simpson
               only had a 40.

                             ALEX
               Just means it'll take you an extra
               31 seconds to seduce.  You re
               still the best, I know it.

                             HAWK
               But you got three guards who...
               Shit, what am I doing?  Where's
               the want ads?  Gonna sell some
               spatulas.

                             ALEX
               Hey, I'm sorry, man.  I'm putting
               out a fire with kerosene.

     Alex gives Hawk a consoling two-hand-shake then jumps
     back to reveal he has put Hawk into thumbcuffs.

                             HAWK
               This isn't funny.  I'm not into
               this.  I...

                             ALEX
               There goes five seconds...My
               record's eighteen.

                             HAWK
               You're not...LISTENING!

     Out of annoyance, Hawk breaks out of the cuffs and
     violently throws them at Alex, who sits down a little
     wounded.

                             HAWK
               I'm sorr--Goddamn Mario Brothers.
               Goddamn Gates.  Goddamn Rutherford
               Auction House.  By the way, how
               many seconds?

                             ALEX
               Rutherford Auction... that name...

     Alex jumps up excitedly and then convulses in pain.

                             HAWK
               Alex!

                             ALEX
               Don't wet your diapers.  I'll have
               to change them.  "Witchcraft."
               What's the running time?

     Alex flops down behind a work table before a wallfull of
     drawings of different kinds of vaults.  He sets himself
     up for an insulin injection.

                             HAWK
               3:48.  I can't get you involved,
               man.  This is my sewage and...
                       (re drawings)
               God, you love all this, don't you,
               you bastard.  Haven't you ever
               heard of stamp collecting, or
               curling?

     Hawk leans in and administers the shot of insulin to
     Alex.

                             ALEX
               I'm in.  Have you seen the public
               service announcements for Diabetes.
               We can ride horses, play LaCrosse,
               and knock off auction houses.  I
               got a plan.  You won't have to hail
               Cesar or Gates.

     Hawk collapses next to Alex, resigned to his fate.

                             HAWK
               I'm a bum.

     EXT. NICE, BUSINESS NEIGHBORHOOD--NIGHT

     TWO GRUBBY DERELICTS, one pushing a shopping cart, the
     other inside it, situated atop the usual two Glad bags.
     They are drunkenly warbling "Witchcraft."  IMPECCABLY
     DRESSED NIGHT-LIFERS give them a wide berth.

     Our derelicts pass beneath a MASSIVE RED CANOPY of a
     distinguished eight story edifice, upon which is written
     RUTHERFORD'S AUCTION HOUSE.  A DOORMAN shoos them away...

     A NEWSPAPER TRUCK pulls up in front of the Auction House.
     The Driver pops out with a bundle of papers and moves to
     a Dispenser on the corner.  The Bums wheel around the
     truck.  The Driver loads the papers and bounds back.

     The Truck pulls away from the corner.  The shopping cart
     rolls off--the bums nowhere to be seen.

     The Truck turns the corner, revealing the derelicts
     climbing up the back of it, with Glad bags around their
     necks.  The Truck moves toward an enclosed Walkway Bridge
     that connects the Auction House with another Building.

     Launching low-tech grapples, the Vagrants latch them-
     selves onto the Walkway window as the Truck passes
     beneath.

     AT THE WINDOW

     The viewer's viewpoint moves into a tighter view of the
     dangling derelicts, revealing them to, of course, be Hawk
     and Alex.  Getting a footing, on the small window ledge,
     each man cuts a hole in the window while holding onto a
     plunger.

                             HAWK
               Whoa, you better cut a bigger hole
               than that.

                             ALEX
               Hey, you promised......Don't worry,
               I'm wearing my girdle.

     INT. INSIDE THE WALKWAY WINDOW--NIGHT

     Hawk and Alex come through their window holes.  Hawk
     immediately flattens himself against a wall, whisper-
     ing...

                             HAWK
               Cameras?

                             ALEX
               No need.  Guards' station's right
               there.

     Alex points to an open doorway just down the hall where
     laughter and shadows emerge.  Hawk tries to flee, but a
     grinning Alex pulls him toward it.

     Hawk and Alex slide across the wall to a closed room
     marked POWER, which is right next to the open Guards'
     Station.  The viewer's viewpoint moves past Hawk and
     Alex lock-picking into the Power room to...

     INT. THE GUARDS' STATION

     Two Security Guards sit before a console of seven
     security screens still chuckling over an unheard joke.
     Wires coming out of the security console run across the
     floor and through the wall into...

     INT. THE POWER ROOM

     The wires go up to a row of seven humming, RECORD button
     flashing V.C.R.s.  Hawk and Alex stand before them,
     sharing a cig.

                             ALEX
               They record everything their
               video surveillance takes in...

                             HAWK
               Yes, master-thief, I can see that.
               You said something about a plan...

     Alex presses the REWIND buttons on the V.C.R.'s.

                             ALEX
               Am I boring you, smartass?  Watch.
               A little rewind and re-wire action
               and the Guards are going to be
               watching a rerun and miss out on
               our exciting episode.

     Alex pulls from a nearby shelf six tapes marked MONDAY.

     INT. SEVENTH FLOOR AUCTION AUDITORIUM--NIGHT

     Moving beneath a video camera and a dazzling Set of
     Hanging Horse Mobiles, a Heavyset guard, BIG STAN, moseys
     through the dimly lit main auction house auditorium.  The
     auditorium chairs are strewn out in the middle beside a
     turbo Floor Washer.

     Next to a painting of Happy Children Riding Horses at the
     back of the auditorium stage, Big Stan hefts himself upon
     a comparatively TINY BLUE CHAIR and begins to tip back
     and snooze.

     INT. GUARDS' STATION

     The Security Guards look to the seventh floor screen to
     see an unfolding shot of Big Stan mid-snooze.

                             SECURITY GUARD ONE
               Check out Big Stan...
                       (walkie-talkie)
               Big Stan!

     THE AUCTION AUDITORIUM

     Startled by his walkie-talkie, Big Stan falls back on the
     little chair, crunching it to the ground.

     THE FIRST FLOOR

     The laughing security guards see the crunch.

     INT. THE POWER ROOM

     Alex puts the last of the Monday tapes into a V.C.R.

                             ALEX
               You got about five minutes and
               change.

                             HAWK
               5:32.  "Swinging on a Star."

                             ALEX
               You know they invented something
               while you were inside.  Called a
               watch.

     A freight elevator pings.  Hawk opens it up as the music
     of "Swinging on the Star" kicks in on the soundtrack.

                             HAWK
               "A mule is an animal with long
               funny ears."

                             ALEX
               "He kicks up at anything he
               hears.

     Hawk crams himself into the freight elevator with his
     Glad bag.  Strenuously upbeat Ray Conniffesque singers
     continue to sing the song, orchestrally accompanied, when
     Hawk isn't.

     INT. THE FREIGHT ELEVATOR

     Hawk takes over the song, sardined in the elevator.

                             HAWK
               "Or would you rather swing on a
               star, carry moonbeams home in a
               jar."

     POWER ROOM

     Alex goes up to a Circuit Box and pulls down two large
     Switches.  The soundtrack singers continue to warble.

     THE GUARDS' STATION

     The lights of the floor wobble and die.  The console
     screens blink off.  The Security Guards stop laughing.

                             SECURITY GUARD TWO
               Hell-o.  Check the Power room,
               bud...

     Security Guard One harrumphs into a standing position...

     POWER ROOM

     Alex speedily hooks and rehooks the backs of the V.C.R.S.
     They now all have their PLAY buttons lit up.

                             ALEX
               swing on a star, carry moonbeams...

     OUTSIDE THE POWER ROOM

     Security Guard One fishes for keys to open the power
     room.  The soundtrack singers whisper as not to give away
     Alex.

     INSIDE THE POWER ROOM

     Alex briskly slams back up the switches.

     OUTSIDE THE POWER ROOM

     The singers go louder as the lights come back on.
     Security Guard One harrumphs and heads back to the
     Guards' Station.

     THE AUCTION AUDITORIUM

     Hawk scrambles out of the freight elevator in the left
     wall of the Auditorium, glancing to the clock.

                             HAWK
               "Or would you rather be a fish?"

     He pulls out the black canvas bag from his Glad bag and
     takes out the blueprints.  Hawk follows them toward the
     painting on-stage.

     THE GUARDS' STATION

     Big Stan comes up from behind his fellow guards, dumping
     the remains of the chair on the floor.

                             BIG STAN
                       (moving back off)
               Very funny.

     The Seventh Floor Screen shows a peaceful auction
     auditorium.  And the Blue Chair.

     THE AUCTION AUDITORIUM--CAMERA P.O.V.

     From the exact angle, the viewer sees the current state
     of the room with Hawk flinging off the painting of the
     horseback children, revealing a safe.  But no Blue chair.

     HAWK

     spits on the rubber cup of an electronic sensor, plugged
     into a Walkman, and affixes it to the safe above the
     dial.

                             HAWK
                       (lyric trouble)
               "A fish is annuh nan na nan na
               brook.

     THE FREIGHT ELEVATOR

     Alex is now packed into the freight elevator.

                             ALEX
               "He can't write his name or read
               a book.  To fool people is his
               only thought."

     THE AUCTION AUDITORIUM

                             HAWK
                       (remembering)
               "And though he's slippery, he
               still gets caught."

     Wearing headphones, Hawk cranks up the Walkman and spins
     the dial.  The CLICKS from the dial are so loud he winces
     and turns down the volume.  Then there's a CLUNK.

     THE GUARDS' STATION

     With the soundtrack singers taking over, Guard Two sips
     a cup of coffee.  He doesn't swallow.

     His sights zero in on the Blue Chair on the seventh
     screen.  He looks to the chair remains, then back again.

                             SECURITY GUARD TWO
               Uh, Jerry.  I'm looking at the
               seventh floor and I don't know
               how to say this, I see the Blue
               Chair.

                             SECURITY GUARD ONE
               What the... You think that's weird,
               check out screen two.....

     Screen Two shows THE TWO SECURITY GUARDS THEMSELVES
     hatching open some on-duty beers, going down a hall.
     Guard Two looks to the empties atop the console....

                             SECURITY GUARD TWO
               Somebody rewired the recorders!

     AUCTION AUDITORIUM

     Hawk ditches his accessories and swings the safe door
     open.

     Inside the safe, along with the "holy" Da Vinci music
     cue, is the clay equestrian model from Leonardo's
     worktable.

     Hawk belts out as he put it in the black canvas bag.

                             HAWK
               "And all the monkeys aren't in
               the zoo."

                             ALEX (V.O.)
               "Every day you meet quite a few."

     Alex gives Hawk a congratulatory pat.

                             HAWK AND ALEX
               "So you see it's all up to you.
               You can be better than you are.
               You could be swinging on a star."

     THE AUCTION ROOM

     BIG STAN reconnects the wires of the seventh V.C.R.

     THE GUARDS' STATION

     Suddenly, on the seventh screen, the image and voices
     of Hawk and Alex in-process comes on.

                             SECURITY GUARD ONE
               Shit, let's roll!

     THE AUCTION AUDITORIUM

     Hawk puts the painting back up, but stops to stare at the
     playful children.

                             ALEX
               The song's over!  Come on!
               "You could be swinging on a star."

                             HAWK
               What am I doing here?  There are
               so many things I wanna do that
               aren't this.  Paint a lighthouse.
               Kiss a woman in Italy.

                             ALEX
                       (more frantically)
               "You could be swinging on a star."

                             HAWK
               Paint a woman in a lighthou--I
               don't want to steal a horse.
               Life is...

     Hawk's soliloquy is cut short as Security Guards One and
     Two crash into the auction auditorium.

                             ALEX
                       (DEADPAN)
               "You could be swinging on a star."
               You couldn't have waited to see
               a psychiatrist.  No, you had...

     Alex whips his chair at the floor washer, tipping it
     forward and causing its electrical cord to pull up and
     trip the Guards into a bellyflop.

     Hawk bolts right at the bustling up guards and locks them
     into Alex's thumbcuffs.  He then limbos under their
     connected arms and springs over the outstretched washer
     cord.  The Security Guards clumsily turn and re-trip
     themselves.

                             HAWK
               Let's go down the freight elevator.

     Big Stan suddenly unhatches from the freight elevator.

                             ALEX
               Keep those ideas coming.

     Hawk and Alex run toward an office located at the right
     wall.  They both do a Gene-Kellyesque-chair-tip-over
     before simultaneously bashing through the office door.

     INT. DARKENED AUCTION AUDITORIUM OFFICE

     Hawk and Alex stop in the office to painfully laugh and
     rub their funny bones.  Alex stops laughing.

                             ALEX
               I'm not as unpleasantly plump as
               that Guard am I.

     Big Stan fires off a warning shot.  Hawk and Alex quickly
     tear up a window.

     Moving out on to a ledge, Hawk and Alex look down to the
     huge auction house awning and trade gulps.

     Big Stan wobbles into the mouth of the office door.

                             HAWK AND ALEX
               I got a bad feeling....

                             HAWK
               I can't even swim.

                             ALEX
               Hell, the fall'll probably kill
               ya...

     Big Stan raises his gun.

     Hawk and Alex jump and AAAGH down the face of the
     building....

     Closer and closer to the awning....

     The viewer focuses upon Hawk as he free-falls......

                                                CUT TO:

     RIGHT INTO A LAZ-Y-BOY CHAIR

     Hawk continues his "fall" into a ridiculously huge
     reclining chair.  The foot stand swooshes out with a
     thump.  A HAND pulls away the canvas bag with a cackle.

     INT. GATES APARTMENT--LATE NIGHT

     Hawk's weirdly reclining viewpoint makes Gates and his
     pad more grotesque than they are (No small feat.)
     A sub-Radio Shack stereo coughs next to a scary punch
     bowl of red, margarita-like substance, beneath the
     instantly recognizable framed picture of Those Dogs
     Playing Poker, all atop a Jungle Shag.

     Gates, in shorts and a Hawaiian shirt-over-a-KEEP ON
     TRUCKIN'-T-shirt, raises a loud tumbler with one hand,
     the black canvas bag in the other.

                             GATES
               Hudson Hawkins gets the chair of
               honor.  How about a Gates-arita?
                       (toward bowl)
               I used real hot dogs.

                             HAWK
               Weren't you the bartender at
               Jonestown?

     Suddenly a light is turned on in the corner, revealing a
     seated Cesar and Antony Mario, the latter taking a painful
     Gatesirita sip.

                             CESAR
               Good job, not pretty, but good.

                             HAWK
               Ah, the mafia, the cops; do I know
               how to party or what?

     Gates pulls out the horse and looks at it.

                             GATES
               All this trouble for a horsey.
               I may not know art, but I know
               what I like.

                             HAWK
                       (to Dog picture)
               You certainly do.

                             GATES
               So when's that Sebastian-Cabot-
               Buckingham-Palace-looking-
               Butlerhead getting here?

                             ALFRED
               Any minute now, dear Mr. Gates.

     A malevolently snobbish British Butler, ALFRED, enters in
     distaste.  He makes a stressful glance to three VANITY
     FAIRS on a coffeetable that has a photo of a MAGNETIC
     HUSBAND-WIFE-DOG COMBO with the caption: MAYFLOWER POWER.
     Hawk notices this.

                             GATES
               Oh, sorry Jeeves.  Gates-arita?

                             ALFRED
               I'll pass.  May I?

     Alfred takes the equestrian model and with a jeweler's
     loupe, studies it carefully.

                             ALFRED
               Ah, such craftsmanship.  Leonardo
               Da Vinci's last commission for the
               Duke of Milan.  Irreplaceable.

                             GATES
               Hey, Mr. French, I'm delirious
               for you.  Now where's my cut?

     With dignity, Alfred SMASHES the ancient horse over
     Gates's head.  Alfred rummages through the debris
     REVEALING a perversely labyrinthine CRYSTAL PIECE.
     (recognizable from Da Vinci's workshop).

                             GATES
               You son-of-a......I don't believe
               this!  You come into my house!

     Alfred pockets the goodies, but not before Hawk can give
     them a confused peruse.

                             GATES
               I ought to take Big Ben and shove
               it up your limey blimey bunghole!

     A blade slides down Alfred's arm.  Half-yawning, he...

     ALFRED'S 180 DEGREE POV

     spins before Gates and the bystanders behind him.
     THE BLADE goes back up Alfred's arm.

     The room's only sound is the stereo's inappropriate
     music.  Gates shrugs but his voice is off.

                             GATES
               Like I said.  Where's my cu-u-...

     Suddenly a line across Gates's neck turns red and blood
     begins to gush like a tourist attraction.  Gates crashes
     down upon the table holding the punch bowl and the stereo,
     sending it to the ground, cutting off the music.  The Dog
     Poker picture falls atop the carnage like a lid.

     Blown away, Hawk tries to wiggle his way out of the
     recliner.  Alfred pats some stain remover on the blood
     on his shirt.

                             ALFRED
               So much for his "cut."
                       (post-chortle)
               Excuse my dry British humor.

                             CESAR
                       (rising)
               Lovely work, Alfred, taking the
               Concorde back?

                             ALFRED
               Indeed I am, Mr. Mario.  I'm
               really racking up those frequent
               flyer points...

                             HAWK
               I hate to interrrupt you two
               lovebirds...

                             ANTONY
               You know, I think Gates promised
               Hawk a cut, too....

     The Mario brothers cackle out.  Hawk tries to flail out
     of his chair.  Alfred turns to him and flicks up his arm.
     Hawk sees his life pass before his eyes until he realizes
     Alfred is merely pulling him up off the chair.

                             ALFRED
               Ta ta, Hudson Hawk.

                             HAWK
                       (breathless)
               Too-do-loo, babe.

     INT. ALEX'S RESTAURANT--DAWN

     Hawk bursts into the bar.  Alex sits on a stool, reading
     the paper.

                             ALEX
               Did I miss anything?

                             HAWK
               Oh, not much.  Gates just had his
               tonsils taken out.  The hard way.
         
                             ALEX
               Geez, Gates was killed.  Who do we
               send the thank you note to?
         
     Hawk does a combat jump over the bar and begins to fiddle
     with the cappuccino machine.

                             HAWK
               The Butler did it.  Guy was a cross
               between Alistair Cook and a Cuisinart.
               Dude took Mr. Ed and humptied
               dumptied it over Gates's head.  He
               said it was made by, get this,
               Leonardo..

                             ALEX
                       (professorial)
               Ah yes, a rare Renaissance piece.
               Da Vinci's "Sforza," an equestrian
               model of a never executed statue.
               I consider it to be the prize of
               tonight's auction of objets
               d'equestrian.  Horse things.

     The cappuccino machine sparks.  A perplexed Hawk takes
     a couple extra seconds to back off.

                             HAWK
               Okay, you got me, Mr. PBS.

                             ALEX
                       (holding up newspaper)
               Morning edition.  Seems two thieves
               "attempted" to steal it last night,
               but thanks to three "courageous"
               guards, it will be ready for tonight.

                             HAWK
               "Attempted."  At-tempt-ted!  I'm
               not happy about having to steal
               that horse, but I do have my
               pride.  Face it, when it comes to
               burglary, and sex, I....

     Hawk takes the newspaper.  There is a picture of the
     Three Security Guards in a cheery pose behind the
     "Sforza."  Hawk squints to see that Security Guards One
     and Two are still wearing the thumbcuffs.

                             HAWK
               Boing.  Uh, this I don t understand...

                             ALEX
               Why try?

                             HAWK
                       (hurdling the bar)
               Because I'm tired of not
               understanding things.  Cops,
               Mafia, and butlers forcing me to
               bust my ass to steal something,
               which it turns out I really didn't
               steal--it's fucked up.

                             ALEX
                       (pulling back newspaper)
               You re not thinking of going to...

                             HAWK
               Alex, my man, it's time to play a
               little offense.  Where's your tux?

     INT. RUTHERFORD'S AUCTION HOUSE--NIGHT

     Dressed in a not-quite-fitting but suave tuxedo, Hawk
     enters the now well-lit auction house auditorium (chairs
     all set out).  Bored WORKMEN in coveralls lug equestrian
     items on to a podium from the familiar freight elevator.

                             ECCENTRIC BALD AUCTIONEER
               ...fan-taas-tic example of
               Florentine marble... Who will start
               at 160,000...160,000......180,000.

     Someone raises their paddle as Hawk passes beneath the
     hanging horses and finds an aisle seat near the stage.
     Hawk scans everyone in the room before coming to the one
     seated next to him, AN ENCHANTINGLY BEAUTIFUL WOMAN.

                             HAWK
               All these years of attending auctions,
               I still get goosebumps.  The paintings,
               the sculptures....the things that
               aren't really paintings or sculptures...

                             THE WOMAN
               .... the pretentious vultures who
               don't even look up from their
               calculators to see what they're
               buying.  Now that gives me
               goosebumps.  Auctions are
               disgusting.

                             HAWK
               I couldn't agree more.  Savages.

     The Woman laughs at his gear switch then catches herself.

                             ECCENTRIC BALD AUCTIONEER
               Lot Fifteen, an equestrian sconce
               attributed to the Cellini school..

     AUCTION ENTRANCE

     Big Stan, the hefty guard from the heist, enters the area
     wearing a blue ribbon.

     AUCTION AREA

     Big Stan is walking in back of the seated bidders:  An
     oblivious Hawk in the foreground starts to scan VARIED
     BIDDER-TYPES, raising their paddles to babble out dollar
     figures; a GAUDY ROCK STAR and his GLOOMY-CHIC ENTOURAGE,
     A KING FAROUK-TYPE with a BORED TEENAGE AMERICAN HOOKER,
     and a scary NORDIC PRINCESS in a monocle and a tiara.

     THREE STANDING ASSISTANTS frantically man a table of
     phones set up down before the stage.  One raises his
     arm.

                             ECCENTRIC BALD AUCTIONEER
               Sold!  To the caller from
               Newfoundland.

     A STYLISH FEMALE ASSISTANT takes out an impressive replica
     of the "Sforza" from the safe behind the podium and brings
     it to the Auctioneer.  The crowd a-a-hs... Hawk laughs
     and shakes his head.

                             ECCENTRIC BALD AUTIONEER
               And finally, Lot number 17,
               thought to be lost in the war,
               and again last night, the Da
               Vinci "Sforza," the jewel of the
               sale.  Fan-taas-tic...

                             HAWK
                       (re: Auctioneer)
               Is looking like a constipated
               warthog a prerequisite to getting
               a job in the art world?

                             ECCENTRIC BALD AUCTIONEER
               There have naturally been questions
               of its authenticity, so to verify
               we have Doctor Anna Baragli of the
               Vatican.  Doc?

                             ANNA
                       (rising, to Hawk)
               Some of us warthogs are more
               constipated than others.

     Hawk uneasily laughs as Anna makes her way up the stage
     and pulls out a large magnifying glass.  A look of
     distress passes over her face.  Hawk closes his eyes in
     anticipation.

                             HAWK
               Oh, the shit is going to hit the
               fa--

                             ANNA
                       (suddenly serene)
               Fantastic.  Perfection.  The
               Vatican extends its jealousy to
               the lucky bidder.

                             ECCENTRIC BALD AUCTIONEER
               We'll begin the bidding at 82.5
               million dollars.  To you, sir.
               Eighty-three, Ninety--your bid,
               madame--Ninety point five.....

     Hawk opens his eyes in confusion.  He scans Anna coming
     off the stage, gliding toward the phone table.  Hawk
     floats into the aisle, curling toward her as she picks
     up a phone and murmurs into it.

                             DARWIN MAYFLOWER
               lOO million clams, Francesco!

     The crowd orgasms as Vanity Fair cover boy, DARWIN
     MAYFLOWER works the aisle, playfully mussing up the
     appreciative, tiaraed Princess's hair, giddily high-
     fiving the Rock Star, and sloppily frenching the Hooker.

                             ECCENTRIC BALD AUCTIONEER
               100 million dollars to Mr. Darwin
               Mayflower.

     Hawk turns to gaze at the enigmatically familiar figure.
     Anna looks up from the phone to do the same.  She
     swerves her attention to the back-turned Hawk.

     Darwin moves to one of two reserved empty seats as his
     wife, Minerva, makes her entrance par excellahnce.  She is
     outrageously dressed with a mammoth Tiffany watch that
     extends from her wrist down to, acting as a leash,
     her obnoxious little dog, BUNNY.

                             MINERVA
               Francesco, 100 million and one.

     Darwin, to the crowd's delight, holds his struck heart.

                             DARWIN
               Outbid by my own wench, quelle
               bummere.

                             MINERVA
               Poor baby..... Here, Bunny.

                             ECCENTRIC BALD AUCTIONEER
               Fan-taas-tic, the bid is at 100
               million and one dollars.

     Commencing a slow motion sequence, Big Stan comes out
     of the nearby office, zipping up his fly.  He immedi-
     ately scopes Hawk in the space before the stage.

     The Mayflowers lower themselves into their seats with
     devoured canary smiles.

                             ECCENTRIC BALD AUCTIONEER
               Go-ing!

     Big Stan pulls out his gun, untheatrically, as not to
     cause a scene.  Anna sees this and follows Big Stan's
     eyeline to Hawk.

     Hawk turns to re-pursue but stops dead at the sight of
     the gloating Big Stan.

                             ECCENTRIC BALD AUCTIONEER
               Go-ing!

     Big Stan launches a gallop toward Hawk, who spins and
     veers back round up the aisle.

     The Mayflowers zero their sights on the activity.

                             ECCENTRIC BALD AUCTIONEER
               Gone!

     The gavel comes down in super slow-motion.

     Anna's leg pokes out of the aisle, tripping the guard.

     Hawk brakes at the end of the Mayflower's row and smiles
     in relief, casually turning to Darwin and Minerva.

     The gavel continues to come down in super slow-motion.

     Both Darwin and Minerva Mayflower suddenly DUCK DOWN.

     Smile vanishing, Hawk spins toward the stage.

     The Gavel hits.

     Breaking out of slow-motion into wide-angle, the entire
     podium explodes sending debris, equestrian pieces, and
     eccentric bald pieces searing into the screaming,
     battered crowd.

     Knocked off his feet, Hawk gropes into a standing
     position.  He sees the Mayflowers make a smooth exit.
     He starts to give chase until he sees a battered Anna
     rising from the ground.

     A hanging white Tri-Star Pegasus, cracks from the
     damaged ceiling and swooshes down towards Anna.

     Hawk bolts upon some auction chairs and makes a flying
     leap.  He slams Anna out of the Pegasus's pulverizing
     Path.  They weary up off the ground and move down the
     aisle, calm in a storm of packed art patrons.

                             ANNA
               My God, that was bold of you,
               you didn't have to do that...

                             HAWK
               Forget about it--it was nothing--
               anybody would have done the same
               thing--It's an impulse...

                             ANNA
               No, I meant you didn't have to
               tackle me and rip my dress.  A
               polite push, perhaps?  A clear
               shout of "watch out, Anna"
               would have done nicely...

                             HAWK
               Excuse me, Milady.  I would have
               flown over and carried you up to
               a pink cloud, but I left my cape
               at the cleaners.

     Anna touches Hawk's lips and laughs.

                             ANNA
                       ("Hey, I was kidding")
               Thanks tough guy, thanks a lot.
               Why was the guard chasing you?

                             HAWK
                       (Serious answer?
                        Na-a-h?)
               Because Danger, Doc, is my middle...

     Before Hawk can finish, a hanging horse out of nowhere
     hammers him into the ground and the viewer into
     darkness.

     FADE IN:

     INT. VAN-TYPE AMBULANCE--NIGHT

     Hawk stirs into consciousness strapped on an elevated
     gurney.

                             HAWK
               Saint Pete, hey I know, the whole
               cat burglar thing, it sounds bad,
               but I'll take the worst cloud you
               got...

     Hawk's eyes focus.  The Mario Brothers hover over him.

                             CESAR
               News flash.  You're not in
               heaven.  Yet.  30 seconds and
               counting, if you know what I'm
               saying.  Couldn't just play along,
               could you...

     EXT. THE BROOKLYN BRIDGE--NIGHT

     The ambulance careens onto the Brooklyn Bridge.

     INT. INSIDE THE AMBULANCE

     Antony raises up a mammoth gun.

                             HAWK
               Pretty class way of covering your
               tracks.  I think that auctioneer
               landed at La Guardia.

                             ANTONY
               Subtlety was never one of our
               strong points.

                             HAWK
               Neither's flossing.

     A confused Antony touches his teeth with his gun hand.
     Hawk escapes from one of his straps and launces a nearby
     trayful of syringes into Antony's face where they ghoul-
     ishly quiver.  Antony fires a wild shot, shattering the
     partition.

     FRONT SEAT OF THE AMBULANCE

     The Scarfaced Bodyguard/Driver, now in paramedic white,
     freaks at the starred windshield.

     THE BROOKLYN BRIDGE

     The ambulance bumper-pools off some innocent cars.

     INSIDE THE AMBULANCE

     Hawk frantically tries to undo his other strap but a
     howling Cesar, side-stepping his vibrating-on-the-floor
     brother, latches onto the back of the gurney and wrenches
     it backward.

     OUTSIDE BACK OF AMBULANCE

     The elevated gurney blasts out the back with a now
     unstrapped but terrified Hawk whoa-a-ing atop it.

     The gurney wheels hit the road, sparking.

     A sheet from the gurney, caught on the door, yanks TAUGHT
     --Hawk is "water skiing" on his stomach atop the elevated
     gurney!

     Screeching cars are weirded out by the new vehicle on the
     road.

     THE GURNEY

     Battered by wind and fear, Hawk clutches to the gurney
     and the sheet with a grit teeth stoneface.

     The sheet is torn from the gurney sending it rocketing
     off to the side on its own crazed volition.

     Hawk skis toward a TOLL BOOTH WITH A LARGE GATE-ARM.

                             HAWK
               Life don't get much better than
               this.

     He then sees he's heading toward an EXACT CHANGE lane.

     Whizzing wildly forward on the gurney, Hawk scrambles
     into his pocket and wiggles out some change.  He fran-
     tically winnows out some pennies and then maniacally
     FLINGS the change from twenty feet away.

     TOLL BOOTH

     The change ker-chunks into the basket and Hawk and the
     gurney JUST BARELY streak underneath the rising Gate-arm.

     EXT. THE AMBULANCE

     CRASHES through a gate-arm of another lane.  Hawk and the
     still-wildly whooshing gurney cut it off.

     FRONT SEAT OF THE AMBULANCE

     Cesar pops his head through the partition.

                             CESAR
               Make him into Roadkill!

     Antony, seemingly oblivious to the syringes porcupined in
     his skull, pokes his head next to Cesar's.

                             ANTONY
               Yeah, run him down!

     Cesar and the Bodyguard/Driver turn to Antony and scream,
     then all three look out the windshield and scream.

     THE AMBULANCE

     jackknifes over a stopped car and somersaults into a
     fiery ball.

     In the foreground, Hawk's gurney coasts down

     A PEACEFUL OFF-ROAD

     Hawk, with an unchanged expression of pure white knuckle
     fear, comes to a tranquil gurney-wheels-gently-squeaking
     stop.

     Lit by the flames of the ambulance crash, a sneering
     young man in wire rim glasses emerges from the darkness,
     carrying a steel suitcase.  He kneels before Hawk and
     opens the suitcase revealing a complex computer appara-
     tus.  He begins mumbling into a cellular phone.

     A malevolent, SILENT DEADPAN WRAITH passes him and
     approaches Hawk.  Both men are dressed in outfits that
     seem to be a melange of fascist uniform and haute
     couture.

     On the fingers of one Wraith hand is carved the word
     HATE.  On the other hand is the word FROG.  The Frog Hand
     hands a befuddled Hawk a card.  It reads: MY NAME IS KIT
     KAT AND THIS IS NOT A DREAM.

     Hawk looks up with a "huh" expression as Kit Kat chops
     his neck, knocking him off the gurney.

     The sneering computer guy hangs up his phone and pulls
     forward a small cattle prod from his apparatus.

                             HAWK
               This is the worst night...

                             SNICKERS
               When it rains, it pours.  Name's
               Snickers.  The plane leaves in 40.

     Snickers zaps Hawk in the leg with his device.  Hawk a-
     a-ghs into a kneeling position.  Snickers returns to his
     suitcase and is passed by a PLEASANT YOUNG BLACK WOMAN in
     the "outfit."

                             ALMOND JOY
               Almond Joy.  I know, pretty silly.
               But it's better than when we first
               started out, our code names were
               Diseases.  You don't know what
               it's like being called Clymidia
               for a year.
                       (walking off)
               Whoops, forgot....

     She deftly kicks Hawk across the face.  Hawk angrily
     bounds back up until he sees the BIGGEST MEMBER OF THE
     GROUP Fe-Fi-Fo-Fum his way toward them.  Suddenly, the
     Giant clumsily trips over Snickers' suitcase apparatus
     and ram-collapses into Hawk and the gurney.  Laying atop
     Hawk, Butterfinger goofily speaks...

                             BUTTERFINGER
               My name's Butterfinger.

                             HAWK
               No shit.

     The mysterious group parts to reveal a much more mature
     and cynically subdued man dressed in big lapels and a hat
     that screams Old Time CIA.  His name will be GEORGE
     KAPLAN.

                             KAPLAN
               Don't you just hate kids...

                             ALMOND JOY
               George, you promised.  No Old CIA/
               New CIA jokes...

                             KAPLAN
               I call them the MTV.I.A.  Punks
               think Bay of Pigs is an herbal tea.
               They think the Cold War involves
               penguins and...

                             HAWK
               Don't I know you...

                             KAPLAN
               You just might.  I'm the guy who
               tricked you into robbing a
               government installation and then
               had you sent to prison for it.  At
               the time, I was bald with a beard,
               no moustache, and I had a different
               nose, so if you don't recognize me,
               I won't be offended.

                             HAWK
               Bastard, you're going to need
               another nose!

     Hawk explodes upward.  Everyone but cool Kaplan draws a
     gun.

                             HAWK
               But I'm not the type of guy to
               hold a grudge.

                             KAPLAN
               I used you as a diversion.  while
               you were getting captured upstairs,
               I was shredding documents in the
               basement.  Deep down, I guess I
               was just jealous.  You were one
               incredible thief...

                             HAWK
               To what do I owe the dishonor of a
               reunion, you centrally intelligent
               scumsicle.

     As Kaplan converses, Snickers and Butterfinger bring out
     a mammoth empty suitcase and open it behind Hawk.

                             KAPLAN
               I Want to make things up to you.
               That's why I got you this gig,
               doll.  Hawk, my name's George
               Kaplan and to quote the late,
               great Karen Carpenter, "We've only
               just begun."

                             HAWK
               Three minutes, twenty-three
               seconds.  If you think I'm doing
               another...

                             KAPLAN
               Hush.  My employer wants a meeting.

                             HAWK
               Employer?  The president?

                             KAPLAN
               No, somebody powerful.  Oh.  Look.
               what's that up there?

                             HAWK
               I'm supposed to fall for that?

                             KAPLAN
               Shucks.  Guess not.

     Kaplan savagely point-blank punches Hawk in the face,
     knocking him out cold and into the mammoth suitcase.
     Snickers slams it shut revealing a KENNEDY INTERNATIONAL
     sticker.

     INT. MYSTERIOUS BARE ROOM--DAY

     Hawk slowly awakens on an exotic couch.  He has been put
     in an aggressively fashionable Italian outfit.  He eyes
     and touches his new duds with complete bafflement.  He
     then stumbles into a standing position to, mouth gaping,
     take in a wondrous 360 degree view of Rome, Italy as "O
     Solo Mio" blares on the soundtrack.

                             HAWK
               No.  Way.

     Hawk's spinning view and the music on the soundtrack slam
     to a halt as he zeroes in on the sight of Scary Butler
     Alfred elegantly reaching the top of the staircase.

                             ALFRED
               Welcome to Rome, sir.

                             HAWK
               Yes way.

     EXT. OUTSIDE INTERESTING BUILDING--DAY

     Alfred opens the back door of an omnipotent, Mayflower-
     logoed LIMOUSINE.  The car moves off as Hawk slides in...

     INT. THE BACK SEAT OF THE MAX-TECH LIMOUSINE

     facing Darwin Mayflower who is blustering into the
     cellular.

     While he talks, Darwin shakes Hawk's bewildered hand,
     then holding up one finger in a "be with you in a sec"
     facial move.

                             DARWIN
               For those kind of wages, I could
               have built the factory in America!
               They're Vietnamese, can't we just
               give them more Bart Simpson shirts?
               I hear depressing news like this
               and I want to commit genocide!
                       (slamming phone)
               Alfred, hold my calls.  So, Hawk!
               The Hawkster!  What do you think
               of the vehicle?

                             HAWK
               You could host American Bandstand
               in here.  Why did you duck at the
               auction, asshole?

                             DARWIN
               Because I didn't want to get hurt,
               taterhead.

     A FAX MACHINE comes to life as Darwin babbles.

                             DARWIN
               What can I tell you, I'm the
               villain.  Initially it was a
               priority to keep a lot of buffers
               between you and me, but since most
               of them are dead now, I thought
               what the heck.  Hawk, you come
               highly recommended.  I would have
               done some things differently at
               the auction house, but hey, I want
               to be in business with you.

     Darwin scans the Fax message with annoyance, and then
     shoves it into a violent paper shredder.

     OUTSIDE THE LIMO SHREDDER

     Shredded paper litters out of a vent on the outside door.

     INSIDE THE LIMOUSINE

     A simmering Hawk tries to explode but the phone rings.

                             HAWK
               My life is not some deal.  I...

                             ALFRED (O.S.)
               It's Boston, Mr. Mayflower.

                             DARWIN
               I'm sorry, I have to take this.
               Those are valid points though...

     Darwin picks up the phone and goes Mr. Hyde, while giving
     Hawk "Can you believe this guy"-type gestures.

                             DARWIN
               You better have a good excuse...
               You better have a better excuse!
               You are so weak!  I'm only
               thankful your ancestors didn't
               settle America or else my name
               would be Running Brave or Vomiting
               Antelope...Really.  Well, listen
               close, babe.

     Darwin holds the phone over a 50 cent piece-size siren in
     his armrest.  Darwin presses a button and a PIERCING
     NOISE fills the car as it comes to a stop.

                             DARWIN
               Shall we?

     Darwin bolts out.  Hawk hangs back, waiting for Rod
     Serling to explain things, then bolts out too.

     EXT. E.U.R. DISTRICT BUILDING--DAY

     Hawk and Darwin head up the steps of an overpowering
     fascistly marble superstructure.  Alfred brings up the
     rear.

                             DARWIN
               So Hawkasaurus, I won't mince
               words...

                             HAWK
               Whatever.  You own Boardwalk, you
               own Park Place, you own the four
               railroads.  You think you're God.
               For all I know, you're probably
               right.  I just wanted to have a
               damn cappuccino, maybe play some
               Nintendo after I find out what it
               is.  Man, why didn't you just buy
               the horse?  What am I saying, you
               did buy it...

                             DARWIN
               Oh... Let's see.  There are
               organizations that think we wanted
               the "Sforza" for reasons other
               than putting it in the Da Vinci
               museum we're building in Vinci.
               Hopefully, these organizations
               think our plan has been ruined
               with the explosion of our replica.
               If I seem vague, grand.  We want a
               low profile on this, that's why I
               got Kaplan and the Candy bars
               involved.  I helped George help
               the Mario Brothers and Gates help
               get you out....

                             HAWK
               If you're pausing for a "thank you,"
               give it up.  So boss, you going to
               tell me what the crystal piece
               inside the pony means?

                             DARWIN
               Way to go, Alfie!  How many people
               did you break that thing in front
               of.   Good help's hard to find.

                             HAWK
               I guess that's a no.

     INT. MASSIVE CONFERENCE ROOM--DAY

     A mind-blowingly pretentious painting of Darwin, Minerva,
     and Bunny hangs above a mammoth M-shaped conference table.

     Lying atop the table in heels, shades, and a heart-
     stopping dark outfit is Minerva.  NASTY Metal riffs semi-
     audibly spew from a headset she wears.

     Surrounding the table is a VARIED GROUP OF OLD MONEY AND
     NEW MONEY BOARD MEMBERS ranging from a nine year old
     INDIAN PRINCE to a SWEET ELDERLY AMERICAN WOMAN.  They
     converse to the person at their side in businesslike
     tones, oblivious to Minerva.

                             DARWIN
               Ladies and gentlemen of the board...

     The board members go into tableau silence.  Minerva con-
     tinues a brief sing-a-long before Darwin scolds...

                             DARWIN
               And Min-er-va.  Let's give it up
               for Hudson Hawk.

     The board applauds as Alfred pushes Hawk inside.

                             MINERVA
               Hello......Bunny, Ball-Ball!

     Minerva lobs a ball in the air.  Bunny, the annoying dog,
     scurries beside Hawk to catch it.

     Moving down toward the other end of the table, Hawk takes
     in the surreal surroundings with battle fatigue.  He sees
     ONE BOARD MEMBER take a luxurious sip of cappuccino.
     Minerva paces up upon the table.

                             DARWIN
               Hawkmeister, we got you clothes,
               great hotel, and a 250,000 lira
               per diem.

                             MINERVA
               That's two hundred dollars a day?
               So he can get a hooker and some
               tequila.  Veto, Darwin.

                             HAWK
               Guess I know who wears the penis
               in this family.

                             MINERVA
                       (jumping off table)
               For God's sake, chain this
               convict.

     With a yawn, Alfred pulls out a pair of state-of-the-art
     handcuffs.

                             HAWK
               Alfred, you're a very polite
               psychopath, but if you...

     Hawk kicks out at Alfred, who nimbly moves slightly and
     gives a pummel to Hawk's body somersaulting him over the
     edge of the table, into an empty seat.

     The Board Members politely applaud.  Alfred pulls Hawk's
     hands around his back and cuffs him.  Bunny intensely
     sniffs his crotch.

                             MINERVA
               We want Da Vinci's sketchbook,
               what do they call it, the Codex.

                             DARWIN
               Listen Hawk, this might be hard to
               believe, but I'm a regular joe.  I
               just want to be happy and happiness
               comes from the achieving of goals.
               It's just when you make your first
               billion by the age of 19, it's
               hard to keep coming up with new
               ones.  But now finally I got my
               new goal.  World domination.  With
               your help...Bunny....quit that!

                             MINERVA
               Bunny, ball-ball!  Bad bunny!

                             HAWK
               Think he's already got today's
               ball-balls.  Five more minutes
               please, it's been so long...

     Minerva yanks away the yelping dog.

                             HAWK
               Anybody have a cigarette?  But
               seriously, do me a favor and
               Concorde me back to prison.  I
               don't care anymore.  I hope you
               have the receipts for the threads.

                             MINERVA
               You go back, you won't be alone.
               You'll have a diabetic barkeep
               cellmate.  You're still young
               enough to have fun shanking child
               molesters for a pack of smokes,
               but "Alex" will go in knowing that
               the next time he gets out it'll be
               to attend his own funeral.
               Depressing.

                             HAWK
               You wouldn't risk the dime to call
               the police.  You have no proof.

                             DARWIN
               Ah, the magic word...

     Alfred plants a slide machine on the table and Darwin
     starts clicking gorgeous images of Hawk and Alex robbing
     the auction house, on a bare wall.

     The Board members gush.  The Elderly Woman gives a
     thumbs-up.

                             DARWIN
               It's veja du, Hawkhead.  Something
               you wish never happened.  We shot
               the entire operation with hidden
               cameras behind the hidden cameras.
               Hired the guy who did the last
               Sports Illustrated Swimsuit issue.
               Excellent work... whoops, damn
               Fotomat assholes...

     A slide hits the wall of himself and Minerva kneeling in
     Big Baby clothes with Alfred snarling over them, decked
     out in leather.  He clicks ahead...

     Hawk looks away and sees that the Board members have an
     annual Report-type booklet in front of them that reads--
     THE DA VINCI/ALCHEMY PROJECT.

     Minerva leans over in front of him.

                             MINERVA
               Tomorrow, you're going to hit a
               church.

                                               CUT TO:

     EXT. A MASSIVE WIDE SHOT OF ST. PETER'S--DAY

     The Vatican stands in its glory, mobbed by HUNDREDS OF
     LOCALS AND SIGHTSEERS.  The viewer's viewpoint zeroes in
     on the Mayflower limousine circling around it.

     INT. THE LIMOUSINE

     Hawk looks out from the back seat of the limousine
     in stylish Italian sunglasses.

                             HAWK
               I'm robbing the Vatican.  The nuns
               at St. Agnes predicted that I'd end
               up doing this...

     Two identical Twin Flunkies sit across from him, grinning
     stupidly.  Hawk pushes up his sunglasses with his middle
     finger.

     INT. VATICANESQUE MAP ROOM

     Mentally casing the joint, Hawk gets some distance
     between him and the flunkies as he enters into a room
     that has a glorious, ancient Map of the World Mural.

     INT. ANOTHER VATICAN ROOM

     Hawk makes a scribble in a notepad before coming to a
     Vatican guard, standing before a painting of a Pope
     performing a Coronation.

                             HAWK
                       (half-hearted)
               Excuse me, I'm being blackmailed
               into robbing the Vatican by a
               psychotic American corporation
               along with a CIA...

                             VATICAN GUARD
               "You're being".....uh, I don't,
               uh...

     A jaded Hawk laughs and pats the cop on the back.

                             HAWK
               Forget it, man.  Go tackle a
               jaywalker.

     INT./EXT. CIRCULAR OPEN AIR HALLWAY

     Hawk comes out onto a circular open-air hallway.  He
     scans up to some rooftops and makes a note...until he
     sees a line of International Phone Boothettes.  Checking
     for Flunkies, he rips one up.

                             HAWK
               Operator, I want to make a collect
               call to Alex Messina, New York....

     The Flunkies drift into view.  Hawk hangs up and seethes
     off.

     INT. HALLWAY LEADING TO CODEX ROOM

     Hawk saunters down a long resplendent hallway toward a
     room at the end bustling with excitement.  Coming to the
     mouth of the room, he looks to two gold framed mirrors on
     either side of the opening, rubs his head, and scribbles.

     INSIDE THE CODEX ROOM

     Hawk takes in the majestic beauty, and practical details,
     of the room--windows, statues, a Massive Ornate Lighting
     Fixture--as he moves down one of the twin winding stair-
     cases leading to a path of people behind velvet ropes and
     the object of their gaze...

     THE DA VINCI CODEX

     --an old book enclosed in a glass case, propped open to
     the familiar BEAUTIFUL DRAWING of a MAN inside a CIRCLE.

     The case is located between two informational tablets
     enclosed in glass columns.  Enter Holy Da Vinci theme.

                             ANNA (V.O.)
               But it is his gift as an inventor
               who drew together science and art
               that is most incredible.

     Hawk brightens to the return of Anna, carrying a portfolio
     bag, striding down the stairs with a group of INVESTORS
     AND FAMILIES.  She brightens back, giving him a quick
     verbal breath and a hand squeeze.

                             ANNA
               Tough guy.  What are you--How's
               your head.

                             HAWK
                       (vegetable)
               Yes, and my giraffe loves it, too...

     She laughs, going into her public voice.

                             ANNA
               As you know, the Da Vinci Codex,
               has lived in the Vatican for
               centuries and will continue to
               live here for centuries more.

                             HAWK
                       (under his breath)
               That's what you theenk.

                             ANNA
               Question, sir?   His untiring pen
               predicted the airplane, the
               submarine, the bicycle, the
               helicopter, and even the tank.
         
     A LITTLE BRAT trailing the group, moves next to Hawk,
     bitching away to her STUFFED ELEPHANT, POKEY.

                             LITTLE BRAT
               This is so bor-ing!  Do you hate
               Italy as much as I do, Pokey?
                       (bad ventriloquism)
               Si, senor!  Italy sucks the big
               one!  why can't we go to the Epcot
               Center!

     The Little Brat stops and lets Pokey the elephant dangle
     from her side.  Hawk eyes the elephant strangely.

                             ANNA
               These more dangerous designs
               inspired him to develop a secret
               code that ....

     The stuffed elephant suddenly goes flying over Anna's
     head.

     The ALARM goes off.  The Massive Ornate Lighting Fixture
     swoops down from the ceiling, inverting in air, and slams
     down over the Codex, transformed into a makeshift cage.

     Strange green gas comes billowing out of the vents.
     Needless to say, everyone goes crazy.

     Coughing gas, Hawk peeks to see that a line of light
     sensor alarms imbedded in the tablets are what set the
     alarm off.

     Two GAS MASKS drop airlinesquely from the mouth of the
     entranceway and TWO RACING-IN GUARDS wrangle them on.

     The Little Brat sees that Pokey the stuffed elephant has
     been beheaded by the cage/lamp.  She is pulled away and
     spanked.

                             LITTLE BRAT
               Pokey, come back!

     Anna yanks a notetaking Hawk away as the gas blusters in
     around him.  The Two Flunkies, eyes on Hawk, are hap-
     lessly making their way up the opposite staircase.

                             ANNA
               Come on, this stuff will knock you
               out.  Have you ever had the feeling
               you were being followed, Mr. Bond.

                             HAWK
               Never, why do you ask?

     Reaching the top of the stairs, just outside the door,
     Anna briskly pulls Hawk into a PIECE OF WALL THAT IS
     REALLY A DOOR.  The wall closes as the Flunkies come
     flying out, baffled.

     INT. CIRCULAR STAIRCASE

     Hawk, mucho impressed, and Anna move down a tight, dark
     circular staircase.

                             HAWK
               Whoa.  Name's Hawkins, Eddie
               Hawkins.
               My nickname's Hudson Hawk, but don't
               call me Hudson, not even as a joke.
               The Nuns at St. Agnes called me
               that and they're the ones who
               helped make me what I am today.
               Not a compliment...

                             ANNA
               Sure Hudson.  Are you going to
               tell me why you did that back there
               or are you going to blame it
               on Dumbo?

                             HAWK
               Could you believe that crazy
               elephant?

     Anna shakes her head as she opens a door into...

     INT. A LITTLE UNDERGROUND SUBWAY--DAY

     A four foot high mail train rumbles down the track of a
     mini-underground station.  Workers latch onto mail bags.
     Hawk and Anna emerge from a small door.

                             HAWK
               Whoa, part 2.  Does it go to Times
               Square?

                             ANNA
               Delivers up to ten at night.  The
               Pope has an obsession with his
               Easter Seals.  It's actually not
               that an unusual set-up.  The
               secret passageway on the other
               hand....

                             HAWK
               The Vatican is made of constant
               mysteries meant to be enjoyed,
               not explained.

                             ANNA
               Nice.  But right out of our
               brochure.

                             HAWK
               Oh, you read that.

                             ANNA
               Actually I wrote it.  It's a good
               sentence.  It can apply to people.

                             HAWK
               You're not an unmysterious thang
               yourself.

                             ANNA
               I don't steal stuffed elephants
               from little girls.
                       (smoothing his
                        jacket)
               And I buy my own clothes.  My
               life's a little boring...

                             HAWK
               God, I wish I could say the same
               thing.  What about having a nice,
               dull dinner with me tonight.
               Scrabble, Knock-knock jokes,
               Anecdotes about famous dead
               Italians....

                             ANNA
               I'll bring my entire repertoire...

     The Two Flunkies stumble into the station, looking
     around.  Anna and Hawk crouch down.

                             HAWK
               And I'll bring my entourage...

                             ANNA
               Secret passageways don't mean as
               much as they used to.  There's
               a place two blocks east of here.
               Enzo's.  Say 10:30.

                             HAWK
               Said.

     Hawk and Anna peck each other with a smile.  He crawls
     out an exit door.  As he leaves, Anna's smile disappears.
     She pulls out a rosary and gives herself a self-scolding
     bang on the head.  She then darts to a large crucifix
     and looks up.

                             ANNA
               Father, it's obvious.  He's up to
               something.

     Suddenly a speaker in Jesus's mouth gently crackles.

                             JESUS (Italian)
               Report downstairs at once.

                             ANNA
               Yes, sir.

     INT. CATACOMBLIKE AREA

     A CARDINAL paces in an enigmatic Vatican area.  Anna
     clacks up to him.

                             CARDINAL
               Did he mention the Mayflowers?

                             ANNA
               No, your Eminence.  I think he's
               going to steal the Codex, as
               early as next week.

                             CARDINAL
               Attempt, you mean.  The vanity
               of this man, Hudson Hawk.  The
               Vatican has foiled the advances
               of Pirates and Terrorists.  We
               will not lie down for some
               schmuck from New Jersey.  Must
               you flirt with him so realistically?

                             ANNA
               That's the best kind.  A wise
               woman once said "Polite
               conversation is rarely either."

                             CARDINAL
                       (chuckling)
               Let me be the one to quote
               Scripture.  ....As an agent of
               our organization, you are put in
               awkward situations.  Just
               remember, Hudson Hawk is an evil,
               evil man.

                             ANNA
                       (unconvinced)
               Yeah.  The big E.

     EXT. NAVONA PIAZZA--DAY

     The evil Hawk clumsily strides around a fountain, looking
     off in all directions, soft-shoes past some sedate
     painters and swings into...

     INT. A BIG QUIRKY PHONE BOOTH

     Hawk grabs up the phone and dials....

                             HAWK
               Hello, operator.  I'd like to
               make a collect call to New York
               number...

     The Mayflower limousine creeps to the edge of the piazza,
     behind an oblivious Hawk.

                             HAWK
               Thank you, operator, thank you.

     Hawk turns, putting a finger in his ear.  Seeing the
     limo, he FREAKS and balls himself into a corner.

                             HAWK
               Come on, Alex, pick up, you
               Reindeer goat cheese-eating
               motherfucker.

     INT. ALEX'S RESTAURANT--NIGHT

     It is late night in New York.  A phone rings atop the
     bar of Alex's restaurant with no one in sight.

     INT. PIAZZA--DAY

     Hawk pokes his head to see a Darwin and Minerva (holding
     Bunny) emerge from the limousine.  As he turns his con-
     centration back to the phone, ALEX HIMSELF flows out from
     a building to cheerfully speak with Darwin and Minerva
     and get licked by Bunny, before they all pile into the
     limo.

                             HAWK
               A-lex, A-lex, come on Alex.

     Hawk slams down the phone and turns to see the limousine
     pull off.

     Hawk angrily bursts from the door and is painfully
     CLOTHESLINED by agent Butterfinger, who is dressed as
     a mailman.

     Crumpled on the ground, Hawk kicks out with his foot,
     into Butterfinger's stomach, doubling him. Hawk then
     grabs him by the head and rams into the glass of the
     booth.

     Hawk rotates off for an escape...but the rest of the
     CIA crew cuts him off holding barely concealed guns;
     Snickers dressed as a maitre 'd, Almond Joy as a Bermuda
     tourist, and Kaplan in his usual emsemble.  Kit Kat is
     dressed exactly like Hawk, right down to a bloody lip.
     Hawk gives him a double take.

                             KAPLAN
               Hawk, Hawk, Hawk.  Enjoying
               Italy?  I always had a soft spot
               for Rome.  Did my first barehanded
               strangulation here.  Communist
               politician.

                             HAWK
               Why George, you big softie...

                             KAPLAN
               God, I miss communism.  The Red
               Threat.  People were scared, the
               Agency was respected, and I got
               laid every night.

     A humiliated Butterfinger comes waddling out, holding
     the phone.  Kaplan rolls his eyes.

                             BUTTERFINGER
               Sorry, coach...

                             KAPLAN
                       (shaking his head)
               If his father wasn't the head of
               Shit, I hate this, the
               government's got me farmed out,
               working for the Mayflower
               corporation now, money beats
               politics.  War isn't Hell anymore,
               it's Dull.  Don't slaughter their
               men and rape their women, just
               steal their microchips.

                             HAWK
               You know Kaplan, if you weren't
               the slimiest pinata of shit that
               ever lived, I'd feel sorry for
               you.

                             SNICKERS
               Good news, bud, the Mayflowers
               have moved up the time-table.
               You're hitting the Vatican to-night.

                             HAWK
               Tonight?  You're whacked.  The
               timing's off, I'm underequipped
               Damnit, I have a date!

     Almond Joy smoothly extracts Hawk's notebook and reads...

                             ALMOND JOY
               Grapple, Biker's bottle, hairspray,
               black turtleneck, Pocket
               Fisherman, acid, collapsible
               yardstick, softball, and 72 stamps.
               Gee Stud, this is going to be
               some date.  No Harvey's Bristol
               Cream?

                             KAPLAN
               Snickers, make the list happen.
               Oh and it's one thing to play
               hide and seek with the Mayflower's
               pathetic staff, but we're sore
               losers.  I've put jumper cables
               on the nipples of children and
               not always in the line of duty.

                             HAWK
               Thanks for sharing.

                             KAPLAN
               We blow up space shuttles for
               breakfast.  You and your friend
               Alex would be a late afternoon
               Triscuit.

                             HAWK
               If you do anything to my friend...

                             KAPLAN
               Yeah, right.  By the way, as long
               as I'm getting things off my
               chest, I'm the one who killed your
               little monkey.  Made it look like
               a Mafia hit.  Did it for fun.
               Ciao.

     Kaplan and the crew quickly disperse in different
     directions as Hawk howls in frustration.  Kit Kat moves
     behind Hawk and perfectly mimics him.

                             HAWK
               What did you have against Little
               Eddie, motherfucker?  He was just
               a monkey who liked to laugh.
               Come back without your yuppie
               army.  I'll triscuit you, you
               space shuttle eating...Shit.!

     Without looking, Hawk elbows the mimic Kit Kat in the
     face.  Kit Kat gives Hawk a strange smile and hands him
     a card that reads:  BEWARE THE ODD STEPS.

     Hawk looks up from the card.  Kit Kat is gone, but
     Butterfinger scampers in his place.

                             BUTTERFINGER
               Hey, Mr. Hawk, I got those 72
               stamps!

     Sighing, Hawk takes the huge sheath of stamps.

     EXT. INDOOR TRAIN TRACK

     One of the small Vatican mail trains bullets across an
     indoor track.  The viewer's viewpoint whooshes to catch
     up, focusing on a very large package, addressed to the
     Pope, that has Hawk's sheath of stamps slapped onto it.
     The train zips into a tunnel.

     INT. THE VATICAN UNDERGROUND SUBWAY

     The train rumbles into the Vatican mini-station.  TWO
     HARRIED WORKERS heave up the strange cargo onto a sorting
     table.

     A bell rings as a clock hits 10.  The workers do a sigh
     of relief.  Shucking off their uniforms, they head out.

     A hand rips out of the huge package.

     INT. OUTSIDE THE CODEX ROOM--NIGHT

     Hawk pops out of the secret passageway door and moves to
     the mouth of the doorless Codex room.  He pauses to
     hand-comb his hair in the two large, framed mirrors at
     the sides.

     THE CODEX ROOM

     Carrying the now frameless mirrors in each hand, Hawk
     hustles to the top of the steps and suddenly stops.

                             HAWK
               "Beware the Odd Steps."

     Hawk crouches down and notices the step below him has a
     clear magnetic tape running across it to a dime sized
     alarm button.

                             HAWK
               Why Kit Kat, aren't you a
               gentleman...

     Hawk bounds down every other one of the steps down to
     where the Codex is bathed in a holy light.

     He hefts up the two now frameless mirrors and puts them
     each in a groove of a collapsible yardstick running
     across the top.  The parallel mirrors now face out from
     each other.  Hawk sprays a blast of Clairol to reveal the
     light sensor beams, and then with a deep breath, he
     thrusts the mirrors into the beams.

     The light bounces harmlessly off the mirrors and Hawk
     exhales.  He balances the connected mirrors then crawls
     through his tent-like passageway.

     Hawk squirts acid from a biker's bottle on the cracks of
     the rectangular glass case that holds the Codex.  The
     acid sizzles.

     INT. VATICAN LIBRARY HALLWAY--NIGHT

     A BURLY GUARD thoughtfully stares at a painting, fingers
     propping his chin like an critic then continues ambling
     on.

     THE CODEX ROOM

     Rubbing his head, Hawk gives an excited smile as the glass
     cracks of the rectangular case loosen.  Hawk pulls out a
     pocket fisherman....

     The viewer's viewpoint moves upward to reveal, through
     the mouth of the room, the Burly Guard is coming down
     the hall.

     OUTSIDE THE CODEX ROOM

     Burly Guard approaches the outskirts of the Codex room.
     He combs his hair into the piece of wall in the now
     empty mirror-frame then REALIZES.

     Muttering Italian into his walkie-talkie, Burly Guard
     rushes into the room and looks down to the sensor
     deflecting mirrors.

     He passes a statue, behind which, Hawk is revealed to
     be standing.

     Burly Guard approaches the Codex and sees the dripping
     acid.  He also notices a fishing hook attached to the
     binding of the Codex.  The fishing wire leads out of
     the glass case.  The Guard reaches to touch it when
     suddenly the wire is pulled tightly upward by a
     moving-out-from-behind-the-statue Hawk.

     The Codex FLIES off its perch, setting off the ALARM and
     sending the bizarre cage/lamp CRASHING DOWN and AROUND
     the hapless Burly Guard.  The green gas commences its
     noxious billowing as the Codex swooshes into Hawk's
     hands.  He then hurls a softball, smashing a window
     on the other side of the room.

     The familiar Vatican Guard and a Guard Three barrel
     down into the mouth of the codex room.  Only one
     Gas Mask drops from the doorway.  The Vatican Guard
     pulls it on and gives a "That's Life" shrug of
     shoulders to the fainting Guard three.

     Hawk puts on the missing gas mask and launches a grapple
     around the ceiling cord of the dropped Ornate Lighting
     Fixture.  Hawk then Tarzans from one staircase to
     another.  He then ungrapples and heads toward the
     shattered window.

     The Vatican Guard waits a stunned moment before giving
     chase.

     EXT. THE ROOF

     Hawk flings off his gas mask and begins a classical
     skipping-across-the-rooftop jaunt.  Suddenly a brick
     on the slightly slanted roof gives way and Hawk FALLS.
     His canvas bag goes skipping down across the roof,
     landing against the antennae.

     INT. THE POPE'S BEDROOM

     A T.V. showing Mr. Ed. speaking to Wilbur in Italian
     goes fuzzy.  THE POPE, wearing his famous hat and a Notre
     Dame bathrobe angrily bangs on it.

     EXT. THE ROOF

     Hawk harvests his grapple on the level part of the roof
     and slides down toward the dangling-off-the-antennae bag.

     The Vatican Guard pops out of the window and fires a
     warning shot.

     Hawk stretches to the bag.  His fingers touch as the
     Guard continues to bound forward.

                             HAWK
               Please God, Please God.......let
               the guard shoot me.

     Hawk pulls up the bag and turns himself to see Vatican
     Guard hovering over him on the roof.

                             VATICAN GUARD
               The worm's on the other foot,
               yankee noodle candy.

     Hawk sees the Vatican Guard's foot move toward the
     grapple.  Hawk ferociously tugs, ripping the Guard
     off-balance and knocking down a side of the roof.

     EXT. TOP OF A NEARBY WALL

     Hawk dashes atop a nearby wall and hurls his grapple
     across a road around a tree branch.  Hawk ties the end of
     grapple line, tosses on a friction belt, takes a breath
     and JUMPS OFF THE WALL.  The viewer follows him on his
     breathtaking ride.

     The brused Vatican Guard flops back atop the roof.  He
     gets off a wild shot before crumpling back down.

     HAWK

     is alnost to the other side when the Guard's bullet hits
     the friction belt.  Hawk drops with a wild scream...
     and lands with a painful straddle atop a street lamppost.
     His eyes bug out with the thought of a life without
     children.  He slowly spins off the lamppost and sails
     down upon...

     EXT. A BUS

     and the comfortable luggage housed on top of it.  Hawk
     tries to maintain his balance upon the wobbling
     baggage, but the bus makes a quick turn and Hawk goes
     flying off...

     EXT. RIGHT INTO A CAFE CHAIR--NIGHT

     Panting and discombobulated, Hawk looks across the table
     to the female hands holding open a menu.  The menu comes
     down.  It is Anna.  Hawk unpretzels and laps his canvas
     bag.

                             ANNA
               Oh Hudson, I was worried you
               weren't going to drop by....

                             HAWK
               I never break a date.  Scout's
               honor.

     Hawk does the honor sign with his black gloved hand
     then quickly rips it off as a WAITER comes to the
     table.

                             HAWK
               Fettucini con Funghi Porcini.

                             WAITER
               Bellissimo, signor.

                             HAWK
               Oh, and could I have some ketchup
               with that.

     Anna hits her forehead with the palm of her hand while
     the waiter's entire body sinks in disappointment.  Other
     TABLE OCCUPANTS sadly shake their heads.

     EXT. ANOTHER TABLE--NIGHT

     At a comfortable distance curled behind a heat lamp,
     Snickers is being an Uglier American to an UNCOMPREHENDING
     WAITER, while Almond Joy chuckles and Butterfinger spreads
     butter over an entire baguette.

                             SNICKERS
               Come on, Pierre, Steak-bur-ger,
               Fren-n-ch Fries.  This is France,
               you gotta have French.....

                             ALMOND JOY
               Actually we're in Italy, Snickers,
               she said as if it made a difference.

     The Waiter sneaks off.  Butterfinger devours his bread.

                             SNICKERS
               Italy, France, Moscow.  They all
               just wanna be Nebraska.  Old Man
               Kaplan thinks since Communism is
               dead, we got nothing to do.  Man,
               Democracy isn't free elections.
               We gotta teach the world that
               Democracy is Big Tits, College
               Football on Saturdays, Eddie
               Murphy saying the word "Fuck"
               and Kids putting their hands down
               garbage disposals on "America's
               Funniest Home Videos."

                             ALMOND JOY
               Damn baby, when's the last time
               you had a vacation...Jesus, I
               gotta get out of this job.  If
               my Mom knew her daughter
               assassinated the leader of the
               anti-Apartheid movement....

                             SNICKERS
               Quit bitching, you got the
               employee of the month plaque for
               that shit...Ah to be in Pari-is
               and in love.

     They look off to....

     HAWK AND ANNA'S TABLE

     Physically sarcastic, the Waiter brings a tall wine
     basket with a bottle of ketchup in it.  Hawk nabs it.

                             HAWK
               This is bueno.  They had the worst
               ketchup in prison.....uh...

                             ANNA
               Prison?

                             HAWK
               I was the Warden?

                             ANNA
               How long were you in?

                             HAWK
               Let's just say, I never saw E.T.

                             ANNA
               Wow, you were "in the joint."
               "Doing hard time."  It's funny,
               but that excites me.  I seem to
               have a thing for sinners.

                             HAWK
               I seem to have a thing for sinning.
               sinning.  Check please....

                             WAITER
               Ah, anything for dessert?

                             ANNA
                       (she shoots)
               Yes.  Something to go.

                             HAWK
                       (she scores)
               I'll bring the ketchup.

       INT. ANNA'S HOUSE--NIGHT

       The viewer's viewpoint pulls back, past the black canvas
       bag on a table, to reveal a barefoot Anna is straddling
       a bare-backed Hawk, demurely and tentatively studying his
       bruises.

                             ANNA
               What have you been doing?

                             HAWK
               Uh....old badminton injury.

     Anna giggles and bends to kiss a bruise.  She stops
     herself and opts for tickling.

                             HAWK
               tickles, ticKleS, TICKLES.

                             ANNA
                       (not stopping)
               Oh, I'm so sorry...

     Roaring with laughter, they capsize onto the floor.
     Hawk slithers around to devour her toes.  Anna closes
     her eyes and arches her back.....

     She opens her eyes and sees a large crucifix staring
     right at her.  With a gasp, she rolls away from Hawk
     and stands up, trying to brush off her sins.

                             ANNA
               I'm sorry.  I can't.  I....

                             HAWK
                       (softly approaching)
               Hey now, outside of a very
               friendly dog this morning, it's
               been a slow decade.  I don't make
               love every ten years, I get a
               little cranky.

                             ANNA
               It's also been a long time for
               me.  I--

     Their heads fuse for a semi-classic screen kiss until
     THE CRUCIFIX LIGHTS UP AND BEGINS SHOUTING IN ITALIAN.

                             HAWK
               Catholic girls are scary...

                            ANNA
               Somebody robbed the Vatican.

                            HAWK
               Oh.  No.

     Anna slides on her shoes and makes a hasty retreat.
     She bumps into the canvas bag.  The Codex slides out.
     They both catch it in mid-air.  Anna's eyes pop.  She
     wrenches the Codex away and kicks.  Hawk pulls her into
     a compassionate back-against-his-stomach hug.  The Codex
     falls to the floor unharmed.

                             HAWK
               It's not what you think.  Okay,
               maybe it is....

                             ANNA
               You really went and did it.  With
               one day, not even a day, of
               planning, you did it.  Nobody
               does it better, Hudson.  You
               started the week stealing the
               Sforza and you ended it swiping
               the Codex.

                             HAWK
               Wha--

                             ANNA
               What are your plans for the
               weekend?  Hoisting away the
               Colosseum?  Tell me, did the
               devil make you do it or did
               Darwin and Minerva Mayflower?

     EXT. A CAR OUTSIDE OF ANNA'S PLACE--NIGHT

     Crammed together in the front seat, Snickers, Almond
     Joy, and Butterfinger are watching the shadows of
     Hawk and Anna up in the window.  Snickers snaps a
     cartridge into a gun while Butterfinger attacks a
     goo-ey pastry.

                              SNICKERS
               What's going on in there?

                              BUTTERFINGER
               Do you want me to rape them?
                       (throwing pastry down)
               Dunkin does it better.

                              SNICKERS
               Just read, Butterfinger.

     Butterfinger pulls up the book on Da Vinci that Anna
     wrote and starts reading like a schoolboy.

                             BUTTERFINGER
               "Da Vinci had fears about his
               more dangerous designs, so he
               created a shorthand code in
               reverse script..."

                             ALMOND JOY
               To yourself!.....What are they
               doing?  In twenty seconds, we go
               in.

     INT. ANNA'S PLACE

     Foam shoots out over the coffee.  Hawk smiles down at
     it as Anna works a cappuccino machine.

                             ANNA
               For two years, I've been tracking
               the Mayflowers' peculiar interest
               in three Da Vinci pieces.  Their
               Sforza replica was as fake as
               the "gas leak" that supposedly
               destroyed it.

                             HAWK
               Does everyone in the world know
               more than me?  Jesus, I'm just
               some guy who happens to be good
               at swiping stuff.....Lifted a
               piece of licorice when I was one
               and a half.  Who knew it would
               lead... They even got the CIA
               involved!

                             ANNA
               The C.I. what?  God, no...

                             HAWK
                       (raising his cup)
               Ooh, I guess I do know something
               Here's looking at you, kid...

     THE CAR OUTSIDE

     The agents burst from the car, guns raised.

                             ALMOND JOY
               Now.

     ANNA'S HOUSE

     Hawk sips the cappuccino.  His face immediately contracts.

                             HAWK
               This doesn't taste like
               cappuccino.

                             ANNA
               Oh, I must have put too much
               ethyl-chloride in it.

     Anna throws a pillow on the ground and holds out her
     hand.  Hawk collapses.  His coffee cup lands perfectly in
     Anna's outstretched hand and his head lands perfectly
     on the pillow.

     The candy bars bash the door open, guns raised.

                             ANNA
               Why didn't you tell me at the
               restaurant that he had hit the
               Vatican tonight.  My people will
               not be happy.  I want to see Kaplan.

                             ALMOND JOY
               That's not overly possible.  He...

                             BUTTERFINGER
               But guys, remember, he's in the
               castle at Vinci....

     Snickers and Almond Joy grimace into fake smiles.

     EXT. THE CASTLE--NIGHT

     A helicopter thunders up to the awesome castle from the
     opening Da Vinci sequence.

     INT. HELICOPTER

     Anna pets the head of Hawk on her lap.  She is pondering.

     INT. A MYSTERIOUS DARK ROOM--NIGHT

     A sparse circle of light houses a chair and a pacing
     Kaplan.

     Snickers and Butterfinger flop Hawk onto the lit chair.

     Kit Kat is dressed exactly like Anna.  She reacts as she
     comes into the light.  Kaplan takes the Codex from her.

                             KAPLAN
               Way to go, Anna.

                             ANNA
               When the Mayflowers find out we
               have the Codex, they're going to
               want to make a deal...

                             KAPLAN
                       (gung-ho lying)
               And then we'll arrest those
               greedy pigs... Is that it?

     Hawk stirs.  The viewer gets his woozy P.O.V.

                             ANNA
               Actually George, it's not it.
               What are we doing in this castle?
               I happen to know the Mayflowers
               bought this castle last year when
               they found out Da Vinci used to
               do...

     The lights in the room come on to the sound of holy Da
     Vinci theme, revealing an almost perfect refurbishing of
     the exact same workshop Da Vinci toiled in in the
     opening.

                             KAPLAN
                       (trying to be solemn)
               It's the site of their new museum
               and we're taking it over.  Operation
               Deflower Mayflower is going full
               speed ahead.

                             ANNA
                       (taking it in)
               Oh Lord.... the only reason I ask is
               that Hudson, uh, Mr. Hawk, Hawkins,
               had some "neat" things to say about
               Darwin, Minerva, and you.
               Basically that you're part of the
               same car pool.

                             KAPLAN
               Anna.  Anna.  Anna.  If that were
               true, Almond Joy would have
               handed you your heart right
               after you handed me the Codex.
               Now, get some sleep.  Kit Kat...

     Kit Kat in drag spookily moves inches away from Anna.

                              ANNA
               Cat got his tongue?

                              KAPLAN
               Actually he never told us what it
               was.

     Kit Kat smiles, revealing the fact he has no tongue.

                             ANNA
               How sweet.  I trust you will see
               Hudson Hawk is given to the proper
               authorities.  I recommend
               leniency...

                             SNICKERS
                       (holding in a laugh)
               Oh, I think we all do.

     Hawk gives her a look of honesty and pain that causes
     Anna to guiltily gulp as she heads out with the mimicking
     Kit Kat.

                             SNICKERS
               Do you think she has any idea that
               Operation Deflower Mayflower is as
               bogus as Kit Kat's tits?

                             KAPLAN
               I don't think so, although bringing
               her to the castle gave her a big,
               juicy hint.

                             ALMOND JOY
               With all due respect to that great
               blouse, why didn't I cut out her
               heart?

                             KAPLAN
               Close call, but she's our only way
               of keeping tabs on that damn
               mysterious Vatican organization.
               Hawk, it's time to go to the
               principal's office....

     EXT. OUTSIDE THE CASTLE--NIGHT

     Moving into the chopper, Anna glimpses, Bunny, the
     obnoxious dog, in a Mayflower logo dog tag, taking a leak
     on some bushes.  She fakes a yawn to the like dressed Kit
     Kat who fakes one back.

     INT. THE G. MACHINE ROOM--NIGHT

     Kaplan, Hawk, and the other agents march into the mammoth
     room of the opening scene.  In the place of where one
     remembers the gold machine are undulating sheets, beneath
     which are unassembled parts of the machine.

     Inside, a ball goes whizzing out of a tennis ball
     machine.  In tennis gear and goggles, Darwin Mayflower
     thwacks it against the wall of (now faded) frescos.

     Also in tennis threads, Minerva is laying on a chaise
     lounge holding a gadget in her hand.

                             DARWIN
               Seven!

     Minerva turns the gadget up to SEVEN and presses a
     button.  Another tennis ball shoots out, a little faster.
     Darwin batters it.  The ball ricochets into the forehead
     of an "amused" Alfred who is retrieving balls in sweat
     pants.

                             ALFRED
               Jolly.  Good.  Shot.  Sir.

                             MINERVA
               Ooh, it's Hudson Hawk, you cease
               to amaze me, convict.  You are a
               terrible cat burglar!

                             DARWIN
               Haven't you ever seen, like David
               Niven?  You know tiptoe in, tiptoe
               out.

                             MINERVA
               Like a "cat", one could say.

                             HAWK
               Shucks, I'll just take it back.

     Hawk reaches for the Codex.  Kaplan pulls it over to
     Darwin, who pulls up his goggles and fondles the ancient
     binding.  Taking a knife from Kaplan, he begins to slit
     it open.

                             MINERVA
                       (bouncing up)
               No, let me!

                             DARWIN
                       (pout)
               I don't care.

     Hawk looks away to the billowing sheets and the strange
     machine parts behind them.

     Minerva slits the bindings and tugs out another geometri-
     cally perverted crystal.

                             HAWK
               Another piece of the puzzle for
               the Da Vinci Alchemy project.

     Kaplan, Darwin, and Minerva look up to Hawk, then to each
     other, all start to speak, then all stop.

     This quandary is deferred by the entrance of the twin
     Flunkies.

                             DARWIN
               Oh, you.  There's nothing more I
               hate than failure.  All you had to
               do was follow the Hawk, it's not
               like I said "Teach our nation's
               children how to read."

     Hawk uses the distraction to amble toward the sheets.

                             DARWIN
               I guess we're just going to have
               to kill 'em...

     Shockingly swift, Minerva pulls a small gun from beneath
     her tennis dress and blasts a burning hole between each
     set of Flunky eyes, splattering them to the ground.

                             DARWIN
               God Minerva, I was kidding.

     A SHOCKED HAWK

     quickly turns from the blithe carnage and pulls up a
     sheet.  He reveals the familiar Gold Machine Demonhead.

     THE MAYFLOWERS

     reverberate off each other with laughter.  Bloodstained,
     Kaplan and Almond Joy exchange an eye bulge.  Minerva's
     smile disappears as she sees Hawk by the sheets.

                             MINERVA
               Get away from there, convict!

                             HAWK
               Just browsing.  Don't touch me....

     Snickers touches him.  Hawk smashes him in the jaw.
     Snickers rears back to reciprocate....

                             DARWIN
               Don't hurt him!  We need him for
               the final job!

     Snickers stops himself, snarling in frustration.  Hawk is
     suddenly the happiest man he's been in Italy.

                             HAWK
               Oh weeeeelly, don't hurt me?  Even
               if I do this....

     Hawk pulls Snickers' glasses off and stamps them.

                             HAWK
               And this....

     Hawk knees Butterfinger in the stomach.

                             HAWK
               Surely this must offend....

     Hawk body-block-dominoes Butterfinger and Snickers to the
     ground.  Kaplan and Almond Joy aim their guns.

                             KAPLAN
               That's it!

     Playfully lifting his shirt, Hawk grabs Minerva and
     manually swivels her hips to the beat of his.

                             HAWK
               Things are getting a little loose
               at the Da Vinci workshop tonight.
               "Put your left leg in, take your
               right foot out."  May I call you
               Minnie....

     Hawk mambos to Alfred who rifles his blade up to Hawk's
     crotch.  Hawk stops dancing.

                             DARWIN
               Come to think of it there is a part
               of your body that you won't need for
               your next job...

                             HAWK
               Hey, guys, I've always wanted to sing
               like Franki Valli and the other seasons,
               but come on....

     Alfred moves the blade a little upward.  Hawk a-a-ghs.

                             MINERVA
               Big girls don't cry-I-eye.

                             HAWK
               Two minutes, 35 seconds.  Damnit,
               I'm involved in this thing, so I
               just wanna know what this thing is.
               I wanna be treated as an adult.

                             DARWIN
               That's fair.  Tomorrow.  Back in
               Rome.  Now go to your room.

     Alfred strategically Vulcans Hawk on the neck.  He falls.

     INT. DARK CONFESSION BOOTH--MORNING

     The lips of Anna come into light.

                             ANNA
               Forgive me Father for I have
               sinned.  It's been 1200 hours
               since my last confession.

     INT. THE CARDINAL'S SIDE OF THE CONFESSION BOOTH

     The cardinal suppresses a yawn.

                             CARDINAL
               Hit me with your best shot.

                             ANNA (O.S.)
               I betrayed a man.  A good man.  An
               innocent man.  A thief.

                             CARDINAL
               Anna, what are you trying to say...

     ANNA'S DARKENED LIPS

                             ANNA
               He came into a world where crime
               is a legitimate business tactic
               and a legitimate government
               procedure.  But he knew Right and
               Wrong.  Oh, and we kind of messed
               around...

     THE CARDINAL

     freaks and goes into some Italian gibberish before...

                             CARDINAL
               "Messed around" messed around?  I
               know-- I don't want to know.  First
               base?  Second Base?  Stop me when
               I'm getting warm...

                             ANNA (O.S.)
               A little petting is not the issue!

                             CARDINAL
               Sorry.  Seventeen Hail Marys and
               five minutes outside.

     INT. OUTSIDE THE CONFESSION BOOTH--MORNING

     The Cardinal emerges and stands by Anna's confessional
     curtains.

                             CARDINAL
               So let me get this straight,
               sister, you're saying Hudson Hawk
               is not willingly working for the
               Mayflowers but Kaplan and the
               Candy Bars are?

     Anna moves out of the confessional curtains, wearing a
     FULL NUN HABIT for she is a Nun.  The gaspingly beautiful
     church unfolds as they walk.

                             ANNA
               You got it.  Operation Deflower
               Mayflower is a bad joke and I'm the
               punchline.  I thought we were using
               the CIA to help us to get Mayflower,
               but really the CIA was using me to
               keep us away from Mayflower.

                             CARDINAL
               Oh, why couldn't I be the Cardinal
               in charge of catering.... If the
               Mayflowers get the three sections
               of Da Vinci's crystal and his
               instructions for the gold machine--
               Aie-yi--Do we got anything?  What of
               Alex, Hawk's friend, where is his
               loyalty?

                             ANNA
               I'm going to find out.

                             CARDINAL
               I'm sorry for losing it back there,
               but you must remember, sister, you
               have vows to God as well as a mission
               to the world.

                             ANNA
               I know, I know, your Eminence, just say
               "God go with me."

                             CARDINAL
               God go with you, sister.

     Anna puts on the coolest pair of sunglasses, deliciously
     contrasting with her habit.  She moves off....

     INT. ROME CONFERENCE ROOM--DAY

     Beneath the wacky portrait, Darwin circles the board-
     member filled conference table as Minerva smooches Bunny.
     Everyone watches Alfred place a bar of Gold and of Lead
     in the hands of a blindfolded Hawk at the middle of the M.

                             DARWIN
               So, Captain Hawk, in one of your
               paws you got a gold bar worth
               about 8 thou.  In the autre, you
               got lead that won't get you
               gelato.

                             MINERVA
               Surely a master-thief like you can
               tell the difference.

                             HAWK
                       ("What's my Line")
               That's two down to Kitty
               Carlisle...

     Hawk "weighs" the two bars in his hands--digs with his
     fingernails.  He rips off the blindfold in subdued
     frustration.  As Minerva speaks, she unconsciously
     molests Alfred.

                             MINERVA
               Cool, isn't it?  Weight, feel,
               mal1eability, they're all but
               identical.  On the periodic chart
               of elements, they're but one
               proton apart.  Great minds worked
               for centuries to turn worthless
               into priceless.

                             HAWK
               Alchemy.

                             DARWIN
                       (casually goosing Alfred)
               Alchemy!  Is the business term of
               the 90's, my man!  Minerva read
               about it in an airline magazine
               about four years ago.  I dumped
               some lira into research... Shazam,
               we come across a diary by one of
               Da Vinci's apprentices detailing
               La Machine de Oro, the gold machine
               for those at home, and the rest is
               about to become history.  Money
               isn't everything, gold is.  Fuck
               blue chip stocks!  Fuck T-bills!
               Fuck Junk Bonds!  I got the real
               deal!  Money will always be paper
               but gold will always be gold!

                             MINERVA
               Market crashes.  Bomb drops.
               Greenhouse effect affects.  We'll
               still be the richest, most powerful
               people in the world.  In 1992,
               Europe is coming together to become
               one business superpower.  It's one
               party we'd love to poop.

                             DARWIN
               Well, that said, the last
               ingredient in the recipe is in, get
               this, you're gonna die, the Kremlin.

                              HAWK
               Sure.  The Kremlin.  Makes sense.
               The Kremlin.  Why not?  Listen,
               this is all too Indiana Jones and
               the Lost City of King Tut for me,
               man.  Throw me in jail and go ahead,
               just try and throw Alex...

                             MINERVA
               Jail, you asshole!  Our foot
               soldiers will blow your brains
               out!  Bunny, Ball-Ball!

     Minerva angrily throws the dog off her lap and whips a
     tennis ball into its mouth.

                             DARWIN
               I'll torture you so slowly you'll
               think it's a career!  I'll kill
               your family, your friends, and the
               bitch you took to the Prom!

                             HAWK
               You want an address on that last
               one?

     Bunny barks up at Hawk in anger.

                             HAWK
               Bunny, not you too?

                              MINERVA
               You've got a dilemma, tiger.  I
               think I know what's going to help
               you solve it.

     Alfred quickly latches on the state-of-the-art handcuffs
     and the blindfold.  The viewer's viewpoint stays on a
     writhing Hawk.

                              HAWK
               I'll kill all you.  Even the old
               lady.


     Hawk kicks back on the table, "jump ropes" the cuffs,
     then picks the lock with his teeth.  Hawk rips off the
     blindfold to see that the entire room is empty except
     for Alex, standing at the other end, in an incongruous
     Italian leather coat.

                             ALEX
               I hated cigarettes until I saw my
               first No Smoking sign.  Keep off
               the Grass?  Let's play Soccer.
               Only law I cared about was
               friendship.  Broke that one too,
               didn't I?  This Gates-Mario
               Brothers-CIA-Mayflower-Da Vinci
               thing seemed like a sweet deal.
               Visit foreign lands, take their
               treasures.  I don't know, I thought
               you'd get into it.  It's better
               than playing darts with M.B.A.'s at
               the bar.  I didn't know it was
               going to be like this.  Them using
               me to use you... I'm sorry, there's
               only one way out of this and it's
               gonna hurt me more than it's gonna
               hurt you.

     Alex pulls out a gun from his jacket and clicks it in.

     EXT. FAMILIAR PIAZZA--DAY

     The piazza from the fascist E.U.R. building are bustling
     with office workers laughing, smoking, and hustling.
     Darwin, Minerva and Kaplan are a solid troika in the
     center of the steps.  The other agents stroll in the
     periphery....

                              KAPLAN
               I just don't think it was a
               smoking hot idea to leave them up
               there alone.

                             MINERVA
               Don't worry George, this is the
               reason we put the old diabetic
               guinea on the payroll to begin
               with.  To keep Hawk in line.
               They'll talk about "being buddies"
               and "chugging brewskis."

                             DARWIN
                       (raising glass)
               You gotta love male bonding.

     As Darwin slaps Kaplan on the back, behind them, Hawk and
     Alex come crashing out of the windowed doors of the building.

                              KAPLAN
               You were saying...

     Moving to the edge of the stairs, Hawk and Alex, latter
     holding his gun, sprout up from their own debris and
     continue savagely brawling.  The wigging out passers-
     by give them space.

                             HAWK
               You bastard!  You fucked my
               freedom for a lousy job!

     Alex trembles, going into a diabetic seizure.  He shakily
     raises his gun.

                             ALEX
               Hawk... I'm so sorry...

     Hawk roars forward like a bull and helmets Alex.  They
     roll together down the massive staircase past Darwin,
     Minerva, and the CIA who react with "This can't be
     happening" catatonia.

     Two SHOTS go off as Hawk and Alex crash to the bottom of
     the staircase.  Hawk rises up in a daze to see Alex on the
     ground with two bloody bullet holes.

                             HAWK
               No.....Alex!  Wake up, you can't
               go out like this.

     Hawk falls to his knees as Snickers hustles toward him.
     Suddenly, sirens are heard as a police van pulls up.
     Snickers stops.

     Four policemen blast from the back of the van.  One holds
     back the crowd.  One strenuously pulls Hawk into the van.
     The other two drag in Alex.

     The villains look to each other for non-existent guidance
     as the van pulls away.

                             MINERVA
               Plan B, anyone...

     Using initiative, Snickers hops on a Vespa and roars off
     after them.  The van can be seen swerving off.....

     AROUND A CORNER

     where it bolts up into a much larger truck marked VATICAN
     SOUVENIRS.  TWO SEEMINGLY-INNOCENT-BYSTANDER PRIESTS break
     demeanor to flop up the wheel ramps, slam close the back
     of the truck, lock it shut, and continue on their solemn
     way.

     The TRUCK BELLOWS off as the Vespa spins around the corner.
     Snickers brakes and looks around for the police van.  He
     hits his handle with frustration.

     EXT. BEAUTIFUL ROME OVERVIEW

     Out of her habit but still in her incredible sunglasses,
     Anna looks out to a lovely view of Italy.  The Vatican Truck
     pulls up behind her.  A giddy, blood-stained Alex and a not-
     so-giddy Hawk bound out of the back.  Alex excitedly gives
     himself an insulin shot.

                             ANNA
               Oh thank God, you're dead...

                             ALEX
               It was so beautiful!  When the
               blanks went off, they...

     Hawk's fist whooshes into frame and blasts Alex's jaw.

                             HAWK
               You bastard.  You fucked my
               freedom for a lousy job.

                             ALEX
               But I said I was sorry....

                             HAWK
               No sweat, Alex, you only made the
               biggest mistake of my life.  What
               was your per-diem?

                             ALEX
               Don't act like you've never committed
               a crime before, Hawkins?  I know, I
               made call, when Anna tracked me down I...

                             ANNA
               Hudson, don't you understand...

                             HAWK
               And you, Dr. Cappucino, you're lucky
               I don't hit women, assuming you are
               a woman.  I'm not taking anything for
               granted anymore.

                             ANNA
               I-work-for-a-covert-Vatican-humanitarian-
               organization.  The-CIA-made-a-fool-of-me.
               I-care-for-you...

                             HAWK
               Oh.  Well, what's this?

     Hawk pulls out the Demon Head that was in the Mayflower
     Museum from out of his pocket.  Anna turns white.

                             ANNA
               Where did you get this?

                             HAWK
               You know, the place where you gave
               the bad guys the Codex.... the
               Mayflower Museum.

                             ANNA
               It's from the machine.  All they
               need is the crystal to run it and
               they have 2/3 of it already.  We
               can't let that happen.

                             ALEX
               You're saying you want us to beat
               them to the crystal and save the
               world from financial disarray.

                             ANNA
               Something like that.

                             ALEX
                       (pulling out plane
                        tix)
               Well, forget about it.  Hawk and I
               are going to Rio.  We're hurt,
               we're tired, and a hero ain't
               nothing but a sandwich.  Right,
               buddy?...

                             ANNA
               Hudson, God's given you a gift for
               cat burglary, you can t just...

                             HAWK
               You better believe I can.  I'm
               sick of people telling me what I
               have to do.

                             ANNA
               It's that kind of selfish attitude
               that...

                             HAWK
               Selfish attitude?  I'm just some
               guy who wants a little nap and a
               cappuccino for when he wakes up,
               not too much foam...

                             ANNA
               You re not "some guy" anymore,
               Hudson.  Right now, you're the
               only guy.  Without your help, I....

     Anna looks to Hawk with a choked-up expression.  The
     weight of the world on his shoulders, Hawk turns away
     to a lovely view, his mind painfully raging and
     swirling toward peaceful clarity.

                             HAWK
               The world is beautiful.  Every day
               in prison I made sure to remember
               that.  It's only when I actually
               got out that I forgot.  If I was
               sane, I'd be on that plane to Rio.
               But being beaten and abused to
               fulfill some corporation's
               perverted vision does something to
               your mental health.  The world is
               beautiful and I'm tired of being
               fucked.
                       (turning around)
               It's Darwin and Minerva's turn to
               bite the pillow...

     Anna involuntarily does the sign of the cross.  Alex
     goodnaturedly does a jerking off motion.

                             ANNA
               That was beautiful.

                             ALEX
               I laughed, I cried.

     Shaking his head, Hawk swipes the plane tickets from
     Alex.

                             HAWK
               Rio, Alex?  After all they've
               done to...Hey, these tickets are
               for Moscow!

                             ALEX
                       (knowing smile)
               Damn travel agency.  That Kremlin
               thing is in Moscow, isn't it?

     A proud Hawk slaps Alex on the back as some passing
     ITALIAN LOCALS stop to stare, horrified, at Alex's
     bullet holes.  Anna sweetly intervenes.

                             ANNA
               Ketchup.  Stupido Americani...

     The locals give off a slightly dazed "A-a-h" and move off.

     INT. THE CONFERENCE ROOM--DAY

     Wind blows through the shattered conference room window.
     Snickers is banging on his computer apparatus at the
     table with the Mayflowers and the other agents.

                             KAPLAN
               We're all family now.  My team
               has done a lot of rougher things
               than steal the model of a
               helicopter.

                             SNICKERS
               We're going to whack this place
               so fast we'll have time to shop
               for American imports.

     Darwin and Minerva politely smile and then turn away to
     each other with knowing looks.  The computer screen shows
     the familiar image of the Kremlin building that turns
     into a complex look at interiors the viewer will later
     see.

                             ALMOND JOY
               Lucky for us, the Da Vinci is
               located in a wing of the Kremlin
               that they used to throw the Miss
               Ukraine pageant and stuff.  It'll
               have the least number of guards....

                             KAPLAN
               As for our plan of action,
               anybody'd be insane to go in
               from the ground floor...

     INT. A VAN-BUS--NIGHT

     A head-rubbing Hawk and a stomach rubbing Alex kneel on
     the floor of a moving van, over a barely legible drawing
     of what was so neatly delineated on the CIA computer.
     Both guys are dressed as priests and are chewing gum.

                             ALEX
               We're going in from the ground
               floor.

                             HAWK
               Geez, this Art Treasures Room
               looks like a burnt diaphragm.

     Hawk laughs and pops up into the passenger seat.  Anna
     is revealed to be driving in her habit.  Hawk gives her
     a kiss.

                             HAWK
               Hey, don't take your disguise so
               seriously.

                             ANNA
               Uh, yeah.  Guess I'm a wee bit
               nervous.  I'm sorry I could only
               score clergy passports.

                             HAWK
               Fits my new image.  A thief for
               the masses.  This is one job I'm
               not going to feel guilty about
               enjoying.  Gum.

     Hawk, Alex, and Anna all spit out their gum into a bag
     Hawk holds.

                             ALEX
               The security's actually not that
               severe.

                             ANNA
               It doesn't have to be.  Everybody
               knows that if you mess with the
               Kremlin, you'll end up in a
               Siberian gulag eating your own
               fingernails.

     Hawk takes in some views of Moscow that remind one of
     Budapest.

                             HAWK
               Shwoof, that makes me feel better.
               I can't believe this is the Iron
               Curtain.  All the guy at Airport
               customs wanted to know was "Who
               Shot J.R.?"

                             ALEX
               You sound disappointed.

                             HAWK
               Yeah, I mean, come on, going
               through the Iron Curtain is
               supposed to be crawling
               underneath barbed wire, it's
               supposed to be strangling a
               guard...

     THE VAN

     passes a textbook shot of the Kremlin in the distance.

                             HAWK (V.O.)
               It's supposed to be parachuting
               in the moonlight....

     EXT. THE TOP OF THE KREMLIN--NIGHT

     Kaplan, Snickers, Almond Joy, and Butterfinger slam down
     upon the roof of the Kremlin and discard their
     parachutes.

     Snickers opens up his computer screen, upon which is the
     image-map of the Kremlin with a flashing blue light at
     the top of the building and a flashing green one inside.

                             SNICKERS
               We are the blue light.  The green
               light is where the Art Treasures
               room is.

                             KAPLAN
               Let's go make a purple light.
               Where's Kit Kat?

     EXT. THE KREMLIN GROUNDS

     Dressed in cat burglar black and all chewing gum, Hawk,
     Alex, and Anna crawl across the Kremlin grounds.  They
     scope out a shabby Delivery Entrance.

                             ALEX
               Delivery Entrance.  Low Security.

                             ANNA
               Gum.

     All three spit out their gum into Hawk's bag.

                             HAWK
               Count of three?

                             ALEX
               Why not just go now?

                             HAWK
               Okay.

     The Trio rush for the door.

     THE KREMLIN ROOF

     SOVIET GUARD ONE comes out on the roof to light a cig-
     arette.  He looks in the distance to the motivating CIA
     team.  Suddenly a card floats down into his hand.

     It reads:   WILLIAM TELL.  ADAM'S APPLE.  GET IT?

     The not-getting-it Guard looks up from the card as a
     grinning Kit Kat parachutes behind him.  The Guard
     swerves around and Kit Kat savagely skewers him with a
     crossbow shot to his Adam's apple.

     THE DELIVERY ENTRANCE

     Hawk, Anna, and Alex race to the door, the latter
     bashes it...

     INT. GRUNGY WHITE FOYER

     open and sets off an annoying hammer-against-bell alarm.
     Alex all-fours beneath the alarm.  Hawk does a Michael
     Jordan vault off Alex's back and slam dunks A MASSIVE
     BALL OF USED-GUM, pulled from his bag, between the
     hammer and the bell, cutting off the sound.  They rush
     ahead.

     EXT. THE KREMLIN ROOF

     The agents are trotting across the roof when a phone on
     Snickers' apparatus rings.  Kaplan answers it.

                             KAPLAN
               Everything's going fine, Minerva,
               thanks for asking...

     INT. NONDESCRIPT HALLWAY

     Minerva chats on a cellular moving down a hallway, with
     Darwin, who is holding in his laughter as if this was a
     great crank.

                             MINERVA
               I say who needs this Hudson Hawk
               anyway....

     INT. A GRAND BALLROOM

     The good guys scurry upon the second level of an epic
     and gorgeous ballroom.  Two lush staircases lead up from
     the floor.  From behind a pillar, the gang checks out
     the activity below.

     A tablecloth is being wrangled over a large table at
     the opposite end of the ballroom by SERVANTS.  Threaten-
     ing SOVIET SOLDIERS maneuver on the floor.

                             HAWK
                       (Wizard of Oz)
               Oh-Eee-Oh-A-Whoa-Oh.

     They then make a mad scuffle across their side of the
     second level, hunkering down by the level railing.

     As they move into another wing hallway, the viewer's
     viewpoint moves back down to the ballroom floor to see
     a gloating DARWIN AND MINERVA ENTER, the latter still
     on the phone.

                             MINERVA
               Everybody here, in Rome, wishes
               you tinsel boxes of love...

     The servants move away from the tablecloth and the
     table, revealing that it is shaped like an M.  A GROUP
     OF SERIOUS SOVIET V.I.P.'s come out to join the
     Mayflowers at the table.

     THE ROOF

     Kaplan hangs up the phone.

                             KAPLAN
               Lazy, rich, condescending bitch.

     The team moves up to the rooftop doorway where Kit Kat
     is.  He holds up an "About Time" card.  The agents laugh
     and greet them.

     INT. A VERY LONG, ENIGMATIC HALLWAY

     Hawk, Alex, and Anna pass through a set of windowed
     double doors into a very long hallway that leads into a
     pitch darkness.  A MURAL OF A HAPPY, ARM-STRETCHED LENIN
     looms above the doors.  They give it a a quick glance
     before pulling out screwdrivers and wire hangers.

                             ALEX
               Eighth room down, babe...

                             ANNA
               Guards come exactly every three
               minutes....

                             HAWK
               Three.  Oh.  Oh.  "Side by Side."

     Our trio charges down the hallway.

                             HAWK
               "Oh, we ain't got a barrel of
               money.

                             ALEX
               "Maybe we're ragged and funny."

     They reach a MASSIVE SPOOKY DOOR WITH AN ODD, ANCIENT
     LOCK.  They go to work on it.  Not losing the beat.

                             HAWK AND ALEX
               "But we'll travel along, singing
               a song.  Side by Side..."

     INT. TOP FLOOR HALLWAY

     With a gust of wind, Kaplan and the Candy Bars bluster
     through the rooftop door into another hallway, where
     SOVIET GUARDS TWO AND THREE are taking it easy.

                             KAPLAN
               Create a diversion.

     Snickers and Butterfinger calmly blow away both guards
     with silenced mini-Uzis.

     SOVIET GUARD FOUR rushes out a door before the agents,
     zipping up his fly.  Almond Joy twists his neck with an
     agonizing SNAP.

     THE LONG HALLWAY

     Hawk, Anna, and Alex retreat beneath the Lenin mural
     through the windowed double doors.

     Behind the doors, they poke up to see a BESPECTACLED
     GUARD emerge from the darkness to check out the door.

                             ALEX
               Now that's a lock.

                             HAWK
               Don't worry, we'll get it...

                             ANNA
               Can I sing this time, too?
               Please?

     Hawk and Alex are not thrilled about the idea, but Anna's
     eye flutter does it.

                             HAWK
               Uh, I guess so.

     The Bespectacled Guard moves back into the darkness.

     THE BALLROOM

     The Soviet V.I.P.'s open up presents of pink L.A. GEAR
     tennis shoes, silly T-shirts, and Nintendo joysticks
     as a standing Darwin hypnotizes them.

                             DARWIN
               I look at you Soviet people and I
               feel... pity... superiority.  Most
               of your life, your government has
               told you that Capitalism turns
               people into robots who'd rather
               eat microwave sushi, naked in the
               back of a Cadillac than hear the
               laughter of children.

                             MINERVA
                       (smiling)
               We're here to say, your government
               was right.

                             DARWIN
               So let's get busy.  Have some fun
               and make some deals.

     AT THE LOCK

     Alex holds a lit match into the lock, while Hawk
     does something incomprehensible with a screwdriver.
     They are improvising...

                             HAWK
               "Oh this lock is a pain in the bu-utt"

                             ALEX
               "How'd we ever get such in a ru-utt"

     Anna suddenly, booms out the chorus in a way that Hawk and
     Alex can barely concentrate.

                             ANNA
               "But we'll travel the road, Sharing
               the load.  Side by Side!"

     THE HALLWAY ABOVE

     The CIA team saunters through corpses up to a door
     similar in lock and design to the one Hawk and Alex
     are working on.

     Snickers's computer screen shows the blue light directly
     above the green light.

                             SNICKERS
               This is the room above the Art
               Treasures room.  The lock is a
               Natalya Z-Z, first created...

                             ALMOND JOY
               Snickers, baby, I love you like a
               brother, but really, who cares?
               Silencer bomb...

     Butterfinger pulls from around his shoulder a strange
     rifle.  He attaches to the front of it;, a glass encased,
     suctioning time-bomb from a waist satchel.  He fires
     the bomb against the door and it starts ticking.

     BEHIND THE WINDOWED DOUBLE DOORS

     come Hawk, Alex, and Anna, panting.

                             HAWK
               That was close....

                             ALEX
               Anna, I think you better stay....

                             HAWK
               You can be lookout!.....  Take
               Alex's gun.

     Alex hands Anna his gun, who glumly takes it like a Little
     Sister not allowed to play.  Hawk and Alex go back through
     the doors.

     THE HALLWAY ABOVE

     The CIA bomb blows up the door with a weird silencer
     sound.  Kaplan and the Candy Bars giddily whoop as they
     rush through the smoking door.

     THE BALLROOM--SECOND LEVEL

     Anna meanders across the second level muttering to herself
     in Italian and amusingly imitating Hawk's condescension.

                             ANNA
               "You can be the lookout."

     Anna suddenly moves past the pillar to see the Mayflowers
     and the V.I.P.S.  She gasps and hurls herself behind the
     second level railing.

     THE BALLROOM FLOOR

     A VERY DIGNIFIED SOVIET LEADER, in a SHIT HAPPENS baseball
     cap, addresses Darwin.

                             SOVIET LEADER
               Before we serve you "the main course,"
               hee, hee, we need to know specifics
               about what you can do for us.  We--

                             DARWIN
               Bluntness.  How amusingly Hungarian.
               Listen up, for reasons I don't want
               to get into, I recently had to close
               down a petroleum factory, but I'm
               going to re-build it here and
               Madonna's going to cut the ribbon!
               Frozen burritos in Leningrad.  1982
               fantasy.  1992 reality.

     THE LOCK OUTSIDE THE DOOR

     Hawk and Alex more frantically toil on the lock.

                             HAWK
               "We all had our quarrels and
               parted..."

                             ALEX
               "But we'll be the same as we started...

     The lock clunks open.  They race through the doors into...

     INT. THE ART TREASURE ROOM

     Hawk and Alex weave through the room which is crammed,
     with little nuance, to the gills with great art treasures
     including an impressive array of Faberge eggs.  A solid
     gold hammer and sickle hang on one wall...

                             HAWK AND ALEX
               "Just traveling along, singing a
               song.  Side--"

                             HAWK
               Geez, this place is a mess...

                             ALEX
               Voila...

     They rumble toward an opening in the wall of the room
     covered by a small curtain that has the Da Vinci Man in
     the Circle drawing emblazoned across it.  Hawk reaches
     for the curtain.  Alex puts his arm around him and speaks,
     not sings.

                             ALEX
               Side by side, man...

     Suddenly, the roof above them explodes.  Kaplan and the
     Candy Bars drop down behind them.

                             ALMOND JOY
               What the hell....

                             SNICKERS
               You're supposed to be dead!

                             ALEX
               I'm a ghost.  Boo.

                             HAWK
               I don't want to sound immature,
               but we were here first...

                             KAPLAN
               I wish I could think of those cute
               quips the way you can, Hawk, but
               I can't, so I'll just shoot Alex.

     Kaplan point blank shoots Alex in the chest.  Alex
     crumples backward, moaning.  Butterfinger, casually, but
     with incredible strength, holds Hawk's arms behind his
     back.

                             HAWK
               No....

                             ALMOND JOY
               That was pretty uncool, George...

                             KAPLAN
               Sorry, you know he kind of reminds
               me of Little Eddie.  But I digress.
               Ah, victory is so sweet....

     Kaplan pulls back the Da Vinci curtain.  Nothing is there.

     THE BALLROOM BANQUET

     A SOVIET CHEF lifts up a silver domed serving tray,
     revealing the Da Vinci helicopter model.

                             MINERVA
               Yum.  This is the best meal I
               ever had...

     ANNA

     bulges her eyes at the revelation.  She pulls out Alex's
     gun and bangs herself in the head.  What to do....

     THE ART TREASURES ROOM

     Kaplan is bugging out.

                             KAPLAN
               Damnit, this isn't the plan!
               Blue light, green light, shit!
               Snickers, Kit Kat, A.J., scramble,
               see if you can find out anything.

     They thunder out.  Hawk, still in Butterfinger's
     oblivious clutches, shouts..

                             HAWK
               Can't you see the Mayflowers
               double-crossed you...

                             KAPLAN
               They may be scum, but if I get the
               Da Vinci model back, then we'll be
               roasting weenies on the beach.

                             HAWK
               I don't think you'll appreciate
               their choice of weenie.

     Kaplan raises his gun.

     THE BALLROOM BANQUET

     Darwin holds the Da Vinci model in one hand and raises
     a glass of vodka in the other.

                             DARWIN
               You're helping us achieve a goal
               and in return, I'm giving you a
               key to the world's executive
               washroom.  Don't piss it away....
               Skoal, amigos...

                              ANNA (O.S.)
               Stop or I'll shoot.

     Minerva and some various Soviet VIPS spew their vodka to
     look up to Anna pointing a gun down at them from the
     second level.  She is shivering, shaking the gun.

                              ANNA
               You people are immoral and
               narcissitic and I won't let you...

     In unison, the Soviet Soldiers surrounding the table
     begin machine gunning up at her.  She dives behind the
     railing.

     THE ART TREASURES ROOM

     Kaplan lowers his gun.

                             KAPLAN
               I can't believe this.  I'm in
               fucking Russia, or do I have to
               say, the fucking Soviet Union and
               I'm shooting a non-Bolshevick.
                       (raising back up
                        his gun)
               I never thought I'd say "I'm just
               in this job for the money."  Sad.
               Any last immature quips?

                             HAWK
               No.
                       (a beat)
               But why do you let Butterfinger
               keep those blood stains on his
               shirt?

     Falling for the oldest trick in the book, Butterfinger
     looks down to his shirt.

                             BUTTERFINGER
               What blood stains....

     Hawk bounces up to savagely head-butt Butterfinger.
     Butterfinger slams back against a wall causing the Gold
     Sickle to fall down around his neck and knock him to the
     ground, pinning his head to the floor.  The Gold Hammer
     next trembles off the wall and crushes Butterfinger's
     skull.

                             HAWK
               You want immature, how 'bout an
               egg fight...

     Hawk flings a Faberge egg, smashing the gun out of Kaplan's
     hand.  Hawk pelts a batch more at him.  Kaplan sloppily
     whips some eggs back.  Hawk finally smashes one in half
     and beans the jagged piece into Kaplan's eye.  He squeals
     to the ground, geysering blood.

     Hawk swoops down to a wheezing, breath controlling Alex.

                             HAWK
               Alex, are you....

                             ALEX
               I can't believe you didn't notice.
               My weight.  I lost ten pounds in
               Rome

                              HAWK
               You're a reed, man.  I gotta get
               Anna.  Hang in there...

     THE BALLROOM

     Bullets stop splintering around Anna at the railing as
     the soldiers fling out their empty cartridges to reload.

     Snickers, Almond Joy, and Kit Kat race out of the hall-
     way area into the ballroom area.  They stop at the sight
     of Anna....

                             ALMOND JOY
               Anna-bannana-fo-fanna, I guess I
               have to cut out your heart for
               real now.  It's not personal.

     Anna feebly raises her gun.  Almond Joy laughs and
     pulls out a knife.

                             ALMOND JOY
               You won't shoot.  I read your
               dossier... Sister.

     The Soviet Soldiers snap in new cartridges as Almond Joy
     moves out from behind the pillar towards Anna.  The
     Soldiers blast away at this newly appearing figure.

     Almond Joy ruptures and vibrates in a Sonny Corleone
     ballet.

                             ALMOND JOY
               I gotta get a new job...

     Snickers and Kit Kat militarily roll on either side of
     Anna as their partner wilts to the ground.  The men,
     Snickers with his mini-Uzi, Kit Kat with his cross-
     bow rifle, briefly leap up to fire down at the soldiers
     with some graphic success.

     Anna watches Darwin and Minerva head up the stairs to
     her level.  She bolts off....

     BALLROOM FLOOR

     The last of the Soviet VIPS flee as the Soldiers tip
     over the M shaped table on its side, using it for
     cover, firing upward.

     KIT KAT

     breaks off and scurries around the second level to get
     a position behind the M.

     He fires down an arrow for a successful kill.  Another
     guard tries to fire up, but Kit Kat impales him to the
     back of the table with a quality shot.

     Kit Kat grins and reloads as Alfred, the butler, regally
     creeps behind him.

     HAWK

     comes out of the long hallway double doors up to where
     Anna is bustling.  They hug...

                             ANNA
               The Mayflowers got...

     Hawk and Anna turn to see the Mayflowers hastening in
     their direction.  Noticing them back, the model-toting
     Mayflowers halt.

     KIT KAT

     turns to Alfred and fires his crossbow.  Alfred effort-
     lessly cuts it in half with his blade and continues
     to move forward.  Still smiling, Kit Kat tries to reload.

     MINERVA

     breaks the standstill.

                             DARWIN
               What a pleasant surprise.  You're
               probably wondering...

                             HAWK
               But you're going to tell us
               anyway...

                             MINERVA
               I hate a man with a sense of
               humor.  While you corn dogs were
               comparing the lengths of your
               masculinity, we obtained the
               helicopter the new fashioned
               way: a thoroughly corrupt business
               deal.

                             HAWK
               If you think you're getting past
               me...

     Grunting behind them, Snickers gun-butts Hawk to the
     ground.

                             HAWK
               Don't be stupid...they...

                             SNICKERS
               Bastard!  If you were a true
               American.

                             HAWK
               Just shut up and hit me!

     Snickers swings a punch.  Hawk blocks it then whomps
     him in the chest.

     As they battle, Darwin grabs Anna's hair, slams her
     into a pillar, and watches her crumple.

     KIT KAT

     gets in an arrow but it's too late.  Alfred stabs
     him deep, deep, deeply, and lifts him from the ground.

     A shower of cards reading "OUCH" "PAIN" and "THIS REALLY
     HURTS" rain from out of Kit Kat's coat.

     Alfred discards him over the edge.

     Kit Kat sails down upon the M.

     The lone card of "FUCK" plops from his open eyed corpse.

     HAWK

     and Snickers trades fierce blows, stumbling down a
     staircase.

     DARWIN

     and Minerva watch the fight with amusement.  Alfred
     approaches.

                             DARWIN
               Alfred, the getaway car...

     SNICKERS

     slashes Hawk in the arm with a small but sinister blade.

                             HAWK
               Damnit, I hate this!  I'm a cat
               burglar!  Nobody said anything
               about this fight-to-the-death
               shit.

                             SNICKERS
               Too bad.

     Snickers goes for a final thrust when suddenly one of the
     silencer time bombs suctions to his head.

     Hawk turns to see Alex, barely standing, at the top of
     the stairs, holding the strange rifle.

     Darwin and Minerva turn to this dramatic entrance.  They
     start to trot off...

                             MINERVA
               I knew it!  I told you it was a
               fake.

                             DARWIN
               That New-York-Italian-Father-
               made-twenty-bucks-a-week-son-
               of-a-bitch.  What was our bet?  A
               million?

                             MINERVA
               Million five, lover...

     HAWK

     boots Snickers down the stairs.  Snickers somersaults
     up and frantically tries to pull off the bomb.

     Snickers wails to the soldiers, who have lowered their
     guns and are poking their heads out of the M to watch.

                             SNICKERS
               Help me you Democratic Reform
               lovers!  Get a screwdriver, you
               Stupid Eskimoes!  Screw-dri-ver!
               Oh God, I always wanted to know
               how to play the harp, there
               just was so little time!  Rosebud!

     The soldiers high-tail it out.  Snickers plugs his ears.
     Nothing happens.

                             SNICKERS
               Maybe it was just a....

     Snickers blows up gloriously before the M.

     THE STAIRCASE

     Hawk bounds up to Alex, who puffs down onto the steps.

                             ALEX
               Get 'em.  They went down the
               hallway.

                             HAWK
               Let's just forget it, I mean...

                             ALEX
               Get em....

     Hawk rushes up the. stairs, gives a "What can I do?" glance
     to the unconscious Anna, and then continues rushing, past
     a pillar.  Minerva emerges from behind the pillar and
     moves forward.

     THE LONG ENIGMATIC HALLWAY

     Hawk chugs beneath the Lenin mural and down the hall-
     way.  He sees Darwin breezing in front of him.  Darwin
     looks back to Hawk then runs forward into the darkness.

     THE BALLROOM

     Minera sits down next to the pained Alex.

                             MINERVA
               Alex.  How's it going?

                             ALEX
               Go, go to Hell, to Hell.

     Minerva pulls out a candy bar and rips it open.

                             MINERVA
               Where's your insulin....No?  Well,
               Bon Appetite.

     Minerva savagely slams Alex's head down and shoves the
     candy bar in his mouth.

     THE HALLWAY

     Hawk moves closer and closer to the darkness of the
     hallway when a one-eyed and bleeding George Kaplan dives
     out of the Art Treasures room and tackles him.  Hawk
     kicks him off...

                             HAWK
               Oh, come on....

     THE BALLROOM

     Alex gulps down the last of the candy bar, shivering.

                             MINERVA
               Very good, Alex, but you re
               still alive....

     She pulls out another candy bar.  Alex, with a last
     burst of strength, punches her across the face.

                             MINERVA
               That's fair.

     THE LONG HALLWAY

     Hawk and Kaplan lock onto each other's throats.

                             HAWK
               Why does this have to be so hard...

                             KAPLAN
               Tell me about it...

     Suddenly, of all things, a car is heard rumbling in the
     darkness.

     Hawk and Kaplan stop fighting and turn to see THE MAY-
     FLOWER LIMOUSINE screeching out of the darkness with
     Darwin standing out of the sunroof firing a gun.

     Bullets fly around them.  From his back pocket, Hawk
     slaps the nice picture of him and Little Eddie into
     Kaplan's hands.

                             HAWK
               Take this to Hell with you...

     Hawk jumps up and grabs a hanging lamp.

     Deranged with confusion, Kaplan turns from the picture
     to the charging limousine.

                             KAPLAN
               My pension.....

     The driving Alfred smiles through the windshield.

     Kaplan's body slams into a vivid somersaulting crash
     into the windshield.

     Hawk's hands burn and sizzle on the hanging lamp.

     Passing beneath, Darwin raises up his gun.

     Hawk lets go of the lamp and drops down on Darwin,
     locking his legs around his neck and crushing him
     down into....

     THE BACKSEAT OF THE LIMOUSINE

     Hawk and Darwin grapple on the floor of the limo.  The
     Da Vinci helicopter model bobs on the backseat.  Darwin's
     gun goes off..

     right through Alfred's throat.  He slumps over, pressing
     down on the accelerator.

     THE LIMOUSINE

     blasts down the hallway, sparking off the wall, and
     bashing off paintings and mirrors.

     THE BACKSEAT

     Darwin flicks on his paper shredder and shoves the side
     of Hawk's hand into its teeth.

     OUTSIDE THE LIMOUSINE

     A mist of blood coughs out of the shredder vent and makes
     a weird bloody line across the wall.

     INT. BACKSEAT

     Hawk yanks his hand from the shredder and grabs the meg-
     lomaniac by the hair and shoves his head down on the
     arm rest.  Hawk turns on the piercing siren and Darwin's
     eyes try to escape his head with a high pitched scream.
     Darwin's entire body bucks wildly.

     Darwin back-elbows Hawk and moves down for his gun.
     Hawk pulls him back by his hair, grabs him by the balls,
     and pushes him upward through the sunroof.

                             DARWIN
               God-damnit, I only wanted to
               destroy the world in my own image.
               I'm a regular Joe...

     Darwin pounds his fists on Hawk's head as Hawk hits the
     sunroof switch sliding it shut on Darwin, pinning
     his arms below the roof, but leaving his torso twisting
     in the wind.

     The mural of a happy Lenin with his arms outstretched
     looms ahead waiting to greet Darwin.

     Putting two and two together, Darwin loses it....

                             DARWIN
               Not Lenin, anybody but Lenin.  God,
               let's talk abut this.

     The limousine charges through the double doors and Darwin's
     body connects with the mural.

     INSIDE THE LIMO

     Hearing the crunch, Hawk flips into the front seat and
     brakes the vehicle.  Alfred's head bounces against the
     steering wheel.  Hawk reaches over with a grin and picks
     up the Da Vinci model.  He looks to Alfred, Kaplan
     crunched in the windshield, and Darwin's dangling legs.

                             HAWK
               Wow, this is really gonna hurt the
               resale value...

     THE BALLROOM

     Hawk runs up to a woozy Anna and helps her up.  She has
     a cross-shaped blood stain on her forehead.

                             HAWK
               Oh, honey....

     Hawk looks to Alex, sitting on the stairs, the same way
     he left him.  Hawk rushes to him.

                             HAWK
               We did it man, we...

     Hawk grabs Alex's shoulder.  Alex falls back.  Written
     over his face in red lipstick is REALLY DEAD.

     Engaging a slow motion sequence, Minerva saunters behind
     Anna, putting on red lipstick.  Minerva slams her back
     to the ground.

     Hawk howls then turns to see stiff-upper-lip Alfred,
     bleeding from the neck.  Hawk tries to throw a punch,
     but Alfred blocks it and crunches him across the face.

     The Da Vinci helicopter model bounces down the stairs
     in slow motion and cracks open, revealing the intricate
     mirror of the opening scene.

     INT. DARK ROOM ATOP MAYFLOWER MUSEUM--DAY

     A damaged Hawk awakens in a dungeonish room and stumbles
     to some shutters.  "O Solo Mio" returns on the sound-
     track as the shutters open to a postcard view of Vinci.

     Hawk closes the shutters and cuts off the music.  A
     slightly more composed Anna touches his shoulder causing
     him to jump slightly.  They melt into a kiss.

                             ANNA
               Oh Hudson...

                             HAWK
               I told you not to call me Hudson.
               The only people who called me that
               were the nuns at...

                             ANNA
               Oh Hudson, I'm a sister of the
               Catholic church as well as an
               agent.

                             HAWK
                       (cut-off laugh)
               This is too bad to be false.

     Alfred enters the room in his favorite outfit with a
     bandage around his neck.  His voice is strange, but still
     polite.

                             ALFRED
               Welcome back to Vinci.

                             HAWK
               Last rites, sister?

                             ANNA
               Please, no nun jokes...They're a
               bad habit to get into....get it?

     Hawk and Anna unconvincingly laugh then sadly pause.

                              HAWK
               She killed Alex.

     Alfred gives them a push.

     INT. THE DA VINCI WORKSHOP

     Alfred leads them through the Da Vinci workshop past the
     bat winged glider and incongruously crammed-in tennis ball
     machine.

     INT. THE ROOM OF THE GOLD MACHINE--DAY

     Alfred grandly opens double-doors to reveal that Da
     Vinci's gold machine has been majestically re-created
     piece by piece.  In the periphery, the 90's rears its
     head in the form of THREE TECHNICIANS wearing headsets
     and gun holsters who consult computer terminals.

                              MINERVA (O.S.)
               GOLD-FI-ING-ER!

     Hawk and Anna turn to see Minerva splashily enter in
     sexy funeral-wear.

                              MINERVA
               Sorry, I couldn't resist.  You're
               probably wondering why you're
               still alive.  Anna.....

     As Minerva speaks, TECHNICIAN ONE forcibly escorts Anna
     toward a stand near the gold machine and tightly
     handcuffs her to it.

                              MINERVA
               I want you to monitor the Da
               Vinci's directions from the
               apprentice diary.  And Hawk, I
               didn't want you to go to hell
               without knowing that Darwin and
               I's dream came true.
                       (suddenly sheepish)
               Beside that, none of us can seem
               to put that damn crystal together.
               Alfie and I were up all night with
               the thing.

     TECHNICIAN TWO commences a forcible escort of Hawk to the
     gold machine.  Hawk cold-cocks him to the ground.

                              HAWK
               You killed a friend.  Why should I
               help you go for the gold?

                              MINERVA
               It'll take a couple of years of
               steady production, but I'll flood
               the market with so much gold that
               gold itself, the foundation of all
               finance, will lose its meaning.
               Brokers, economists, and fellow
               entrepreneurs will drown in the
               saliva of their own nervous
               breakdowns.  Markets will crash-
               crash.  Financial Empires will
               crumble-crumble.

                              HAWK
               Except yours-yours.  The goal of
               world domination.  Well, if you
               put it that way, Minnie.  How can
               I resist?

                              MINERVA
               You can't, convict!  You're just
               a shmoe!  Every shmoe has the
               fantasy the planet revolves around
               them.  It rains, car crash stops
               traffic, you say "How could this
               happen to me?"  It's a natural
               inclination.  But for I, this
               isn't a fantasy, it is reality!
               You are on my planet!  You walk
               around the corner for coffee, out
               of my sight, you do not fucking
               exist!  The lives of shmoes like
               you have meaning only in relation
               to the rich, to the powerful, to ME!

     Anna looks at the oil cloth diary before her.  She pulls
     a compact from her pocket and holds the compact mirror
     over the scribblings.  Reading off the reflection, her
     eyes widen.

                              ANNA
               Do it.  There's no reason to fight
               anymore.  She's a force of nature.

     Trying to get a grip on Anna's words, Hawk lets himself
     be escorted to another stand before the gold machine that
     has the two complex crystal parts and the weird mirror.

                              MINERVA
               If you pull this off, I can't
               promise I won't kill you.  I mean,
               who we trying to kid?  But I will
               spare the Flying Nun here....

                              HAWK
               And to think I thought you were
               Evil Incarnate in pumps.

                              MINERVA
               I killed some lovable working
               class Italian-diabetic, but you
               killed the most significant male
               figure of the decade and a kind,
               gentle lover.  So don't play with
               me.

     Minerva flicks a switch on the stand Anna's handcuffed
     to.  Anna vibrates, being electrocuted.

                              HAWK
               Okay, fine!

     Minerva switches it off.  Giving himself a head rub, Hawk
     bears down on the three oddly malleable objects.  He
     TANGLES and BENDS and with a loud SNAP, puts them
     together, forming the Crystal from the opening scene.
     Minerva snatches it from him and puts on a head-set.

                              MINERVA
               Oh Hawk, don't ever change.  Go,
               team, go!

     Minerva giddily sets the crystal in the same place as Da
     Vinci had it in his machine.

     Using a long steel pole, Technician One adjusts a myriad
     of mirrors so they are in a proper angle with a series
     of lenses culminating on the top of the machine.

     Technicians Two (black-eyed) and Three pour various
     chemical powders and liquids into corresponding compart-
     ments on the machine, beautifully decorated by the
     chemical's zodiac sign.

     Alfred places a lead bar in its proper place.

     Hawk glides to Anna and undoes her handcuff.

                              HAWK
               I hope you know what....

                              ANNA
               Trust Leonardo....

                              HAWK
               Wha.....

     Anna puts her fingers on his lips.

     Minerva throws a lever.  Steam begins to percolate from
     the furnace towards the machine.

                              MINERVA
                       (into the headset)
               We're for real.

     THE MACHINE

     begins to rotate, at first clunkily, then faster.
     The Crystal rotates comfortably in its compartment.

     The machine throws out its folding arms, each with an
     element.  The arms click higher.

     The goggled technicians stand before a time-coded video
     monitor, taking notes.

     The chemical housings open and the chemicals begin to
     spill and drop through brass tubes.

     ANNA

     murmurs to Hawk.

                              ANNA
               Da Vinci made the real directions
               in a secret script that I decoded.
               The way the machine is running
               now, the gold will produce too
               quickly, clog, and the machine
               will shut itself down.  Isn't it
               wonderful?

                              HAWK
               Yeah, but what would happen if that
               little mirror came out of the
               crystal.

                              ANNA
               Wha -- you don't want to know...

     Hawk pulls out the mirror from his pocket.

                              HAWK
               I wanna know...

                              ANNA
               Holy sh-h--things are going to
               get very interesting, very fast.
               Da Vinci would be proud of you.

     IN THE MACHINE

     The chemicals snake down their individual paths to the
     Lead Bar spinning its trough.  There's a FLASH and a
     controlled but jarring explosion.

     EVERYONE

     doubletakes.  Hawk reaches down to the six foot steel
     pole and with one swing slams the faces of all three
     deep in concentration Technicians to the ground.

     Oblivious to the violence behind her, Minerva, pulling
     on goggles over her head-set, moves closer with a
     religious purr.

     THE MACHINE

     triggers a fresnel lens and laserlike beams bounce around
     the mirrors faster and faster, circling the room.

     OUTSIDE THE MACHINE

     Hawk and Anna squint, blinded.  Flinging off her goggles,
     A literally beaming Minerva giggles forward.

     THE MACHINE

     Beams of light converge on the top mirror and bounce into
     the innards of the machine with a mighty roar!

     MINERVA

     sees that the center of the machine gleams yellowish and
     molten.  She moves closer, shouting into her head-set.

                              MINERVA
               Eureka, motherfuckers!

     The machine thunders and spins at a more aggressive
     pace.

     Hawk's voice suddenly comes on Minerva's head-set.

                              HAWK'S VOICE (head-set)
               Minnie, hate to interrupt your
               orgasm, but....

     HAWK AND ANNA

     stand above the unconscious Technicians.  Hawk is on
     head-set.

                              HAWK
               Me, Anna, and Leonardo just wanna
               say you got the Midas touch, baby...

     MACHINE

     Minerva turns toward the machine in anger and confusion.

     The center of the machine blows.  The pool of molten gold
     rockets at the viewer.

     Mirrors explode and the lasers slash at the walls.

     Minerva tumbles from the machine, screaming, that is to
     say, trying to scream, because molten gold covers her
     face.  It bubbles and cascades, turning her into a
     bizarrely beautiful echo of Nefertiti.

     HAWK AND ANNA

     turn to retreat, and see, standing in the mouth of the
     open double doors, in an open shirt, wearing Indian war
     paint on his face and the words RULE BRITANNIA painted
     on his chest, ALFRED!

                              ALFRED
               How.

                              HAWK
               You're unemployed, Alfie.  Boss
               is dead.  Her plan is over.

                              ALFRED
                       (strange voiced)
               My plan is just beginning.  I'll
               forgive you for denying me the
               pleasure of slaughtering my
               boorish employers, but I'm afraid
               the birth of the new British
               Empire can have no witnesses!

                              HAWK
               Ooh-kay...

     Alfred rushes forward with a howl.  Hawk meets him
     halfway.  They trade savage punches and then lock onto
     each other's throats.

     Anna pulls a gun from a technician's holster and prays
     for forgiveness.  She aims steadily, and fires...

     right into Hawk's arm.  This allows Alfred to knock him
     back with a strong punch.

                              ANNA
               Sorry!

     She fires again.  The bullet pings off Hawk's belt buckle.

                              HAWK
               Stop helping me!  Thou shalt not
               kill!

     Hawk's turning to chastize Anna, allows Alfred to kick
     Hawk back against a wall.  Alfred lunges out with his
     blade, hitting the wall off-angle.  Hawk yanks the shaft.
     Alfred goes with the flow and presses the shaft on Hawk's
     throat.

     Gasping, Hawk looks to a rip in Alfred's shirt and sees
     a hinge and lever on the shaft.  With an all or nothing
     jerk, Hawk flicks the lever.  The shaft clicks on the
     hinge.

     Alfred's greater strength and narrower grip makes it fold
     away from Hawk and suddenly it is Alfred's throat which
     is caught in the V-shaped trap!  The momentum of the
     sudden change makes Alfred stumble towards the wall until
     the point of the "V" hits it--

                              HAWK
               Don't lose your head over this.

     Hawk takes the six foot steel pole and gives a Babe Ruth
     swing right onto the V.  The blades slam together and
     POP ALFRED'S HEAD OFF, SENDING IT SCREAMING DISEMBODIED,
     HIGH IN THE AIR.

     ALFRED'S SCREAMING HEAD P.O.V.

     Hawk and Anna are seen waving up to the viewer (Alfie's
     head).

                              HAWK
               Excuse my crass American humor.

     The machine thunders with another explosion.

     THE DA VINCI WORKSHOP

     Hawk and Anna rush into the Da Vinci workshop.  She
     guiltily touches the surface wound on his arm.  He
     delicately takes the gun from her and laughs until he
     sees...

     BUNNY THE DOG!! standing in the open mouth of the
     workshop.  Anna turns to Hawk...

                              ANNA
               Allow me.

     Anna confidently moves toward the dog until Bunny leaps
     up and savagely clamps his teeth into her throat sending
     her crashing to the ground.

     Hawk pauses in disbelief before raising the gun.

     Bunny continues to viciously gnaw away on the convulsing
     Anna, blood gently starts to emerge.

     Hawk can't get off a shot.  He throws down the gun in
     exasperation.  It lands next to The Gadget that is
     connected to the Tennis Ball Machine.  Hawk rushes
     forward, picks up the gadget, turns the dial to Ten, and
     then smiles sweetly toward the dog.

                              HAWK
               Oh Bunny, Ball-Ball.

     Bunny stops his violent behavior and perkily looks up
     blood droplets drizzling from his mouth.

     Hawk slams down on the gadget.

     A tennis ball comes rocketing out of the machine.

     Bunny leaps and catches the rocketing ball but the force
     of it sends him FLYING AND CRASHING out a window.

     Hawk pulls up Anna as the machine completely EXPLODES.

     A huge chunk of the roof THUDS before the workshop door.

     Hawk suddenly looks off-camera and smiles.  Anna shakes
     her head vigorously.  He pulls her out of the frame.

     EXT. A VINCI COUNTRYSIDE TREE

     A man awakens from a nap and pulls up his hat.  It is THE
     TRAVELING JUGGLER WITH THE UNFORGETTABLY ETCHED FACE.

     He pulls his three red balls from a pouch on his mule.
     He begins a stoic juggle when another loud BOOM sends him
     to the ground.

     EXT. OUTSIDE THE GRAND CASTLE--DAY

     An explosion of steam and gas blows out the windows!
     Debris frisbees toward the camera along with....

     Anna, hanging on Hawk's waist, and Hawk, hanging from
     the bar on DA VINCI'S BAT WINGED GLIDER.

     The glider gracefully swooshes down through the castle -
     through the glorious vista.

     EXT. THE ROAD TO THE CASTLE

     The glider floats to a perfect landing before the
     Unforgettable Juggler.

                             JUGGLER
                         Che pazzo....

     Hawk and Anna collect themselves and look up to the smoke
     billowing castle.  They smile and gush in relief.  They
     wrap arms around the confused but warming up Juggler and
     laugh again.

     A SMALL PIAZZA

     The mule trots into a small storybook piazza in the hush
     of dawn.  Hawk, Anna, and the unforgettable Juggler ride
     atop it.

     A WOMAN WITH AN UNFORGETTABLY ETCHED FACE moves to a cafe
     table with a luminous smile.  She unfolds a table cloth
     atop it and then mystically sets down two cappuccinos.

     Hawk and Anna dismount, thank the Juggler, then cozy into
     the table.

                             HAWK
               Have I ever told you the world is
               beautiful...
                       (semi-seductively)
               I'd really like to play
               Nintendo with you, or something...

                             ANNA
               Hudson, I'm afraid I'm sticking
               with God.
                       (smiling)
               But you're a close second, tough
               guy.  What is that smile?

                             HAWK
                       (broadly grinning)
               I got my planet back.

     Hawk puts on a pair of sunglasses that look exactly like
     the ones Da Vinci wore in the opening and raises his cup.

                             HAWK
               The first one's for Alex.  Cheers.

     The viewer's viewpoint moves into Hawk's lips having a
     sip of that damn unmasculine European coffee.

                                                FADE OUT.

          FOUR MONTHS LATER...   
                         

                         

                         FADE IN

          A BARREN LANDSCAPE
          beneath slate-grey sky. Frigid rock and stunted trees fall to an
          ice-choked coast. Congealed sea on a desolate beach.

          MARKO ALEXANDROVICH RAMIUS
          bare-headed in cold wind, studies the inclement coast. Bottomless
          eyes move slowly across the landscape, missing nothing.

          SUPER: POLWARNY INLET
          Soviet Submarine Base on the Barents Sea
          500 mi north of Murmansk
          Ramius wears a tar black winter uniform of Captain First Rank in
          the Soviet Navy. Behind him, out of sight, someone SPEAKS:

                         VOICE (OS)
          Cold this morning, Captain.
          Ramius shivers. When he replies, he speaks not about the weather,
          but of the land:

                         RAMIUS
          It is cold.

                         (BEAT)-
          And hard.
          Turning his back on the icy coast, Ramius smi-I fondly at the man
          who just spoke to him

          CAPTAIN SECOND., RANK VASILY BORODIN
          Ramius' executive officer, also in black uniform. Borodin's rigged
          with a mike. , Brass .buttons gambol in his Nubian cap like money.

                         RAMIUS (CONT'D)
          e your head a bit. No need to
          crowd him.

                         BORODIN

                         (INTO MIKE)
          Come left three degrees. Make your
          course three-four-zero. Sonar, let
          me know when we pass fifty, fathoms.
          A HELMSMAN responds on a SPEAKER in the SAIL. Nautical CROSS
          TALK. Orders GIVEN and AFFIRMED. Pulling back, Ramius and
          Borodin are revealed standing atop

                         

                         

                         

                         

          THE RED OCTOBER
          a huge submarine, trading a gigantic rudder a hundred yards aft
          her sail. A patrol BOAT and ICEBREAKER escort her to sea. On
          SPEAKERS in the SAIL:

          Captain, political off=er Putin requests
          permission to come to the bridge.

                         (GLANCING AT

                         BORODIN)
          Granted.

                         BORODIN
          (under his breath)
          Think of it, Comrade.. .son of only a
          humble mM worker...

                         RAMIUS
          Quiet as grass, Vastly. Quiet as grass.
          (louder, turning)
          Good morning, Comrade political off=er

          IVAN YURIEVICH PUTIN
          block-faced, forties, pink-necked, political officer assigned to Red
          October, clambers through the hatch into the air, wheezing:

                         PUTIN
          Ah,, Captain, every time I climb that
          ladder, I realize what an over-fed
          ox rve become.
          Put in smiles. Ramius smiles back, but his eyes are cold. Suddenly,
          there's not a lot of Lave on the bridge:

                         PUTIN (CONT'D)

                         (EXPANSIVELY)
           Such a glorious day. So exciting to
          h t ally put the land behind us and
          be on our way.

                         (TO RAMIUS)

          Me, a man of such humble birth, whose
          father was only a mill. worker. Think
          of it, comrades, a mill worker.
          Borodin CHUCKLES. Putin stares at him. Borodin covers with a

                         

                         

                         

                         
          COUGH. Putin keeps starring. Flushed, Borodin looks away. Putin
          turns porcine eyes on Ramius:

                         PUTIN (CONT'D)

                         (TURNING)
          Your father was a Lithuanian, was
          he not, Captain?

                         RAMIUS
          You know he was.

                         PU TIN
          I knew a Lithuanian once...
          His words hang like rotten fru

                         PUTIN (CONT'D)
          ...though I'm sure your father was
          nothing like him. Pefmisrdon to go
          below?
          Smirking, Putin leaves. Ramius watches him go. SPEAKERS in the

          it's time, Captain.
          St M dealing with Putin's exit, Ramius turns away from the hatch,
          contemplating the shore. After a beat, softly:.

                         RAMIUS
          We go.

                         BORO DIN

          Captain coming below. Of cer of
          the deck, make signal to escort:.
          Ramius and. Borodin disappear. Red October prepares to dive. All
          that remains is icy .sea and the Sand. Then, faintly at first, from
          the frozen coast:

          A RED ARMY CHORUS
          rises into the swirling sky. It seems to come from everywhere, the
          rocks, the trees, the sea itself. Red October dives. The screen
          fades to black and a giant title appears:

          THE HUNT FOR RED OCTOBER
          CHORUS BOOMS. Male VOICES ring in thundering tribute to the
          heart and soul of mother Russia. Credits keep rolling. Then, from

                         THE DARKNESS

                         A LITHOGRAPH
          of John Paul Jones fighting the Serapis appears. It's on the wall. in
          a cluttered study. Books crowd every bit of space. Photos, models
          and nautical memorabilia, everywhere.

          THROUGH A WINDOW
          an English suburb in drizzling rain. Red Army CHORUS SINGS
          SOFTLY. In a driveway, a late model ROVER waits, lights on,
          engine running. At a messy desk

                         JACK RYAN
          early-thirties, good-Looking, disheveled and harried, stuffs papers
          into a brief case. Slamming it shut, he reaches for his raincoat.

                         BEHIND HIM

          A LITTLE GIRL
          appears in the doorway. Her name is Sally. She's Ryan's
          daughter. Wearing a nightgown with butterflies on it, she's
          carrying a well-worn Koala bear:

                         SALLY
          Daddy?

                         RYAN

                         (TURNING)
          Hey.., What are you doing up?
          You're suppose to be sleeping.

                         SALLY
          I can't.
          Kneeing beside: her, Ryan talks in a steady unpatronizing way. He
          loves her to death:

                         RYAN
          What's the matter?

                         SALLY
          Where are you going?

                         RYAN
          I have to go on a business trip and you
          have to go to sleep or when you grow up
          you'll only be two inches tall.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         SALLY
          Stanley keeps waking me up.
          Stanley is Sally's bear. Ryan talks to it like it was alive.
          it makes Sally grin.

                         RYAN
          What's the matter, Stanley? Are you
          nuts or something?

          But about twenty-one boats out of San
          Diego, including one way out at Pearl,
          starts hearing Pavarotti Doming out their
          ass. Jonesy has turned the whole fucking
          Pacific Ocean into a stereo speaker.

          Beaumont's LAUGHS. Even Jones sm Ies. Then, a flashing light on
          the. sonar display catches his eye. He starts flipping switches.
          Beaumont sobers:: up:

                         JONES
          Be sti 1, I got it.
          Jones works in silence, then punches the intervom:

          Conn, sonar.

          Captain, aye. What is it Jonesy?

                         JONES
          Distant contact, submerged bearing zero-
          nine-seven. It's a wild guess, but I'd
          say we had a Boomer headed out of the barn.

          IN THE COMMAND CENTER
          forward of sonar, sailers drive the ship beneath a maze of pipes and
          equipment. At the center of the Conn, surrounded by fire control,
          quartermaster, helm :

          CAPTAIN BARTOLOMO MANCUSO
          skipper of the DaZa, early-forties, muscular body encased in a blue
          jumpsuit, works the intercom on the periscope plat6arm:

                         MANCUSO
          Start a plot, Jonesy. IM be there
          in a second.
          Leaving the deck, Mancuso glances at his executive offker

          LIEUTENANT PHIL THOMPSON
          thirties, dark complected, standing at fire control:

                         IN SONAR
          Jones is already working on the plot. In font of him on the sonar
          display, the flashing light is starting to move. Mancuso sticks his
          head in.

                         MANCUSO
          What do you have?

                         CUT TO:

                         RAMIUS
          in Red October's Conn. Much larger than the control center on the
          Dallas. Leaving the deck, Ramius heads aft, glancing at Borodin:

                         RAMIUS
          When you see Putin, tell him that when
          it's convenient, 191 be in my stateroom.
          Leaving the Conn, Ramius enters

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         A HALLWAY
          Moving past a radio compartment on his left, Ramius stops at a door,

                         ENTERING THE

                         CAPTAIN'S STATEROOM
          C3osing the door behind him, Ramius turns into the room.
          Surprised, he sees

                         PU TIN
          seated at a desk, reading a bible. Startled, Putin looks up:

                         RAMIUS
          What are you doing?

                         PT TIN
          It's my responsibility to oversee the
          stability of the crew, Captain. You
          know that.

                         RAMIUS
          And you accomplish this by searching
          through my papers and invading my
          privacy?

                         PUTIN
          There is no such thing as privacy in
          the Soviet Union, Comrade. It's
          antithetical to the oal]ective good.
          Suppressing his anger, Ramius moves to a locker, changing into
          dungarees. He can fiee]. Putin's weasel eyes crawling up and down
          his back. Holding the bible, Put in muses:

                         PUTIN (CONT'D)
          You. surprise me, Captain. A man in your

                         RAMIUS
          The book belonged to my wife. I
          keep it only for sentimental value.

                         PUTIN
          Your wife was a beautiful woman. A
          tragedy her life was cut so short.

                         PUTIN
          (trying to joke)
          Given the amount of fire power on Red
          October, I'm sure the whole world will.
          breathe a cm1 eotive sigh of relief.

                         RAMIUS

                         (LKE ICE)
          How many more agents does the KGB
          have on my boat?

                         PUTIN

                         (STANDING)
          Captain, this is not your boat. It
          belongs to the Union of the Soviet
          Socialist Republics. You would be
          well advised to remember that.

                         (RAMIUS BLANCHES)
          Anyway, I am only a political odfioer.
          If the KGB has an agent on board,
          I would be the last to know.

                         RAMIUS
          I suggest we open our orders.

                         PUTIN
          As you wish.
          There's a safe on the wall. Ramius spins the combination. Inside,
          another safe with four locks. Both Ramius and Putin have keys.
          Inside the second safe, a large envelope.
          it has an ornate. scarlet seal, marked 'Top Secret'. Ramius cracks
          the seeal, removing four pages of operation orders. Glancing at
          Putin; he reads:

                         RAMIUS
          We are to proceed to grid 54-90 and
          rendezvous with the Akula submarine,
          Konovalov.

          Captain Tupalev's boat.

                         RAMIUS
          You know Tupolav?

          line of aril rats and that he was a
          student of yours. it is rumored, he
          has no love in his heart for you. Why
          is that?
          Ramius pours two cups of steaming tea from a silver pot on a
          serving tray, offering it to Putin.. Putin takes the cup.

                         RAMIUS
          There is no room in Tupolev's heart
          for anyone or anything except Tupolev.

                         (READING)
          Having made contact, we are ordered
          to run a series of drfl1 . Tupolev
          w2l hunt us while we test our ship.
          Putting down his tea, Putin stands, suddenly formal, awkwardly

                         OBSEQUIOUS:

                         PUTIN
          Captain, this is an historic moment
          for all. of us. I should like to make
          a request.

                         RAMIUS
          Before you do, I want to talk to you
          about something important.

                         PUTIN

                         (NOT HEARING)
          I know that it is not aooording to
          protocxrl, but would you permit me to
          post the orders and inform the crew
          of our mission?

                         RAMIUS

                         (RESIGNED)
          As you wash, Comrade.
          Putin grins, heading for the door. He never makes it. In a sudden
          violent motion,, Ramius kicks Putin's left leg from under him.
          Surprised, the; big man tumbles sideways.
          Leaping to his feet, Ramius catches Putin, slamming him into a
          headlock, driving his thick neck downward, CRACKING his SKULL
          in the SHARP corner of the DESK.
          Putin gags. Cupping his chin, Ramius forces his entire bulk onto
          the man's chest. Putin struggles. His eyes bulge. Ramius strains,
          using all of his strength until..

                         

                         

                         

                         

          PUTIN'S NECK SHATTERS
          and his face goes slack. With surprising gentleness, Ramius lowers
          the shuddering body to the deck. Carefully, he checks the pulse in
          Putin's neck. Dying, Putin stares into Ramius' face.

                         RAMIUS (CONT'D)
          I an sorry my friend. But it is
          cyear to me now. Where I would
          walk, you cannot fallow.
          Whatever his destination, Putin's on his way. Getting up, Ramius
          goes to the desk. Returning with the teapot, he drenches the body
          with scalding tea.
          Replacing the pot on the tray, Ramius puts the orders in a
          wastebasket and sets them on are. Removing a duplicate set of
          orders from his safe, he' places them on the floor by the dead man.
          Satisfied everything is the way he wants it, he moves to an intercom
          and takes a deep breath. Pushing a button, he BELLOWS:

                         PETROV
          This is all very unnerving, Captain.
          The reason for having two missM keys

          early-thfrties, Tupolev's executive officer. This Conn is smaller
          than Red . October's and the weird vibes perfectly reflect the rampant
          paranoia of the Commander:

                         BONAVIA
          Captain Tupolev?

                         TUPOLEV
          What is it2l

                         BONAVIA
          St M no sign of Red October, sir. I
          think we should surface and contact Red
          Fleet Command.

                         TUPOLEV
          To what purpose?

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         BONAVIA
          To inform them Red October has not
          appeared.

                         TUPOLEV
          What makes you think she hasn't?
          Tupolev glides to a quartermaster's station. Following him,
          Bonavia's stomach growls.

                         TUPOLEV
          Has it occurred to you that Red October
          may already be in position? That Ramius
          is merely hiding behind his silent drive?
          Waiting for me to break radio silence
          and make a fool of myself?

                         BONAVIA

                         (FRUSTRATED)

                         BUT -

                         TUPOLEV
          I will not break radio silence. We
          wilt lie here quietly for a few more
          hours. If Ramius hasn't arrived by
          then, I'll contact Red Fleet Command.

                         BONAVIA
          Captain, I am concerned that -

                         TUPOLEV
          I Care little for your concerns, Comrade.
          Tupolev leaves. Bonavia glances at the quartermaster. His stomach
          growls again.

          Left alone, Ryan spot, a lectern at the foot of the tabl. Nearby, a
          yeoman tends a slide machine, an overhead projector and a large
          bulletin board. Ryan heads for the lectern.
          The yeoman has a list of slides, some photos and mustrations.

                         RYAN
          Gentlemen, the last twenty four hours
          have seen some extraordinary Soviet
          naval activity. The first to sail was --

                         (SLIDE)
          this ship, the Red October. A variant
          of the typhoon class, she's some six
          hundred fifty feet long. Thirty-two
          thousand tons submerged displacement,
          roughly the size of a World War II
          aircraft Carrier.

                         (BEAT)
          Unlike the standard typhoon, equipped
          to fire long-range missiles from Russian
          waters, Red October carries fifty-six
          SS-311s, which is a short-range attack
          mis it with eight independent warheads.
          That's four hundred forty-eight warheads
          all spedfically designed to fire close in.

                         (ANOTHER SLIDE)
          We believe these doors on the bow, and
          here again on the stern, enclose a
          magneto-hydrodynamic drive, or caterpillar,
          which may allow the sub to run totally
          silent.

                         (ANOTHER SLIDE)
          it is possible this new drive system
          allowed the captain, a man named Marko

                         RAMIUS -
          Ryan points out two photos on a bulletin board. One is of Ramius
          alone. The other is a wedding photo of Ramius and a beautiful
          woman.

                         RYAN (CONT'D)
          to elude one of ' our attack boats,
          the Dallas, which trailed Red October
          f r om harbor this morning.

                         (POINTKUY)
          This drive, if it's working, could
          render Red October invvsihl8 to our
          SOSUS warning nets in the Atlantic.

                         PELT
          You would characterize this as a first
          strike weapon, Dr. Ryan?
          Ryan glances at Greer. Greer smi reassuringly.

                         RYAN
          There's no doubt about that, sir. She
          is designed to approach by stealth, and
          fire on a target with little or no warning.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         ADMIRAL
          An offensive weapon. The kind you start
          wars with.

                         RYAN
          Precisely, Admiral..

                         (RE: MAP)
          if I may continue. Shortly after the
          Dallas lost contact, there were additional
          Soviet mailings from Pa tjarny, Leningrad
          and the Mediterranean. The Soviets have

                         SOME --

                         (CHECKING NOTES)
          fifty-eight nuclei submarines headed at
          high speed into the Atlantic. And this
          afternoon's satellite pass over Policjarny
          found head blooms in the engineering plants
          of the Kirov, the Minsk and more than
          twenty cruisers and destroyers,, indicating
          that the bulk of their surface fleet is
          also preparing to sail.
          Flushed, Ryan sits beside Greer. Pelt turns to Greer:

                         PELT
          Conclusions?

                         GREER
          Absence of activity in the Pacific suggest
          this is probably just an exercise having
          nothing to do with the Red October.
          A General starts to object. He's cut off by JUDGE MOORE, a
          white-haired civilian near the top of the table:

          Before sailing, Captain Ramius sent a
          letter to Admiral Yuri Padorin, Chairman
          of Soviet Naval Deployment.
          Painting at Ramius' wedding picture, Ryan whispers to Greer:

                         RYAN
          That's her uncle!

          Ramius' wife. Padorin's her uncle!
          Greer has no idea what Ryan's saying. Moore's still talking:

                         MOORE
          The contents of the letter are unknown,
          but Admiral Padorin immediately demanded
          a meeting with Premier Ligachev and
          within minutes of that meeting, the
          Soviet Fleet sailed with orders to find
          Red October --

          My god. They've got a madman on
          their hands. He's gonna start a war.
          A spirited discussion ensues. Tuning it out, Ryan stares at the
          picture of Ramius and his wife. Urgently, he whispers to Greer:

                         RYAN
          This is the twenty-gird, isn't it?
          Greer nods. Order in the room has broken down. Generals and
          Admirals argue vehemently about appropriate. responses. Staring at
          the photos, a light goes off in Ryan's brain:
          SljenCel. Ryan realizes everyone in the room is staring at him.

          Uhhmm...I was just thinking there
          was perhaps another possibility we
          ought to consider.
          Ryan takes a deep breath.

          Ramius might be trying to defect.
          Nobody moves. Ryan glances at Greer. Greer rolls his eyes. Too
          far out. Ryan's on his own. The.General bristles:

          Well, Ramius trained most of their Officer

          men willing to help him. And he's not

          at a translucent status board in the quartermaster's station on the
          Dalla. Behind the status board, projected on a screen, a nautical
          map of the North Atlantic. Mancuso and Thompson enter.

                         JONES

                         (TO MANCUSO)
          I know you're busy, Captain. But I
          may have something here.

                         MANCUSO
          Go ahead.

                         JONES
          I've been working on a sound I heard
          when the typhoon disappeared. I washed
          it through the tape machine several times
          and managed to isolate it. But when I
          asked the computer to identify it, the
          answer I got. was magma displacement.

                         MANCUSO
          Magma displacement?

                         JONES
          Yes sir. See, the system we are
          using was originally- designed to look
          four seismic events and although we
          adapted it. to hunt for submarines -

                         MANCUSO
          utto the chase, Jonesy._:.,

                         JONES
          Aye, aye, sir. Anyway,; I got curious,
          and. started tracking. the sound on our
          lateral array. I located it four
          different times. The fifth time it
          was gone and I couldn't find it. But
          I want to show you what I worked up.
          Picking up a grease pencil, Jones makes calculations on the status
          board overlaying the nautical map:

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         -48-

                         JONES (CONT'D)
          The first contact was at zero-nine-Been
          hours and the bearing was two-six-nine.

                         (DRAWING LINE)
          Then at zero-nine-thirty hours it was
          bearing two-six-zero. And at zero-nine-
          forty-eight is was two-ive-zero.

                         (ANOTHER LINE)
          I came back to it at about ten-hundred
          and the bearing was two-four-two. The
          last signal was real faint and I didn't
          have a very good lock on it.

                         MANCUSO
          So?

                         JONES
          Well, I figure it couldn't be very far
          away from us, right? Let's say it was
          halfway between us and Iceland. That
          would put it on a course like this.
          Jones makes more calculations on the. status board. Mancuso
          recognizes a pattern:

                         MANCUSO
          Headed directly into Red Route One.

                         JONES
          Exactly. Sir, I believe the sound I
          heard is the acoustical signature of some
          kind of super-quiet Russian submarine and
          he's taking the inshore track off the
          Iceland coast.

                         THOMPSON
          What do you think, captain?
          Mancuso stares-at the status board, then turns to Jones:

                         MANCUSO
          Let me see if I got this straight. The
          three minion dollar computer tells you
          you're chasing after an earthquake and
          you aren't convinced. So you get curious
          and came up with this theory: on your own?

                         JONES

                         (UNCERTAIN)
          Yes, sir.

                         MANCUSO
          Relax, Jonesy. You sold me.
          Jones grans.

          Let me ask you this. If we get close
          to this supers lent sub again, you
          think you can track him down?

                         JONES
          Yes, sir. Now that I know what to
          listen for, I'1 bag the sucker cold.

          TURBOPROPS SHRIEKING, the Foxtrot ROCKETS out of a cloud
          bank at unbelievable speed, leveling off above the racing ocean.

          IN THE FUSELAGE
          of the Foxtrot, Amalric nudges his computer, punching up one

          IN THE SKY
          the Foxtrot chews up the afternoon, a deadly projectile hell bent on
          destruction. Below, the ocean streaks by.

          IN THE FUSELAGE
          of the Foxtrot, preparing to launch his localization pattern, Amalric
          presses a button on his fire control console:

          IN THE SKY
          four sonar buoys exit the belly of the Foxtrot. Trailing parachutes,
          they splash into the ice-cold sea.

          in Red October's Conn, talking in hushed tones with Melekhin and
          Borodin. Oblivious to their conversation, the crew moves about in

          puts down a clipboard. At his quartermaster station, Stadnyuk
          upends, a mess of pencils.

          Ramins and Borodin exchange glances. At his quartermaster station,
          Stadnyuk is paralyzed with fear.

          IN THE FUSELAGE
          of the Foxtrot, Amalrioa wipes his brow, continuing to work his

                         COMPUTER:

          IN THE COCKPIT
          Of the Foxtrot, the copilot runs a final check. Adjusting his
          headset, the pilbt answers Amalric:

          Ask God for forgiveness, Comrade.

          IN THE FUSELAGE
          of the Foxtrot, Ama1ric enters a program on his keyboard. Watching
          it lock in, he announces:

          IN THE SKY
          the Foxtrot levels off. Bomb bay doors inch open, revealing a
          torpedo, sixteen inches in diameter and eight feet long. As the
          plane's nose dips, the torpedo relaasee.
          parachute opening behind, a thousand pounds of doomsday device
          dive earthward at dizzying speed, splashing into choppy sea.

          ON RED OCTOBER
          in the Conn, Ramius listens to SONAR on AUDIO. Faint PINGS
          appear, growing inexorably LOUDER, more FREQUENT, the

          ON RED OCTOBER
          in the Conn, torpedo and counter-measure PING LOUDLY on ship's

          Leaving his quartermaster's station, Stadnyuk stands on shaky legs

          Because American lives are at stake,
          I've been instructed to ask your
          President for precisely that.

                         (SWALLOWING)
          Since you were so adamant about the
          consequences of confusion, I thought
          we might ask him together.

                         PELT
          I understand.
          Pelt picks up the phone.

                         CUT TO:

                         BROKEN SUNSHINE
          dappling a choppy sea. Ice-cold WIND whips whitecapped waves and
          lashes the horizon. The helicopter with Ryan aboard circles into
          view.

          IN THE CHOPPER
          HOWLING. NOISE. PILOT and COPILOT navigate tricky winds.. TWO
          SAILORS crouch by an open door, checking a harness on Ryan.
          Tuiindng to the pi ot, the copilot BELLOWS:

                         PILOT
          OK. Tell them to surface.

                         (RE: RYAN)
          Hook him up! But hurry, we don't
          have much fuel left!
          Sai],or threads cable through a winch by the door. Ryan's white as
          a ghost. NOISE Is DEAFENING. Another saï¿½ar belts a harness to
          Ryan's back.
          Ryan peers down. Wind from the rotors crushes the waves.
          Between his feet, Ryan can see the small white wake from a
          periscope.

          ON THE DALLAS
          in the Conn, Mancuso spins the scope. Thompson watches him.
          Both he and Mancuso wear life jackets:

                         MANCUSO
          Whoever this guy is, he's in far one
          hell of a ride.

                         ( NG)
          Officer of the deck. Surface the ship.
          A flurry of activity in the Conn. The Dallas prepares to surface.
          Mancuso and Thompson move to a hatch by the helm.

          IN THE CHOPPER
          the saftors i nish strapping Ryan into the sling. One of them leans
          forward, painting to a ]ever on Ryan's chest, SHOUTING:

                         SAILOR
          Pull this to release!
          Fighting. panic, Ryan glances down. A mitlion miles below, the sea
          bans- mine-grey.

          ON THE DALLAS
          sail in the Conn work like lightning in cramped quarters. A
          petty afâ¬'lcer straps Mancuso and Thompson into harnesses.

                         MANCUSO
          You got a man dangling at the end of
          a line with no paint of reference and
          helicopter rotors generating enough
          static electak ty that we have to
          ground him or it! l be like grabbing
          a hot wire and if he falls in the water
          the only way to get him out is with divers
          'cause most of the ship's underwater.

                         (PAUSE)
          Fun?

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         THOMPSON

                         (G NING)
          Why I joined the Navy.
          A sager hands Mancuso a phone for the bridge.

                         THOMPSON (CONT'D)
          I put Jonesy in the forward escape
          hatch in case he goes in the drink.

                         MANCUSO
          Good. We got no idea who this guy
          is or why the Navy wants his on
          our boat so bad.

          IN THE CHOPPER
          Teeth chattering, sta:ugg g with deja vu, Ryan is transfixed by, the
          sub-zero ocean. HOWLING WIND and CRASHING ROTORS. Eyes
          wide, he watches

          THE DALLAS RISE
          First the sail, then the foredeck EXPLODE high into the air, finally
          CRASHING back to the WATER.

          ON THE DALLAS
          The COB helps Jones climb into an escape trunk aft of the sail. It's
          cramped and brightly lit. Jones checks his equipment.

          IN THE CHOPPER
          Ryan watches Mancuso and Thompson climb out of the sail onto the
          lurching bridge.The sailer leans close, HOLLERING:

                         SAILOR
          Hang on!
          He trips a laver on the winch. Cable feeds out a few feet Holding
          his breath, Ryan inches into the abyss.

          ON THE BRIDGE
          Mancuso lays binoculars on Ryan. Thompson ties both of them to
          the sail The sub pitches and rolls. Forward and aft are buried
          beneath waves.
          Fingers freezing, Thompson clamps one end of a jumper cable to a
          metal lip on the bridge to ground the sub against static generated
          by the helicopter's rut

                         

                         

                         

                         

          IN THE AIR
          savage WINDS from the chopper's ROTORS start spinning Ryan like
          a top. Desperately, he trams to control the dizzying motion.
          Above, caught in an unexpected wind sheer, the chopper plummets
          seaward. Ryan's line goes slack. Angry sea rushes up at him with
          blistering speed.

          IN THE CHOPPER
          the pilot struggles for control. Behind him, loose equipment SLAMS
          into the WINCH, JAMMING the CABLE. CURSING, the pilot regains
          control. The chopper stabilizes.

          IN THE AIR
          CRACKING like a WHIP, the CABLE goes TAUT. Ryan feels like
          he's been hit with a sledgehammer. Unable to breathe, he RIPS off
          his HELMET.
          A rock in a sling, he tries to get his bearings. Everything's grey.
          Above, the chopper's rotors CHEW the SKY. Help] s, Ryan starts
          swinging like a pendulum.

          ON THE BRIDGE
          Mancuso and Thompson watch Ryan rocket by at Mach 10. A huge
          arc carries him way out over the angry sea. Slowing down, Ryan
          starts to spin again.

                         MANCUSO

                         (SCREAMING)
          See if you can get a ground on his line.
          I'm gonna try and catch the bastard!
          Way out on the horizon, Ryan reaches the end of his arc and starts
          a comet-like ride back at the ship.

          IN THE CROPPER
          the pilot FEATHERS. CONTROLS trying to reduce Ryan's
          mind-boggling-ride. over his shoulder, he BELLOWS:

                         PILOT
          Reel him back in!

                         SAILOR

                         (TRYING)
          The cable's jammed!

                         PILOT
          If they don't pick him up this time,
          we have to cut him Ioxe!

                         

                         

                         

                         
          The sailor keeps trying to rewind the cable. No go. sweating, he
          wraps gloved fingers around the emergency release on the drum.

          IN THE AIR
          Ryan watches the Dallas' saw rush at him with unbelievable speed, a
          towering black monolith on an ubiquitous canvas of grey.

          ON THE BRIDGE
          Thompson readies the ground, holding one end in the air. A wave
          BLASTS the DALLAS.

          THE GROUNDING CABLE
          rips free of the bridge. Surprised, Thompson goes overboard.
          Caught in his harness, he dangles helplessly above the water.
          Mancuso and Ryan reach for each other as Ryan hurtles at the
          bridge. All hell breaks loose:

          A BOLT OF ELECTRICITY
          arcs between their oohed hands. BLITZED, Mancuso is
          KNOCKED hard to his KNEES.

          IN THE CHOPPER,
          the sailor pulls. the release lever, CUTTING the cable. it SLAMS
          back inside like a two ton rubber band.

          IN THE AIR
          unhooked, Ryan sling-shots fifty yards over the pitching bow of the
          Dalyas, disappearing beneath the ice-cold water.

          UNDER THE. WATER
          Bubbles trailing from his mouth, Ryan struggles to free himself from
          the harness.

          ON THE BRIDGE
          a vision of hell, hair blowing in all diYectlons, Mancuso eyeballs the
          spot where Ryan went down, SCREAMING:

                         MANCUSO

                         (INTO PHONE)
          Man overboard!
          Thompson drags himself back onto the bridge.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          IN THE ESCAPE TRUNK
          Jones hears Mancuso's voice BOOMING over SPEAKERS:

                         MANCUSO (VO)

                         (ON SPEAKERS)
          Man overboard! Twenty yards off
          the starboard bow!
          The COB SLAMS the HATCH, turning the trunk into an iron tomb.
          Jones pulls a mask over his eyes, activates his oxygen and drags
          open the exterior hatch.

          SEA WATER THUNDERS
          in, submerging him in Icy stillness. Securing a line to the
          bulkhead, Jones swims out into the swirling brine.

          IN THE AIR
          the chopper banks hard to the left, climbs Into the mist and starts
          circling the Dams.

          IN THE WATER
          free of the harness, Ryan bobs like a cork in the waves. Fifty
          yards away, the keeness sub p bahes violently.

          A ' DIVER
          surfaces next to Ryan. Removing his mouthpiece, Jones BELLOWS
          over the CRASHING SEA:

                         JONES
          Are. you injured!?

                         JONES
          I'm gonna take you in through an
          escape trunk!
          Jones hooks Ryan to the line. Salt stings Ryan's eyes. His,
          breathing's ragged.

          ON THE DALLAS
          BEDLAM in the CONN. STACCATO orders. Mancuso helps
          Thompson through the hatch. Hell on wheels, Mancuso disappears
          down a passageway.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          IN THE WATER
          Jones and Ryan ride waves by the curved hull. of the ship. Jones
          offers Ryan his mouthpiece.

                         RYAN
          Wait a minute!

                         JONES
          Listen, you son-af-a-bit h. I'm only
          gonna tell you once. Stick this fucking
          thing in your mouth and breathe!
          Ryan takes the mouthpiece, inhaling and exhaling rapidly. The
          helicopter circles above. Jones drags Ryan

          UNDER THE WATER
          into bruised silence. Pulling themselves downward along the Dalla
          rolling hull, Ryan and Jones share oxygen.

          IN THE ESCAPE TRUNK
          Ryan and Jones pull themselves inside. Blazing light ignites a fire
          storm of one-caned organisms. Eyes wide, Ryan watches Jones c3 se
          the hatch.
          Jones starts draining the trunk. Everything slows down. Echoes
          REVERBERATE. The water level in the trunk drops and the

          SHRIEK OF PRESSURIZED AIR
          ASSAULTS Ryan's EARDRUMS. Hurling the mouthpiece. away, he
          gulps air in the rapidly draining trunk like a banked trout.

          IN THE HALLWAY
          outside the trunk, Mancuso and crew open the hatch. Tumbling
          out, Ryan stands; on shaky legs, excited, babbling:

                         RYAN
          Jesus Christ! I cant believe it!
          Jesus Christ --Â»

                         MANCUSO
          Take it easy --

                         RYAN
          When I hit the water, it was like Ice.
          I thought I was going to freeze --

                         MANCUSO
          Slow down. You're hypervent it sting.

                         (RYAN BLINKS)
          Now, who are you?

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         RYAN

                         (DISORIENTED)
          Sorry. I'm Jack Ryan. Are you
          Captain Mancuso?
          Mancuso nods. The radioman appears with another message.
          Mancuso rips it open and starts reading it. Ryan rockets into

                         PRESENT TIME:

                         RYAN (CONT'D)
          Captain, we have to find the Red October.
          She's a Russian --

          I already found him, Ryan. Then I

                         (QUIC)DY)
          We have to find him again. The
          Captain is going to defect and -

                         MANCUSO
          What the hell are you yammering about?

                         RYAN
          I have to talk to -

                         MANCUSO
          Mr. Thompson. Get this man some
          dry clothes and coffee.

                         RYAN

                         BUT CAPTAIN

                         MANCUSO
          I'Il be in the Conn.

          JUMP CUT TO:
          at the entrance of the sonar shack, fifteen minutes later. Behind
          him, in the Conn, the crew is preparing to man battle stations.
          Jones has returned to sonar.

                         MANCUSO

                         (TO JONES)
          Any sign that he's alerted to our
          presence?

                         JONES
          No, sir, captain. operating as before.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          Ryan appears in dry clothes. Mancuso ignores him. The of5cer of
          the deck turns to Mancuso:

                         OOD
          Captain. Battle stations are manned.

                         MANCUSO
          Very well.

                         RYAN
          What do you mean battle stations?

                         (URGENTLY)
          Look, I've been authorized by the
          President of the United States to
          talk to the Captain of Red October.
          Mancuso takes the last message from his pocket:

                         MANCUSO
          And I have been ordered to blow him
          out of the water if he stays on a
          course to the United States or
          demonstrates any hostile intentions.

                         RYAN

                         (STUNNED)
          I don't understand.

                         MANCUSO

                         (RE: MESSAGE)
          According to this he's gone bughouse
          and intends to fire his missiles. So
          much f= your defection theory.
          Mancuso hands Ryan the message.. Ryan stares at. it. Mancuso
          turns back to the officer of the deck:

                         MANCUSO (CONT'D)
          Officer of the deck. Make,

                         RYAN

                         (RE: MESSAGE)
          Think about this a second. Naturally
          the Soviets would tall us he is insane.
          They want us to sink him before he has
          an opportunity to defect.

                         JONES

                         (TO MANCUSO)

          The officer of the deck repeats Mancuso's orders. Mancuso and
          Ryan are eyeball-etc-eyeball.. Ryan whispers:

                         RYAN
          Listen to me, Captain. There must
          be some way you can establish contact
          without violating your orders. I'm
          telling you, he wants to defect.

                         (MANCUSO FROWNS)
          If there's ever going to be peace in
          the world somebody has to take a risk.
          Give the man a chance. He's defecting.

          we'll play along.

          ON THE SURFACE
          Grey sky. Frothy sea. Red October's periscope appears. Seconds
          later, three hundred yards away, the Dalla' scope breaks the
          surface.

          ON RED OCTOBER
          Ramius is glued to the eyepiece of his periscope. He spots the
          Dallas' scope in the water. Behind him, sailors are tense, wary.
          Uncomfortable, Borodin sweats at fire control.

          in the Conn, Mancuso is glued to his scope just like Ramius. Ryan
          can hear his heart nq:

          All right, Mr. Ryan. You wanted
          to:. talk to him. There he is. What
          do you want to say?
          Ryan chooses his words carefully. As he does, Mancuso hits a
          periscope light in morse:

          He can do that, can't he?

                         MANCUSO
          He can do that. But is he gonna do
          that?

          ON RED OCTOBER
          in the Conn, Ramius is still at. the scope, watching the light in the
          Dalla' periscope. After a moment, he, glances at Borodin:

                         RAM=S
          Verify the range again.

                         (BEAT)
          Ping one time only.

          ON THE DALLAS
          in the Conn, Mancuso's at the scope. Ryan is scribbling something
          on a pad. Sailors hear a PING. Thompson grins.

                         MANCUSO
          I'D. be dammed.

                         (TO RYAN)
          Now what?

                         (THINKING)
          And ten him to ping again if he agrees.

          ON RED OCTOBER
          in the Conn, Ramius is at the scope, watching the flashing light.
          After a second, he steps back, face white. Finally, he turns to

                         BORODIN:

                         RAMIUS
          Verify the range one more time.

                         RAMIUS
          Give me a sounding, ' Vasily! Ping
          once only.
          Borodin goes to work. Ramius stares at Melekhin. Melekhin frowns.
          What the hell is happening?

          ON THE DALLAS
          in the Conn, Mancuso, Ryan and the crew hear another PING.
          Ryan's ecstatic. Mancuso Isn't.

          Morning of the fourth day
          in engineering, Petrov and Melekhin stand at a sink on the reactor

          Melekhin's in rubber apron, gloves and plastic face shield. Dressed

          He shuts a valve with a large wrench. Turning a page, Petrov

                         READS:

          Melekhin shuts the, valve. Petrov stares at the alarm. Below it, a
          meter is flashing red:

          Do you think they will let me live in
          Montana?

          are several explanations -

                         PETROV
          Listen to me. Radioactive fuel is in

          radiation leak. And if something
          isn't done, we're all going to die! -
          Ramius stands. Suddenly, Petrov remembers where he is. Ramius'
          eyes are bullet holes. Wilting,, Petrov stammers:

                         PETROV (CONT'D)
          Forgive me, Captain. But -

                         RAMIUS
          it's probably a piece of corrosion in
          the pipes. That happens. Now let's
          take' another sample. But quietly.
          We don't want to panic the crew.

          JUMP CUT TO:

                         ENGINEERING
          minutes later. Melekhin and Petrov prepare to draw another sample
          at the sink. Ramius stands behind them. Technicians to the rear.
          Melekhin struggles with the valve:

          ON THE SURFACE
          Red October rises in angry sea. An emergency door on the sail
          opens. Seconds later, a hatch on the missile deck opens also. The
          sea RAGES.
          Climbing out on the deck, Tblllsi and a half a dozen sailors try to
          inflate rafts. Red October PITCHES and ROLLS. Wind HOWLS.
          Frurated, Tbilisi SCREAMS into a headset.

          IN THE CONN
          through the open emergency door, the sea CRASHES. Frightened to
          death, shivering sailors in life preservers line up to leave. Petrov
          counts them. Ramius stands by Sorodin.

          and my officers wall submerge the ship
          and take her elsewhere to scuttle. The
          Americans must never have this boat!
          All Petrov wants do to is get his ass off the boat. At the door,
          Ramius stops him:

                         RAMIUS (CONT'D)
          Doctor. When you get home. You will.

          Petrov splits. Borodin slams the hatch behind him and seals it.

          Submerge the ship.

          ON THE DECK
          the ocean RAGES. Red October sets to submerge. GEYSERS of
          WATER and air EXPLODE hundreds of feet in the sky as she dives.
          The BLOWBACK is STAGGERING.
          Wild-eyed sailors in rubber rafts hang on for their lives. On the
          horizon, Petrov spots the American frigate hurtling forward, light
          flashing.
          A puff of smoke appears, fbnowed by a muted EXPLOSION. The
          frigate's FIRING. As the round comes in, there is an

          EARSPLITTING SHRIEK.
          A hundred yards beyond Red October's bow, the SEA EXPLODES.
          The CONCUSSION and the STORM are mind-bending. Petrov thinks
          the world's coming to an end.
          In the rafts, men slash at ropes binding them to the deck. One by
          one, they drift free of the submerging ship into foaming sea. One
          sailor can't cut his rope. His raft's dragged under.
          Wind HOWLS. The frigate FIRES AGAIN. Another EARSPLITTING
          SHRIEK. Another EXPLOSION. Tons of icy saltwater cascade over
          Petxov's head. -
          Gulping air, Petrov spots the raft and sail r pop back to the
          surface. Red October's sail disappears. Sailors haul freezing men
          from raging water. Hell on earth.

                         CUT TO:

          IN THE HELICOPTER
          on the fwltml of the frigate, PILOT and copilot are strapped into the

          head.

          Copy that. We're on our way.

          IN. THE AIR
          the helicopter rises from the fantail of the frigate. In seconds, it
          passes over Petrov and his companions floating in rubber rafts in
          choppy sea.

          IN Â°THE HELICOPTER
          the pilot glances over his shoulder at a SENSOR OPERATOR working
          a computer behind the copilot:

          Torpedo Inputs?

                         SENSOR OPERATOR
          Set and veri ed as ordered.

          IN THE WATER
          the life rafts converge on the frigate like insects hovering round an
          oversized queen. In one of the rafts, Petrov watches as a net is
          thrown down at him.

          IN THE HELICOPTER
          the p eyeballs the sea as it races by. Speaking into a mike:

          Roger that, Bravo One. Five hundred
          yards to the drop paint. Torpedo is

          IN THE CIC
          aboard the fcigate, Curry turns to one of the shadows:

          Seahawk One reports torpedo armed
          and ready to fire. Requests final
          authorization to drop.

          IN THE RAFTS
          Petrov and the others climb the nets. Halfway up, the doctor stares
          back at the helicopter hovering in the distance.

          IN THE AIR
          thirty feet above the water, the helicopter releases a torpedo in the
          area where Red October went down.

          ON THE FRIGATE
          Petrov climbs onto the fantail. U.S. sailors are waiting with coffee
          and blankets. Fuming, Petrov confronts an officer:

                         PETROV
          I protest! What authority do you
          have to fire? I protest!

          IN THE CIC
          Curry coordinates information. AIL around him, men work intensely.
          Curry turns to one of the shadows:

                         CURRY
          Seahawk One reports torpedo is launched
          and running normally at forty knots.

          Four hundred yards from drop paint.
          Eight hundred yards. Twelve hundred
          yards.
          One of the shadows leans forward and presses a button on Curry's
          console. The button is marked Command Control Detonate. The

                         SHADOW IS

                         ADMIRAL GREER
          in a white uniform and cap. Beside him, Skip Tyler, leans on his
          cane, concentrating on Curry's display.

          IN THE HELICOPTER
          Pilot studies the sea. Suddenly, it BULGES. Loud CONCUSSION.
          Shock WAVE. A giant mushroom cap rises from the depths as gas
          bubbles vent.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          ON THE FANTAIL
          Petrov watches in horror as a huge concave impression vents below
          the helicopter. A huge plume of gas and water erupts skyward.

          IN THE CIC
          aboard the frigate, Curry turns to Greer:

                         CURRY
          Torpedo has detonated.

                         GREER
          And you understand, Lieutenant. I
          was never here. That torpedo did not
          self-destruct. It hit the target. Right?

                         (CURRY NODS)
          Now, Contact the Dallas and tell them
          to proceed.
          Curry nods.

                         CUT TO:

                         MANCUSO
          in the Conn aboard the Dallas with Thompson. Mancuso has a .45 in
          a holster on his belt. Thompson reads a message:

                         MANCUSO
          OK. Now comes the weird part.
          Thompson fo lows Mancuso out of the Conn into

                         A PASSAGEWAY
          running aft. Mancuso and Thompson move at speed. Mancuso is far

          But the orders are specific.

                         THOMPSON
          We're gonna be f ne.
          Rounding a corner, they start

                         

                         

                         

                         

          DOWN A LADDER
          Thompson will never get over how fast Mancuso can move. Aren't
          guys that big supposed to be slow?

                         MANCUSO
          This has got to be the craziest stunt
          I've ever heard of. There's only about
          two ml]]k n things that can st]l. go wrong.
          At the bottom of the ladder, they enter

                         A PASSAGEWAY
          Ahead of them Jones and Ryan wait by a ladder beneath an open
          hatch. Like Mancuso, Jones is armed. Jones starts up the ladder.
          Ryan follows. Mancuso turns to Thompson:

                         MANCUSO
          Listen. If anything --

                         THOMPSON
          Captain. We'll be all right.
          Mancuso climbs up the ladder, disappearing through the hatch.
          Thompson closes it.

                         CUT TO:

          Behind them, Jones, Ryan and Mancuso climb up through a hatch.
          Jones shuts it. Steiner speaks into a headset::

                         (BEAT)
          Hit the running lights.

          IN THE WATER
          -black on black. Then, in a single blinding flash of light

          THE RED OCTOBER
          is revealed. Hovering above it, floodlights blazing, the DSRV.
          Descending, it locks onto a hatch by the sail.

          IN THE DSRV
          Copilot turns to Steiner:

                         COPILOT
          We have a seal. Skirt is dry.

                         STEINER
          Roger. Open the hatch.
          Getting up, the copilot heads for the hatch.

                         MANCUSO
          Wait.
          Copilot stops. Reaching into his jacket, Mancuso offers Ryan a .45.

                         RYAN

                         (EYEING PI- )
          He's defecting.

                         MANCUSO
          And he can't change his mind?

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         RYAN
          He's not going to change his mind.

                         MANCUSO
          Willing to bet your life on that.'
          Ryan stares at the pistol. Sighing, he puts it in his jacket.
          Copilot opens the hatch. In the gloom below, another hatch.
          Copilot raps on it. Somebody opens the lower hatch. Mancuso,
          Jones and Ryan climb down into

          THE RED OCTOBER
          on a ladder at the forward end of the Conn. Waiting for them,
          Ramins, Borodin and all the other of Awkward silence.
          Nervous, Borodin drags out a cigarette and lights it. Unexpectedly,

                         RYAN- SMI1 :

                         RYAN
          Russian Cigarette?

                         (BORODIN NODS)
          Could I try one?
          Mancuso frowns. Borodin offers Ryan a cigarette. Kamarov has a
          light. Ryan inhales and COUGHS:

                         RYAN (CONT'D)

                         (GAGGING)
          Jesus...
          Poking fun, Ryan rolls his eyes. Borodin grins. Ramius
          The ice is broken. Men shake hands.

                         RAMIUS

          Before I go any further, I want to know
          whose idea is this impos.ih18 plan?

                         MANCUSO

                         (TO RYAN)
          Amazing. our intention was to publicly
          surrender this boat and request asylum.
          it never occurred to us there would be
          a way you could keep it. The idea to
          stage a radiation leak was inspired --

                         (FROWNING)
          You look familiar. Do I know you,
          Commander?

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         RYAN
          You have a good memory, Captain. We
          meet briefly years ago. But I'm not
          a naval commander. I work for the CIA.

                         RAMIUS

          CIA?

                         RYAN
          Easy, Captain. I'm not an agent. I'm
          just an analyst.

          I write books.
          Suddenly, HIGH SPEED SCREWS passing over the HULL:

                         KAMAROV
          Torpedo! Americans are shooting at us.

                         JONES
          Wrong. Ours growl. Yours whine. It's
          Russian!

          Agitated, Curry works his computer.

          What do you mean there's another torpedo?
          Where in hell did it come from?

          Come on, Mancuso, move it. Get the
          hell out of there.

          ON RED OCTOBER
          BEDLAM in the Conn. Tba'lisi and Jones are on their way to sonar.
          Ramius SHOUTS at Melekhin:

                         RAMIUS

          Get that damn thing off my boat.
          Mancuso's halfway up the ladder. He spots Steiner peeking down at

                         HIM:

                         STEINER
          I think somebody just shot a torpedo

          Where am I supposed --
          Mancuso SLAMS the HATCH. Scrambling down the ladder, Mancuso
          hears Ramius bel]Dwing at Borodin who is manning the helm:

          No, Vasily. I need you in fire control.
          We must track whoever's out there.
          Borodin heads for fre control. Ramius tosses Ryan into the chair
          behind the helm :

                         RAMIUS (CONT'D)

          Stunned, Ryan grabs the helm. Jones and Tbilisi, must have made it
          to sonar. Speakers CRACKLE:

                         JONES (VO)

                         (ON SPEAKERS)
          Steady bearing to the weapon. Still
          zero-two-zero. Range about seven
          thousand yards.

                         RAMIUS

                         (TO RYAN)
          Turn that helm to the left until the
          dial says course zero-two-zero.

                         MANCUSO
          No! That's wrong. Ryan, don't turn
          that goddam wheel!
          Ryan stares at Mancuso then at Ramius. Deciding, he turns the
          helm left, coming to course zero-two-zero.

                         RYAN

                         (TOO MANCUSO)

                         (TO RAMIIUS)
          You're heading straight into that torpedo.

                         RAMIUS
          I know.

          IN THE CIC
          aboard the frigate. Helms, Greer and Tyler lean over the

          Thompson's still outside the sonar shack. The COB's at Fare

                         THOMPSON
          Why is he heading into the torpedo?
          Is he trying to kill himself?

                         COB
          Mr. Thompson. We have a solution on the

                         (HOARSELY)
          I wrote a biography on Admiral Halsey,
          called, Fighting Sailor. It was about
          tam in combat --

                         JONES (VO)

                         (ON SPEAKERS)
          Ten seconds.

          I know this book. I have read some
          parts of it.

                         (RYAN BLINKS)
          Your conclusions were wrong, Ryan.
          Halsey acted stupidly.
          CRASH. The Conn ROCKS. Sound of TORPEDO BREAKING UP.
          Metal SCRAPES along the SHIP. Realizing what's going on:

                         - MANCUSO
          I'll be dammed.

                         RYAN
          What happened?

                         MANCUSO
          Combat tack, Mr. Ryan. By turning
          into the torpedo,, Ramius closed the
          distance before it could arm itself.
          I never would have thought of it.

                         RYAN
          So we're safe?

                         RAMIUS
          Not yet. Right now, the Soviet Captain,
          a man named Tupolev is removing the
          safety features on all his weapons.
          He won't make the same mistake twice.
          Behind Ramius, Ryan spots a SHADOW at the rear of the Conn. He
          can't believe his eyes. The goddam shadow has a pistol in hand.

                         SUDDENLY:

                         

                         

                         

                         

          A FIRE STORM
          of GUNFIRE sprays the CONN. Everybody scatters. Borodin is
          HIT. SLAMMING into the bulkhead, he falls in a seated position,
          eyes wide.
          Fire control panel EXPLODES. Behind a console, Mancuso drags out
          his .45 and RETURNS FIRE. The shadow disappears.

          ON THE DALLAS
          Beaumont rips off his headgear, turning to Thompson in the sonar
          shack's door, breathing hard:

                         BEAUMONT

          ON THE KONOVALOV
          in the Conn, Tupa]av is furious. He YELLS at Bonavia:

                         TUPOLEV
          Hurry up goddammit! I want all the
          enabling devices disconnected!

          Captain, I cannot go any faster.

          ON RED OCTOBER
          in the Conn, cars crawl from hiding. Sparks ERUPT from
          WIRES. Fire contra is history. Ramius leans over Borodin:

                         BORODIN
          I would have like to have seen Montana.
          And the Indians.

          He dies. RAGING, Ramius POUNDS the BULKHEAD. Kamarov
          notices a light on a panel:

                         KAMAROV
          He's in the missile compartment!

                         RAMIUS

          The ship is yours.

                         MANCUSO
          But the control is blasted to hell.
          I can't shoot.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         RAMIUS
          Then get behind him and stay there.
          Don't let him put you in his sights
          or we're all dead.
          Mancuso tosses Ramius his .45. Catching it, Ramius splits. Ryan
          follows.

                         CUT TO:

                         TUPOLEV
          a caged tiger in the Conn on the Konovalov. Bonavia turns, looking
          back at him :

          Left full rudder. T11 shake him loose.

          ON RED OCTOBER
          in a passageway outside a door to the missile compartment, Ramius
          and Ryan hug the bulkhead:

                         RAMIUS
          He'll break into a panel and short
          -circuit the wiring on a missile. We'll
          be blown to pieces.
          Taking a deep breath, Ryan follows Ramiais into the

                         MISSILE COMPARTMENT
          coming face-too-face with a BARRAGE of GUNFIRE. Ramius is HIT.
          Ryan drags him into a space behind an electrical panel. Mercifully,
          the shooting STOPS.
          Ryan checks Ramius. His shoulder's a mess. Mind riling, Ryan
          studies his surroundings. He's never felt so alone.
          The compartment is vast, dominated by twenty tussle tubes six feet

                         

                         

                         

                         
          in diameter. Overhead, a catwalk. At the aft end, somebody's
          working with a wrench.

                         RAMIUS
          We must stop him before he gets into
          a panel..
          Ryan stares at Ramius. Ramiii isn't gonna stop anybody.
          Resigned, Ryan finds the .45 Mancuso gave him in his pocket,

                         MUMBLING:

                         RAMIUS
          Be careful what you shoot at in here,
          Ryan. The compartment is very sensitive.
          In a daze, Ryan starts walking aft, still MUMBLING:

                         RYAN
          Be careful what you shoot at, Ryan.

          The ship turns. Wall becomes cuing. Grabbing the catwalk, Ryan

          IN THE WATER
          the DAIlas heads for the surface. Counter-measures head for the
          bottom. The incoming torpedo chases the counter-measures,
          disappearing into the abyss.

          ON THE SURFACE
          The Da11a ERUPTS from the WATER at THIRTY DEGREES, her
          bottom exposed well aft of the sail. A broaching behemoth, she
          CRASHES back into the sea, DISPLACING TONS of WATER.

          ON THE FRIGATE
          neither Soviet nor American sailors on the fantail can believe their
          eyes. Peirov's jaw drops. Has the entire world gone completely
          insane?.

          ON RED OCTOBER
          in the missile compartment, blood pounding, Ryan leans flat against
          a missile tube. On the other side of the tube, METAL fans on

          CONCRETE.
          Rounding the tube, Ryan holds the .45 at arm's length. Kneeling
          before him, directly in front of an open panel on the missale bay is a
          Sovvet sail or with crazy eyes:

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         IT'S LOGINOV
          the cook's assistant who witnessed the Putin key exchange. He's
          got a hot wire in each hand. Time stands sthl. Ryan stares at
          Loginov. Loginov stares back.
          There's something in the Loginov's eyes, an uncompromising,
          irrational vi lainy that asks no forgiveness. For a moment, Ryan's
          paralyzed, a rabbit before a cobra.
          Deliberately, Loginov begins to move his hands together, bringing
          the wires closer. Ryan tri es to speak. He can't. Loginov's grin
          cracks wide like a rotten egg.

                         RYAN FIRES
          Flame LEAPS from the BARREL of the .45. The pistol KICKS like a
          MULE. Loginov is delivered to eternity. Impotent, the wires fall to

                         (BEAT)
          Andre...
          Lysenko sits, hat in hand. Finally, he averts his gaze.

          JUMP CUT TO:

                         A DRIVER
          standing beside a limousine outside the Executive Office Building.
          Fuming, Lysenko approaches. The driver smiles. Not a good idea.

                         LYSENKO SNARL:

                         LYSENKO
          Shut up! Don't speak to me Boris. Don't
          ever speak to me unless I speak to you
          first. And wipe that smile off your face!
          Lysenko pBe into the limo, slamming the door as hard as he can.
          Locked inside, he starts shouting and hitting things.

                         CUT TO:

                         BRIGHT MOONLIGHT
          on the tree studded bank of a large coastal river. A gentle breeze
          touches the trees and punctuates the silence. Crickets and frogs
          sing on the shore:

                         

                         

                         

                         

          SUPER: ORICOKE RIVER

                         PAMLICO SOUND

                         NORTH CAROLINA

          THE RED OCTOBER
          glides quietly up the river's surface. Ramius and Ryan stand on
          the sail. Behind them, two junior officers, one American and one
          Russian, Conn the ship:

                         RYAN
          We're two hundred miles from the nearest
          naval base.

                         RAMIUS
          Interesting notion, hiding a submarine
          in a river.

                         (EYEING SHORE)
          How do you know this place?

                         RYAN
          I grew up not far from here.

                         (PAINTING)
          My grandfather taught me to f5sh right
          over there on that rock.
          Ramius spots a large rock on the shore. So warm and inviting, this
          land, when compared to the bitter cold coast he ]eft a ]ifetl,me ago.
          Ram hl studies Ryan in the stillness:

                         RAMIUS
          There is one question you have not
          asked me.

                         RYAN
          Why?

                         (RAMIUS NODS)
          I assumed you would speak when you were
          ready.

                         RAMIUS
          We. are standing on part of the reason.
          I've spent my life preparing to fight a
          war I hoped would never happen. This
          ship was not built to fight such a war.
          it was built to start one.

                         (BEAT)
          And there were personal reasons.

                         RYAN
          Your wife?

                         RAMIUS

                         (NODDING)
          it started there, perhaps.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          Ramius glances at the rock. Beside it, a muskrat drops quietly into
          the water.

                         RAMIUS (CONT'D)
          Or perhaps it was something that started
          long ago...

                         RYAN
          Fishing?

                         RAMTUS
          Fishing.
          Taking a deep breath, Ramius studies the surrounding hills. Lights
          from farms twinkle in the night air.

                         RAMIUS (CONT'D)
          "The sea will, grant each man new
          hope, as sleep doth dream of home."
          (on Ryan's look)
          Christopher Columbus.
          Ryan smilm.

                         RYAN

                         (QU`EDY)
          Welcome to the new world, sir.

                         DISSOLVE TO:

                         A STEWARDESS
          walking down the aisle of an airplane, checking passengers.
          Stopping near the front of the cabin, she glances down at

                         RYAN
          sound asleep in his seat, empty tea cup on a tray beside him. A
          blanket hangs on one log. In the seat next to him

          A TEDDY BEAR
          smi> out at passing clouds. The bear's got a red ribbon round his
          neck-and a seat belt fastened over his bulging tummy.

          Covering Ryan with the blanket, the stewardess leaves. Tea cup
          RATTLES. Ryan doesn't even twitch. Turbulence is a thing of the
          past.

                         FADE OUT

                         THE END

    LONDON 2007.. NOW


1   EXT   NIGHT   URBAN TERRACE                                1

    A row of rundown terrace houses. Some are boarded up. Not all
    the street lights work. Those that do cast shadows of parked
    vehicles glistening in the rain.

    A front door opens and DON appears with rubbish which he puts
    in a bin. He hears something and looks up to see four big
    horses pulling a hulking great wagon down the middle of the
    street. The wagon is a gigantic windowless box. The horses
    are harnessed and there are reins but no sign of a driver.
    It's a very weird sight. DON, unable to take his eyes off
    this amazing apparition shouts back into the house from where
    light from a TV flickers.

                        DON
              Carol!... Carol!

                           CAROL (V.O.)
              What?

                        DON
              Come here! Quick!

                        CAROL (V.O.)
              What is it?

                           DON
              Quick!

                        CAROL (V.O.)
                  (irritated)
              I'm trying to watch this! It's the
              last episode!

                        DON
                  (annoyed)
              Come here!!!

    CAROL appears in the doorway.

                        CAROL
              What is it?

    But the wagon and horses have gone.

                           DON
              It's gone!




                                                      (CONTINUED)

                                                                 2.
1   CONTINUED:                                                  1


    CAROL, disgusted, swats him on the head with the flat of her
    hand and goes back inside.


2   EXT/INT   NIGHT    PARKED CAR IN STREET                       2

    A YOUNG COUPLE are snogging in the back of a parked car.
    Music is playing on the radio.

    They are interrupted by heavy vibrations and the terrifying
    sight of the huge looming horse-drawn box as it trundles
    past.


3   EXT   NIGHT     THE TOWN HALL CLOCK                           3

    The clock shows and strikes 2am.


4   EXT   NIGHT     A DINGY BACK STREET                           4

    The wagon has stopped. The back begins to open, top, bottom
    and sides, like a dark menacing flower unfolding its petals.

    Shadowy FIGURES manoeuvre the side panels and begin to raise
    the roof.

    While this is happening THE CAMERA tracks around to reveal a
    garishly lit club across the street.

    A group of DRUNKEN YOUTHS emerge from the club, staggering,
    laughing, shouting, drinking, breaking bottles, and throwing
    up. The LADS grope the GIRLS. Everyone's having "a great
    time".

    They see the wagon and stop, unsteadily, in their tracks.

                           MARTIN
                 What the...!

    We now see what they see. The wagon has been converted into a
    stage. We're looking at an old fashioned and very shabby
    travelling theatre. Electric footlights are powered by a
    clanking generator. The pediment above the stage carries the
    words: THE ASTONISHING IMAGINARIUM OF DOCTOR PARNASSUS.

    PERCY, a dwarf, dressed as a medieval demon and rigged out as
    a one-man band plays a fanfare introducing a young man
    (ANTON, 18-19 years old) who emerges from the back of the
    stage dressed as MERCURY, the messenger of the gods, with
    wings on his helmet and sandals.



                                                      (CONTINUED)

                                                               3.
4   CONTINUED:                                                4


                           ANTON/MERCURY
                 Ladies and Gentlemen... Step up!
                 Step up!... I, Mercury, the
                 messenger of the gods, invite
                 you... tonight, for one night
                 only... at this very venue... to
                 enter the mind, the very great
                 mind, of Doctor Parnassus!

    PERCY does a roll on the drum as a curtain behind
    ANTON/MERCURY rises to reveal DOCTOR PARNASSUS - he appears
    to be an Indian holy man - long scraggly beard, chalk white
    make up, a large red circle on his bald head, a crown of
    yellow flowers, strings of beads, and partially covered in a
    loose-fitting swath of white cloth - apparently levitating
    several feet above the stage. (He's sitting on a glass
    plinth). DOCTOR PARNASSUS is seemingly in a trance. A bronze
    tripod containing burning incense stands beside him.

                           ANTON/MERCURY (CONT'D)
                 Doctor Parnassus... as old as
                 time... yes, ladies and gentlemen,
                 more than a thousand years old ...
                 he has the power to empower your
                 mind. A secret learned in the
                 mystic East. Let Doctor Parnassus
                 open your imagination. Let him
                 guide and transport you to worlds
                 and possibilities you never dreamt
                 of... If you dare. But... Beware...
                 there are dangers. You will have to
                 choose. Will your soul fly?... Or
                 will it be dashed on the rocks of
                 darkness? The choice is yours and
                 yours alone. Transcend the heights
                 on Beauty's wing.

    A young woman, VALENTINA,(wearing a wig of long blonde hair
    and a white, flowing costume which gives her prominent hips
    and breasts) stands facing an elaborately framed full-length
    mirror nestled upstage amongst cut-out trees representing a
    forest... This is `Beauty'. She turns and steps forward.

    ANTON takes her hand. They make a couple of dance steps
    together. They look enchanting and enchanted.

                           ANTON/MERCURY (CONT'D)
                     (to the audience)
                 Or, if you must...

    Now PERCY, in demon costume, leaps from behind the scenery .



                                                       (CONTINUED)

                                                                4.
4   CONTINUED: (2)                                             4


                        ANTON/MERCURY (CONT'D)
              ... scour the squalid depths with
              Putrid's brother, Stench!

    PERCY indicates a ticket dispenser attached to the front of
    the stage.

                        PERCY
              Take a ticket and join the queue!
              Only five quid a go! There's no
              greater bargain on planet earth!

    A beer bottle lands on the stage

    The DRUNKEN YOUTHS cheer.

                        ANTON/MERCURY
              You choose... Fulfilment, grace and
              light or... Waste, filth and
              darkness.
                  (under his breath,
                   watching the drunk,
                   MARTIN, with contempt)
              No prizes for guessing what you'll
              do.

    MARTIN has begun, with difficulty, to clamber onto the stage.

    His MATES laugh and shout encouragement.

                        ANTON
                  (not in character.. he
                   stutters)
              No. Sorry. That's n-not allowed.
              You have to t-take a t-ticket
              first.

    ANTON tries to prevent MARTIN from getting on stage. But
    MARTIN thumps ANTON and pulls him into the `audience'.

    MARTIN'S drunken MATES laugh and applaud.

    MARTIN is now on stage and heading for DOCTOR PARNASSUS who
    is still in a trance.

    PERCY tries to head him off but MARTIN shoves PERCY off the
    stage. PERCY lands on the ground with a crash.

    More laughter from the MOB.




                                                      (CONTINUED)

                                                                  5.
4   CONTINUED: (3)                                               4


                        MARTIN
                  (drunkenly to PARNASSUS)
              Hey you...I wanna audition. I
              wan... I wanna be a star... I
              wanna...

    MARTIN is on the verge of tweaking DOCTOR PARNASSUS' nose or
    pulling his beard when VALENTINA diverts him.

                        VALENTINA
              Stop! Get off the stage!

    MARTIN turns his bleary focus to VALENTINA.

                        MARTIN
              Thas a nice pair of jugs.

    MARTIN'S mates roar their approval.

                        VALENTINA
              Get off the stage!

                        MARTIN
              No. I wan you... I wan you...

    MARTIN lunges at `Beauty' who retreats up stage.

    MARTIN blunders into the scenery as he pursues `Beauty' who
    stays just out of reach. She takes cover behind a cut-out
    tree.

    ANTON and PERCY climb back onto the stage as MARTIN continues
    to chase `Beauty'. VALENTINA evades him by ducking through
    the mirror (made of flexible reflective material slit down
    the middle). MARTIN crashes after her.

    ANTON and PERCY exchange worried looks. They look at DOCTOR
    PARNASSUS. Should they wake him from his trance? They decide
    not to but it's a difficult decision.


5   INT/EXT   MAGICAL FOREST                                      5

    The stage set, which was clearly only a few feet deep, now
    seems much deeper and to contain many more cut-out trees.

    `Beauty' weaves in and out of the 2 dimensional trees as
    MARTIN chases her further into the increasingly magical
    forest. Beauty's costume has been transformed into something
    wonderful. (A rainbow studded with diamonds?)

    VALENTINA comes into view. MARTIN is in hot pursuit.


                                                       (CONTINUED)

                                                                  6.
5   CONTINUED:                                                   5


                           MARTIN
                 Come here you little sexpot!

    VALENTINA stops, turns, smiles sweetly and slams her fist
    hard into MARTIN'S gut. He doubles up. VALENTINA pauses for a
    moment, contemplating doing some serious damage, before
    striding off.

    MARTIN staggers to his feet.

                           MARTIN (CONT'D)
                 Come back! You bitch!

    He rushes after her but, trips on a root (a real 3
    dimensional tree root) and pitches face first to the ground.
    Recovering, he looks up. Shock. He is surrounded by a dark,
    terrible, and very REAL forest. `Beauty' has vanished.


6   EXT   THE STAGE     NIGHT                                     6

    VALENTINA, `Beauty', slips back on stage through the mirror.
    Her costume has reverted to its original state. She examines
    her knuckles on the hand with which she punched Martin.

    ANTON looks at her. She shrugs. DR. PARNASSUS is still in a
    trance, his lips moving soundlessly. ANTON watches DOCTOR
    PARNASSUS in awe. `Beauty' sighs. She's had enough.


7   INT/EXT   MAGICAL FOREST                                      7

    MARTIN is lost and terrified in the dark forest.

                           MARTIN
                 Mum...Mum!...

    His voice echoes through the giant trees. But his cries are
    interrupted by another sound...a Tarzan-like howl.

    MARTIN spins around. Strange creatures are swinging on vines
    through the giant trees. They are all around him. They look
    like HANDS... with little heads and arms where the wrists
    should be. They are all howling and jabbering.

    From behind, a HAND CREATURE swings down and grabs MARTIN by
    the collar, hoisting him high into the air.

    Clearing the trees, MARTIN sees he is not alone. There are
    many other people - all in the clutches of HAND CREATURES
    swinging on "vines".



                                                       (CONTINUED)

                                                                    7.

    But, the "vines" are actually long, slim tentacles...
    dangling from enormous, luridly coloured JELLYFISH that float
    through the dark, frightening, sky.

    From some of the tentacles, bottles of booze dangle - just
    out of reach of the struggling crowd - all desperate for a
    drink.

                           MARTIN (CONT'D)
                 Please... I'll never...! Never
                 again!. Honest!... From now on... I
                 swear!.. Not a drop!

    With a smile of satisfaction, the HAND CREATURE stops
    jabbering and let's go of MARTIN'S collar.



    Down he plummets. The ground rushes up. MATRTIN is as good
    as dead. But when he hits the ground, rather than going
    SPLAT!!, he bounces high in the air, turns a couple
    somersaults and lands on his feet.

    He can't believe what has just happened... and then he hears
    music. Beautiful, ethereal music.

    In the distance a light is glowing. It's the sun, rising
    above a majestic mountain pass. Cut into the rock, is a long
    stairway winding up to the summit.

    The HAND CREATURE swings down, gives MARTIN the "thumbs up",
    and points encouragingly toward the stairway.

    Reformed and determined, MARTIN heads for the      stairs. But on
    reaching them he discovers that each one is 6      feet high. The
    stairway is ridiculously steep and difficult.      Letters are
    carved into the first stair..."THE 12X12 STEP      PROGRAM...GOOD
    LUCK". This is going to be tough.

    The sound of a honky-tonk piano makes him turn. Behind him
    the sky is dark. A roadside bar/nightclub with flashing neon
    lights has appeared. He hesitates. He could use a drink
    before the long climb. He heads for the club.

    The door to the club is opened by a mechanical fairground
    figure of a jolly smiling man (MR NICK) distinguished by a
    bowler hat and a red waistcoat.

                           MR NICK
                 Hi there. C'mon in. Looks like you
                 could use a drink.

    MARTIN, relieved and reassured by the welcome, steps inside.
    The door closes followed by the sound from within of much
    gaiety and laughter.

    THE CAMERA pulls back as the nightclub suddenly EXPLODES IN A
    BALL OF FLAME.


8   EXT   DINGY BACK STREET                                       8

    The sound of police sirens. We are back outside in front of
    the theatre.

    DR. PARNASSUS rises unsteadily, coming out of his arduous
    trance.... `Beauty" moves to support him as, exhausted, he
    loses his balance and snaps out of his trance.

                        DOCTOR PARNASSUS
                  (holding his head)
              Valentina...

                  (indignant)
              He was chasing me.

                        DOCTOR PARNASSUS
                  (angry)
              You don't go through the mirror.

                        VALENTINA
              I had to get away.

                        DOCTOR PARNASSUS
              You hit him.

                        VALENTINA
              Self defence.

                        DOCTOR PARNASSUS
              You're out of control. Ever since
              your mother died...

                        VALENTINA
              When I was three!

                        DOCTOR PARNASSUS
              I don't want to talk about it!

                        VALENTINA

              You brought it up!

    DOCTOR PARNASSUS turns on ANTON.

                           DOCTOR PARNASSUS
                 We don't accept drunks!

                           ANTON
                 We c-couldn't stop him.

                           DOCTOR PARNASSUS
                 People must be in their right minds
                 when they make the choice.

                           ANTON
                 I know. I'm s-sorry.

                              DRUNKEN GIRL (V.O.)
                 Martin!...

    The POLICE are dealing with a drunken mob of nightclub
    REVELLERS, making arrests.

    A distraught, hysterical, DRUNKEN GIRL is looking for MARTIN.

                           DRUNKEN GIRL (CONT'D)
                 Martin!... Martin!...

    She sees `Beauty'.

                           DRUNKEN GIRL (CONT'D)
                 He went with that cow! I'll scratch
                 her eyes out!

    A POLICEWOMAN grabs the DRUNKEN GIRL and drags her,
    struggling, into police van.

    MARTIN'S FRIENDS are searching for him around the stage.

                           FRIEND OF MARTIN
                 Marty!? Marty, where are you?
                     (a POLICEMAN grabs him))
                 Oi! Leave off..it's them..they've
                 got our mate back there.

                           POLICEMAN
                     (to PARNASSUS)
                 You! Gunga Din! What do you think
                 you're playing at!?

                           DR. PARNASSUS
                 `Playing'? We don't `play'! What we
                 do is deadly serious!

     DR. PARNASSUS pushes aside the mirror to reveal a door in the
     back wall of the shallow stage. It is swinging open.

                         DOCTOR PARNASSUS
               Gone. Will we miss him? I don't
               think so.

     The POLICEMAN looks and frowns.

                         DOCTOR PARNASSUS (CONT'D)
                   (to the POLICEMAN
                   condescendingly)
               Don't worry if you don't understand
               it immediately.

     PERCY, wisely, decides to head off conflict. He steers DOCTOR
     PARNASSUS away from the POLICEMAN.

                         PERCY
                   (to POLICEMAN)
               He's doing his bit to save the
               human race. He thinks it's got a
               future. Quaint, eh? I keep telling
               him to get a proper job.
                   (shaking his empty
                    collection cup)
               Check it out.. another night with
               nothing in the kitty.

                         POLICEMAN
               I want you freaks out of here. Now.
               If I ever see you in this parish
               again I'll do you.

     DOCTOR PARNASSUS bows exaggeratedly, with a hint of mockery.

     The POLICE OFFICER suspects that DOCTOR PARNASSUS is taking
     the piss, but decides not to press it. Instead, he knees
     MARTIN'S struggling friend to the ground.


9    EXT   BACK STREETS DAWN                                       9

     The sky is grey with the first light of dawn. The wagon rolls
     off down the dark street as a dustcart rumbles into view and
     its CREW begin emptying bins and picking up rubbish.


10   EXT   A HOLIDAY FAIR   NIGHT                               10

     The wagon is parked at the edge of the fair. The stage is
     set. ANTON dressed as Mercury is trying to attract an
     audience, without much success.

                            ANTON
                  Step up! Step up! For one night
                  only! The Imaginarium of Dr.
                  Parnassus! Not to be missed!

     On stage is DOCTOR PARNASSUS, `levitating' and in a trance,
     as before. Incense smoke swirls around him.

                            ANTON (CONT'D)
                  Test your imagination! Envisage the
                  sublime. Let Doctor Parnassus be
                  your guide. Discover the heights of
                  Wisdom...

     VALENTINA dances forward, looking fabulous as `Wisdom'.

                            ANTON (CONT'D)
                  ... Or, if you will, visit the
                  doldrums with all that's vile and
                  stinks.

     PERCY steps forward, once again in his mediaeval demon
     costume.

                            PERCY
                      (indicating ticket
                       machine)
                  Take a ticket and wait your turn.
                  Twenty quid a go, reduced to five
                  for one night only!

                            ANTON
                  The world is full of wonders,
                  beauty, enchantment, for those with
                  eyes to see...

     He magically produces a bouquet of flowers. Throws it into
     the air.. it transforms into beautiful doves.

     This impressive trick is totally ignored by a group loudly
     arguing just in front of the stage - THE FAMILY FROM HELL.

     DR. PARNASSUS stirs from his trance. He's had enough of this.

               Excuse me! Excuse me! Would you

     PARNASSUS ignores him and resumes his trance.

     Unnoticed by all, DIEGO has somehow managed to climb onto the
     stage and is peering at the mirror.

     ANTON looks across the stage to her. She mimes that a certain
     someone has gone into the mirror. ANTON considers waking
     DOCTOR PARNASSUS but thinks better of it. Instead he heads
     off upstage and through the mirror in pursuit of Diego.
     VALENTINA takes over the pitch.

     ANTON moves through the cut -out trees and into a fantastic,
     brightly coloured landscape of Dr. Seuss-like hills and
     valleys. The sky if full of cloud-sized soap bubbles.

     Diego is in the distant using his game controller to make the
     bubbles bang into each other...trying to burst them.

     We can hear VALENTINA trying to continue the pitch in the
     face of the family from hell. Their baby has now started
     wailing.

     Cracks in the ground begin to appear under ANTON"S feet.

     ANTON, recovering, struggles out from between giant blocks of
     stone. The world has gone dark.

     He hears DIEGO crying somewhere in the distance and starts to
     clamber over the shattered monoliths..

     Reaching the top, ANTON sees DIEGO on the peak of a distant
     rocky pinnacle surrounded by bottomless chasms. There are
     what appear to be two suspension bridges spanning the void on
     either side of the pinnacle.

     CUT TO DIEGO who is in a state of confusion and terror. Is he
     lost inside a video game he can't control? He presses the
     buttons on his gaming device - to no avail.

     One of the bridges leads to a bluff where war games are under
     way... all very video-game-like. Thrilling aggressive music
     blares forth.

     MR NICK appears, still in red waist-coat and bowler hat, but
     this time in the form of a CUT-OUT shooting target with a
     bull's-eye on his chest.

                                                                15.

                            MR NICK
                  Come on laddy, cross the bridge!
                  Join up! Be a man. Kill the enemy.
                  Impress your dad. Unlimited ammo.
                  Great fun. Pow! Pow! Pow!

     As he speaks bullets fly. Each time MR.NICK gets shot and is
     knocked flat, he pops back up continuing his spiel.

     The other bridge appears to be made of black and white piano
     keys and looks very rickety and unsafe. The piano key bridge
     descends into a great cavern where hundreds of BOY AND GIRL
     PIANISTS are practising on hundreds of pianos, all playing
     the same tune - the tune DR. PARNASSUS is humming, but with
     stern, demanding, PIANO TEACHERS in attendance.

                            PIANO TEACHERS
                  No, no, start again! Again! From
                  the top! Again! Practice! Practice!

     DIEGO doesn't know what to do.

     Behind him rises a strange Mongolfier balloon. DR.
     PARNASSUS's face is repeated again and again around its
     circumference. ANTON'S in the basket.

     DIEGO catches sight of ANTON.

                            DIEGO
                  Help!
                      (indicating gaming device)
                  It doesn't work! It's broken!

                              ANTON
                  What?

                              DIEGO
                  The game!

                            ANTON
                  What g-g-game?

                            DIEGO
                  The game! The video game! The one
                  we're in!

                            ANTON
                  I d-d-don't know what you're t-t-
                  talking about.

                              DIEGO
                  Help me!

                                                               16.

                          ANTON
                   (miserable )
               I c-can't.

                           DIEGO
               What?

                         ANTON
               I'm n-not supposed to be here.

                         DIEGO
               What am I going to do?

                         ANTON
               That's the p-point. It's up to you.

                          DIEGO
                    (dismayed)
               But... Don't leave me! Don't let me
               die!

     But ANTON has gone.

     DIEGO, terrified, tests the bridge to the war games.

                         MR NICK
               Attaboy, sonny. Join the men.
               Nothing to it. Hup two, hup two...

     He hesitates...the music from the pianos seems to have an
     effect on him. He comes to a decision. He drops his gaming
     device then very hesitantly steps onto the extremely wobbly
     piano keys.

     The CUT-OUT shooting target MR NICK isn't happy.

                         MR NICK (CONT'D)
               No, wait! That's the wrong choice!
               That bridge leads to failure and
               despair. You'll be dead before
               you're thirty. This is the one.
               This is the bridge to manhood!

     DIEGO looks uncertain, unnerved. For a moment we think he
     might change his mind, but he presses bravely on across the
     piano bridge.

                                                               17.




13   EXT   A HOLIDAY FAIR   NIGHT                              13

     At last, finally, there's a bit of a crowd around the
     theatre, but drawn only by the FAMILY FROM HELL who are
     making a lot of noise.

                         MUM
                   (hysterical)
               He's been kidnapped! They've taken
               him! It's that weirdo up there! Do
               something, Dad, do something!

                         LINDA
               I want my brother! I want my little
               brother!

     On stage DR. PARNASSUS, continues to hum in his trance-like
     state. INSPECTOR OF FAIRS rattles on.

                         INSPECTOR
               You cannot perform here without
               appropriate authorization.

     Getting no response from DR. PARNASSUS he pulls out his
     mobile phone and dials.

                         INSPECTOR (CONT'D)
                   (with phone to ear)
               It's me. I need some support. We've
               got trouble.

     ANTON steps out of the mirror. He produces an inflated
     balloon which he releases and which then flies, zig-zagging
     out over the audience.

     DR. PARNASSUS, wakes in time to see the balloon.

                         DR. PARNASSUS
                   (delighted with Anton's
                    `message')
               Ha,ha! Success! One little devil
               out of the fire... makes it all
               worthwhile!

     He magically produces a Tarot Card from the startled
     INSPECTOR'S ear.

                         INSPECTOR
               Where did you say you're from?

                              DR. PARNASSUS
                  I didn't.

     He lifts his arm with a flourish whereupon a gloriously
     painted canvas sky unrolls from the top of the set disgorging
     DIEGO as it reaches the stage.

                              DR. PARNASSUS (CONT'D)
                  Hooplah!

     DIEGO rolls out, tumbles across the stage and lands next to
     the rest of his FAMILY. He's beaming, laughing, full of
     wonder, transformed by his experience.

                            MUM
                  Diego! Where have you been? I've
                  been worried sick!

                            DOCTOR PARNASSUS
                      (descending from his glass
                       plinth)
                  And so... a glimmer of hope...
                  Perhaps eternity has not been in
                  vain!...

     DAD smacks DIEGO round the back of the head.

                            DAD
                  And you can wipe that silly
                  expression off your face, you
                  little poof.

                            LINDA
                      (gleefully)
                  You're in big trouble! You're in
                  big trouble!


                            UNCLE BOB
                  You've upset your mum.

                            AUNTY FLO
                  He's spoilt our evening.

                            DAD
                  And where's your gamer? He's lost
                  his bloody gamer! Another fifty
                  quid down the drain. You're not
                  getting another one! Bloody kids!
                  Why do we bother?

     THE FAMILY FROM HELL moves off.

     DIEGO, full of wonder and oblivious to his family, looks back
     at PARNASSUS and gives the old man the thumbs-up.

     PARNASSUS smiles and raises his thumb in response.

     The INSPECTOR OF FAIRS is joined by a POLICEMAN and
     POLICEWOMAN.

                         POLICEMAN
               What's the trouble?

                         DR. PARNASSUS
               Ah, the fuzz.

                         POLICEMAN
               What did you say?

                         DR. PARNASSUS
                   (charmingly)
               Fuzzy Wuzzy was a bear, Fuzzy Wuzzy
               had no hair, Fuzzy Wuzzy wasn't
               fuzzy wuzzy?

     The POLICE and the INSPECTOR exchange dark looks. Clearly
     they're dealing with a dangerous trouble-maker.

                         INSPECTOR
                   (to Parnassus)
               Next time I find you doing business
               without a permit I'll impound your
               wagon.

                         POLICEMAN
                   (to Parnassus)
               I'll be doing worse than
               that...now, bugger off!

                         DR. PARNASSUS
               With pleasure.

     He bows mock graciously.


14   INT   BACK STAGE   DRESSING ROOM   A MOMENT LATER           14

     Valentina, half-undressed, is struggling out of her `Wisdom'
     costume while at the same time looking at pictures of
     beautiful homes and gardens in a very battered copy of `Homes
     and Gardens'. Without make-up and costume she appears much
     younger.

     A movement of something reflected in the dressing-room mirror
     catches her eye.

     In the mirror we see MR NICK, not a CUT-OUT, but the real
     thing.

                              VALENTINA
                        (startled, guiltily hiding
                         `Homes and Gardens')
                  Oh!

     She turns, holding her dress to cover her modesty. There's
     nobody there.

                            VALENTINA (CONT'D)
                  Who's that? Who's there?


15   EXT   EDGE OF FAIR / THE WAGON       CONTINUOUS              15

     ANTON and PERCY are packing-up and closing the wagon.

     DR. PARNASSUS, out of his make-up and costume, is smiling and
     humming to himself as he removes the feed bag from one of the
     horses.

     The horse lifts its head and DR PARNASSUS recoils in shock
     and horror. Standing directly behind the horse is MR. NICK...
     a huge grin splitting his face.

                            MR NICK
                  Hello Parnassus... It's been a
                  while hasn't it?

     PERCY, winding a rope onto a cleat, hears distant laughter
     and looks up.

     CUT TO PERCY'S P.O.V. where we see, some distance away and in
     a relatively secluded spot, MR NICK rocking with laughter
     while DOCTOR PARNASSUS looks stricken. He clutches at the
     back of a park bench to steady himself.

     CUT TO PERCY who looks thoughtful and worried. He heads off
     to help DOCTOR PARNASSUS as the latter slumps onto the bench.
     MR NICK has vanished.

                            DOCTOR PARNASSUS
                      (distraught)
                  He's come to collect.

                            PERCY
                  I thought so.

                            DR. PARNASSUS
                  What can I do?...

                            PERCY
                      (grimly)
                  Nothing.

                            DOCTOR PARNASSUS
                  There must be something!

     He looks over to where VALENTINA is helping close the
     theatre. PERCY follows his gaze.

                            PERCY
                  You're going to have to tell her.


16   EXT   CITY STREETS      LATER                             16

     The wagon makes its way through city streets.

     PERCY is sitting on the roof driving. ANTON is lying on the
     roof looking up at the stars. VALENTINA is sitting next to
     him lost in thought.

                            ANTON
                  Look at that moon.
                      (no response from
                       Valentina)
                  I've n-never seen it so b-big. And
                  the stars...It's so c-clear.

     PERCY holds his hand out, palm up.

                            PERCY
                      (sardonically)

                  He's not here is he? He's inside
                  getting pissed.

                            ANTON
                  Are you happy?

                  Ecstatic.

     ANTON produces an old beaten-up copy of `Beautiful Homes' and
     starts thumbing through it.

                            VALENTINA (CONT'D)
                  Hey! That's mine!

     She tries to snatch it from him.    He flutters it out of her
     reach.

                            VALENTINA (CONT'D)
                  Give it me!

     She wrests it from him and hides it just as PERCY looks back
     at them.

                  those p-places?... N-not me.
                  Well... m-maybe....with you.
                      (suddenly urgent)
                  Let's run away. Make a new life
                  together. I'll retrain. Computers.
                  Stocks and bonds. We could be
                  happy. Just the two of us.

               Twelve.

                         VALENTINA
               See? Parnassus says so too. Are you

                Parnassus is a pain. Okay he's
                extraordinary but I'm not. I don't
                want to be like him. I want to be
                like other people. Like them.
                (gesturing to the passing city)
                You know... normal. Ordinary.
                You're so lucky.

     She gets up, kisses ANTON on the top of his head and climbs
     down into the hatch.

     Anton looks thoughtful, bruised.

     PERCY glances back.

                Actually, I'm going to be sixteen.
                Shall I tell Parnassus I know? I
                think he knows I know. Silly man.
                Sweet sixteen.

     She disappears down the hatch, then quickly pops back up.

17   INT   DOCTOR PARNASSUS' DEN   THAT MOMENT                    17

     DOCTOR PARNASSUS' cabin is tiny. It's packed with books and
     memorabilia; Egyptian/Assyrian/Greek/etc., magic trick
     paraphernalia, and much else.

     A hanging lantern suspended from the ceiling throws moving
     shadows.

     DR. PARNASSUS is slumped despondently on a cramped bed. A
     plate of untouched food sits on a table in front of him.

     He has laid out tarot cards. To the right - The Magus.. to
     the left - The Devil. The next card is The Maiden. He places
     it carefully beneath The Magus.

     He picks up an open bottle of spirits and takes a swig.
     Clearly he's already had a few drinks.

                  leave it.

                  Now what?

     She starts tidying up.

                            DR. PARNASSUS
                      (avoiding the question)
                  I should never have brought you

               Listen to me! I need to tell you
               something, before it's too late!

     DR PARNASSUS reaches up and plucks a glass paperweight out of
     the air. It's that kind that contains little models which are
     engulfed in a snow storm when the paperweight is shaken.

     DR. PARNASSUS shakes the paper-weight and watches the `snow'
     swirl about.

               fact...


18   EXT   INSIDE THE PAPERWEIGHT    NIGHT                        18

     A HOODED RIDER moves slowly through the snowstorm, the horse
     picking its way carefully across a field of virgin snow.

                         DR. PARNASSUS (V.O.)
               ... I was visited... by someone I
               had hoped never to meet.

     In the distance, rising like a dark mountain, is a strange
     monastery. Dim light comes from a couple of windows.

     We can hear, from far away, the indistinct droning voice of
     the story teller, a younger DR. PARNASSUS.

     THE CAMERA moves up over and way ahead of the HOODED RIDER,
     continuing through the snowstorm, over fields, forests,
     valleys, rocks, until it reaches the monastery, high on a
     rugged hill. Here it enters one of the dimly lit monastery
     windows, taking us into a dining hall.


19   INT   MONASTERY DINING HALL    NIGHT                         19

     Entering via a window and looking down into the monastery
     dining hall, we see DOZENS OF MONKS sitting at a long
     refectory table. They are eating their supper and listening
     to a young DR. PARNASSUS who is sitting on a dais at the far
     end of the hall, his eyes closed, in a trance, telling a
     story.

     A log fire burns in a big fireplace.

                         DR. PARNASSUS
               ... Having captured the wind and
               tamed the storm ... the Chief
               Steward, laying down to take his
               rest, had a disturbing dream... He
               dreamt that a hooded rider was
               approaching across the snow-swept
               plain.

                  A rider who would challenge the
                  very foundations of the world...

     The door to the refectory swings open with a crash.

     The MONKS look up.

     Standing on the thresh-hold is the hooded figure, covered
     with snow.

     He throws off his hood.    It's MR NICK.

                            DR. PARNASSUS (CONT'D)
                  ... The Steward woke and remembered
                  his dream. What manner of man had
                  he dreamt of, and what did it
                  signify?

     DR. PARNASSUS and MR NICK are sitting at the fire.

     Behind them, in the hall, MONKS come and go.

     On the dais, a MONK continues with the story. This monk is a
     younger PERCY.

                            PERCY
                  ... And as the waters rose... the
                  people's need for stories grew.
                  Stories that would feed a great
                  hunger. A hunger for more than just
                  understanding...

     PERCY continues telling the story in the background.

                            MR NICK
                  What exactly do you do here?

                            DR. PARNASSUS
                  We tell the eternal story.

                            MR NICK
                  Oh.... What's that?

                            DR. PARNASSUS
                  The story that sustains the
                  universe. The story without which
                  there is nothing.

                  Nothing? Really. Are you telling me
                  that if you stop telling a story...
                      (waving in the direction
                       of Percy)
                  This story... something you made
                  up, a fiction... that the universe
                  ceases to exist?

                            DR. PARNASSUS
                  You make it sound so simple.

                            MR NICK
                  And you believe it?

     DR. PARNASSUS smiles.

                            MR NICK (CONT'D)
                  Incredible. It's just incredible to
                  me that you can believe something
                  that can be so easily disproved.

                            DR. PARNASSUS
                      (complacently)
                  I don't think so.

     MR NICK turns and throws a spell at PERCY who goes rigid like
     a statue - struck dumb. The story stops.

                              DR. PARNASSUS (CONT'D)
                        (alarmed)
                  No!

     Another MONK, sitting at the table, immediately continues the
     story.

                            SUBSTITUTE MONK
                  ..having been brought to the limit
                  of his endurance...

     MR NICK freezes him too, stopping him from speaking.

     A third monk continues.

                            THIRD MONK

     MR.NICK renders him silent.

                              DR. PARNASSUS
                  Stop!

     MR NICK zaps DR. PARNASSUS and all the other MONKS. All
     still. None of them can speak.

                          MR NICK
               There you are. You see. The story's
               stopped. No more story... And yet,
               we're still here, the fire's still
               burning...

     He pushes open a window.

                         MR NICK (CONT'D)
               It's still snowing. The wind's
               still blowing. Nothing's changed.

     DR. PARNASSUS and the MONKS, still struck dumb, look
     appalled.

                         MR NICK (CONT'D)
               Cheer up... I've freed you from
               this ridiculous nonsense.

     MR NICK undoes the spell.

     The MONKS moan. DR. PARNASSUS slumps down in despair.

     MR NICK smiles and lights a cigarette. He's enjoying this.

                         MR NICK (CONT'D)
               Now you can use your powers to do
               something else. Have fun, travel,
               learn a foreign language...

     Splat! A gob of bird shit lands on MR. NICK'S head. An eagle
     circles overhead. It swoops across the hall and exits through
     a window.

     DR. PARNASSUS leaps up, laughing, amazed, revived.

                         DR. PARNASSUS
               A sign! A message! That bird was a
               messenger... from distant places we
               know not of!
                   (triumphant)
               Other places! The point is, you're
               wrong! And I'm wrong! It doesn't
               have to be us here!
                   (indicating monks)
               Somewhere in the world, at any
               given time... someone is telling a
               story! Sustaining the universe!
               Right now, it's happening.

               That's why we're still here. You
               can't stop stories being told
               somewhere! You can't be everywhere!

     MR NICK is furious.

                         MR NICK
                   (irritated)
               A weak hypothesis!

                            DR. PARNASSUS
                      (smiling)
               Yes?

     MR NICK stubs out his cigarette.

                         MR NICK
               I tell you what... You're probably
               not a betting man but...

     MR NICK whispers into the DR. PARNASSUS's ear.

                         DR. PARNASSUS (V.O.)
               And so I made a wager with the
               devil.


21   EXT   ON THE ROAD (MIDDLE AGES)    DAY/NIGHT               21

     DR. PARNASSUS and PERCY are travelling the world with a
     little theatre. Giving performances. Inviting AUDIENCE
     MEMBERS onto the stage to participate.

                         DR. PARNASSUS (V.O.)
               Whichever of us won ten converts
               first, would win the bet... My
               argument was the importance of the
               story, the power of the
               imagination... His, the power of
               material things, the supremacy of
               stuff... Naturally... I won.

     CUT TO another performance. Now the 16TH CENTURY.

                         DR. PARNASSUS (V.O. (CONT'D)
               My prize...
                   (a voice filled with
                    horror)
               ... was ever-lasting life.

     Another show...now the 18TH CENTURY

22   EXT.   MODERN CITY STREET     DAY                             22

     DR. PARNASSUS and PERCY are performing on a street corner in
     modern clothes. As are all the PASSERSBY who pay them no
     attention.

     They look exhausted, like beggars...and very old.

                            DR. PARNASSUS (V.O.)
                  It seemed as though the Devil,
                  after all... had triumphed... And
                  then... one day....

     A BEAUTIFUL WOMAN (played by the same actress as Valentina,
     but older with different coloured hair) comes into view.

                            DR. PARNASSUS (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                  From the very first moment I saw
                  her, I was head-over-heels in love.
                  She was beautiful, enchanting,
                  delightful, young... But I... I was
                  several thousand years old! How
                  could I woo her? What could I do?


23   EXT.   CLIFF TOP    EVENING                                   23

     CUT TO a desolate cliff top where PERCY is struggling with DR
     PARNASSUS, trying to prevent him from throwing himself off
     the cliff.

                            PERCY
                  Don't be a fool! You can't die!
                  You're immortal! You'll just end up
                  broken, in the eternity ward, and
                  I'll be stuck looking after you!
                  Forever!

     DR. PARNASSUS breaks free, stumbles backwards, and pitches
     out into space. PERCY screams.

                            DR. PARNASSUS V.O.
                  At times like these... the devil is
                  never far away.

     DR. PARNASSUS is hanging by his coat, snagged on a branch
     angled out from the cliff face and held, like a fishing rod,
     by MR NICK who has a great grin on his face.


24   EXT.   RIVER      DAY                                     24

     CUT TO a much younger DR. PARNASSUS and the BEAUTIFUL WOMAN
     in a row boat, picnicking, as they float down a river. They
     are in love, very happy to be together.

     PERCY, wearing a blazer, flannels and straw boater is rowing
     or punting.

                            DR. PARNASSUS (V.O.)
                  The devil granted me mortality
                  again...and youth and great powers.
                  I won my bride. I was in love. But
                  at what price...

     The boat bumps into a submerged log. DR. PARNASSUS tries to
     push free. Several cigarette butts float past. Looking up,
     DR. PARNASSUS sees a man sitting on the riverbank, fishing,
     smoking a cigarette. It's MR NICK .

     There is a loud and ominous clap of thunder.


25   INT.   PARNASSUS' DEN        NIGHT                        25

                            DOCTOR PARNASSUS
                  ...at what price....

     DR. PARNASSUS looks haggard. He closes his eyes. He sways and
     drops the paper-weight.

                               VALENTINA
                  Father!...

     At that moment the wagon lurches to a stop and we hear
     frantic banging on the roof.

     DR PARNASSUS is glad of the excuse not to go on.

                            DR. PARNASSUS
                  We've stopped.

                            VALENTINA
                  What do you mean `at what price'?

                            DR. PARNASSUS
                      (turning back to his Tarot
                       cards)
                  It'll wait, it'll wait. Another
                  time. Something's happened. You'd
                  better go and see.

                            VALENTINA
                  Typical! You insist I listen to a
                  story and then you don't finish it!

     More banging from above.

                            DR. PARNASSUS
                  Go and see!

     VALENTINA turns and goes.

     PARNASSUS looks miserable but, almost relieved.    He turns
     over the next card.

     It's The Hanged Man. It depicts a body hanging from a gibbet
     surrounded by several arcane objects.

     PARNASSUS studies the card, trying to wring some meaning from
     it - then lays The Hanged Man in the space between the
     others. He takes a swig from the bottle.


26   EXT   WAGON ON BLACK FRIARS' BRIDGE     NIGHT                 26

     The wagon has stopped in the middle of Blackfriar's bridge.
     It's pouring with rain.

     VALENTINA, wearing some sort of covering against the rain,
     climbs out of the hatch and onto the roof of the wagon.

     Here she finds ANTON pointing excitedly down into the Thames.

                            ANTON
                  Incredible! I saw somebody d-
                  dancing in the air.. under the b-
                  bridge..

     VALENTINA looks doubtfully at PERCY who peers morosely out
     from under his sou-wester and shakes his head.

                             ANTON (CONT'D)
                  It's true! There was a sh-shadow on
                  the water, when the lightning
                  flashed...

26   CONTINUED:                                                26


     Lightning flashes again.

     We see what ANTON and VALENTINA see. A shadow, on the water,
     of someone `dancing', hung by his neck with a rope attached
     to the underside of the bridge.

                            ANTON (CONT'D)
                      (triumphant)
                  You see! The d-dancer!

                            VALENTINA
                      (horrified)
                  There's someone hanging there!

                            ANTON
                      (smugly to Percy)
                  I t-told you!

                            VALENTINA
                  A rope! Get a rope!


27   EXT   SIDE OF BLACK FRIARS' BRIDGE      MOMENTS LATER      27

     ANTON is `absailing' over the side of the bridge. One end of
     a rope is tied around his waist, the other is attached to the
     bridge parapet. A lantern dangles from his waist.

     VALENTINA and PERCY watch ANTON'S perilous descent.

     Moments later there are two bodies hanging from the bridge,
     the mysterious HANGING MAN'S and ANTON'S.

     The MAN is hanging by a noose around his neck, still jerking
     in his dance of death. His hands are tied behind his back.

     ANTON can't reach the MAN.

                            ANTON
                      (shouting up)
                  I c-can't reach him.

                               VALENTINA
                  Try again!

                               PERCY
                  Swing in!

                               VALENTINA
                  Hurry up.




                                                         (CONTINUED)

                                                               36.
27   CONTINUED:                                               27


     ANTON shoots PERCY and VALENTINA a jaundiced look and with
     VALENTINA'S help on her end of the rope begins to swing back
     and forth.

     Eventually, with a big enough swing, he manages to hook his
     foot around the HANGING MAN who has gone limp. Dead.

     With extreme difficulty and great discomfort, ANTON pulls the
     MAN close to him, takes a knife from his pocket and cuts the
     MAN'S rope.

     ANTON and the MAN are now swinging back and forth together on
     ANTON'S rope which is threatening to cut ANTON in half.

                               ANTON
                  Arghhh!!!!

                            VALENTINA
                  You've done it! Brilliant!

                               ANTON
                  Argggg!!!

                            PERCY
                  Come on, don't hang about! We're
                  getting soaked up here!


28   EXT   PAVEMENT ON BLACK FRIARS' BRIDGE A LITTLE LATER     28

     VALENTINA, ANTON and PERCY manhandle the MAN over the parapet
     and onto the pavement.

     DR. PARNASSUS has just stepped out onto the top of the wagon.
     Soaked. He's drunk and is swaying.

                            DR. PARNASSUS
                  Why are you fishing dead people out
                  of the river? He's dead. Leave him.
                  Let's go. Before the police turn
                  up.

     He goes, unsteadily, back inside.

     VALENTINA and ANTON drag the MAN under the wagon, out of the
     rain.

     The MAN is dressed in an expensive Saville Row suit. His
     jacket pockets are full of strange weights and arcane symbols
     have been scrawled on his forehead. He's about 30 years old
     and very handsome.

     The MAN appears to be dead but VALENTINA decides to try the
     kiss of life.

     ANTON is made uncomfortable seeing VALENTINA administer the
     kiss of life and he pulls her away.

                            ANTON
                  No! That won't work. And anyway,
                  you d-don't know where he's b-been.
                  Let me...

     He brings both fists down hard on the centre of the MAN'S
     chest.

     Boing! The `dead' MAN coughs, sits bolt upright, spits out a
     little metal tube and smashes his head on the underside of
     the wagon, knocking himself out.

     The little metal tube clatters over the asphalt.

                            ANTON (CONT'D)
                  He's alive!

                               VALENTINA
                  Thank God.

                            PERCY
                  Well, he was.

     ANTON picks up the little metal tube and examines it.

                            ANTON
                  What on earth is this?


29   EXT   BLACK FRIARS' BRIDGE        REAR OF WAGON MOMENTS LATER   29

     VALENTINA, ANTON and PERCY drag the MAN from under the wagon
     and carry him to the rear.


                            VALENTINA
                  Put him in the big trunk.

                               ANTON
                  B-but...

                            VALENTINA
                  Don't argue.

                            PERCY
                  The boss said leave him.

                            VALENTINA
                  He thought he was dead.

     They start to bundle the MAN in one of the travelling trunks
     attached to the back of the wagon. With the body hanging
     half in half out, ANTON suddenly stops.

                            ANTON
                  I d-don't like it. It's none of our
                  b-business.

                            VALENTINA
                  So, what do you suggest, we leave
                  him on the side of the road?

     ANTON doesn't want to answer that one.

                            PERCY
                      (walking away)
                  Definitely.

     VALENTINA, single-handedly, hefts the MAN into the trunk and
     carefully places a cushion under his head. An action not
     missed by ANTON.


30   EXT   DERELICT BUILDINGS       DAWN                         30

     The wagon stands, hidden, among deserted derelict buildings.
     All is quiet.

     The lid of the big travelling trunk slowly opens.

     The MAN struggles out. His neck is sore, his wrists ache and
     his head is bruised. He hasn't a clue where he is. He tries
     to make sense of the wagon, the grazing horses, the derelict
     buildings.

     Some distance away a bizarre, horned and tailed CREATURE is
     involved in a strange contorted dance.

     Hoping to avoid the CREATURE, the MAN starts to move away but
     is stopped by a squeaky voice behind him.

                              PERCY (V.O.)
                  Hey, you!

     The MAN turns around to find PERCY looking at him.

                            PERCY (CONT'D)
                  I suppose somebody saves your life
                  everyday of the week.

                      (croaking)
                  What?

     He can hardly speak. It hurts him to do so.

                            PERCY
                  Too much like routine to bother
                  with a thank you.

                  Third. If that proves too
                  difficult, you may call me Percy.

                            MAN
                  Where are we?

                            PERCY
                  Geographically, in the Northern
                  Hemisphere. Socially, on the
                  margins. Narratively, with some way
                  to go. And your name is...

                            MAN
                      (appalled)
                  I... I can't remember.

                            PERCY
                  That's handy.

     PERCY whistles to the dancing CREATURE, who turns and
     approaches. The MAN is getting very nervous.

                            PERCY (CONT'D)
                  Any credit cards?

                            MAN
                  What?..Oh..OK... you can have
                  whatever you want.. just don't..

               My wallet... it's gone. Nothing.
               I've been robbed.

                         PERCY
               Don't look at us.

                         CREATURE
               What's your name?

                         PERCY
                   (sceptical)
               He can't remember.

     Suddenly a mobile phone starts ringing. They all look at
     each other. It's in the MAN'S pocket. But, he doesn't move.
     The CREATURE takes his head off ..it's ANTON.

                         ANTON
               Might be for you.

                         PERCY
               They'll know who you are.

     The MAN still doesn't move. ANTON reaches over and tries to
     find the phone in the MAN'S pockets. The MAN tries to push
     him off and find the phone himself. The phone is retrieved
     but, in the struggle to answer it, it's dropped.

     A WOMAN SPEAKING RUSSIAN can be heard from the phone. As
     ANTON and the MAN dive for it, the MAN `accidently' steps on
     it. The phone is crushed.

                         PERCY (CONT'D)
               Pity.. I speak Russian.

     ANTON and PERCY glare with deep suspicion at the MAN.

                         DR. PARNASSUS (O.S.)
               Dammit! I told you to leave him. He
               was dead.

     DR. PARNASSUS, holding a cold, damp towel to his throbbing
     head, appears, coughing and miserable from the wagon.

                         PERCY
               Well, we didn't and he isn't.

                         ANTON
               He was hanging under the b-bridge.

                          DOCTOR PARNASSUS
               Hanging?

               By his neck. Until dead. If we'd
               had any sense.

     ANTON produces the bricks with strange markings that were in
     the MAN'S pockets.

                         ANTON
               We found these in his p-pockets.

     DOCTOR PARNASSUS examines the bricks with great interest.

     He pulls out The Hanged Man card and compares it's arcane
     details - a noose, strangely marked shapes like bricks, a
     metal tube - to the objects found on the MAN.

                         DOCTOR PARNASSUS
               The hanged man!

                         VALENTINA(O.S.)

     She appears from inside the wagon.

     They all look at one another. Good point.

               Actually, I saw that trick

     DOCTOR PARNASSUS, looking up from his study of the bricks and
     noose, takes the MAN aside, looks closely, trying to read the
     strange markings on his forehead.

                         DOCTOR PARNASSUS
               These marks... I recognize them.

     TONY doesn't know what DR PARNASSUS in talking about but he

     he needs to play along.

     The MAN precedes DOCTOR PARNASSUS in the tiny room. He looks
     around in amazement.

                           DOCTOR PARNASSUS
                 We can talk here. Sit down, sit

                  You've lost your memory?

                  I just... it needs time... to
                  recover.

                      (incredulous)
                  You've come here with a message....
                  A vitally important message from
                  Mister Nick... A matter of life or
                  death... and you can't remember
                  what it is!?

                            MAN
                  Not at the moment. I'm sorry. It's
                  never happened before.

                            DOCTOR PARNASSUS

32   EXT   SHOPPING MALL PARKING LOT    NIGHT                     32

     The wagon is parked in a shopping mall parking lot. The
     theatre is being opened up by PERCY and ANTON. There are a
     few late night SHOPPERS coming and going.


33   INT   BACKSTAGE                THAT MOMENT                   33

     VALENTINA, dressed as `Beauty', is rummaging in a theatre
     skip, helping the MAN find something to wear for the show.

     There is a slight whiff of sexual attraction in the air.

                            VALENTINA
                  He says you must work... to focus
                  your mind. You can help out front..
                  sell tickets. Ah, here we are...
                      (Pulling out a full
                       bottomed wig)
                  Try this. You can be `Justice'.

     The MAN tries on the wig and looks in a mirror.

     VALENTINA tries not to laugh.

                      (pulling a face)
                  Exactly. A laughing stock.

                            VALENTINA
                  Just like the rest of us.

                             MAN
                      (pulling out a carnival
                       mask)
                  I think I'll hide behind this.

                            VALENTINA
                  No face. No name. The mystery
                  thickens. I'm going to have to give
                  you a name...

     She presses a metal breast-plate to his chest.

                            VALENTINA (CONT'D)
                  ... until you remember who you are,
                  I dub thee Saint George. You can
                  save me from the dragon. George.

                            GEORGE
                  Hold on!.. what dragon?

                            VALENTINA
                  You've met Parnassus.

     Mischievously, she ties a chiffon tutu around his waist.

                            GEORGE
                  Now you are making fun of me.

     VALENTINA giggles.

                            GEORGE (CONT'D)
                  I'm sorry but, nobody laughs at me
                  without paying the price....ah,ha.

     He begins tickling her. She laughs uncontrollably, falling
     backwards into the costume skip..

                            ANTON O/S
                  We c-can't do it. We...

     ANTON enters wearing his Mercury gear.       He freezes, seeing
     GEORGE and VALENTINA rollicking about.       They stop, look up.

                            VALENTINA
                  Hi, Anton.... what?

                The show. We c-can't do it. It's
                your father...

                          VALENTINA
                    (alarmed)
                What is it? What's happened?


34   INT   DOCTOR PARNASSUS' CABIN     MOMENTS LATER           34

     VALENTINA and ANTON arrive in the doorway, dismayed.

     GEORGE hovers in the background.

     DOCTOR PARNASSUS is attempting to get ready for the show but
     he's so drunk he can hardly stand. He's already put some
     article of clothing on back-to-front or inside out. PERCY is
     trying to help.

                           VALENTINA
                Oh no!

                          DOCTOR PARNASSUS
                Can he remember!
                    (seeing Man in doorway)
                Can you remember?

                           GEORGE
                Not yet.

                          DOCTOR PARNASSUS
                Bloody useless! Mr Nick sends an
                emissary and he can't bloody
                remember! It's a bloody disaster!

                          VALENTINA
                You can't go on. You're drunk.

                          DOCTOR PARNASSUS
                I am not drunk! I'm under
                considerable stress.

                          VALENTINA
                    (to Percy
                You'll have to do it.

                          DOCTOR PARNASSUS
                No! No understudy! The audience
                won't tolerate an understudy!
                There's only one Doctor Parnassus,
                and I am he!

                      (interrupting)
                  Somebody make some strong coffee.

     EVERYONE looks at George.

                            DOCTOR PARNASSUS
                  Strong coffee? Brilliant!
                      (sarcastically saluting
                       George)
                  This is why fate has brought us
                  together. Don't worry about
                  remembering... It's all the same to
                  a man on a galloping horse!


35   EXT   SHOPPING MALL PARKING LOT    THEATRE                  35

     DOCTOR PARNASSUS is on   stage, floating' on his glass pillar,
     apparently in a trance   but,humming erratically. He is flanked
     by VALENTINA and ANTON   who stay close to PARNASSUS in case he
     falls. PERCY is in his   medieval costume/one-man-band outfit.
     They all look uneasy.

                            ANTON
                      (a bit low-key)
                  For one night only... raise your
                  sights... encounter the majesty,
                  the beauty, the miracle that's in
                  each and every one of you. Take
                  this opportunity to expand your
                  horizons. It's not too late.
                  Experience the Imaginarium of the
                  great Doctor Parnassus.

     VALENTINA peers out over the `footlights' in the hope of
     catching sight of GEORGE.

                            VALENTINA
                  Where's George?

     He's nowhere in sight.

                            ANTON
                      (sarcastically)
                  P-probably remembered he had a wife
                  or t-two back in Russia.

     VALENTINA gives him a dirty look.

                                                                  49.




36   INT   SHOPPING MALL SUPERMARKET     THAT MOMENT              36

     GEORGE, wearing his `romantic' Venice carnival mask is smooth-
     talking several middle-aged LADIES on queue at the
     supermarket check-out.

     He's carrying the theatre's ticket dispenser.

                         GEORGE
               Three tickets for the price of
               two... That's a fantastic deal.
               It's a brilliant show. Much better
               than sex.

     Much ribald laughter from the flattered LADIES.


37   EXT   SHOPPING MALL PARKING LOT   LATER                      37

     The shoppers have gone. The last car drives out of the car
     park leaving it empty except for the theatre wagon.

     ANTON, VALENTINA and PERCY are on their own.

     PARNASSUS, on his plinth, is asleep and snoring.

                         ANTON
               Thank G-God... N-not a single
               customer!

                         PERCY
               Let's close up quick while the
               going's good.

                         VALENTINA
                   (amazed)
               He's never not done a show
               before... Maybe he's past it.
                   (hopefully)
               Maybe it's time to retire.

     PARNASSUS groans in his sleep.

                         ANTON
                   (looking out front)
               Oh n-no!

     ANTON sees GEORGE heading towards them with a mob of MIDDLE-
     AGED WOMEN in tow.

     Bubbling with excitement, the mob arrives.

                  Oh look! How fascinating.

     The other WOMEN agree.

                      (looking at her watch)
                  When does the next show start?

                            PERCY
                  There isn't a next show.

     EVELYN and the other WOMEN are puzzled.

                            PERCY (CONT'D)
                  We've done all the shows we're
                  doing here this evening.

                            DEIDRE
                  But we've got tickets.

     GEORGE looks hopefully at VALENTINA and ANTON who don't know
     what to say.

     We hear a crash.

     THE CAMERA PANS around. PARNASSUS has fallen off his perch
     and is now lying on the floor...snoring and mumbling.

     VALENTINA and some of the WOMEN run forward.

                            SYLVIA
                  This man's drunk. Dead drunk.

                            EVELYN
                  Disgraceful.

                            VALENTINA O/S
                      (suddenly defensive of her
                       father)
                  He's not drunk. He's got a bad
                  cold....

                            GEORGE
                  But being a true professional he
                  tried to keep going, at
                  considerable risk to his health.

     VALENTINA and GEORGE exchange a quick look. VALENTINA thinks
     she's found a kindred spirit.

               No problem...dear ladies. No
               problem at all. I'm so terribly
               sorry. I can't apologize enough.
               You can have your money back or, if
               you like... an extra free ticket.
               Better yet, two extra free tickets
               if you buy another ticket at half
               price. This offer is only available
               today.

     The WOMEN look on the verge of taking up the offer.

     ANTON and PERCY exchange looks. They can't believe GEORGE'S
     chutzpah.

                         GEORGE
               I got carried away.

                         ANTON
               Lying through your t-teeth can do
               that to you.

               Most of them were coming tomorrow.

                  I'll give it back.

                            GEORGE
                  Don't be angry with him. He's a
                  little bit jealous. He's young.
                  Insecure. I'll make it my job to
                  boost his confidence.

     VALENTINA smiles at George with admiration and approval.

                            GEORGE (CONT'D)
                  When's your birthday?


40   EXT   SUPERMARKET CAR PARK         THAT MOMENT              40

     As the wagon trundles out of the deserted car park a DARK
     FIGURE hops onto the rear platform.


41   INT   DOCTOR PARNASSUS' CABIN      MOMENTS LATER            41

     DOCTOR PARNASSUS is groaning and clutching his head. He has a
     fierce hangover. He pours some powder from a packet into a
     glass of water, stirs it with his finger and knocks it back.
     He grimaces and shudders.

     A hatch/shutter on the small window behind him slides open to
     reveal the grinning head of MR NICK.

                            MR NICK
                  You shouldn't drink, it doesn't
                  agree with you.

     Startled, DOCTOR PARNASSUS spins around.

                            DOCTOR PARNASSUS
                  What do you want? I'll do anything.

                            MR NICK
                      (smiles)
                  I know.

                            DOCTOR PARNASSUS
                  You're man's lost his memory! He's
                  bloody hopeless!

                            MR NICK
                  He's not my man.

                            DOCTOR PARNASSUS
                  What?

                            MR NICK
                  Tony Shepherd. Little toe-rag. He
                  used to run a big charity. I
                  wouldn't trust him. But then... you
                  don't trust me do you?

                            DOCTOR PARNASSUS
                  For God's sake! Tell me what you
                  want!

                            MR NICK
                  I just thought...seeing you so
                  upset last night...that you needed
                  a glimmer of hope...maybe a little
                  bet?

                            DOCTOR PARNASSUS
                  On Valentina?

                            MR NICK
                  No?

                            DOCTOR PARNASSUS
                  You bastard!

                            MR NICK
                  First to five?... You might win.
                  And save her. What do you have to
                  lose?

                            DR. PARNASSUS
                  I'll kill you!

                   (laughs)
               Now that would be something. By her
               birthday then.

                         DOCTOR PARNASSUS
               What! Impossible!..you've seen the
               business we're doing.

                         MR NICK
               Things are going to pick up. As
               sure as eggs is eggs.

     He closes the hatch/shutter with a bang.

                            DOCTOR PARNASSUS
               Wait!

     Too late. He's gone.


42   EXT   DERELICT BUILDINGS     DAWN                           42

     Back amongst the derelict buildings the Troupe is resting and
     doing chores. The horses are grazing.

     VALENTINA sits at a mirror fussing with various hair styles -
     slyly trying to catch GEORGE's attention.

     PARNASSUS, holding his aching head, sits a short distance
     away sadly watching her. PERCY is with him.

                         PERCY
               Five souls.. two days, eh!?

                         DR. PARNASSUS
               Shh! I'm trying to think.

                         PERCY
               I told you didn't I?

                            DR. PARNASSUS
               What?

                         PERCY
               That he was a wrong-un.

     PERCY nods his head in George's direction.

                             DR. PARNASSUS
                  Trust in providence, Percy.
                  Remember the hanging man. The cards
                  don't lie.

                            PERCY
                  No... but they sure as hell like
                  being economical with the truth.

     CUT TO ANTON who is painting a long-stemmed, wooden
     flower...he comes over to VALENTINA with it in his hand.

                            VALENTINA
                      (looking away)
                  Don't talk to me.

                            ANTON
                  P-please...I'm sorry about last
                  night. I behaved like an idiot.

                            VALENTINA
                  Yes.

     ANTON suddenly plops down on his arse in a puddle of mud.
     Then spins, flips the flower high into the air and, rolling
     face down onto his stomach, catches the stem with his
     clenched buttocks. VALENTINA bursts out laughing.

                            ANTON
                  You must admit... even idiots have
                  their qualities.

     CUT TO GEORGE who is peeling potatoes, badly. PARNASSUS and
     PERCY come up behind him.

                            DOCTOR PARNASSUS
                  George... We'd like to know who you
                  really are.

                            GEORGE
                  What?... Yes. Me too.

                            DOCTOR PARNASSUS
                  I may be able to help.

                            GEORGE
                  Really? What?... How...?

     PERCY produces a small contraption with wires from behind his
     back and gives it to DR PARNASSUS.

                         DOCTOR PARNASSUS
               Hold this piece of wire.

                         PERCY
               You won't feel a thing.

     GEORGE takes the end of the wire.

                         DOCTOR PARNASSUS
               I'm going to put the tips of my
               fingers on the top of your head.

     He does so.

                         DOCTOR PARNASSUS (CONT'D)
               I want you to relax and try as far
               as possible to think of nothing.

                          GEORGE
               That's not difficult... in my
               condition.

     DOCTOR PARNASSUS closes his eyes. He seems to be making an
     effort.

                         DOCTOR PARNASSUS
               Hold your breath.

     GEORGE does so.

                         DOCTOR PARNASSUS (CONT'D)
               Very good, very good. Yes... Yes, I
               see... I see... Very interesting.

     DOCTOR PARNASSUS takes his hand from GEORGE'S head and gives
     the contraption back to PERCY.

                         PERCY
               You may breathe normally.

     The effort seems to have tired PARNASSUS. He needs to sit
     down.

                           GEORGE
               What... ?

                         DOCTOR PARNASSUS
               Alas, this technique has its
               limitations.

                         GEORGE
               But... Did you discover anything?

                         GEORGE
               My name?... What is it?

     PAUSE.

                         DOCTOR PARNASSUS
               Anthony Shepherd.

                         TONY
                   (stunned)
               My God! That's it! You're right!
               Anthony Shepherd! They call me
               Tony. Tony Shepherd! That's who I
               am!

     VALENTINA and ANTON begin to pay attention and gather around.

                         DOCTOR PARNASSUS
               And... you used to do good works.
               Something to do with charity I
               think.

                         TONY
               Yes...That's right! That's right!
               But how?...

                         DOCTOR PARNASSUS
                   (dismissively)
               It's an ancient technique of mental
               divination, but I'm very rusty and
               it doesn't always work
               satisfactorily.

                         TONY
               But that's amazing! Brilliant!
                   (oddly concerned)
               Was there anything else?

     DOCTOR PARNASSUS shakes his head, no.

                         TONY (CONT'D)
                   (relieved)
               That's absolutely fantastic! Thank
               you. Perhaps I'll remember other
               things.

     PARNASSUS smiles and bows slightly ironically.

               That's so strange. And horrible..
               it's a complete blank. But I do
               remember I was involved in some
               sort of charity.. trying to do
               good, to make the world a better
               place, you know...inspire people,

               What an arrogant idiot.

     VALENTINA looks at him thinking `what a sympathetic person.'

     The sound of a flutey whistle distracts him. ANTON is blowing
     a tune on the metal tube he found on the bridge.

               I mean, the pipe. Where did you get
               it?

     ANTON looks at the metal pipe.

                         ANTON
               I found it.

               It's not a musical instrument. May

               Alright.

     ANTON appears to offer the pipe to TONY but palms it so that
     when TONY reaches out to take it, it's gone.

     TONY.

     PARNASSUS and CO are preparing to move out and do a show.

     ANTON is working near PARNASSUS and PERCY who are unaware of
     his presence.

                          DR. PARNASSUS
                What's eating Anton?

     ANTON pricks up his ears.

                          PERCY
                He's in love with Valentina?

                          DR. PARNASSUS
                    (dumbfounded)
                In love....?

                          PERCY
                It happens.

                          DR. PARNASSUS
                The little snake! I'll skin him
                alive!

     CUT TO ANTON who winces.

                          PERCY
                While you're at it, don't forget
                the other one.

     DR. PARNASSUS looks at PERCY questioningly.

                          PERCY (CONT'D)
                The viper, the scorpion, the
                amnesiac boa constrictor. Tony.

                          DR. PARNASSUS
                Quite another kettle of fish.

                            PERCY
                Really?

                          DOCTOR PARNASSUS
                He's ambitious, energetic... a man
                of destiny.




                                                       (CONTINUED)

                                                                61.

                            PERCY
                      (ironic)
                  And he's going to help us win five
                  souls.

                            DR. PARNASSUS
                  I think he might. Valentina sees
                  good in him.

                            PERCY
                  She'd be better off with Anton.

     CUT TO ANTON who's pleased.

                            DR. PARNASSUS
                  Perhaps I should offer her hand to
                  whoever helps most in winning the
                  next five souls.

     CUT TO ANTON who looks puzzled.

                            PERCY
                  That's even worse than the other
                  ideas you've had today.

                            DR. PARNASSUS
                      (sighs)
                  You're not wrong... Ah, Percy, what
                  would I do without you?

                            PERCY
                  Get a midget.

     CUT TO ANTON as he moves, thoughtfully, away.


44   EXT   OUTSIDE PUB       NIGHT                              44

     The theatre, parked outside a pub, is up and running.

     ANTON, as Mercury, is doing his pitch.

                               ANTON
                  Sleep no more. Procrastinate no
                  longer. Embrace this once in a life-
                  time opportunity. Let the mind of
                  Doctor Parnassus be the portal to
                  the infinite world of your
                  imagination.

     Behind the curtain, PERCY is signalling VALENTINA to see if
     DOCTOR PARNASSUS has been drinking. She sniffs him.


                                                         (CONTINUED)

                                                                  62.
44   CONTINUED:                                                  44


                            DOCTOR PARNASSUS
                  What are you doing? Please
                  concentrate. We've got a tremendous
                  amount of work to do tonight. A
                  great deal depends on it.

     A roll on the drums from PERCY. The curtain rises. DOCTOR
     PARNASSUS `floats' above the stage on his glass plinth.

                            ANTON
                  As old as the universe itself, the
                  great Doctor, versed in every
                  mystic practice known to man, and
                  many more besides, will guide you
                  to your destiny.

     However, the AUDIENCE - a few PASSERS-BY and DRINKERS who
     have drifted out of the pub for a smoke - aren't much
     interested in ANTON. Instead they pay more attention to the
     masked TONY who, decked out in a stylish costume, is working
     the sparse crowd with his smooth charm.

     ANTON, irritated, glances back at DOCTOR PARNASSUS who is
     worried about the lack of customers.

     TONY is now surrounded by fascinated WOMEN. They laugh at one
     of his jokes. One pretty young woman, SALLY, in particular
     seems to be smitten by the handsome `actor'. TONY smiles
     seductively at her.

     The sight provokes ANTON. He leaps off the stage, grabs SALLY
     by the wrist and begins to pull her to the stage.

     PERCY keeps playing.

                            SALLY
                      (laughing)
                  What?... Hey, what you doing?

                            ANTON
                  T-taking you to the heart of your
                  imagination!

     ANTON is trying to compete with TONY but just can't manage
     the charm.

                            SALLY
                      (good humoured)
                  Oh my god! No way!

                            ANTON
                  You won't regret it!

                                                           63.

                         FEMALE FRIEND
               Go for it Sal!

                         SALLY
                   (indicating friend)
               Only if she comes with me.

                         FEMALE FRIEND
                   (enthusiastic)
               Now you're talking!

     A few ONLOOKERS cheer.

                         ANTON
               N-not at the same time!

     ANTON is still pulling SALLY onto the stage.

                         SALLY
               I'm not going on my own.

                          ANTON
               Your imagination is a very special
               place. Doctor Parnassus will make
               it flower.

                         SALLY
               I bet he will.

     More laughs.

                         FEMALE FRIEND
               We'll do it together.

     More laughs.

                         ANTON
                   (shakes his head)
               No. T-two c-competing imaginations
               in the Imaginarium at the same
               time... it's n-not advisable.

                         FEMALE FRIEND
               Eh?

                         ANTON
               The stronger imagination will
               overcome the weaker and then
               there's n-no knowing what might
               happen.

                         FEMALE FRIEND
               That's really stupid.

                          SALLY
               Let go!

                         ANTON
               D-don't be afraid, d-dear lady.
               You'll be safe with me.

     Anton sweeps her off her feet and carries her onto the stage.

                         SALLY
               Put me down!

                         ANTON
               Have no fear.

                         FEMALE FRIEND
               She doesn't want to do it on her
               own!

                          ANTON
               Only b-because she d-doesn't
               realize...

                         FEMALE FRIEND
               Let go of her you silly pillock!

     VALENTINA, worried, steps forward to try and restrain ANTON.

                          VALENTINA
               Anton...

                         ANTON
               It's alright! It's alright!

     Staggering under the weight of the struggling SALLY, ANTON
     barges into DOCTOR PARNASSUS' on his glass plinth.

     The plinth rocks and teeters. VALENTINA tries to stop it
     falling.

     ANTON, unaware of what he's done, disappears through the
     mirror as DOCTOR PARNASSUS crashes head first onto the stage.
     Crack!

     From behind the mirror comes the sound of a woman's
     terrifying, terrified screams.

               SALLY! They've got her in there!
               That's her screaming! SAL! They
               doing something to her! SALLY!
               Help, somebody! Help! Save her!

     Upstage VALENTINA tends the stunned DOCTOR. He clutches his
     head in pain.

                         VALENTINA
               Father! Father!


45   INT/EXT   THE MIND OF DR. PARNASSUS   THAT MOMENT            45

     Terrified, ANTON and the screaming SALLY are spun through a
     black void clinging desperately to an asteroid as planets and
     stars spin madly around them.

     Blood-red lightning bolts crackle and crash. Chaos.


46   EXT   OUTSIDE PUB   THAT MOMENT                              46

     Out front, the CROWD, larger now, is reacting badly to the
     dreadful screams. Sally's friends try to storm the stage.

     TONY and PERCY try to hold them back.

                         TONY
               Please. Everything's alright. It's
               okay. Really. I promise you.

     A MIDDLE AGED WOMAN hits him with her handbag.

     TONY and PERCY are in danger of being overwhelmed. We can
     still hear Sally screaming from somewhere within the stage.

                         TONY (CONT'D)
               Ladies and gentlemen. Ladies and
               gentlemen....please...

     A DRUNK takes a swing at PERCY, misses, and connects with
     TONY.

                         TONY (CONT'D)
               Ugh!

     He falls off the stage and disappears into the angry CROWD
     who begin pummelling and kicking him.

     PERCY, desperate, produces a pistol and fires a couple of
     shots into the air.

     EVERYONE dives for cover.

     PERCY, taking advantage of the temporary lull, begins to race
     around, untying, unhooking, and pulling on ropes.

     The theatre begins to close up as the horses bolt and the
     wagon clatters off down the street, bits falling off as it
     goes.

                            VOICE IN CROWD
                  Somebody call the police!

     A battered TONY, chased by the enraged crowd,just manages to
     clamber on board, with the help of VALENTINA.

     The wagon narrowly succeeds in out-pacing the fastest of the
     CROWD. As it disappears down the street, a figure is dumped
     unceremoniously out through the back door of the wagon.

     It's the terrified SALLY, sent sprawling in the middle of the
     road.

     A figure steps out from the shadows to help her to her feet.
     It's MR. NICK in his bowler and red waistcoat.


47   EXT.   RUBBISH TIP      NIGHT                                47

     A police siren howls as the wagon comes crashing around the
     corner of a great rubbish tip and clatters to a halt... the
     horses steaming, sections of the theatre hanging loose,
     broken..an utter mess. The siren fades into the distance.


48   INT/EXT   THEATRE/WAGON      NIGHT                           48

     Amongst collapsed scenery PARNASSUS lies in a heap. The
     others are struggling to their feet. ANTON is desperately
     trying to do something useful to help PARNASSUS but,
     VALENTINA pushes him out of the way.

                            VALENTINA
                  What were you thinking? Look what
                  you've done. Get out of the way!
                      (appealing to Tony)
                  Tony.

     TONY, battered and bleeding, helps her lift PARNASSUS and
     manoeuvre him to his room.

                  This is my punishment. All is lost.
                  First to Five. One down.
                  Impossible, Valentina. First to
                  five. One down. No people. No time,
                  Valentina. We are doomed.

                  Ssshhhh... Thanks, Tony. Leave us.

     TONY, nods, leaves slowly. Listening.


50   EXT.    WAGON    NIGHT                                        50

     PERCY is angrily banging about, trying to repair the damage.
     ANTON is trying to help but, is just getting in the way.

                            PERCY
                  Do me a favour. Take a long walk
                  off a short pier.

     TONY arrives.

                            TONY
                  Can I help?

                  Bugger off!

     TONY finds ANTON sitting despondently a short way from the
     wagon swigging from a bottle. He sits down next to him.

                            ANTON
                  L-leave me alone.

                      (incensed)
                  What are you suggesting?

                             TONY
                  Oh, c'mon...we all heard her
                  screaming.

                            ANTON
                  I was screaming as well.   It was t-
                  terrifying...

                            TONY
                  Terrifying? Why? I don't
                  understand.

                            ANTON
                      (reluctantly)
                  No, well...you wouldn't. You've n-
                  never been inside the D-Doctor's
                  mind have you?

                            TONY
                  Your not trying to tell me that
                  mind control stuff is real?

                            ANTON
                  You think it's some k-kind of scam,
                  d-don't you?

                              TONY
                  Isn't it?

                            ANTON
                  No... But I d-don't expect you to g-
                  get it... N-not in a million years.

                            TONY
                  Hang on.. if he can really control
                  people's minds, why isn't he ruling
                  the world? Why bother with this
                  crappy side show?

                            ANTON
                  He d-doesn't want to rule the world
                  d-does he?... He wants the world to
                  rule itself!

                            TONY
                  What a waste... Tell me about the
                  mirror. What's the point of that,
                  if not to razzle-dazzle the public?

                You're way off the mark.
                    (taking a swig)
                It's a b-bloody great mystery...
                wrapped in a b-brown p-paper b-bag
                enema...or do I mean, enigma...

     He pulls himself up and starts to stagger off.

                          TONY
                Er... one more thing....Does `first
                to five' mean anything to you?

     ANTON looks at TONY with loathing.

                          ANTON
                I thought you were the c-clever
                one.

     He walks away into the darkness.

     TONY sits there busily thinking.


51   EXT    RUBBISH TIP    DAWN                                51

     The morning light suffuses mountains of domestic refuse.
     Rubbish for as far as the eye can see. Plastic sacks of
     various colours, many spilling open. A few fires are burning.

     Flocks of scavenging sea gulls hover and dive, screaming blue
     murder.

     On one of the many pinnacles of garbage sits a lonely figure.
     It's ANTON, depressed, angry, forlorn.

     The CAMERA SWINGS ROUND to show, below ANTON, in a valley of
     waste material, the wagon.


52   EXT.   THE WAGON     DAWN                                 52

     PERCY has spread out the broken scenery assessing the damage.
     In the shadow of the wagon VALENTINA is changing TONY'S
     dressings.

                          VALENTINA
                Thank God it's only cuts and
                bruises. I thought we'd lost you.

                  If you hadn't been there...

     He holds her hand.    Looks deep into her eyes.

                            TONY (CONT'D)
                  Valentina, your father seems in a
                  terrible state. Is it the police?
                  The show? Maybe I can help.

                            VALENTINA
                  I don't know what's wrong with him,
                  but if it's about the show...I
                  don't care. I'm tired of it...let
                  the police arrest us. I'm sick of
                  living like this....

     She looks miserable. TONY puts his arms around her.   Holds
     her tightly to him.

                            TONY
                  Don't say that. What you're doing
                  is important. Really important.
                  It's just... maybe... it should be
                  done in a different way.

     He is about to kiss her.

                            DOCTOR PARNASSUS O/S
                  What sort of "different" way do you
                  suggest?

     DR. PARNASSUS, grim faced, head bandaged, steps from behind
     the wagon.

     TONY and VALENTINA quickly disengage.

                            TONY
                  Oh, hello, good morning sir. How
                  are you feeling? That was a nasty
                  bump on the head you got..

                            DOCTOR PARNASSUS O/S
                      (beady eyed)
                  "Different?"

                            TONY
                  Well, sir, I've been thinking...
                  It's clear the show's not
                  attracting many people. Forgive me
                  but... I see two ways of tackling
                  this problem.

               Either the style of the show is at
               fault... or the type of audience. I
               would suggest changing both.

     PERCY has appeared, dragging a damaged flat.

                         PERCY
               Change the show!? Who the fizzing
               hell do you think you are?......

                         DOCTOR PARNASSUS
               Shhh!

     He sits down heavily.

                         TONY
               I'm sorry but.. you're not modern.
               People want modern. Look.

     He holds open a tattered fashion magazine to a page of
     beautifully photographed models in a fabulously magical
     setting. He thumbs through more pages of dreamy images.

                         TONY (CONT'D)
               This is modern. It works. Trust me,
               I understand this world.
                   (with a wink)
               This kind of mind control. Let's
               try to meet the public halfway..
               the right public.. and in a better
               part of town.

     From behind the wagon ANTON watches forlornly.   Alone and
     unnoticed by the others.

                         PERCY
               What about the filth?

                         TONY
                   (puzzled)
               What?

                         PERCY
               The filth. The police.

                         TONY
               There'll be a better class of
               police too.

                         PERCY
               That'll be the day.

                The trick is not to hide. Change
                your colours. Be bold. Go where
                they would least expect to find
                you. I think we have been brought
                together for a reason. I don't
                believe in coincidence. You saved
                my life. Now let me do something
                in return.

     PARNASSUS confers with PERCY.

                          DOCTOR PARNASSUS
                Our time's nearly up... This could
                be what we need.

                           TONY
                    (to Valentina)
                This can be my birthday gift to
                Valentina.

     VALENTINA smiles and nods to PARNASSUS.

                          DR. PARNASSUS
                Well then...
                    (with a burst of energy)
                For God's sake let's do it!!!

                Yeah, okay, but what exactly do we

                          TONY
                Well... First of all, I want you to
                give me your money. All of it.

     What?!   PARNASSUS, PERCY, and VALENTINA look at each other.

     Then PARNASSUS sees something beyond the wagon...ANTON,
     downcast, heading off through the swirling plastic bags and
     flying rubbish... a battered suitcase in his hand.

                           DR. PARNASSUS
                Anton!   Where are you going?

     No answer from ANTON.

     VALENTINA runs after him but, he marches on silently.

               Are you trying to wreck my

     Anton stops, still not looking at VALENTINA he slowly drops
     his suitcase.

                         VALENTINA (CONT'D)
               Please. We need you.

     Moved, ANTON turns to her.   She smiles sweetly.

                         VALENTINA (CONT'D)
               How much money have you got?


53   EXT   BOND STREET   EVENING                                  53

     Close up on Parnassus's glass plinth..now open-topped and
     sitting on the edge of the stage... full of the troupe's
     savings. A sign proclaims "Please Take Generously"

     Directly behind the glass box is a half-globe with the
     continent of Africa featured. Sitting on top is Percy
     playing something ethnic but tasteful on a flute with one
     hand...his other is held out pathetically... a beggar. He's
     blacked up and dressed in rags. He doesn't look happy. He
     sneaks nervous glances at the glass box of money.

     The wagon, newly painted in sleek and stylish black and
     white, stands in Bond Street or some similarly fashionable
     street with expensive shops and art galleries. RICH WOMEN
     anxious to be conspicuous in their consumption of wealth
     glide past.

     New signs proclaim `The Choice Is Yours' `The Imaginarium -
     More Exclusive than ever'.

     The stage, hung with soft,flowing, gauzy fabric, has been
     chromatically divided in half - one side black, the other
     white.

     On the dark side a bloated, sun-glassed woman consuming vast
     quantities of food reclines on an elaborate lounge. She is,
     in fact, a very uncomfortable ANTON in full and fulsome drag.

     Center stage stands DR. PARNASSUS dressed as a stylized
     doctor with head reflector. In his hand is a staff with an
     elaborate sun on the top. He is blindfolded.

     On the white side of the stage stands the mirror and a
     stylized Tree of Knowledge with bright red apples. Under the
     tree, and reflected in the mirror, sits VALENTINA as
     Eve...naked except for a long wig that maintains her modesty.
     She gracefully combs her hair.

     Above the mirror is a sign proclaiming "The Naked Truth".

     DR. PARNASSUS, peeking under his blindfold, is distinctly
     uncomfortable by his daughter's lack of attire.

     TONY, in a beautifully cut white suit, and wearing his
     `romantic' Venetian carnival mask sits in profile in a dreamy
     pose on the edge of the white side of the stage.

     Nobody speaks. They pay no attention to the crowd.

     A few women stop, curious. One of them takes out some money
     and puts it in the glass plinth and turns to go.

                            TONY
                      (retrieving the money)
                  Excuse me, madam. I'm afraid we
                  can't accept this.

     The woman stops, confused. Tony hands her back her money.

                            TONY (CONT'D)
                  We are here to give...not take. We
                  are here to help those in need. If
                  it's money you need, then here it
                  is.
                      (referring to the glass
                       plinth)
                  If it's the flowering of the soul
                  you need, then here we are but,
                  unfortunately we are booked solid
                  at the moment. But thank you.. I
                  can see you have a generous spirit.

     TONY returns to his pensive pose.    The women look at each
     other.

                            WOMAN
                  Excuse me but, how does this work?
                  What does it cost?

               How long does that take?   I'm
               running late.

                         TONY
               Madam, why should you care about
               time? What are your dreams worth in
               minutes?

     The women grow pensive.

                         TONY (CONT'D)
               There are hard choices to be made
               in life.
                   (he indicates the
                    tableaux)
               What about the dreams of the less
               fortunate in the world. Do you
               have time for their dreams? Or are
               you like I once was...do you just
               despair? Despair at all that is
               wrong in the world..
                   (getting to his feet)
               ...despair at your inability to do
               anything to change it.. to make it
               better...I despaired so much at the
               powerlessness of my own existence
               that I took the easy way out...the
               coward's way...I committed suicide!
               Yes, that's right, I killed myself.
               Can you understand my despair? But
               I was saved...saved by a
               miracle...The Imaginarium...and
               Doctor Parnassus. He brought me
               back from the dead. He gave me a
               new life. A reason to live. He has
               given me power to dream again... to
               dream of a better world.

     During his speech, more and more people have gathered. Some
     are actually weeping. They are press forward putting money
     in the plinth. Tony tries to stop them but, they insist.
     VALENTINA, ANTON, PERCY, and DR. PARNASSUS are astonished by
     TONY'S performance.

               Please, I'm sorry but, we're booked
               solid at the moment.

     A Louis Vuitton-dressed woman (60+ years old)at the back of
     the crowd shouts:

                         LOUIS VUITTON WOMAN
               Is that child up for adoption?

     She points at the blacked up PERCY.

                         LOUIS VUITTON WOMAN (CONT'D)
               I want to adopt that unfortunate
               black child. It shouldn't be
               working like this. It should be in
               school.

     PERCY is appalled.

                         LOUIS VUITTON WOMAN (CONT'D)
               Who's in charge here?

     The LOUIS VUITTON WOMAN looks around as a couple of POLICE
     OFFICERS arrive on the scene.

     TONY spots them too and heads off the LOUIS VUITTON WOMAN as
     she makes towards them.

                         TONY
               Madam, congratulations, you have
               been chosen.

     The other WOMEN gasp.

                          LOUIS VUITTON WOMAN
               What?

                         TONY
               Come forward and enter the
               Imaginarium.

                         LOUIS VUITTON WOMAN
               But, I haven't paid.

               We don't want your money. We want
               your hopes and dreams. You may make
               a donation later, if you wish.

                         LOUIS VUITTON WOMAN
               But...

                         TONY
               This is a rare moment. Very few are
               chosen. Don't miss this once-in-a-
               life-time opportunity. This way.
               Please.

     He ushers the uneasy LOUIS VUITTON WOMAN onto the stage and
     guides her upstage. PARNASSUS goes into his trance.

                         TONY (CONT'D)
               Believe me Madam, you're the
               luckiest woman in the world.

     The LOUIS VUITTON WOMAN steps into the mirror. TONY
     hesitates..a moment of uncertainty. VALENTINA encourages him
     with a smile. He steps through.

     Across the street a clock begins striking the hour.

     CUT TO the two POLICE OFFICERS who start to move the crowd
     and show on.

                          POLICEMAN
               Alright, I think it's time to move
               on, folks.

     But on spotting the naked VALENTINA who winks at them, they
     agree between themselves to give the show a bit longer.


54   INT/EXT   IMAGINARIUM                                        54

     TONY and THE LOUIS VUITTON WOMAN are astonished to find
     themselves in the romantic, soft-focus, pastel-colour setting
     of a soothing, sophisticated, shampoo commercial.

     Soft fabrics waft, cleansing waterfalls cascade, rose-petals
     float through the air, beautiful girls swing from swings
     attached to clouds - all in delicious slow motion.

                         LOUIS VUITTON WOMAN
                   (overcome)
               Oh... how gorgeous...

54   CONTINUED:                                                  54


     THE LOUIS VUITTON WOMAN takes TONY'S hand and looks at him
     meaningfully.

     TONY, disorientated, takes a moment to regain his composure.
     He smiles and, with an effort, puts his arm around THE LOUIS
     VUITTON WOMAN'S wide waist. He looks into her eyes. She's in
     love.

                            LOUIS VUITTON WOMAN (CONT'D)
                      (moans softly)
                  Ohhh... What bliss... and I don't
                  even know your name...

                            TONY
                  Tony...

                            LOUIS VUITTON WOMAN
                  Tony. How dashing.

     A bar or two of tango encourages them to take a couple of
     intimate tango dance steps.

     Now gently wafting curtains part to reveal.. down a flower
     strewn path and over a bridge... a sleazy motel with a
     shingle over the door reads: "The One Night Stand Motel". In
     the office window sits MR. NICK

                            LOUIS VUITTON WOMAN (CONT'D)
                  Oh, goodness me!

     She bats her eyelashes at TONY and begins, knowingly, to pull
     him towards the motel.

                            TONY
                      (resisting)
                  If I'm not wrong, I fear you must
                  go alone.

     THE LOUIS VUITTON WOMAN pouts playfully, pulling him onwards.

                            LOUIS VUITTON WOMAN
                  Why would I want to go without you
                  darling?

                            TONY
                  It's one of the rules... One
                  imagination at a time, free from
                  the influence of another.

                            LOUIS VUITTON WOMAN
                      (petulant)
                  Boring.

     They have reached the bridge. Stairs descend to a stream.

                         TONY
               Oh..look... another possibility..

     Below them a gondola rests in the stream as small, flower
     bedecked barques float past with framed pictures of romantic
     heroes who died young; Keats, Shelly, Byron, James Dean,
     Rudolph Valentino, Marilyn Monroe, Buddy Holly, Princess
     Diana... the stream continues off into the distance to a
     dark, towering Egyptian pyramid.

     TONY is as bemused as THE LOUIS VUITTON WOMAN.

                         TONY (CONT'D)
               You must make a choice...and...
               actually, to be honest, I'd
               strongly recommend this one.

                         LOUIS VUITTON WOMAN
               But... Rudolph Valentino, James
               Dean, Princess Di?... all these
               people... they're dead.

                         TONY
                   (thinking fast)
               Exactly. To be reborn, first you
               must die. All of them have achieved
               a kind of immortality. And we love
               them all the more for it. They
               won't get old or fat. They won't
               get sick or feeble. They are beyond
               fear. They are forever young. They
               are gods. And you can join them.

                         LOUIS VUITTON WOMAN
                   (softening)
               You're such a wonderful speaker.

     The gondola awaits....with a beautiful male model at the
     helm. THE LOUIS VUITTON WOMAN smiles at him.

                         TONY
               There's not a moment to lose.

     But as she hesitates a dark shadow rises over them. TONY,
     looking past the WOMAN"S shoulder, sees the dark waters of
     the stream rise up transforming into a GIGANTIC KING COBRA
     that towers menacingly over them. It's wearing a BOWLER
     HAT... and it's angry.

                But your sacrifice must be pure.
                You have to let go of all these
                worldly goods.

     He helps THE LOUIS VUITTON WOMAN remove her necklace,
     earrings, bracelets, rings, broach, in double quick time and
     guides her onto the gondola, blowing a kiss after her.

                          TONY (CONT'D)
                Remember nothing is permanent...
                not even death.

     He turns back to see the GIGANTIC KING COBRA shrinking back
     below the bridge, transforming itself back into the waters of
     the stream. From under the arch of the bridge hangs a rope.
     At its end.. a hangman's noose.

     TONY stares at it darkly disconcerted.


55   EXT.   STAGE     EVENING                                  55

     TONY re-enters the stage through the mirror, looking at DR.
     PARNASSUS who has just come out of his trance with
     astonishment

                          TONY
                    (gobsmacked)
                That was so... I had no idea...
                It's just... incredible.

     ...And then he realizes the clock is still striking the hour
     realizing that only a few moments have passed since he
     entered the mirror.

                          TONY (CONT'D)
                ..how do you do this?

                          DOCTOR PARNASSUS
                    (ignoring him and with a
                     big theatrical gesture)
                Hooplah!

     The LOUIS VUITTON woman reappears, sitting on a cut-out cloud
     descending from the ceiling of the stage. She looks radiant.

     She is weeping, completely overcome by her experience.
     PARNASSUS steps forward and helps her to her feet. She kisses
     his hands in gratitude.

                            LOUIS VUITTON WOMAN
                  Thank you, thank you, that was so
                  beautiful, I feel so... thank you so
                  much...

                            DOCTOR PARNASSUS

                  Thank YOU, dear Lady, you give me
                  strength to continue

     Born again, tearful but transcendent, the LOUIS VUITTON WOMAN
     produces her cheque book and begins to write a cheque.

     TONY is frozen, confused. The crowd is still... stunned by
     the LOUIS VUITTON WOMAN's transformation as she deposits the
     cheque, her handbag, her expensive coat in the glass box and
     glides benignly through the crowd... which parts in awe.

     Pause... and then the other WOMEN rush the stage. Mayhem is
     narrowly averted as TONY and PERCY manage to coral them into
     a more-or-less orderly queue.

     Across the street, standing in the doorway of a shop selling
     luxury goods, is MR NICK. He watches events, intrigued...

     ...as TONY escorts a second woman through the mirror, and a
     third, they descend, ecstatic, emptying the contents of their
     handbags, their pearls, earrings and diamond rings into the
     glass box.

     TONY pays off the cops who move on.

     TONY, getting more and more flamboyant, forgets to lower his
     mask each time he re-enters the stage. And now a fourth woman
     descends. Four successes for DOCTOR PARNASSUS.

                            DR. PARNASSUS
                      (aside to Percy)
                  One more to go and we're free.

     DOCTOR PARNASSUS spots MR NICK across the street, smiles,
     holds up four fingers.

     MR NICK gives a little `I'm not impressed' smirk and turns
     away and pretends to be interested in the luxury goods in the
     shop window as four large dark heavy RUSSIAN MEN, all laden
     with luxury shopping walk past.

     One of the RUSSIANS stops..looking at the show..at TONY whose
     mask is sitting on top of his head. The leading RUSSIAN
     pulls him on.

               C'mon..What are you watching that

               Who are you talking about?

                    finger)
               Impossible.

                           SERGE (IN RUSSIAN)
               I'm sure.

     They start pushing through the crowd.

     TONY, reaching down to help an elderly lady up to the stage,
     looks up and sees the RUSSIANS heading through the crowd..

     Panic!! He pulls the mask down and begins to back up.

     But it's too late, they've definitely seen him.

     He spins around and rockets upstage, past DR. PARNASSUS who
     is deep into his trance.

     TONY dives through the mirror much to the amazement of
     VALENTINA, ANTON, PERCY.

     The RUSSIANS chase after him, shoving the queuing WOMEN
     aside, smashing the scenery and knocking ANTON into the
     wings.


56   INT/EXT   SHAMPOO COMMERCIAL LANDSCAPE                    56

     The RUSSIANS charge through the shampoo-commercial landscape.
     No TONY.. Just slo-mo fashion models and soft wafting fabrics
     and aromatic breezes.

                         VLADIMIR (IN RUSSIAN)
               Where did he go?

                         PIOTR (IN RUSSIAN)
               You tell me... It can't be him.

               So why did he run?

                            GREGOR (IN RUSSIAN)
                  There he is!!

     In the distance, TONY is hiding behind some billowing fabric.
     On being spotted, he takes off up a hill.

     The RUSSIANS race toward the hill only to crash into a solid
     wall - painted as a landscape with TONY frozen in mid stride.
     Looking off to their right they see Tony heading up another
     hill. But as they rush in that direction another wall rises
     up blocking them. Again it is painted with a hill and TONY
     frozen in midstride. A third and fourth wall rise up..
     surrounding and trapping the RUSSIANS.

     There is a cell door in one wall. Like crazy animals they
     start throwing themselves against the door trying to break it
     down. It won't budge.

     While the others batter the door, GREGOR, who has been
     somewhat affected by the soft shampoo commercial world, sits
     quietly in a corner picking pretty flowers.

     Exhausted, the other RUSSIANS collapse on the ground.

     GREGOR gently breathes in the aroma of the flowers and
     exhales. As he does the door swings open. The other RUSSIANS
     gape at him... then barrel out the door.

     Outside is a new, beautiful, landscape - the sky dotted with
     white fluffy clouds. Extending from the ground to each cloud
     is an incredibly long ladder. On each ladder is a person
     climbing upwards.

     The RUSSIANS spot Tony. He is already a hundred feet up a
     ladder and climbing.

     Unfortunately, their way is blocked by an over-bright, hyper-
     active, wide-eyed sales girl.

                            SALES-GIRL

     The RUSSIANS roughly shove her aside.     As they rush past,
     GREGOR pauses, hands her his flowers.

                            GREGOR
                  Relax...smell the flowers.

     Reaching the base of TONY'S ladder, the RUSSIANS start
     climbing.

     Seeing the threat, TONY kicks hard and breaks the rungs below
     him.. setting off a domino effect with more rungs breaking
     downward towards the RUSSIANS. Snap! Crack! Rungs break in
     their grasp.. they fall.

     The RUSSIANS land in a tangled heap as the domino effect
     continues down to the base of the ladder.

     Laughing down at them, TONY turns to continue climbing - only
     to see the domino effect heading down from the top of the
     ladder... towards him.

     THE LADDER COMPLETELY SEPARATES IN TWO.

     Tony struggles to maintain his balance - and somehow manages
     to get his feet on the two halves of a broken rung. Then, as
     if he were on giant stilts, starts to stride away.

     The RUSSIANS chase after him but, his giant strides leave
     them far behind. Smugly, TONY looks back just as one of the
     legs of his ladder snags on a fallen log. He loses his
     balance... and plunges hundreds of feet earthward.

     From nowhere, ANTON (still dressed as a fat woman) appears..
     running to catch the plummeting TONY. He does and Whomp!!..
     is flattened. Knocked out cold. TONY is unscathed.. his fall
     broken by ANTON'S padding.

     But, the RUSSIANS arrive, grab TONY, start to beat him up.

                          SERGE
               You thieving scumbag! We break
               every bone in your body!

     They scrawl strange symbols on TONY'S forehead.

                         TONY
               No! Wait! I can explain! Give me a
               chance!

                         VLADIMIR
               We want our money or you die again!
               This time for good!

     ANTON struggles to his feet.

                         ANTON
               Stop it! L-leave him alone!

     The RUSSIANS turn and, thinking ANTON is a fat, bossy, middle-
     aged woman, hesitate.

                         ANTON (CONT'D)
               Stand b-back! I'm warning you!

     Foolishly, he whips off his wig and assumes a manly martial
     arts pose. The RUSSIANS look at each other. Then, utterly
     ignoring ANTON, turn their attention back to beating TONY.

     GREGOR walks calmly over to ANTON who is in attack mode.

                         GREGOR
                   (bending down and picking
                    a flower, he offers it to
                    ANTON)
               Relax. Smell the flowers.

     Confused, ANTON takes the flower, sniffs and then... GREGOR
     floors him with a powerful punch on the nose

     Meanwhile, the RUSSIANS have a noose around TONY's neck and
     have looped the rope over a tree branch. TONY struggles to
     pull out the metal pipe he keeps on a string around his neck.
     He gets it to his mouth as if to swallow it when...

     ... the ground erupts and a giant London policeman's helmet
     rises up (we are talking 20 feet tall)and revolves -
     revealing DR. PARNASSUS' carved and painted face beneath.

     The mouth drops open and a great red tongue rolls out like a
     welcoming red carpet. From inside the giant mouth a smiling
     policeman beckons the RUSSIANS to come on in..

     The terrified RUSSIANS let go of the lynching rope.

     TONY drops to the ground and, with a whistle, the brass pipe
     flies out of his mouth.

     Behind the RUSSIANS a painted backdrop unfurls..it reads
     "JOIN THE FUZZ.. WE LOVE VIOLENCE".. and a chorus line of
     LONG-LEGGED GIRLS in mini-skirted police outfits appear -
     high-kicking a snappy song and dance number.

     The astonished RUSSIANS don't know what the fuck is going on.

     Suddenly, a friendly OLD WOMAN'S VOICE is heard shouting
     something in Russian.

     Spinning around, the RUSSIANS see an old BABOUSHKA (Russian
     grandmother) outside a tumble-down cottage waving gaily to
     them. A stunned pause. Then, pell-mell, they rush to her.


                                                       (CONTINUED)

                           RUSSIANS (IN RUSSIAN)
                Mama!   Mama! Help! Save us!

     As they run toward her they get smaller and smaller. She
     lifts her skirts and all four disappear underneath. And
     then.. BOOM!.. a muffled explosion balloons the skirts
     outward. Smoke spews out from below.

     Straightening her skirt, the BABOUSHKA looks up, and pulls
     off her head - revealing MR.NICK's tiny head poking out of
     the collar. He smiles smugly.

     The giant POLICEMAN DR. PARNASSUS registers disappointment
     and, like a balloon rapidly deflating, spins off into the sky
     sending up a cloud of dust obscuring everything.

     The dust clears and TONY and ANTON find themselves in a
     desolate, empty landscape. Nowhere. Nothing.

                          TONY
                Did you see me!! I almost reached
                the clouds! I could have...it was
                incredible...I was almost there...

                           ANTON
                Shut up!

     Over a distant rise the wagon appears, pulled by the horses.
     ANTON drags Tony, babbling and stumbling, towards it.

                          TONY
                I made my choice and I climbed... I
                felt so much potential. I could
                have done anything. I have to have
                another chance...another go...I
                need this...


57   EXT   SOMEWHERE DOWN RIVER - MUD FLATS   EVENING             57

     The wagon is parked on waste ground. It looms out of nowhere
     illuminated by a light leaking from within.

     We hear PERCY'S angry voice.

                          PERCY O/S
                Maybe you were holding them upside

58   INT   THE STAGE - CONTINUOUS                                58

     The angry troupe huddles amongst the clutter of props and
     jumbled scenery. TONY is on trial.

     DR. PARNASSUS is sitting in a corner, head in hands. He seems
     utterly destroyed.

                            ANTON
                  You're a l-liar. You've been lying
                  to us all along. Who are you? Who
                  were those thugs?

                            TONY
                  I am not a liar!

                            ANTON
                  No?

                            TONY
                  No! I just... didn't divulge
                  everything I knew.

                            PERCY
                  Comes to the same thing.

                            TONY
                  Absolutely not. Not in law.

                            ANTON
                  You stole their money.

                            TONY
                  No. I didn't.

                            ANTON
                  That's what they said.

                  Are you going to believe them
                  before you believe me?

                             PERCY
                  Why not?

                            TONY
                  Because they're irredeemably bad
                  people, and I'm essentially good. I
                  know that sounds terribly prim and
                  arrogant and self righteous, but
                  I'm trying to be honest. Look, the
                  truth is... in order to get my
                  charity off the ground I needed
                  capital.

     ANTON looks askance.

                            TONY (CONT'D)
                      (in response to Anton)
                  Yes, I know, and you're right, but
                  that's the way the grown-up..the
                  real world works. You can't make
                  omelettes without soiling your
                  hands. Or should that be the other
                  way round? Anyway, I - with
                  hindsight very foolishly - accepted
                  a loan from people who seemed to
                  me, at the time, to be very decent
                  and sincere. There was absolutely
                  no way I could have known that they
                  were part of a ruthless organised
                  crime syndicate and that they
                  wanted to use my charity to launder
                  money. I made a mistake. And I have
                  to live with that. I'm sorry. What
                  more can I say?

               What?

               The first time they hung you from
               the b-bridge... right?... B-because
               you stole their money.

                         TONY
               Stop saying that! I didn't steal
               it! I didn't have it. I'd had to
               invest in infrastructure. I needed
               more time. When you run a charity
               you have to give lots of money
               away. You wouldn't believe the red
               tape. The Charity Commission are a
               bunch of fascists. It's incredible.
               I mean... c'mon give me a break...I
               almost died today.. and I said I'm
               sorry... and anyway..... this was
               supposed to be a special day...it's
               Valentina's birthday.

     He pulls out the LOUIS VUITTON WOMAN'S beautiful necklace

               Happy birthday. For a beautiful
               woman.

     He puts it around Valentina's neck. VALENTINA smiles.   ANTON

               It's too late... for visitors.

     Once more someone knocks. Everyone is edgy. Particularly
     PERCY.

     The knock comes again.

                         PERCY
                   (sotto voce, agitated)
               Please can we answer the door? I
               can't stand not answering the door,
               or the telephone, or whatever. It's
               not in my nature. I won't sleep for
               weeks if we don't answer the door!
               Sorry!

     DR. PARNASSUS gets up, goes to the door, opens it and steps
     outside, closing the door behind him.

     VALENTINA, ANTON, PERCY and TONY exchange looks.

59   EXT   OUTSIDE THE WAGON    THAT MOMENT                       59

     DR. PARNASSUS and MR NICK move away from the door and go
     around to the front. The stage is half-opened.

     The horses are standing steaming nearby.

                         DR. PARNASSUS
                   (very down)
               I know... It's over....you've
               won...

                         MR NICK
               Four rotten Russkies?

                         DR. PARNASSUS
               And the girl..from the pub.

     MR NICK shakes his head.

                         MR NICK
               Sally doesn't count.    Do you, gal?

     SALLY (the woman thrown out from the wagon as they escaped
     from the pub mob) steps out of the shadows, puts her arms
     around NICK

                         DR. PARNASSUS
               You're joking... toying with me.
               Like a cat with a mouse... As is
               your privilege.

                         MR NICK
               Sal didn't get to make a real
               choice. You were gaga. Out for the
               count. Wouldn't be fair...And
               you've got four, thanks to your
               friend Tony. So... we're even...
               it's not quite over.

     He smiles, lights a cigarette, takes a deep drag...

                          MR NICK (CONT'D)
               Not quite.
                   (checks his watch)
               Oh,oh, look at the time...it's 11.


                                                       (CONTINUED)

                                                               92.
59   CONTINUED:                                               59


     ...and he wanders off into the darkness with SALLY.
     Somewhere, a clock strikes 11.

     DR. PARNASSUS, agitated, watches him go.

                               VALENTINA (V.O.)
                  Father?

     DR. PARNASSUS looks round to find VALENTINA standing next to
     him. He starts to round up the horses.

                            DOCTOR PARNASSUS
                  Valentina... my darling girl. We
                  must do another show! Now! Quickly!
                  Get ready to move out!

                            VALENTINA
                  Who was that?

                            DOCTOR PARNASSUS
                  Somebody asking the way. Where's
                  Tony?

                            VALENTINA
                  I overheard you... He wasn't asking
                  the way.

                            DOCTOR PARNASSUS
                  Please! Get everybody together.
                  Another show! Tony! Percy!

                            VALENTINA
                  I want to know what's going on.

                            DOCTOR PARNASSUS
                      (harnessing the horses)
                  Not now.

                            VALENTINA
                  Yes, now! I want to know the truth!

                               DOCTOR PARNASSUS
                  The truth?

                            VALENTINA
                  What are you hiding?

                            DOCTOR PARNASSUS
                  There are more important things, at
                  this moment!

                         VALENTINA
               It's something to do with that
               bloody rambling story you were
               telling me the night we found Tony
               isn't it?

     PARNASSUS sighs. Stops. He checks his watch

                         DOCTOR PARNASSUS
               Yes.

                         VALENTINA
               So tell me.

                         DOCTOR PARNASSUS
               What I told you was... the truth.
               I really am thousands of years old.
               I have been immortal. I have been
               mortal. And I have had many
               dealings with the devil. Too many.

                         VALENTINA
                   (fearful)
               What are you saying?...

                         DOCTOR PARNASSUS
               Remember the woman I was telling
               you about?.. the one I was so
               desperately in love with.. so in
               love that I made a deal with the
               devil? That was your mother...
               ...she was so beautiful, so
               enchanting...so...

     Looking at VALENTINA, DR. PARNASSUS sees her morph into the
     BEAUTIFUL WOMAN appearing. He almost swoons.

                         DOCTOR PARNASSUS (CONT'D)
               ... so young. She was everything I
               had ever dreamed of. I made a
               choice. I bargained away my
               immortality. I regained my youth...
               and I won her. I did! I won her...!

     The BEAUTIFUL WOMAN morphs back into VALENTINA.

                         DOCTOR PARNASSUS (CONT'D)
               ...but at a price...

     DR. PARNASSUS looks haggard. He closes his eyes. He sways and
     loses his balance.

     VALENTINA stops him from falling.

                         VALENTINA
               What price?

                         DR. PARNASSUS
                   (anguished)
               It's too terrible...

                            VALENTINA
               Tell me...

                         DR. PARNASSUS
               I... The price of my obsession...
                   (he groans)
               I can't say it.

                            VALENTINA
               Say it.

                            DR. PARNASSUS
               You.

                            VALENTINA
               What?

                         DR. PARNASSUS
               I was mortal again... on condition
               that... any children I fathered...
               would, on their sixteenth
               birthday... belong to him.

                         VALENTINA
                   (stunned)
               Him?...

     VALENTINA can't take it in.

                         VALENTINA (CONT'D)
               But... didn't...

                         DR. PARNASSUS
               Your mother never knew. She died
               before I had to tell her.

                         VALENTINA
               I don't believe this! It can't be
               true. It's just another of your
               wretched stories... A cruel story!

                            DR. PARNASSUS

               Why do you say these things?

                         DR. PARNASSUS
               It's true. Every word. But all is
               not lost.

     VALENTINA looks at him.

                         DR. PARNASSUS (CONT'D)
                   (feverishly)
               A new wager... The first of five.
               If I win... you're free... you're
               mine again.. and we can win!
               Where's Tony? We can still win!

                         VALENTINA

                         DR. PARNASSUS
               With one more show. The day isn't
               over.

                            VALENTINA
               No!

               Valentina.

                         VALENTINA
               All my life you've made me play
               `Beauty', `Truth', `Justice'...
               filled my head with dreams and high
               ideals. All that crap! While... all
               the time...! The devil was right!
               You're arrogant! Vain and arrogant!
               I'm just another one of your stupid
               wagers!... You're beneath contempt.

     She rushes off into the dark night.

                          DR. PARNASSUS
               Valentina! That's not true! It's
               not like that! Wait! Come back!
               Valentina!

     A dark silhouette stands in the shadow of the wagon. It's
     TONY. What has he heard?

     DR. PARNASSUS rushes into the wagon.

     PERCY is already on his feet, having heard the DOCTOR
     shouting.

                         ANTON

               Valentina... She's... she's gone...

     ANTON rushes out.

     PERCY stops by DR. PARNASSUS before he exits.

                         PERCY
               Telling the truth... Always a bad
               idea.

     ANTON, running, calling for VALENTINA.

     PERCY is scouring the area on horseback.

     ANTON running though a newspaper-filled tip, sees a headline
     on one of the newspapers. Stops.


62   EXT   THE WAGON     A LITTLE LATER                         62

     PARNASSUS, a bottle in his hand, is lurching around.

               You fool! You monstrous fool!    You
               should be dead.

     He starts to violently bang his head against the side of the
     wagon.

     Suddenly the stage begins to unfold. PARNASSUS looks up,
     unable to see what or who is doing this. He drunkenly
     stumbles around the side to see TONY pulling ropes.

                  I overheard you. You only need one
                  more to win. Me! I'll be that one.
                  I'll take the risk to save
                  Valentina and, hopefully, you sir.
                  We've still got a few minutes.

     Tony steers DOCTOR PARNASSUS towards his glass column.

                            DOCTOR PARNASSUS
                  Yes! Yes! Of course! Of course!

               But...
                   (realizing Parnassus is

                    inability to go into a
                    trance)
               Why not?! What's wrong?

                         DR. PARNASSUS
               My mind... I can't concentrate...
               I'm too upset...

                         TONY
               You must do it! You have to do it!
               It's the only way to save your
               daughter!

                         DR. PARNASSUS
                   (distraught)
               I know...

                         TONY
                   (sitting PARNASSUS down)
               Concentrate. You must concentrate.
                   (clearing the way to the
                    mirror)
               I'll make the right choice. I'm
               sure of it. I can feel how right it
               is already.

     TONY leaps back to steady DR. PARNASSUS who looked as though
     he were about to topple off his pillar.

                         TONY (CONT'D)
               Oh God!... Doctor... We can save
               her.. you and me. I need this. We
               both need this. Please. The trance.

     PARNASSUS quiets down.   Starts mumbling.

     TONY rushes to the mirror. Steps through. He finds himself
     standing amongst the stage scenery. Nothing else.

                         TONY (CONT'D)
               Bugger!

     He steps back out of the mirror.    Goes to PARNASSUS who is
     weeping.

                         DR. PARNASSUS
               It's no good!

     TONY shakes him hard.

                         TONY
               PULL YOURSELF TOGETHER!... Sir.
               Concentrate...or you'll have lost
               her forever.

     PARNASSUS slowly goes into a sobbing kind of trance state.

     TONY confirms he is in a trance, then rushes to the mirror.

                         VALENTINA O/S
               Tony...oh, Tony..

     What?! TONY stops. Looks around. There in the shadows
     huddles VALENTINA, sobbing.

                         VALENTINA
                   (sobbing)
               It's useless... Hopeless... I
               thought I was strong, but I don't
               even know how to run away...

     TONY hesitates.. No time! He looks back to PARNASSUS who
     seems to still be in his trance. Hesitates. Then rushes to
     VALENTINA.

                         TONY
               It's alright... it's alright...
               Don't cry. It's going to be
               alright, believe me.

                         VALENTINA
               This stupid theatre...!... That's
               all I've ever known...! I've
               always believed it was something
               precious, but it's not... it's a
               lie...I hate it!

     TONY lifts her up, putting his arm around her.

                         TONY
               Everything's going to be alright...
               I'll take you away. I'll show you
               the world. My world. The great big
               beautiful world I've always dreamed
               of... You'll love it.

     VALENTINA, grateful, clings to TONY.

               Yes?


                            VALENTINA
               Maybe.

                         TONY
               C'mon then.

     They turn to the mirror but, an off-stage clearing of the
     throat makes them look round to see ANTON watching them. He's
     holding a torn and dirty piece of newspaper.

                         ANTON
               Ah, there you are, Tony. Here's
               something m-might interest you.
                   (reading)
               'Missing: D-disgraced head of
               children's charity'.

                            TONY
               No!

     TONY tries to snatch the paper but ANTON steps back.

                         ANTON
               N-not a bad p-picture, Tony.
               Listen to this Valentina... it's
               about Tony's b-beautiful world..

                            DOCTOR PARNASSUS O/S
               Valentina!     Where are you?

     PARNASSUS is still in his trance but, mumbling.

                         ANTON
               ...Anthony Shepherd, who was
               arrested last week on charges of...

     VALENTINA is surrounded. Confused.

                         TONY
                   (to Valentina)
               Valentina, Don't listen to that.
               I'm innocent. This is the work of
               people who are trying to destroy
               me! Evil people! Believe me! Look,
               I'll show you the truth!

     TONY pulls VALENTINA towards the mirror.

     ANTON tries to stop him, but TONY pushes him back, off the
     stage. He crashes to the ground.

                         TONY (CONT'D)
                   (grabbing VALENTINA)
               Hurry!

     TONY and VALENTINA disappear through the mirror.

               Valentina! Forgive me.


63   INT/EXT   DR. PARNASSUS' DRUNKEN IMAGINATION                 63

     Mist and rain descend as TONY and VALENTINA run through the
     darkened shapes of the shampoo-commercial landscape - now
     tattered, ragged, and wind blown. Darkness reigns.

                         TONY
               This isn't right. This is all
               wrong. Which way?

     Soaked and cold they spy a welcome sight. A uniformed valet
     with an open umbrella stands by the door of a sleek limo.

                         VALET
               Your car is here, Mr.Tony.

                         TONY
               Ah, Lester, just in time.

     TONY ducks under the umbrella and helps VALENTINA into the
     car ahead of himself.

     As she slides across the seat she notices the driver - bowler
     hatted and smoking a cigarette.

                         VALENTINA
               No! Tony, don't get in! Get away!

     She pushes TONY back and scrambles out...dragging him back
     out into the dark rain.

     The driver turns around.   It's MR.NICK.. looking vexed.

     VALENTINA and TONY struggle through the rain. Suddenly, they
     find themselves in deep water up to their chests. They are
     sinking. Through the mist they see a boat. It is the gondola
     that transported the LOUIS VUITTON LADY.

                           TONY
                  Help! Over here!

     The boatman turns the boat in their direction. TONY tries to
     pull himself on board. The boatman reaches down to help.

                            BOATMAN
                  Give me your hand

     It's MR. NICK.    VALENTINA recoils, drags TONY off the boat.

                            TONY
                  Stop! What are you doing!   We'll
                  drown!

                            VALENTINA
                  No we won't. This is the way.

     She points to jumbled rocks just visible in the darkness.
     They drag themselves onto them. The rocky monoliths appear
     to be the same as the landscape ANTON climbed over when he
     was searching for DIEGO, the son of THE FAMILY FROM HELL.

     And, like a repeat of that experience, from behind the ridge
     rises the Parnassus-faced Mongolfier balloon. But, now the
     eyes stream tears and rain pours down. In the basket is
     ANTON.

                            ANTON
                  Don't d-do it. Don't g-go on. Not
                  with him! He's all lies.

                            VALENTINA
                  Just like my father. Leave me
                  alone. I don't care anymore. I want
                  a new life.

                            TONY
                  Valentina...

     He pulls her away..towards a little tumble-down cottage. Warm
     candlelight glows in the windows, smoke curls from the
     chimney. They run to the door. TONY bangs on it. Someone
     can be heard unlatching the locks inside.

     A child's crying cuts through the wind.

     VALENTINA turns and sees a little girl sitting on the path...
     among flapping laundry. She rushes to her, tries to pick her
     up but, the little girl resists..

               Tony, help me, she's heavy.

     The door has just opened and TONY is halfway through.    He
     turns, irritated.

                         TONY
               What is it now?! Can't we just go
               inside and get dry.

     Behind him, in the warmth, stands the old BABOUSHKA.

     Seeing that VALENTINA is really struggling with the little
     girl, TONY reluctantly goes to help. The little girl, on
     seeing TONY, tries to break away but, he holds on to her.

                         TONY (CONT'D)
                   (shouting angrily)
               Ostanobuite bas menshi schit!

     The litle girl goes quiet. VALENTINA looks at TONY with
     surprise. The BABOUSHKA looks angry. Suddenly a light begins
     to suffuse TONY and the little girl. A small orchestra can
     be heard playing garden party music.

                         VALENTINA
               You did it! You made the right
               choice!

     The light fills the screen and we find...

     ...TONY, sleekly groomed and immaculately dressed, holding
     the smiling little girl. She too has been cleaned and
     buffed. The sun shines. He stands in...

     Behind and beyond them is an impressive country house.

     A small orchestra is playing. There is a marquee.

     WAITERS and WAITRESSES move amongst the assembled notables
     bearing trays of drinks and food.

     TONY is the focus of attention. A TV current-affairs/news
     JOURNALIST with CAMERA CREW is following him around.

                  Sustainability's great, if you can
                  achieve it. The problem is, in many
                  cases you simply can't, for a whole
                  variety of reasons.

     TONY smiles and shakes the hand of someone in a wheelchair.

     A GROUP OF GUESTS burst into spontaneous applause. Everybody
     loves and admires TONY. He smiles boyishly.

     He moves on. The TV CREW stay with him.

                            JOURNALIST
                  Aren't you running the risk of
                  entrenching the need for charity by
                  increasingly institutionalising it?

     up, she looks stunning.

     She and TONY exchange broad smiles. They're in love. He pulls
     her to his side and puts his arm around her. The
     photographers snap away.

                  And what's your message to the

                  I wouldn't presume to have a

                  Fortunately for the Foundation, I
                  think we pretty much see eye to eye
                  on most things.

     Now we hear a distant buzzing. EVERYBODY looks up.

     hands for THE TV CAMERAS.

     VALENTINA watches from a distance..ignored.

     A huge chandelier illuminates a grand ornate ballroom where
     wealthy guests, in evening dress, are being seated at tables
     by liveried ushers. Large beautiful photographs of the
     underprivileged children of the world line the walls. A
     great banner reads "Suffer The Little Children Benefit Ball"

     The PRIME MINISTER and his WIFE are seated at the head table,
     facing the dais, bubbly and expectant. Security is heavy.

     TONY is conferring with his speech writers and assistants as
     VALENTINA descends the staircase looking utterly stunning in
     a beautiful gown. TONY bows, romantically kissing her hand.
     He turns her to admire their reflections in a gilt
     mirror...the perfect, beautiful, dream couple.

                         TONY
               You look gorgeous, my love.   I knew
               you wouldn't let me down.

     The little girl, OLGA, and a little boy are brought forward.
     They are dressed in ethnic clothes. TONY takes OLGA'S
     hand...offers the little boy's hand to VALENTINA. She takes
     it in her own. The four of them start to walk to the door
     leading to the ballroom.

                         TONY (CONT'D)
                   (looking to everyone)
               This is a vitally important moment
               for the future of the Foundation.
               The children of the world are
               depending on us.

                  Anton!?

     TONY and VALENTINA look around. ANTON is nowhere to be seen
     but, his voice continues.

                            ANTON (V.O.)
                  All of this is false! It's nothing
                  to do with you! It's all him. It's
                  his imagination!

                            TONY
                  Call security, somebody.

                            ANTON (V.O.)
                  It's all rotten! A naked lie!
                  You've got to understand!

     The LITTLE BOY is tugging VALENTINA'S arm.       She looks down.
     It's ANTON. A child-size ANTON.

                            ANTON (CONT'D)
                  Look at this...

     He produces the newspaper with TONY'S photo and news story.

                            ANTON (CONT'D)
                  ...`Tony Liar'..

                             TONY
                  What?   How?...

     TONY lunges for him but, ANTON dodges out of the way.

                            ANTON

     Security guards have rushed in.

     TONY has grabbed little ANTON and starts hitting him.

                         TONY
               And now he doesn't stutter! You
               see!? It was all an act to get
               cheap sympathy!

                         VALENTINA
                   (pulling TONY off ANTON)
               Take your hands off him!! Stop it!

               Get off me! What are you doing?
                   (lashing out and hitting
                    VALENTINA in the face)
               You've betrayed me! Haven't you?
               You let him in...into my world, you
               bitch!?.. after all I've lavished
               on you...OW!!

     Little ANTON has leapt on TONY's back and sunk his teeth into
     TONY'S ear. TONY throws him off and starts beating him.


68   INT   THE BALLROOM   CONTINUOUS                           68

     In the glittering ballroom a children's choir sings.

                         CHILDREN'S CHOIR
               "We are the world..we are the
               children..."

     Behind the choir the double doors of the ballroom crash
     open... exposing TONY violently beating up an `ethnic child.'

     Stunned silence as the horror of this happy scene sinks in.

     Then...

                         GUESTS
               My God! Somebody stop him!   He's a
               monster! Get him!

     As one they leap to their feet.

     TONY looks up and freezes. At the same time the walls of the
     ballroom begin to crack and disintegrate. TONY'S world starts
     to fall apart... literally.

     The floor around TONY falls away into an abyss leaving only a
     narrow escape route. He hurls ANTON aside and dashes away as
     the GUESTS pursue him. ANTON avoids being trampled but,
     loses his footing and falls over the edge.

                             VALENTINA
                  Anton!!!

     VALENTINA, fighting through the angry GUESTS, rushes to the
     edge of the abyss. ANTON is struggling to hold on to a
     broken floor joist that protrudes several feet down from the
     side of the cliff face.

                            ANTON
                  Valentina!..help me. Please.

     His grip slips. VALENTINA reaches for him, grasps his hand.

                            VALENTINA
                  Forgive me, Anton. I was wrong.

                            ANTON
                  I know... I'm not a child.

     And.. ANTON REVERTS TO HIS NORMAL SIZE...AND WEIGHT.

                            ANTON (CONT'D)
                  I love you, Valentina.

     ANTON slips out of her grip, plummeting into the abyss.

                             VALENTINA
                  Noooo!

     Suddenly, VALENTINA is jerked backwards by her hair.

                            TONY
                  Who's behind this!? Eh!? You didn't
                  come up with this all on your own
                  did you!!!???
                      (slapping her)
                  No! Someone's got at you. Someone's
                  paid you!!!... Who!!!??? Tell me!!!

                            DR. PARNASSUS(O.S.)
                  Valentina! My darling daughter!

     They turn to see PARNASSUS in the distance (where once the
     ballroom stood) stumbling towards them, drunk, desperate. As
     he moves forward a new landscape is created behind him.

     TONY rushes towards PARNASSUS.

                         TONY
               You old bastard! This is all your
               doing!

                         DR. PARNASSUS
                   (drunkenly)
               All my doing?... I'm merely the
               facilititatater, dear boy.

                         GUESTS (O.S.)
               There he is! Stop him! Leave her
               alone. Get him!

     Throwing his arm around TONY, PARNASSUS spins him around to
     face the MOB rushing towards him.

                         DR. PARNASSUS
               I create the opportunities. Is it
               my fault if your not up to it?

     Tony wrenches his arm free and violently shoves the drunken
     DOCTOR right into the path of the frenzied MOB. PARNASSUS is
     trampled underfoot in their rush to catch TONY.

                         VALENTINA
               Father! No!

     PARNASSUS'S body lies broken on the ground. Frantically,
     VALENTINA rushes to him, throwing herself on her father's
     battered body, sobbing hysterically.

                         VALENTINA (CONT'D)
               NO..NO NO... Please.. father..it's
               all my fault. What have I done?...

     With siren wailing, an AMBULANCE arrives, screeching to a
     halt. PARAMEDICS pull VALENTINA away. They check PARNASSUS
     for signs of life and begin to lift him onto the gurney.
     VALENTINA can't control herself and tries to throw herself
     onto his body. The PARAMEDICS struggle with her.

                         PARAMEDIC
                   (with a severe stutter)
               P-p-p-lease m-mis-s, there's-s

                         VALENTINA
               NOOOOO...!!!

     VALENTINA wrenches herself out of their grasp howling like an
     animal and rushes away out of earshot before the PARAMEDIC
     can finish speaking.

                         PARAMEDIC
               ...d-dead drunk.

     A bottle falls from the DOCTOR'S hand and explodes in a
     million fragments as it hits the ground.

     The shimmering fragments coalesce into a fractured mirror
     corridor down which a multi-reflected VALENTINA runs -
     sobbing like a madwoman - lashing out at her reflections,
     some of which are flashbacks of her flirting with TONY,
     irritated with ANTON, angry with PARNASSUS.

                         VALENTINA
                   (to her reflections)
               You little fool! You're to blame!..
               for everything... I hate you!

     The multi-reflection broken mirror corridor ends at two
     mirrors identical to the one used in the Imaginarium. The one
     to the left is marked 'His' with a bowler hat, the other to
     the right 'Hers' with a bonnet. She hesitates.

                         VALENTINA (CONT'D)
                   (laughing madly)
               So this is to be my choice!!

     MR NICK appears out of the "His" mirror - a burst of flame
     behind him.

     He makes a sweeping gesture inviting VALENTINA to enter the
     mirror marked 'Hers'.

     VALENTINA, heads for the mirror marked 'His'. MR NICK blocks
     her path.

                         MR NICK
               Now, there's absolutely no need for
               that. That's just plain
               contrariness.

     VALENTINA tries to get around him.

               You think you deserve punishment
               but you're a kid - you have no
               idea...trust me.

     VALENTINA feints another direction. MR NICK blocks her.

                         VALENTINA
                   (a crazed look)
               Wrong. I'm 16...I'm a woman now..

     She spins around him...he blocks....a kind of dance between
     them begins - confusingly reflected in the mirrors. A tango
     can be heard.

                         VALENTINA (CONT'D)
               ...a selfish bitch, everyone I love
               dies...I'm...

                         MR NICK
               ...only fit for hell? If only.

     He looks at Valentina with lascivious intent. He's tempted,
     briefly, but resists it.

                         MR NICK (CONT'D)
               No... your pop would never speak to
               me again. And that'd be a shame.
               Let's dance.

     Reflected in the swirling mirror fragments, they tango until
     he spins her towards the right hand mirror. She sails through
     - and, with a mad smile, throws him a kiss.

     The mirror closes with a burst of flame. The briefest flash
     of DR. PARNASSUS face is reflected in the mirror fragments.

                         DOCTOR PARNASSUS O/S
               Valentina!!!!!!

     MR NICK turns, realizing he has been looking into a mirror
     fragment reflecting the two mirrors. The writing on the
     Valentina's mirror reads "His".

                         MR NICK
               Damn!... I've won.

                                                                112.




69   EXT   STRANGE   MOUNTAIN LANDSCAPE                           69

     DR. PARNASSUS is sitting alone on a prominent bluff (the same
     one he tried throwing himself off many years ago) He's
     distraught. Tears run down this cheeks. A distant bell tolls
     midnight.

     MR NICK appears behind PARNASSUS...sits down beside him.

                         MR NICK
               Funny how things work out, isn't
               it?

     He lights a cigarette.

                         MR NICK (CONT'D)
               It's not what I had in mind
               y'know... this.. Valentina, being
               the fifth... It doesn't seem
               right... She's supposed to be the
               prize, the star prize... not part
               of the bloody score... And you
               lumbered with eternal life all over
               again... What a bummer, eh?

     No response from PARNASSUS. A Tarot cards drops from his
     hand. It is The Hanged Man.

     MR. NICK points to the plain far below. Across the harsh
     ground, TONY is running for his life...pursued by the MOB.

                          MR NICK (CONT'D)
               I hope they get that bastard. Tear
               him limb from limb... But they
               won't... He leads a charmed life,
               that one... I've been trying to
               nail him for years... I thought I
               had him this time. But, there's
               always some prat comes to his
               rescue... Talk about the luck of
               the Devil.
                   (he laughs)
               Those weird markings you found on
               him... on his forehead... Those
               satanic-symbol, so-called,
               things... What's all that about?...
               Maybe they protect him in some
               way... I've never been into that
               black-magic stuff myself... Can't
               seem to get the hang of it... I
               know, pathetic isn't it?...

     PARNASSUS ignores him, sunk even deeper into despondency.

                            MR NICK (CONT'D)
                  God, I hate to see you like this.
                  Look, I tell you what... If you can
                  get the lowdown on those satanic
                  markings, or.. wait.. better
                  still, if you can wipe that self-
                  righteous little creep off the face
                  of the universe... I'll give you
                  Valentina back.

     A beat. Slowly, PARNASSUS looks up.

                            MR NICK (CONT'D)
                  How about it?


70   EXT   SOMEWHERE ON THE MOUNTAIN                              70

     TONY, sweating, panting for breath, is running up the
     mountain.

     Below, the MOB is still in hot pursuit.

     TONY reaches the summit. In front of him, is his salvation -
     an empty gibbet. A noose hangs from the crossbeam.

                            TONY
                  Thank God for that!

     TONY relaxes a little.

     We can hear the mob now, struggling up the mountain.

     TONY digs into one of his pockets and pulls out the brass
     tube that he has always kept close.

     TONY opens his mouth and is about to slip the tube down his
     throat when he spots the Hanged Man Tarot card lying at his
     feet. A hand from behind him snatches the tube away.

     TONY, startled, turns to find himself looking up at DR.
     PARNASSUS.

     PARNASSUS is standing on a chair with the noose around his
     neck. He smiles and opens his hand. The metal tube has
     vanished.

     TONY panics. The MOB is getting closer.

     With his other hand DR. PARNASSUS produces the tube from
     TONY'S ear.

                            TONY (CONT'D)
                      (desperate)
                  Give me that!

     DR. PARNASSUS gestures at the CROWD.

                            DR. PARNASSUS
                  Give us a moment, please.

     The CROWD goes into very slow motion...but twice as angry.

     DR. PARNASSUS teases TONY with magic.

                            DR. PARNASSUS (CONT'D)
                  Here's your tube... Here's mine.
                      (producing a second tube)
                  But mine's just a cheap
                  counterfeit... Look, it breaks...
                      (he breaks it)
                  But here's another...

                            TONY
                  Stop!

                            DR. PARNASSUS
                  You're not amused?

                            TONY
                      (desperate)
                  You've been talking to the devil,
                  haven't you? Let me guess what he
                  said... If you manage to kill me,
                  he'll release Valentina. Yes? Am I
                  right?... I am aren't I? It's all
                  lies. He can't release her. And why
                  not? Because he doesn't have her.
                  He can't have her because she's the
                  prize.
                      (gaining confidence)
                  He doesn't have five wins. But if
                  you kill me he will, won't he?
                  You'll have lost Valentina forever!

     DR. PARNASSUS does a double hand shuffle.

                            DR. PARNASSUS
                  Choose.

               This is ridiculous!

                          DR.    PARNASSUS
               Choose!

     TONY chooses.

                          TONY
               You've got to believe me! For all
               our sakes!

                         DR. PARNASSUS
               Are you sure you made the right
               choice?

                          TONY
               Look...

                         DR. PARNASSUS
               Let's find out.

     He slides the tube down his throat and kicks the chair away.

     He drops... dangles from the rope...the noose tight around
     his neck.

     At the same moment, the MOB resumes normal speed and roars up
     the mountain.

     Is PARNASSUS dead?

     Working very fast, TONY hoists him over his shoulder and
     wrestles the noose loose. He drops PARNASSUS on the ground.
     He's stunned but still alive.

     The MOB is closing in.

     TONY slaps DR. PARNASSUS hard between the shoulder blades.

     The tube pops out of the DOCTOR'S gullet. TONY catches it.

                          TONY
               Gotcha!

     TONY swallows the tube as the MOB surge around the gibbet,
     grabbing him, beating him, and then lifting him onto the
     chair, tightening the noose around his neck.

     Although battered, TONY winks smugly at DR. PARNASSUS, but
     his mood changes when he sees DR. PARNASSUS spit out several
     more fake tubes, then, gagging, force the real one up and out
     of his gullet.

     With a look of realization and horror, TONY drops to his
     death as the MOB kicks the chair away from under him.

     The MOB cheers. Yes, he's dead.

     DR. PARNASSUS tosses the metal tube to MR NICK who steps
     coolly out of the MOB, cigarette in his mouth.

                         DR. PARNASSUS
                   (hoarsely)
               There are three cardinal rules.
               One, there's no black-magic, only
               cheap tricks. And... er... I forget
               the others. Now, where's my
               daughter?

                         MR NICK
               How should I know? You're her
               father.
                   (with needle)
               Her loving father.

     DR PARNASSUS looks askance at MR NICK.

                         MR NICK (CONT'D)
               She's free... isn't she?

     MR NICK smiles and blows smoke in PARNASSUS'S face. The smoke
     fills the screen and becomes...

     ... a dust storm. The wind is howling. The swirling dust
     thins to reveal DR.PARNASSUS, alone, exhausted, trudging
     across a vast desert.

     He's tormented by his thoughts.

                         DR. PARNASSUS
               What else could I do, Valentina?
               What else could I have done... What
               other choice could I have made?...
               Damn!... It was the right choice...

                  Where's my darling? How long must I
                  suffer?

     There is no proper road, only endless sand, but nevertheless
     DR. PARNASSUS reaches a signpost which indicates two distinct
     paths.

     One leads to a tidy little suburban home, the other up an
     dramatic mountain pass via a painfully steep staircase cut
     into the rock (the same one that MARTIN THE DRUNK chose not
     to climb days earlier.

                            DR. PARNASSUS (CONT'D)
                  No, no, no... No more choices,
                  please... No more choices...!!!

     Enraged, he tries to push the sign over, but is too feeble.
     Exhausted, he subsides onto a smooth protruding stone.

                               VOICE (V.O.)
                         (angry)
                  Hey!

     DR. PARNASSUS, alarmed, rolls quickly off the stone.

     Now on his knees he finds himself looking at the top half of
     PERCY'S head and face. What he'd thought was a stone was, in
     fact, his old companion buried in the sand.

                               DR. PARNASSUS
                  Percy!

     DR. PARNASSUS, overjoyed, begins to dig PERCY out.

                            PERCY
                  About bloody time!

                            DR. PARNASSUS

     across the sand in the direction of the bungalow. We can now

               No! Suburban bungalows and all that

     the front door.

     PERCY rings the bell.

     DR. PARNASSUS tries to make a run for it but PERCY holds him
     fast.

     The door is opened by VALENTINA. She's older and is carrying

                            NINE YEAR OLD SON
                  Does it come with a happy ending?

                            DR. PARNASSUS
                  I'm afraid we can't guarantee that.

     THE CAMERA angles across the table...

     In a shadowy corner stands MR NICK, smoking a cigarette.

                                            SHOOTING SCRIPT
  FADE IN:

  DAWN. CRASHING SURF.

  The waves TOSS a BEARDED MAN onto wet sand. He lies there.

  A CHILD'S SHOUT makes him LIFT his head to see: a LITTLE
  BLONDE BOY crouching, back towards us, watching the tide eat
  a SANDCASTLE. A LITTLE BLONDE GIRL joins the boy. The Bearded
  Man tries to call them, but they RUN OFF, FACES UNSEEN. He
  COLLAPSES.

  The barrel of a rifle ROLLS the Bearded Man onto his back. A
  JAPANESE SECURITY GUARD looks down at him, then calls up the
  beach to a colleague leaning against a JEEP. Behind them is a
  cliff, and on top of that, a JAPANESE CASTLE.

  INT. ELEGANT DINING ROOM, JAPANESE CASTLE - LATER

  The Security Guard waits as an ATTENDANT speaks to an ELDERLY
  JAPANESE MAN sitting at the dining table, back to us.

                     ATTENDANT
               (in Japanese)
           He was delirious. But he asked for
           you by name. And...
               (to the Security Guard)
           Show him.

                     SECURITY GUARD
               (in Japanese)
           He was carrying nothing but this...

  He puts a HANDGUN on the table. The Elderly Man keeps eating.

                     SECURITY GUARD
           ...and this.

  The Security Guard places a SMALL PEWTER CONE alongside the
  gun. The Elderly Man STOPS eating. Picks up the cone.

                     ELDERLY JAPANESE MAN
               (in Japanese)
           Bring him here. And some food.

  INT. SAME - MOMENTS LATER

  The Elderly Man watches the Bearded Man WOLF down his food.
  He SLIDES the handgun down the table towards him.

                     ELDERLY JAPANESE MAN
               (in English)
           Are you here to kill me?

  The Bearded Man glances up at him, then back to his food.
                                                          2.

  The Elderly Japanese Man picks up the cone between thumb and
  forefinger.

                    ELDERLY JAPANESE MAN
          I know what this is.

  He SPINS it onto a table- it CIRCLES gracefully across the
  polished ebony... a SPINNING TOP.

                    ELDERLY JAPANESE MAN
          I've seen one before. Many, many
          years ago...

  The Elderly Japanese Man STARES at the top mesmerized.

                    ELDERLY JAPANESE MAN
          It belonged to a man I met in a
          half-remembered dream...

  MOVE IN on the GRACEFULLY SPINNING TOP...

                     ELDERLY JAPANESE MAN
          A man possessed of some radical
          notions...

The Elderly Japanese Man STARES, remembering...

                    COBB (V.O.)
          What's the most resilient parasite?

                                                    CUT TO:

INT. SAME ELEGANT DINING ROOM - NIGHT (YEARS EARLIER)

The speaker, COBB, is 35, handsome, tailored. A young
Japanese man, SAITO, eats as he listens.

                    COBB
          A bacteria? A virus?

Cobb gestures at their feast with his wine glass-

                    COBB
          An intestinal worm?

Saito's fork pauses, mid-air. Cobb GRINS. A third man is at
the table- ARTHUR. He jumps in to save the pitch-

                    ARTHUR
          What Mr. Cobb is trying to say-

                     COBB
          An idea.

Saito looks at Cobb, curious.
                                                3.

                    COBB
          Resilient, highly contagious. Once
          an idea's taken hold in the brain
          it's almost impossible to
          eradicate. A person can cover it
          up, ignore it- but it stays there.

                    SAITO
          But surely-to forget...?

                    COBB
          Information, yes. But an idea?
          Fully formed, understood? That
          sticks...
              (taps forehead)
          In there, somewhere.

                    SAITO
          For someone like you to steal?

                    ARTHUR
          Yes. In the dream state, conscious
          defenses are lowered and your
          thoughts become vulnerable to
          theft. It's called extraction.

                    COBB
          But, Mr. Saito, we can train your
          subconscious to defend itself from
          even the most skilled extractor.

                    SAITO
          How can you do that?

                    COBB
          Because I am the most skilled
          extractor. I know how to search
          your mind and find your secrets. I
          know the tricks, and I can teach
          them to your subconscious so that
          even when you're asleep, your guard
          is never down.

Cobb leans forwards. Holding Saito's gaze.

                    COBB
          But if I'm going to help you, you
          have to be completely open to me.
          I'll need to know my way around
          your thoughts better than your
          wife, your analyst, anyone.
              (gestures around)
          If this is a dream and you've got a
          safe full of secrets, I need to
          know what's in that safe. For this
          to work, you have to let me in.
                                                            4.

Saito gives this a flicker of a smile. Rises. A BODYGUARD
opens double doors which give onto a LAVISH PARTY.

                    SAITO
          Gentlemen. Enjoy your evening as I
          consider your proposal.

They watch Saito leave. Arthur turns to Cobb, worried-

                      ARTHUR
          He knows.

Cobb motions silence. A TREMOR starts, they steady their
glasses, Cobb glances at his watch- THE SECOND HAND IS
FROZEN.

                    ARTHUR
          What's going on up there?

And we-

                                                    CUT TO:

FILTHY BATHROOM - DAY (FEELS LIKE DIFFERENT TIME)

Cobb, ASLEEP, SITTING IN A CHAIR AT THE END OF A STEAMING
BATH. The chair is up on a cabinet- the bottom of the legs
level with the rim of the tub.

A sweating man (40's) watches over Cobb. This is NASH. A
distant EXPLOSION rumbles through the room. Nash moves to the
window, parts the curtains. Outside: a CHAOTIC DEVELOPING-WORLD
CITY- the street filled with RIOTERS- SMASHING, BURNING.

Nash checks Cobb's left wrist: above his watch, tape holds
TWO THIN YELLOW TUBES in place. Nash looks at Cobb's watch-
THE SECOND HAND CRAWLS UNNATURALLY SLOWLY.

Nash follows the tubes to a SILVER BRIEFCASE at Arthur's
feet: ARTHUR IS ASLEEP in an armchair. Tubes connect the
briefcase to Arthur's wrist.

Nash follows another set of tubes from the briefcase to where
they pass under the door to the bedroom. Through the crack of
the door, Nash sees SAITO ASLEEP on the bed, tubes running to
his wrist. BOOM- a closer EXPLOSION, and we-

                                                    CUT TO:

INT. BULLET TRAIN COMPARTMENT - DAY (FEELS LIKE DIFFERENT TIME)

Nash, ASLEEP. Head ROCKING AGAINST THE WINDOW as the train
BUMPS OVER A ROUGH PIECE OF TRACK.
                                                           5.

A Japanese Man, TODASHI (18) watches Nash nervously. He
checks Nash's wrist: TWO YELLOW TUBES CONNECT NASH WITH THREE
OTHER SLEEPING MEN IN THE COMPARTMENT: COBB, ARTHUR, SAITO.

Todashi checks his watch: THE SECOND HAND TICKS IN REAL TIME.
Another TRAIN PASSES in the opposite direction with a MIGHTY
WHUMP- Todashi's eyes FLY to Nash's sleeping face-

NASH JERKS WITH THE MOVEMENT OF THE TRAIN, and we-

                                                     CUT TO:

INT. FILTHY BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS

Another EXPLOSION- Nash CHECKS the sleeping Cobb and we-

                                                     CUT TO:

EXT. ROOFTOP TERRACES, JAPANESE CASTLE - NIGHT

A LOW TREMOR RUMBLES THROUGH THE CASTLE. Cobb and Arthur
steady themselves against the wooden rail. Several TILES and
pieces of MASONRY fall. Below them a BLACK SEA churns. Other
GUESTS wander the massive terraces.

                    ARTHUR
          Saito knows. He's playing with us.

                    COBB
          I can get it here. The
          information's in the safe- he
          looked right at it when I mentioned
          secrets.

Arthur nods. Then spots someone over Cobb's shoulder.

                    ARTHUR
          What's she doing here, Cobb?

Cobb turns to see a beautiful woman, elegantly dressed,
staring out at the sea. This is MAL. Cobb watches her.

                    COBB
          You just get to your room. I'll
          take care of the rest.

                    ARTHUR
          See that you do. We're here to
          work.

Arthur brushes past Mal, shaking his head. She nears Cobb.
Looks out at the DROP. The WIND WHIPS HER HAIR-

                    MAL
          If I jumped, would I survive?
                                                           6.

                    COBB
          With a clean dive, perhaps. Mal,
          why are you here?

She turns to look at him. Amused.

                    MAL
          I thought you might be missing
          me...

She smiles. He leans in, mesmerized.

                    COBB
          I am. But I can't trust you
          anymore.

She stares up at him, inviting.

                       MAL
          So what?

INT. BEDROOM SUITE, JAPANESE CASTLE - MOMENTS LATER

Mal sips champagne as she studies a painting by Francis
Bacon.

                    MAL
          Looks like Arthur's taste.

Cobb is looking down through the window at the GUARDS
patrolling the castle at ground level.

                    COBB
          Actually, Mr. Saito is partial to
          postwar British painters.

He turns to Mal, donning a pair of black leather gloves.

                    COBB
          Would you sit down?

Mal lowers herself gracefully into a leather wingback chair.
Cobb approaches, pulls out a length of BLACK ROPE and kneels
at Mal's feet. She looks down at him.

                       MAL
          Tell me...

Cobb TIES the rope around the CHAIR LEGS.

                    MAL
          Do the children miss me?

Cobb pauses. He lets his gloved fingers lightly touch Mal's
ankle. He looks up at her.
                                                            7.

                    COBB
          You can't imagine.

Mal looks away, uncomfortable. Cobb gets to his feet, letting
out the rope as he moves back to the window.

                    MAL
          What're you doing?

Cobb tosses the rope out-

                    COBB
          Getting some air.

He tugs on the rope, testing. The weight of the chair, with
Mal on it, holds.

                    COBB
          Stay seated. Please.

And with that, he JUMPS. Mal considers the open window.

EXT. JAPANESE CASTLE WALL - CONTINUOUS

Cobb RAPPELS down the wall, darting past windows. He stops at
a particular one. Gets out a glass cutter-

Suddenly he starts DROPPING-

INT. BEDROOM SUITE, JAPANESE CASTLE - CONTINUOUS

The EMPTY CHAIR SLIDES across the floor- WEDGES under the
window-

EXT. JAPANESE CASTLE WALL - CONTINUOUS

Cobb JOLTS to a stop 15 ft. lower. He looks up at the bedroom
window. Shakes his head. Starts climbing back.

INT. KITCHEN, JAPANESE CASTLE - MOMENTS LATER

Cobb drops silently from the window into the darkened
kitchen. He pulls a PISTOL from his belt, screwing a SILENCER
onto the barrel as he GLIDES across the room.

INT. HALL, JAPANESE CASTLE-CONTINUOUS

Cobb SLIPS through the shadows towards a GUARD stationed at
the head of a GRAND STAIRCASE...

The Guard HEARS something- TURNS- PEERS into the shadows...

Cobb FLASHES out of the shadows, silenced pistol up, AIMING-
                                                          8.

PHHT- head shot- the Guard starts to drop... but Cobb is
already there to CATCH him, sliding on his knees and lowering
the Guard SILENTLY to the floor.

INT. DINING ROOM, JAPANESE CASTLE - CONTINUOUS

Cobb moves to a PAINTING. With practiced hands he removes it
from the wall, revealing a SAFE. Cobb spins the dial, pulls
it OPEN, GRABS an envelope from within, stuffs it into his
waistband, where there is already an IDENTICAL ENVELOPE.

LIGHTS COME ON. Cobb freezes.

                    SAITO (O.S.)
          Turn around.

Cobb turns. At the far end of the room: Saito. Next to him is
Mal, gun in hand. She smiles at Cobb.

                    MAL
          The gun, Dom.

Cobb doesn't move. Mal motions outside- two GUARDS drag
Arthur into the room. Mal puts the gun to his head.

                    MAL
          Please.

Cobb slowly places his gun at his end of the long table, then
SLIDES it along the polished ebony. It comes to rest HALFWAY
down the length or the table.

                    SAITO
          Now the envelope, Mr. Cobb.

Cobb reaches into his waistband, removes ONE of the
envelopes, SLIDES it along the table. Steps back, hands
raised.

                     COBB
          Did she tell you, or have you known
          all along?

                     SAITO
          That you're here to steal from me?
              (beat)
          Or that we're actually asleep?

Arthur gives Cobb an I-told-you-so look.

                    SAITO
          I want to know who your employer
          is.

Mal COCKS the gun at Arthur's temple.
                                                           9.

                    COBB
          No point threatening him in a
          dream.

                    MAL
          That depends on what you're
          threatening. Killing him would just
          wake him up... but pain? Pain is in
          the mind...

Mal LOWERS the gun and SHOOTS Arthur in the leg- Arthur
drops, SCREAMING- Mal looks at Cobb, cold.

                    MAL
          And, judging by the decor, we're in
          your mind, aren't we, Arthur?

Cobb watches Arthur's PAIN. Mal aims at Arthur's other leg...

Cobb SPRINGS for the table, SKIDDING along its polished
surface- he GRABS his gun- SHOOTS ARTHUR BETWEEN THE EYES-

Arthur DROPS- the room starts to SHUDDER in a MASSIVE
EARTHQUAKE- Cobb SPRINGS for the door- Arthur's eyes stare at
the ceiling, DEAD, and we-

                                                  CUT TO:

INT. FILTHY BATHROOM - DAY

Arthur's EYES OPEN as he WAKES IN THE ARMCHAIR- he GRABS at
the tubes at his wrist, YANKING them free-

                    NASH
          What're you doing?! It's too soon-

FLUID spurts from the tubes as Arthur STRUGGLES with the
SILVER CASE on the bathroom floor.

                    ARTHUR
          I know! We have to reconnect the
          loop before they wake up!

Arthur grabs the case and pushes through the door to the
bedroom- following the tubes to where they meet Saito's wrist-
SAITO LIES ON THE BED ASLEEP. Saito STIRS and we-

                                                  CUT TO:

INT. JAPANESE CASTLE CORRIDOR - NIGHT

Cobb LURCHES towards the stairs, as all around him the
building BUCKS and HEAVES-
                                                           10.

INT. DINING ROOM, JAPANESE CASTLE - CONTINUOUS

Saito and the Guards PANIC. Mal walks calmly through the
destruction, picks up the envelope and turns to Saito.

                    MAL
          He was close. Very close.

EXT. GRAND STAIRCASE, JAPANESE CASTLE - CONTINUOUS

Cobb runs up the stairs, pulling out the SECOND ENVELOPE-

INT. DINING ROOM, JAPANESE CASTLE - CONTINUOUS

Saito RIPS open the envelope, pulls out sheets of paper. He
looks at Mal, PANICKED. He turns to the Guards-

                      SAITO
          Stop him!

Mal, confused, looks at the sheets of paper: THEY ARE BLANK.
Mal smiles, amused.

INT. GRAND STAIRCASE, JAPANESE CASTLE - CONTINUOUS

As Cobb runs up the stairs he reads the TYPEWRITTEN SHEETS
from his envelope, and we-

                                                     CUT TO:

INT. DILAPIDATED HOTEL ROOM - DAY

Arthur OPENS the silver case: a COMPLEX MECHANISM of TUBES,
SYRINGES, DOSAGE CONTROLLERS. Arthur's hands fly across the
machine's controls as he glances at Saito's STIRRING face-

                    ARTHUR
          I'm not going to make it! Wake
          Cobb!

INT. FILTHY BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS

Nash turns to Cobb. Raises his hand and SMACKS him across the
face, and we-

                                                     CUT TO:

INT. GRAND STAIRCASE, JAPANESE CASTLE - NIGHT

Cobb is SMASHED sideways off his feet...
                                                        11.

INT. DINING ROOM, JAPANESE CASTLE - NIGHT

The CEILING CRACKS above Saito- he looks up as a TON of STONE
floods down, CRUSHING HIM and we-

                                                  CUT TO:

INT. DILAPIDATED HOTEL ROOM - DAY

Saito's eyes FLICKER OPEN. AWAKE.

INT. FILTHY BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS

Nash SMACKS Cobb again-

                    NASH
          He won't wake!

INT. DILAPIDATED HOTEL ROOM-CONTINUOUS

Arthur crouched by Saito, connects the second tube.

                      ARTHUR
          Dunk him!

A CLICK: Arthur looks up to find Saito with a gun to his head
and a finger to his lips, gesturing silence...

INT. FILTHY BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS

Nash puts his hand on Cobb's forehead and PUSHES HIM
BACKWARDS- as Cobb starts to FALL BACKWARDS in the chair we
are in SLOW MOTION, and we-

                                                  CUT TO:

INT. GRAND STAIRCASE, JAPANESE CASTLE - NIGHT

Cobb, full speed, picks himself up, scrambling to read the
last sheet of paper. He stares at it PUZZLED- bullets hit
around him as the Guards race up the stairs and we-

                                                  CUT TO:

INT. FILTHY BATHROOM - DAY

Cobb in SLOW MOTION, hits the WATER- head THRASHING as he
goes under- and we-

                                                  CUT TO:

INT. GRAND STAIRCASE, JAPANESE CASTLE - NIGHT

Cobb glances up from the paper as WATER EXPLODES IN THROUGH
ALL THE WINDOWS, FLOODING THE ENTIRE HALL-
                                                        12.

COBB IS SWAMPED BY WATER, SPUN IN ALL DIRECTIONS AT ONCE- HE
PULLS DEEPER OR FOR THE SURFACE, WE CAN'T TELL...

HE BREAKS THE SURFACE, GASPING FOR AIR IN THE BATHTUB IN THE-

INT. FILTHY BATHROOM - DAY

Cobb's AWAKE, GULPING AIR, getting his bearings.

Saito SMASHES into the room, KNOCKING Nash down- Cobb
LAUNCHES himself out of the tub, FLYING dripping wet across
the room to SLAM Saito against the door- the gun DROPS,
Cobb's fist CONNECTS with Saito's jaw and the struggle is
over.

INT. DILAPIDATED HOTEL ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

Cobb, wet but composed, sits, turning Saito's gun in his
hand. Nash holds Saito's arms behind him. Outside, the sounds
of RIOTING grow louder.

                    COBB
          You came prepared.

                    SAITO
          I bring the gun because not even my
          head of security knows this
          apartment. How did you find it?

Arthur, at the window, looks out at the WORSENING VIOLENCE.

                    COBB
          Hard for a man in your position to
          keep a love nest totally secret...
          particularly when there's a married
          woman involved.

                    SAITO
          She would never...

                    COBB
          And yet, here we are.

Saito is silent.

                    COBB
          With a dilemma.

                    SAITO
          You got what you came for.

                     COBB
          Not quite. The key piece of
          information wasn't there, was it,
          Mr. Saito?
                                                         13.

Arthur looks over at Cobb, worried.

                    ARTHUR
          They're getting closer, Cobb.

                                                  CUT TO:

INT. BULLET TRAIN COMPARTMENT - DAY

Todashi slips a pair of HEADPHONES over Nash's ears, then
pulls out an MP3 player and we-

INT. DILAPIDATED HOTEL ROOM - DAY

Saito's eyes are on the floor.

                    COBB
          You held something back because you
          knew what we were up to...

Cobb uses the barrel of the gun to raise Saito's chin.

                    COBB
          So why let us in at all?

Saito smiles, defiant. VIOLENT NOISES echo up the stairway...

                    SAITO
          An audition.

                    COBB
          Audition for what?

                    SAITO
          It doesn't matter. You failed.

                    COBB
          I extracted all the information you
          had in there.

                    SAITO
          But your deception was readily
          apparent.

And we-

                                                  CUT TO:

INT. BULLET TRAIN COMPARTMENT - DAY

Todashi opens the SILVER BRIEFCASE, revealing the complex
mechanism of syringes and controllers- FOUR CONTROLLERS
DISPLAY COUNTDOWNS.
                                                        14.

Todashi waits for the first countdown to hit "30," then HITS
PLAY on the MP3 player- He watches Nash's sleeping face as he
RAISES the volume...

Through Nash's headphones: the opening bars of Edith Piaf's
"Non, je ne regrette rien," and we-

                                                  CUT TO:

INT. DILAPIDATED HOTEL ROOM - DAY

In the distant background, strange MASSIVE low-end MUSICAL
start, sounding like DISTANT HORNS...

                    SAITO
          So leave me and go.

                    COBB
          You know the corporation who hired
          us won't accept failure. We won't
          last two days...

The DISTANT, SLOWED-DOWN MUSIC is becoming LOUDER, as are the
SHOUTS coming up the stairs. Arthur looks at his watch, its
SLOW SECOND TICKING MARKS TIME WITH THE MASSIVE MUSIC.

                    ARTHUR
          Come on, Cobb.

                    COBB
          So now I have to do this the old-
          fashioned way-

Cobb GRABS SAITO AND PUTS HIS HEAD TO THE FLOOR, gun pressed
into his cheek. Saito looks into Cobb's eyes- sees he will
pull the trigger. Saito BLINKS, looks away in shame-

When he NOTICES SOMETHING. And starts LAUGHING.

                    SAITO
          I've always hated this carpet.

Cobb's eyes flick to the carpet and back.

                    SAITO
          It's stained and frayed in such
          distinctive ways...

Cobb looks up at Nash, who shrugs, at a loss.

                    SAITO
          But very definitely made of wool.
          Right now I'm lying on polyester.
                                                           15.

Cobb glares at Nash, and we-

                                                  CUT TO:

INT. BULLET TRAIN COMPARTMENT - DAY

Todashi watches the first of the countdowns hit ZERO- He
looks up at Arthur, STIRRING, and we-

INT. DILAPIDATED HOTEL ROOM-DAY

Saito turns from the carpet to look up at Cobb.

                    SAITO
          Which means I'm not lying on my
          carpet, in my apartment...
              (smiles)
          You've lived up to your reputation,
          Mr. Cobb... I'm still dreaming.

Cobb looks over to Arthur, but ARTHUR HAS VANISHED, and we-

                                                  CUT TO:

INT. BULLET TRAIN COMPARTMENT - DAY

Arthur's eyes flicker open, AWAKE. He RIPS at his tubes.

                    TODASHI
          How'd it go?

                      ARTHUR
          Not good.

Arthur checks the remaining three countdowns, and we-

INT. DILAPIDATED HOTEL ROOM - DAY

Saito gets to his feet, looking admiringly at Cobb.

                     SAITO
          A dream within a dream-I'm
          impressed.

Cobb lowers the gun. Defeated. Glances at his watch. The
music REVERBERATES, the RIOTERS BANG ON THE DOOR, and we-

                                                  CUT TO:
                                                        16.

INT. BULLET TRAIN COMPARTMENT - DAY

Arthur retracts the tubes into the case as he watches the
next countdown hit ZERO, and we-

                                                   CUT TO:

INT. DILAPIDATED HOTEL ROOM - DAY

Another BANG on the door- Saito, confident now, approaches
Cobb. Nash is behind Saito.

                    SAITO
          But in my dream, we really ought to
          be playing by my rules...

                    NASH
          Ah, yes, but you see, Mr. Saito-

Saito turns to Nash-

                    COBB
          We're not in your dream-

Saito turns back to Cobb, BUT COBB HAS VANISHED-

                    NASH
          We're in mine.

Saito SPINS back to Nash- the DOOR SMASHES OFF ITS HINGES AS
RIOTERS POUR INTO THE ROOM, SWARMING OVER NASH... BUT NASH IS
GONE. The music DIES. Saito and the rioters stand there in
the SILENCE, the light DWINDLING... and we-

                                                   CUT TO:

INT. BULLET TRAIN COMPARTMENT - DAY

Nash' eyes open, AWAKE.

                       ARTHUR (O.S.)
          Asshole!

Nash BLINKS. Arthur is in his face, furious.

                    ARTHUR
          How could you get the carpet
          wrong?!

                    NASH
          It wasn't my fault!

                    ARTHUR
          You're the architect-
                                                        17.

                    NASH
          I didn't know he was going to rub
          his damn cheek on it!

Cobb pulls Arthur away from Nash.

                     COBB
          Lets go.

                    ARTHUR
          And you-what the hell was all that?

                    COBB
          I had it under control.

                    ARTHUR
          I'd hate to see out of control-

                    COBB
          There's no time for this-I'm
          getting off at Kyoto.

                    ARTHUR
          Why? He's not gonna search every
          compartment.

                    COBB
          I can't stand trains.

Arthur moves to the briefcase. Turns a dial.

                    ARTHUR
          I can keep him under for one minute-

Arthur hits a button- A PLUNGER DEPRESSES. Cobb RIPS the tape
off Saito's wrist, ROLLS up his tubes. Arthur SLAMS the
silver case shut. Todashi pulls open the door-

                    COBB
          Every man for himself.

Arthur and Nash EXIT, heading in different directions down
the corridor. Cobb hands Todashi a thick roll of CASH, looks
at Saito, who stirs. Cobb moves off.

EXT. JAPANESE COUNTRYSIDE - CONTINUOUS

The BULLET TRAIN speeds through the lush landscape.

INT. BULLET TRAIN COMPARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

Saito WAKES GENTLY. Looks around the compartment, empty but
for Todashi, reading a comic. Saito looks down at his wrist.
Sees a small mark. Rubs it. SMILES.
                                                        18.

EXT. TOKYO - DUSK

Moving over the vast city towards a high rise. A HELICOPTER
thumps into frame, heading for a pad on the roof.

INT. APARTMENT, TOKYO - CONTINUOUS

Cobb sits, waiting. Checks his watch, restless. He pulls a
HANDGUN. Checks it is loaded. places it on the table in front
of him. Pulls out a PEWTER SPINNING TOP, SPINS it on the
table ... He INTENT STUDIES the top's spin... As he stares,
the sound of a FREIGHT TRAIN builds and builds- the top
WOBBLES, TIPS onto its side- the sound of the train STOPS.
the PHONE RINGS- Cobb GRABS it-

                    CHILDREN'S VOICES (over phone)
          Hi, Daddy! Hi, Dad.

                    COBB
          Hey, guys. How are you?

                    CHILDREN'S VOICES (over phone)
          Good. Okay, I guess.

Cobb closes his eyes, trying to picture his children: INSERT
CUT: COBB's MEMORY- a LITTLE BLONDE BOY (3), back towards us,
crouches IN A GARDEN, looks at something in the grass...

                    COBB
          Who's just okay? Was that James?

                    JAMES (over phone)
          Yeah. When are you coming home?

                    COBB
          I can't. Not for a while.

INSERT CUT: A LITTLE BLONDE GIRL (5), also FACE UNSEEN, joins
JAMES, CROUCHING BESIDE HIM...

                    JAMES (over phone)
          Why?

                    COBB
          Well, James, like I've told you-I'm
          away because I'm working...

                    LITTLE GIRL (over phone)
          Grandma says you're never coming
          back.
Cobb pauses. Takes a breath. INSERT CUT: James and Philippa,
FACES UNSEEN, lift their heads from the grass, responding to
someone's call- they RUN AWAY FROM US ACROSS THE GARDEN...
                                                          19.

                    COBB
          Philippa, can you ask Grandma to
          pick up the phone-

                    PHILIPPA (over phone)
          She's shaking her head.

Cobb TENSES, as if about to SMASH the phone.

                    COBB
          Well, we'll just have to hope
          Grandma's wrong about that won't
          we?

                    JAMES
              (over phone)
          Daddy?

                    COBB
          Yes?

                    JAMES (over phone)
          Is Mommy with you?

Cobb looks like he just got punched- INSERT CUT: COBB'S
MEMORY- MAL, WIND BLOWING HER HAIR, SMILES CALMLY...

                    COBB
          No. No, we talked about this,
          James. Mommy's gone.

                    JAMES (over phone)
          Where?

                    GRANDMA'S VOICE (over phone)
          Time to go, kids. Say bye-bye-
                    COBB
          I'll give some presents to Grandpa,
          okay? Just be good for-

Cobb STARES at the dead phone. Then DOWNS his drink- A KNOCK
at the door. Cobb GRABS the top, the gun- MOVES to the door-
cracks it: Arthur.

                    ARTHUR
          Our ride's on the roof.

Cobb nods. Moves to pick up his bag. Arthur watches.

                    ARTHUR
          Cobb... are you okay?

Cobb looks up.
                                                           20.

                       COBB
          Yeah, why?

                    ARTHUR
          Down in the dream... Mal showing up
          like that ...

                    COBB
          Yeah. I'm sorry about your leg.

                    ARTHUR
          It's getting worse, isn't it?

                    COBB
          One apology's all you're getting,
          Arthur. Now, where's Nash?

                    ARTHUR
          Hasn't shown. Wanna wait?

                    COBB
              (shakes head)
          We were supposed to deliver Saito's
          expansion plans to Cobol Engineering
          two hours ago. By now they know we
          failed. Time to disappear.

INT. CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS

Cobb and Arthur head towards the elevator.

                    ARTHUR
          Where will you go?

                    COBB
          Buenos Aires. I can lie low there.
          Maybe sniff out a job when things
          quiet down. You?

                       ARTHUR
          Stateside.

                    COBB
              (wistful) )
          'Course. Send my regards.

Arthur looks at Cobb. Nods. Sympathetic.

EXT. ROOFTOP HELIPAD - NIGHT

The HELICOPTER sits, ROTORS SPINNING. As Cobb and Arthur
reach the door, it SLIDES OPEN. Cobb steps up into the
leather-padded interior. He freezes.
                                                        21.

INT. HELICOPTER ON PAD - CONTINUOUS

Nash, BEATEN BLOODY, sits on the far side, slumped against
the wine. Beside him: SAITO. He nods politely at Cobb.

                    SAITO
          He sold you out. Thought to come to
          me and bargain for his life...

Saito's BODYGUARD offers Cobb a GUN.

                    SAITO
          So I offer you the satisfaction.

                    COBB
          That's not how I deal with things.

                    SAITO
          Would you work with him again?

Cobb shakes his head. Saito's BODYGUARDS PULL Nash from the
chopper. Saito motions Cobb and Arthur to sit. The chopper
RISES. Cobb watches Nash DRAGGED across the pad.

                    COBB
          What will you do to him?

                    SAITO
          Nothing. But I can't speak for your
          friends from Cobol Engineering.

Saito looks out at the city slipping by.

                    COBB
          What do you want from us?

                       SAITO
          Inception.

Arthur raises his eyebrows. Cobb is poker-faced.

                    SAITO
          Is it possible?

                    ARTHUR
          Of course not.

                    SAITO
          If you can steal an idea from
          someone's mind, why can't you plant
          one there instead?

                    ARTHUR
          Okay, here's planting an idea: I
          say to you, "Don't think about
          elephants."
                    (MORE)
                                                        22.
                    ARTHUR (CONT'D)
              (Saito nods)
          What are you thinking about?

                       SAITO
          Elephants.

                    ARTHUR
          Right. But it's not your idea
          because you know I gave it to you.

                    SAITO
          You could plant it subconsciously-

                    ARTHUR
          The subject's mind can always trace
          the genesis of the idea. True
          inspiration is impossible to fake.

                    COBB
          No, it isn't.

                    SAITO
          Can you do it?

                    COBB
          I won't do it.

                    SAITO
          In exchange, I'll give you the
          information you were paid to steal.

                    COBB
          Are you giving me a choice? Because
          I can find my own way to square
          things with Cobol.

                    SAITO
          Then you do have a choice.

                    COBB
          And I choose to leave.

EXT. AIRFIELD - MOMENTS LATER

The helicopter sets down next to a PRIVATE JET.

INT. HELICOPTER - CONTINUOUS

Saito indicates the plane.

                    SAITO
          Tell the crew where you want to go,
          they'll file the plan en route.

Cobb and Arthur look at each other. Then move for the door.
                                                23.

                    SAITO
          Mr. Cobb...? There is one other
          thing I could offer you.
              (Cobb stops)
          How would you like to go home? To
          America. To your children.

Cobb turns back to Saito.

                    COBB
          You can't fix that. Nobody could.

                    SAITO
          Just like inception.

Cobb considers this. Arthur touches his arm.

                    ARTHUR
          Cobb, come on-

                    COBB
          How complex is the idea?

                    SAITO
          Simple enough.

                    COBB
          No idea's simple when you have to
          plant it in someone else's mind.

                    SAITO
          My main competitor is an old man in
          poor health. His son will soon
          inherit control of the corporation.
          I need him to decide to break up
          his father's empire. Against his
          own self-interest.

                    ARTHUR
          Cobb, we should walk away from
          this.

                    COBB
          If I were to do it. If I could do
          it... how do I know you can
          deliver?

                    SAITO
          You don't. But I can. So do you
          want to take a leap of faith, or
          become an old man, filled with
          regret, waiting to die alone?

Cobb looks at Saito. Barely nods.
                                                          24.

                    SAITO
          Assemble your team, Mr. Cobb. And
          choose your people more wisely.

INT. PRIVATE JET - LATER

Cobb reclines his seat. Arthur picks at a salad, angry.

                    ARTHUR
          I know how much you want to go home-

                    COBB
              (sharp)
          No, you don't.

                    ARTHUR
          But this can't be done.

                    COBB
          It can. You just have to go deep
          enough.

                    ARTHUR
          You don't know that!-

                    COBB
          I've done it before.

Arthur is taken aback. Cobb turns to the window.

                    ARTHUR
          Did it work?

                       COBB
                 (quiet)
          Yes.

                    ARTHUR
          Who did you do it to?

Cobb looks at Arthur. Closed. Arthur shrugs.

                    ARTHUR
          So why are we headed to Paris?

                     COBB
          We're going to need a new
          architect.

INT. GREAT HALL, ÉCOLE D'ARCHITECTURE - MORNING

Cobb, carrying a shopping bag, looks into a lecture hall: no
students, just a RUMPLED PROFESSOR hunched over paperwork.
                                                        25.

INT. LECTURE HALL - CONTINUOUS

                    COBB (O.S.)
          You never did like your office.

PROFESSOR MILES looks up, squinting. Recognizes Cobb.

                    MILES
          No space to think in that broom
          cupboard.

Cobb steps down past the empty wooden rows.

                    MILES
          Is it safe for you to be here?

                    COBB
          Extradition between France and the
          U.S. is a bureaucratic nightmare.

                    MILES
          I think they'd find a way to make
          it work in your case.

Cobb hand Miles the shopping bag.

                    COBB
          Can you take these back for the
          kids?

                    MILES
          It'll take more than the occasional
          stuffed animal to convince those
          children they still have a father.

                    COBB
          I know. I thought you could talk to
          Marie about bringing them on
          vacation. Somewhere I could meet-

                    MILES
          Why would she listen to me?

                    COBB
          You were married for twenty years.

                    MILES
          She blames me as much as you.

                    COBB
          Doesn't she understand that my kids
          need me?
                                                26.

                    MILES
          Yes, she does. We all do. Go back
          and face the music, Dom. Explain
          what Mal did.

                    COBB
          Be realistic, Stephen. They'd never
          understand- they'd lock me up and
          throwaway the key. Or worse.

                    MILES
          You think what you're doing now is
          helping your case?

                    COBB
          Lawyers don't pay for themselves.
          This is what I have. This is what
          you taught me.

                    MILES
          I never taught you to be a thief.

                    COBB
          No, you taught me to navigate other
          people's minds. But after what
          happened with Mal there weren't a
          whole lot of legitimate ways for me
          to use that skill.

Miles looks at Cobb.

                    MILES
          Why did you come here, Dom?

Cobb shifts slightly.

                     COBB
          I found a way home. A job. For
          powerful people. If I pull it off,
          I can get back to my family. But I
          need help.

Miles realizes something.

                    MILES
          My God. You're here to corrupt one
          of my brightest and best.

                    COBB
          If you have someone good enough,
          you have to let them decide for
          themselves. You know what I'm
          offering-

                       MILES
          Money?
                                                27.

                    COBB
          No, not just money: the chance to
          build cathedrals, entire cities-
          things that have never existed,
          things that couldn't exist in the
          real world...

                    MILES
          Everybody dreams, Cobb. Architects
          are supposed to make those dreams
          real.

                    COBB
          That's not what you used to say.
          You told me that in the real world
          I'd be building attic conversions
          and gas stations. You said that if
          I mastered the dream-share I'd have
          a whole new way of creating and
          showing people my creations. You
          told me it would free me.

Miles looks at Cobb, sad.

                    MILES
          And I'm sorry. I was wrong.

                    COBB
          No, you weren't. Your vision was a
          vision of pure creativity. It's
          where we took it that was wrong.

                    MILES
          And now you want me to let someone
          else follow you into fantasy.

                    COBB
          They won't actually come on the
          job, they'll just design the levels
          and teach them to the dreamers.

                    MILES
          Design them yourself.

                    COBB
          Mal won't let me.

Miles looks at Cobb. Appalled.

                    MILES
          Come back to reality, Dom. Please.

                    COBB
          You want to know what's real,
          Stephen? Your grandchildren waiting
          for their dad to come back.
                    (MORE)
                                                        28.
                    COBB (CONT'D)
          This job-this last job-is how I get
          there.

Miles looks down, fiddles with his papers.

                    COBB
          I wouldn't be standing here if
          there were any other way. I can get
          home. But I need an architect who's
          as good as I was.

Miles looks Cobb in the eye. Decides.

                    MILES
          I've got someone better.

INT. CORRIDOR - LATER

Miles and Cobb stand by as STUDENTS file out of a lecture.

                       MILES
          Ariadne...

A young woman carrying books turns. This is ARIADNE.

                    MILES
          I'd like you to meet Mr. Cobb.

She sizes him up with quick eyes. Offers her hand.

                    ARIADNE
          Pleased to meet you.

                    MILES
          If you have a few moments, Mr. Cobb
          has a job offer to discuss with
          you.

                    ARIADNE
          A work placement?

                    COBB
              (smiles
          Not exactly.

EXT. ROOFTOP, ÉCOLE D'ARCHITECTURE - MOMENTS LATER

Ariadne leans against the parapet, overlooking Paris. She
unwraps a sandwich, watching Cobb pull out a pad of GRAPH
PAPER and a PEN. He offers them. She bites her sandwich.

                       COBB
          A test.
                                                           29.

                    ARIADNE
              (mouth full)
          Aren't you going to tell me
          anything?

                    COBB
          Before I describe the job, I have
          to know you could do it.

                    ARIADNE
          Why?

                    COBB
          It's not, strictly speaking, legal.

Ariadne raises her eyebrows.

                    COBB
          You have two minutes to draw a maze
          that takes me one minute to solve.

Ariadne takes the pad and pen. Cobb looks at his watch.

                    COBB
          Go.

She starts DRAWING LINES on the grid, constructing a maze.

                    COBB
          Stop.

Ariadne hands the pad and pen to Cobb. He glances at the pad,
then, looking her in the eye, TRACES the solution. She is
taken aback. Cobb RIPS off the sheet, hands the pad back.

                    COBB
          Again.

She traces straight lines, CONCENTRATING...

                    COBB
          Stop.

She hands Cobb the pad, a touch pleased. Cobb solves the
puzzle instantly, as before. Her smile falls.

                    COBB
          You'll have to-

She GRABS the pad, frustrated... but this time she FLIPS it
over and starts drawing on the BLANK CARDBOARD of the back.
Cobb watches, surprised. He smiles as he sees that she's
drawing CIRCLES, creating a maze based on concentric rings.

Ariadne hands back the pad, defiant. Cobb takes the pen,
starts the maze. This time he gets stuck. Nods.
                                                           30.

                    COBB
              (working the maze)
          More like it.

EXT. NARROW STREET, PARIS - DAY

Arthur stops at a warehouse door. Consults a piece of paper.

INT. WORKSHOP - CONTINUOUS

A large, dusty warehouse. The SLIDING DOOR cracks open.
Arthur enters. Looks around, approvingly.

INT. SAME - LATER

Arthur DRAGS LAWN CHAIRS into the middle of the room. He
erects a table. Lays out several SILVER CASES, unpacking
them, laying out lines of tubing, MECHANISMS...

EXT. PARISIAN CAFE - DAY

Cobb and Ariadne sit at an outdoor table.

                    COBB
          They say we only use a fraction of
          the true potential of our brains...
          but they're talking about when
          we're awake. While we dream, the
          mind performs wonders.

                     ARIADNE
          Such as?

                    COBB
          How do you imagine a building? You
          consciously create each aspect,
          puzzling over it in stages... But
          sometimes, when your imagination
          flies-

                    ARIADNE
          I'm discovering it.

                    COBB
          Exactly. Genuine inspiration.

Cobb leans forwards and draws on the paper table cloth.

                    COBB
          In a dream your mind continuously
          does that...

Cobb has drawn a circle made of two arrows.
                                                     31.

                    COBB
          It creates and perceives a world
          simultaneously. So well that you
          don't feel your brain doing the
          creating. That's why we can short-
          circuit the process...

                    ARIADNE
          How?

                    COBB
          By taking over the creating part.

Cobb draws a straight line between the two arrows.

                    COBB
          This is where you come in. You
          build the world of the dream. We
          take the subject into that dream,
          and let him £111 it with his
          subconscious

                    ARIADNE
          But are you trying to fool him that
          the dream is actually real life?

                     COBB
              (nods)
          While we're in there, We don't want
          him to realize he's dreaming.

                    ARIADNE
          How could I ever get enough detail
          to Convince him that it's real?

                    COBB
          Our dreams reel real while we're in
          them. It's only when we wake up we
          realize things were strange,

Ariadne gestures around them-

                    ARIADNE
          But all the textures of real life-
          the stone, the fabric. cars...
          people... your mind can't create
          all this.

                    COBB
          It does. Every time you dream. Let
          me ask you a question: You never
          remember the beginning of your
          dreams, do you? You just turn up in
          the middle of what's going on.
                                                        32.

                       ARIADNE
          I guess.

                    COBB
          So... how did we end up at this
          restaurant?

                    ARIADNE
          We came here from...

Ariadne trails off, confused.

                    COBB
          How did we get here? Where are we?

Ariadne THINKS, unable to remember. A FAINT RUMBLE begins.

                    ARIADNE
          Oh my God. We're dreaming.

Cobb nods. The RUMBLE is BUILDING.

                    COBB
          Stay calm. We're actually asleep in
          the workshop. This is your first
          lesson in shared dreaming,
          remember?

Ariadne looks around, mind REELING. Cobb BRACES-

The restaurant VIOLENTLY FRAGMENTS, EXPLODING AND IMPLODING
PARTICLES OF FURNITURE, WALLS, PEOPLE FLYING AROUND- Ariadne
WONDERS at the MAYHEM WHIRLING around them- Cobb SHIELDS his
head against the debris. She sees him-

                    ARIADNE
              (shouting over noise)
          If it's just a dream, why are you
          covering your-

Ariadne is WIPED FROM HER SEAT BY A MASSIVE BLAST and we-

                                                   CUT TO:

INT. WORKSHOP - DAY

Ariadne JOLTS awake.

                    COBB (O.S.)
          Because it's never just a dream.

Ariadne turns to Cobb's voice. They are both sitting in the
lawn chairs. Arthur watches over them.
                                                        33.

                    COBB
          And a face full of glass hurts like
          hell, doesn't it? While we're in
          it, it's real.

                    ARTHUR
          That's why the military developed
          dream sharing-a training program
          where soldiers could strangle, stab
          and shoot each other, then wake up.

                    ARIADNE
          How did architects get involved?

                    COBB
          Someone had to design the dreams.
              (to Arthur)
          Let's go another five minutes-

                    ARIADNE
          We were only asleep for five
          minutes? We talked for an hour at
          least...

                    COBB
          When you dream, your mind functions
          more quickly, so time seems to pass
          more slowly.

                    ARTHUR
          Five minutes in the real world
          gives you an hour in the dream.

                    COBB
          Let's see how much trouble you can
          cause in five minutes.

And we-

                                                  CUT TO:

EXT. SAME PARISIAN STREET - DAY

Ariadne walks down the crowded street with Cobb. Cobb looks
around at the street, the cafe, approving.

                    COBB
          It's good. You've got the cafe, the
          layout... you forgot the book shop
          but pretty much everything else is
          here.

Ariadne looks at the passers-by.

                    ARIADNE
          Who are the people?
                                                        34.

                    COBB
          They're projections of my
          subconscious.

                     ARIADNE
          Yours?

                    COBB
          Sure-you are the dreamer, I am the
          subject. My subconscious populates
          your world. That's one way we get
          at a subject's thoughts-his mind
          creates the people, so we can
          literally talk to his subconscious.

                    ARIADNE
          How else do you do it?

                    COBB
          Architecture. Build a bank vault or
          a jail, something secure, and the
          subject's mind will fill it with
          information he's trying to protect.

                    ARIADNE
          Then you break in and steal it.

                     COBB
          Exactly.

Ariadne wonders at the detail of the street.

                     ARIADNE
          I love the concrete sense of things-
              (stamps foot)
          Real weight, you know? I thought a
          dream space would be all about the
          visual, but it's the feel of
          things. Question is, what happens
          as you start to mess with
          physics...

She CONCENTRATES on the street. The street starts to BEND IN
HALF- the buildings on either side FOLDING IN until they form
the INSIDE OF A CUBE OF CITY, GRAVITY FUNCTIONING
INDEPENDENTLY ON EACH PLANE. Ariadne looks up (or down) at
the people on the opposite city surface. Cobb watches her
excitement.

                    ARIADNE
          It's something, isn't it?

                    COBB
              (quiet)
          Yes. It is.
                                                        35.

As they walk, Ariadne notices more and more of the
projections STARING at her.

                    ARIADNE
          Why are they looking at me?

                    COBB
          Because you're changing things. My
          subconscious feels that someone
          else is creating the world. The
          more you change things, the quicker
          the projections converge on you.

                      ARIADNE
          Converge?

                    COBB
          They feel the foreign nature of the
          dreamer, and attack-like white
          blood cells fighting an infection.

                    ARIADNE
          They're going to attack us?

                    COBB
          Just you, actually.

They walk along the street to where it joins the next
gravitational plane. They step up onto the different plane
and walk down the street towards a river. As Ariadne
approaches, steps emerge from the flagstone, and she leads
Cobb up onto a small jetty. As she concentrates, pillars
emerge and a BRIDGE starts to telescope out from the jetty.
They step onto it as it grows. Cobb is impressed.

                    COBB
          It's beautiful... but if you keep
          on changing things...

People crossing the bridge STARE at Ariadne. Several of them
BUMP her shoulder as they pass.

                    ARIADNE
          Mind telling your subconscious to
          take it easy?

                    COBB
          That's why it's called subconscious.
          I don't control it.

The bridge now spans the Seine. Cobb marvels at it.

                    COBB
          Arched stone, iron pillars...
          it's...
                                                          36.

Cobb pauses, thinking. Remembering.

INSERT CUT: Mal, hair blowing, turns to Cobb, smiling,
laughing. He smiles back. They are on the same bridge.

                    COBB
          I know this bridge. This place is
          real-
              (serious)
          You didn't imagine it, you
          remembered it...

                     ARIADNE
              (nods)
          I cross it every day on my way to
          the college.

                    COBB
          Never recreate places from your
          memory. Always imagine new places.

                    ARIADNE
          You have to draw from what you know-

                    COBB
              (tense)
          Use pieces-a streetlamp,
          phonebooths, a type of brick-not
          whole areas.

Several people around them ECHO Cobb's attitude...

                     ARIADNE
          Why not?

                    COBB
          Because building dreams out of your
          own memories is the surest way to
          lose your grip on what's real and
          what's a dream.

                    ARIADNE
          Did that happen to you?

Cobb says nothing. He stands there, starinq at Ariadne.
PEOPLE around her stop and look at her, hostile.

                    COBB
          Look, this isn't about me-

Cobb reaches for Ariadne's arm, turns her to him-

                    ARIADNE
          Is that why you need me to build
          your dreams?
                                                         37.

A passerby GRABS Ariadne's shoulder-

                    COBB
          Leave her alone-

More of the crowd join in, PULLING at Ariadne, holding her
arms open- Cobb PULLS people off- the crowd PUSHES him away-
Cobb sees someone WALKING PURPOSEFULLY through the crowd
towards the helpless, Ariadne- it is Mal. She approaches with
even strides- Ariadne stares at her, uneasy.

                    ARIADNE
          Wake me up, Cobb.

As Mal walks, she pulls out a LARGE KNIFE-

                       COBB
          Mal, no!

                    ARIADNE
          Wake me up!

Ariadne SCREAMS as Mal LUNGES at her with the knife and we-

                                                  CUT TO:

INT. WORKSHOP-DAY

Ariadne WAKES, BREATHING HARD. Arthur moves to her-

                       ARTHUR
          It's okay.

                    ARIADNE
          Why couldn't I wake?

                    ARTHUR
          The only way to wake from inside
          the dream is to die.

Cobb, in the lawn chair opposite, PULLS his tubes out.

                    COBB
          She'll need a totem.

                       ARIADNE
          What?

                    ARTHUR
          Some kind of personal icon. A small
          object that you can always have
          with you, and that no one else
          knows,

Cobb gets to his feet, Ariadne stares at him, furious. He
heads to the bathroom.
                                                          38.

                     ARIADNE
          That's some subconscious you've
          got, Cobb.
              (calls after him)
          She's a real charmer!

                    ARTHUR
          Sounds like you've met Mrs. Cobb.

                    ARIADNE
              (surprised)
          She's his wife?

Arthur nods, pulling off Ariadne's tubes.

                    ARTHUR
          So. A totem. You need something
          small, potentially heavy...

INT. BATHROOM, WORKSHOP - CONTINUOUS

Cobb takes out his PEWTER SPINNING TOP, SPINS it on the
marble counter...

INT. WORKSHOP - CONTINUOUS

Ariadne looks at Arthur, puzzled.

                    ARIADNE
          Like a coin?

                    ARTHUR
          Too common. You need something that
          has a weight or movement that only
          you know.

INT. BATHROOM, WORKSHOP - CONTINUOUS

Cobb STUDIES the spin of the top as it decays, becoming more
and more ECCENTRIC...

INT. WORKSHOP - CONTINUOUS

                    ARIADNE
          What's yours?

Arthur holds out a DIE.

                    ARTHUR
          A loaded die.

Ariadne reaches for it- Arthur snatches sit away-
                                                          39.

                    ARTHUR
          I can't let you handle it. That's
          the point. No one else can know the
          weight or balance of it.

                     ARIADNE
          Why?

                    ARTHUR
          So when you examine your totem...

INT. BATHROOM, WORKSHOP - CONTINUOUS

Cobb's spinning top WOBBLES OVER.

                    ARTHUR (O.S.)
          You know, beyond a doubt, that
          you're not in someone else's dream.

Cobb GRABS it like a drowning man reaching for a lifeline.

INT. WORKSHOP - CONTINUOUS

Ariadne thinks this over.

                    ARIADNE
          That's not an issue for me.

                     ARTHUR
          Why not?

                    ARIADNE
          Arthur, maybe you can't see what's
          going on, maybe you don't want to.
          But Cobb's got problems he's tried
          to bury down there. I'm not going
          to open my mind to someone like
          that.

Ariadne gets to her feet. Walks away.

                    COBB (O.S.)
          She'll be back.

Arthur turns. Cobb is standing in the bathroom doorway.

                    COBB
          I've never seen anyone pick it up
          so fast. And one reality won't be
          enough for her now. When she comes
          back, get her building mazes.

                    ARTHUR
          Where will you be?
                                                           40.

                    COBB
          I've got to talk to Eames.

                    ARTHUR
          Eames? But he's in Mombasa. Cobol's
          backyard.

                    COBB
          Necessary risk.

                    ARTHUR
          There are plenty of other thieves.

                    COBB
          We don't just need a thief. We need
          a forger.

INT. GAMBLING DEN, MOMBASA - DAY

Crowded, bustling, smoke-filled. a westerner (40's), shabby
suit, is squeezed in at a dice game. This is EAMES. He
FIDDLES with his last two chips.

                    COBB (O.S.)
          Rub them against each other all you
          like, they're not going to breed.

Eames looks up to see Cobb.

                    EAMES
          You never know.

Eames tosses down his last chips. The dice are rolled...

                      COBB
          Drink?

Eames loses.

                    EAMES
          You're buying.

Cobb follows Eames. Eames mysteriously produces two stacks of
chips and puts them down in front of the cashier. Cobb pulls
one off the top, squints at the embossed name.

                    COBB
          You're spelling hasn't improved.

Eames GRABS the chip. Hands it to the cashier.

                      EAMES
          Piss off.

                    COBB
          How's your handwriting?
                                                        41.

Eames takes his money. Smiles at Cobb.

                       EAMES
          Versatile.

INT. STREET, MOMBASA - CONTINUOUS

Eames leads Cobb down the quiet street.

                    EAMES
          Word is, you're not welcome in
          these parts.

                       COBB
          Yeah?

                    EAMES
          There's a price on your head from
          Cobol Engineering. Pretty big one,
          actually.

                    COBB
          You wouldn't sell me out.

Eames looks at Cobb, offended.

                    EAMES
          `Course I would.

                    COBB
              (smiles)
          Not when you hear what I'm selling.

EXT. BALCONY OF A COFFEE HOUSE - LATER

A ramshackle balcony overlooking a bust street. Eames pours.

                       COBB
          Inception.

Eames's glass stops halfway to his mouth.

                    COBB
          Don't bother telling me it's
          impossible.

                    EAMES
          It's perfectly possible. Just
          bloody difficult.

                    COBB
          That's what I keep saying to
          Arthur.
                                      42.

          EAMES
Arthur? You're still working with
that stick-in-the-mud?

          COBB
He's a good point man.

          EAMES
The best. But he has no
imagination. If you're going to
perform inception, you need
imagination.

          COBB
You've done it before?

          EAMES
Yeas and no. We tried it. Got the
idea in place, but it didn't take.

          COBB
You didn't plant it deep enough?

          EAMES
It's not just about depth. You need
the simplest version of the idea-
the one that will grow naturally in
the subject's mind. Subtle art.

          COBB
That's why I'm here.

          EAMES
What's the idea you need to plant?

          COBB
We want the heir to a major
corporation to break up his
father's empire.

          EAMES
See, right there you've got various
political motivations, anti-
monopolistic sentiment and so
forth. But all that stuff's at the
mercy of the subject's prejudice-
you have to go to the basic.

            COBB
Which is?

          EAMES
The relationship with the father.
    (downs drink)
Do you have a chemist?
                                                        43.

Cobb shakes his head.

                     EAMES
          There's a man here. Yusuf. He
          formulates his own versions of the
          compounds.

                    COBB
          Let's go see him.

                    EAMES
          Once you've lost your tail.
              (Cobb reacts)
          Back by the bar, blue tie. Came in
          about two minutes after we did.

                    COBB
          Cobol Engineering?

                    EAMES
          They pretty much own Mombasa.

Cobb glances over the balcony.

                    COBB
          Run interference. We'll meet
          downstairs in half an hour.

                       EAMES
          Back here?

                    COBB
          Last place they'd expect.

Eames downs his drink. Rises. Walks over to the Businessman.

                       EAMES
          Freddy!

The Businessman looks up, awkward.

                    EAMES
          Freddy Simmonds, it is you!

Cobb nonchalantly SLIPS over the balcony DROPPING HARD into
the midst of the crowd on the street below.

                    EAMES
              (looks harder)
          Oh. No, it isn't.

EXT. STREET, MOMBASA - CONTINUOUS

Cobb stands up, PUSHES into the crowd- faces PEER at him- he
moves, trying to blend- TURNS- a SECOND BUSINESS MAN is
there.
                                                           44.

                       COBB
                 (disarming smile)
          Yes?

                    SECOND BUSINESSMAN
          We need to-

Cobb HEAD BUTTS the Second Businessman, PUSHES past him-

The First Businessman races out of the bar, sees Cobb's wake,
DIVES after him- Cobb RACES headlong through tight
passageways, WEAVING through or KNOCKING into the locals...

He steps into a dark, crowded cafe, scanning the tables...
the First Businessman enters, spots him. An AFRICAN MAN gets
in Cobb's face, jabbering at him in Swahili- Cobb considers
his options... the First Businessman DRAWS A GUN- Cobb bolts,
steps up on a table and out an open window, SCRAMBLING into
the alley outside...

Cobb LOOKS left, right... CUTS LEFT into a narrow, CROWDED
alley- the alley NARROWS TO A DEAD END. Faces in the CROWD
start to watch Cobb- PEOPLE start to SURROUND him- Cobb looks
back the way he came- the two Businessmen are there, GUNS
DRAWN-

Cobb sees a SMALL GAP between the buildings at the narrow end-
he THROWS himself into it- gets STUCK HALFWAY...

The crowd bears down, GRABBING for him as Cobb struggles to
SQUEEZE HIMSELF through the gap... Cobb's moving INCHES as
his pursuers gain YARDS... the Crowd is upon him... he BURSTS
FREE. TUMBLING onto the next street, ROLLING out of sight.

Cobb Jumps to his feet- in a market square. TWO MORE
BUSINESSMEN move towards him. Cobb BOLTS but a CAR SKIDS UP,
BLOCKS HIS PATH- the door opens- SAITO IS IN THE BACK.

                    SAITO
          Care for a lift, Mr. Cobb?

                    COBB
              (jumping in)
          What brings you to Mombasa, Mr.
          Saito?

                    SAITO
          I have to protect my investment.

EXT. COFFEE HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

Eames stands on the pavement. The car pulls up. Cobb beckons
from the rear window. Eames looks at Saito. Back to Cobb.

                    EAMES
          This is your idea of losing a tail?
                                                        45.

                    COBB
              (shrugs)
          Different tail.

INT. WORKSHOP - DAY

Arthur sits at the table, working on a mechanism. A small
COUGH prompts him to look up: Ariadne is there.

                    ARTHUR
          He said you'd be back.

                    ARIADNE
          I tried not to come.

                    ARTHUR
          But there's nothing else quite like
          it.

                    ARIADNE
          No paper, no pens... nothing
          between you and raw, direct
          creation.

Arthur picks up his mechanism.

                    ARTHUR
          Shall we take a look at paradoxical
          architecture?

Ariadne nods, takes off her coat and we-

                                                  CUT TO:

INT. PENROSE STEPS - LATER

Arthur leads Ariadne down some busy steps in a large glass
and steel ATRIUM in an office complex.

                    ARTHUR
          You're going to have to master a
          few tricks if you're going to build
          three complete dream levels.

A SECRETARY DROPS some papers as they pass...

                    ARIADNE
          What sort of tricks?

They take a tight turn and continue down the next flight.

                    ARTHUR
          In a dream, you can cheat
          architecture into impossible
          shapes.
                    (MORE)
                                                        46.
                    ARTHUR (CONT'D)
          That lets you create closed loops,
          like the Penrose Steps. The
          infinite staircase.

Ariadne FREEZES- THEY ARE IN THE EXACT SPOT THEY STARTED
DESCENDING FROM, next to the Secretary gathering her papers.

Ariadne puzzles at the impossible construction of the stairs.

                    ARTHUR
          See...

Arthur stops her gently- they are on the highest step, with a
LARGE DROP to the next step. Arthur gestures at the drop.

                    ARTHUR
          Paradox. A closed loop like this
          helps you disguise the boundaries
          of the dream you've created.

                    ARIADNE
          How big do the levels have to be?

                    ARTHUR
          Anything from the floor of a
          building, to an entire city. But it
          has to be complicated enough for us
          to hide from the projections.

                    ARIADNE
          A maze.

                    ARTHUR
          And the better the maze-

                    ARIADNE
          The longer we have before the
          projections catch us.

Ariadne looks around. Sees people LOOKING at Arthur.

                    ARIADNE
          My subconscious seems polite
          enough.

                    ARTHUR
          You wait, they'll turn ugly. No one
          likes to see someone else messing
          around in their mind.

                    ARIADNE
          Cobb can't build anymore, can he?
                                                        47.

                    ARTHUR
          I don't know if he can't, but he
          won't. He thinks it's safer if he
          doesn't know the layouts.

                    ARIADNE
          Why?

                    ARTHUR
          He won't tell me. I think it's Mal.
          I think she's getting stronger.

                    ARIADNE
          His ex-wife?

                    ARTHUR
          She's not his ex.

                    ARIADNE
          They're still together?

Arthur turns to Ariadne. Gentle.

                    ARTHUR
          No. No, she's dead, Ariadne. What
          you see in there is just his
          projection of her.

                    ARIADNE
          What was she like in real life?

                    ARTHUR
              (quiet)
          She was lovely.

                                                  CUT TO:

EXT. ROOFTOP, OLD TOWN, MOMBASA - DAY

Saito deposits a FILE in front of Cobb: PHOTOS, DOCUMENTS. As
Cobb runs through them, he passes them to Eames.

                    SAITO
          Robert Fischer, 32. Heir to the
          Fischer Morrow energy conglomerate.
          He's spent his whole life being
          groomed as successor-breaking up
          his father's empire will take a
          radical shift in his thinking.

                    COBB
          What's your problem with Fischer?

                    SAITO
          That's not your concern.
                                                          48.

                    COBB
          This isn't the usual corporate
          espionage, Mr. Saito. This is
          inception. The seed of the idea we
          plant will grow in this man's mind.
          It'll change him. It might even
          come to define him.

Saito looks at Cobb.

                    SAITO
          My sources suggest you might not
          have always been so cautious.

                    COBB
          Then you need new sources, Mr.
          Saito.

Saito considers Cobb. Shrugs.

                    SAITO
          Fischer Morrow has the regulators
          in their pockets. We're the last
          company standing between them and
          total energy dominance and we can
          no longer compete. Soon they'll
          control the energy supply of half
          the world. They'll be able to
          blackmail governments, dictate
          policy. In effect, they become a
          new superpower. The world needs
          Robert Fischer to change his mind.

                    EAMES
          That's where we come in. How's
          Robert Fischer's relationship to
          his father?

                    SAITO
          Rumor is the relationship is
          complicated.

                    COBB
          We'll need more than rumor, Mr.
          Saito.

Eames picks up a photo: a distinguished executive (68).

                     EAMES
          Can you get me access to him?
          Browning. Fischer senior's right-
          hand man. Fischer junior's
          godfather.
                                                        49.

                    SAITO
          It should be possible. If you can
          get the right references.

                    EAMES
          References are something of a
          specialty for me, Mr. Saito.

EXT. DECREPIT BUILDING, MOMBASA - LATER

Eames leads Cobb and Saito down uneven steps to a doorway.

INT. STAIRWELL - CONTINUOUS

Peeling paint, buzzing flies. They ascend to a dusty,
wire-reinforced glass door which Eames pushes open-



INT. PHARMACY - CONTINUOUS

Row upon row of wooden shelves holding hundreds of dusty
glass bottles of all shapes and colors. At the far end, a
portly 40-year-old man rises from behind his desk, beckoning.
This is YUSUF.

                    YUSUF
          Come, come.

Eames shakes Yusuf's hand. Yusuf stops at Cobb.

                    YUSUF
          Ah, yes. Mr. Cobb. I've heard so
          very much about you.
              (indicates chairs)
          please.

Yusuf chases a CAT off Saito's chair.

                    YUSUF
          Bloody cats.

Yusuf moves to a shelf and runs his fingers over the glass
bottles. None of them has a label.

                    YUSUF
          You work using Somnacin, I think,
          Mr. Cobb?

                    COBB
          You're well informed, Mr. Yusuf.

Yusuf places a bottle on the desk in front of Cobb.
                                                         50.

                    COBB
              (dubious)
          Somnacin?

                    YUSUF
              (proudly)
          Yusuf's Somnacin.

Yusuf pulls the stopper, holds it towards Cobb's nose.

                    COBB
          As good as the real thing?

Yusuf WHIPS the bottle away from Cobb, offended.

                       YUSUF
          Better.

Yusuf holds the bottle to the light, marveling.

                    YUSUF
          Binds the dreamers tight. Let's
          them dream as one. Makes it real.
          Of course, if you'd prefer, you
          could use Somnacin brand. If you
          could explain to the international
          control council what you wanted it
          for.

Yusuf puts the bottle back onto the shelf. Sits.

                    YUSUF
          You are seeking a chemist?
              (Cobb nods)
          To formulate compounds for a job?

                    COBB
          And to come into the held with us.

                    YUSUF
          I rarely go into the held, Mr.
          Cobb.

                    COBB
          We need you there to tailor
          compounds to our particular
          requirements.

                       YUSUF
          Which are?

                    COBB
          Great depth.

                    YUSUF
          A dream within a dream? Two levels?
                                                           51.

                      COBB
          Three.

                    YUSUF
          Not possible. That many dreams
          within dreams would be too
          unstable.

                    COBB
          I've done it before. You just have
          to add a sedative.

                    YUSUF
          A powerful sedative. How many team
          members?

                      COBB
          Five.

                      SAITO
          Six.
              (to Cobb)
          The only way to know you've done
          the job is if I go in with you.

                    COBB
          There's no room for tourists on
          these jobs, Mr. Saito.

                    SAITO
          This time, it would seem there is.

Cobb looks at him, uneasy. Yusuf pulls out another bottle.

                    YUSUF
          Of course. I use it every day.

Yusuf hands it to Cobb, who considers the white liquid
inside.

                      COBB
          For what?

Yusuf beckons them further into the pharmacy, to a METAL
DOOR. He STOPS- second thoughts.

                    YUSUF
          Perhaps... you will not want to
          see.

Cobb motions to continue. Yusuf pulls out a large key.
                                                        52.

INT. BACK ROOM, PHARMACY - CONTINUOUS

A dark room with ROWS of low COTS. Each with a sleeping
occupant. Tubes connect their wrists. An ELDERLY BALD MAN
watches over them.

                    EAMES
              (counting)
          Eighteen, twenty-all connected,
          bloody hell.

                    YUSUF
          They come every day. To share the
          dream.

Yusuf nods at the Elderly Bald Man, who moves to the nearest
bed. Reaches out to the OCCUPANT. Gives his face a FIRM SLAP.
The sleeper does not even stir.

                    YUSUF
          See? Very stable.

                    COBB
          How long do they dream?

                    YUSUF
          Three, four hours. Every day.

                    COBB
          How long in dream time?

                    YUSUF
          With this compound... about forty
          hours. Each and every day.

Saito surveys the room, appalled.

                    SAITO
          Why do they do it?

                    YUSUF
          Tell him, Mr. Cobb.

                    COBB
          After a while...
              (looks at Saito)
          It becomes the only way you can
          dream.

                    YUSUF
          Do you still dream, Mr. Cobb?

Cobb STARES at the sleepers. Uneasy.

                    EAMES
          They come here every day to sleep?
                                                        53.

                       ELDERLY BALD MAN (O.S.)
          No.

Cobb turns to the Elderly Bald Man, who looks fondly at his
dreamers.

                    ELDERLY BALD MAN
          They come to be woken up... the
          dream has become their reality...

The Elderly Bald Man pokes a crooked finger at Cobb's chest.

                    ELDERLY BALD MAN
          And who are you to say otherwise?

Cobb STARES at the Elderly Bald Man. DISTURBED. Cobb turns to
Yusuf. TOSSES him the bottle.

                    COBB
          Let's see what you can do.

INT. SAME - MOMENTS LATER

Cobb is lying on an empty cot, asleep. Yusuf stands over him.
As we move in on Cobb's SLEEPING FACE we hear the sound of a
FREIGHT TRAIN, BUILDING, and we-

                                                  CUT TO:

EXT. WASTELAND - DAY

CLOSE ON Cobb's face as he lies, EYES CLOSED, cheek pressed
to a METAL RAIL- THE SOUND OF THE TRAIN IS DEAFENING- Cobb is
BREATHING, BREATHING, BREATHING, and we-

                                                  CUT TO:

INT. BACK ROOM, PHARMACY - DAY

Cobb's eyes open. Yusuf is watching him.

                       YUSUF
          Sharp, no?

Cobb nods. Gets to his feet, looking around-

INT. BATHROOM, PHARMACY - CONTINUOUS

Cobb SPLASHES water on his face, breathing hard- INSERT CUT:
A CURTAIN BILLOWS. MAL TURNS TO US, HAIR BLOWING, SMILING.
Cobb fumbles in his pockets, pulls out his spinning top. He
tries to set it spinning on the back edge of the sink, but it
FALLS to the floor and rolls towards the door- Saito is
there. WATCHING Cobb. He looks down at the spinning top.
                                                         54.

                    SAITO
          Everything alright, Mr. Cobb?

Cobb dries his face with a paper towel. Picks up his top.

                    COBB
          Everything's fine.

INT. BACK ROOM, WORKSHOP - NIGHT

Close on a small BRASS CHESS PIECE. Ariadne tips it over.
Frowning, she picks up a micro drill, peels back the felt on
the bottom and widens a hole in one side of its base. Tests
the TIPPING POINT again. A NOISE makes her look up.

INT. WORKSHOP - CONTINUOUS

Ariadne comes into the main space. Someone is there,
unpacking one of the MECHANISMS. Cobb.

                    ARIADNE
          You're back.

Cobb looks up with a start. Caught out.

                    ARIADNE
          Are you going under on your own?

                    COBB
          I just-I need to test some things.
          I didn't realize anyone was here.

                    ARIADNE
          Just working on my totem.

Ariadne holds up the chess piece. Cobb reaches for it.

                    COBB
          Let me see-

Ariadne SNAPS it out of his reach. Smiles. Cobb nods.

                    COBB
          You're learning.

                    ARIADNE
          It's an elegant solution to keeping
          track of reality. Your invention?

                       COBB
          No. Mal's.

Cobb pulls out his spinning top. Looks at it.
                                                      55.

                    COBB
          This one was hers. She'd spin it in
          a dream and it would never topple.
          Just spin and spin...

                    ARIADNE
          Arthur told me she died.

                    COBB
          She did. How are the mazes coming?

Ariadne indicates three large ARCHITECTURAL MODELS.

                    ARIADNE
          Good. Each level relates to the
          part of the subject's subconscious
          we're trying to access. I'm making
          the bottom level a hospital, so
          that Fischer will bring his father
          there-

                    COBB
          Don't tell me. Remember, you only
          want the dreamer to know the
          layout.

                    ARIADNE
          Why's that so important?

                    COBB
          In case one of us brings in part of
          our subconscious. You wouldn't want
          any projections knowing the layout.

                    ARIADNE
          In case you bring Mal in.

Cobb says nothing.

                    ARIADNE
          You won't build yourself because if
          you know the maze, then she knows
          it. And she'd sabotage the
          operation. You can't keep her out,
          can you?

Cobb says nothing.

                    ARIADNE
          Do the others know?

                     COBB
          No.
                                                        56.

                    ARIADNE
          You have to warn them if it's
          getting worse-

                    COBB
              (gentle)
          I didn't say it's getting worse.
          Look, Ariadne, I need them for this
          job. I need you for this job.
          Without your help, I'll never get
          back to my children. And that's all
          I can care about right now.

                    ARIADNE
          Why can't you go home, Cobb?

Cobb looks at her, deciding what to say.

                    COBB
          They think I killed her.

                    ARIADNE
          How did she die?

Cobb thinks.

INSERT CUT: Mal, wind BLOWING her hair, smiles at Cobb. Now
we see Cobb- SHAKING HIS HEAD, TEARS STREAMING, BEGGING-
                       COBB
          Thank you.

                       ARIADNE
          For what?

                    COBB
          Not asking whether I did.

INT. WORKSHOP - DAY

Ariadne, Arthur, Yusuf, Eames and Saito sit around the room,
looking at FILES. Cobb presides.

                    COBB
          The mark is Robert Fischer, heir to
          the Australian energy conglomerate,
          Fischer Morrow.

Cobb opens a large presentation pad.

                    COBB (reads aloud)
          "I WILL SPLIT UP MY FATHER'S
          EMPIRE."

Cobb turns to the team.
                                                  57.

                    COBB
          An idea Robert Fischer's conscious
          mind would never accept. We have to
          plant it deep in his subconscious.

                      ARTHUR
          How deep?

                    COBB
          Three levels down.

                    ARTHUR
          A dream within a dream within a
          dream? Is that even possible?

                    COBB
          Yes. It is.

                    COBB
          Now, the subconscious motivates
          through emotion, not reason, so we
          have to translate the idea into an
          emotional concept.

                    ARTHUR
          How do you translate a business
          strategy into an emotion?

                    COBB
          That's what we have to figure out.
          Robert and his father have a tense
          relationship. Worse, even, than the
          gossip columns have suggested...

                    EAMES
          Do you play on that? Suggest
          breaking up his father's company as
          a 'screw you' to the old man?

                    COBB
          No. Positive emotion trumps
          negative emotion every time. We
          yearn for people to be reconciled,
          for catharsis. We need positive
          emotional logic.

Eames thinks. Paces. Looking back at the board.

                    EAMES
          Try this... "MY FATHER ACCEPTS THAT
          I WANT TO CREATE FOR MYSELF, NOT
          FOLLOW IN HIS FOOTSTEPS."

                    COBB
          That might work.
                                                         58.

                    ARTHUR
          Might? We'll have to do better than
          that.

                    EAMES
          Thanks for the contribution,
          Arthur.

                    ARTHUR
          Forgive me for wanting a little
          specificity, Eames.

                    COBB
          Inception's not about specificity.
          When we get inside his head, we're
          going to have to work with what we
          find.

Arthur shrugs, frustrated. And we-

                                                  CUT TO:

EXT. NEW YORK STREETS - DAY

The team are in the middle of a DESERTED intersection.
Ariadne is showing Yusuf aspects of the geography.

                    EAMES
          We could split the idea into
          emotional triggers, and use one on
          each level.

                    COBB
          How do you mean?

                    EAMES
          On the top level, we open up his
          relationship with his father....
          Say: "I WILL NOT FOLLOW IN MY
          FATHER'S FOOTSTEPS." Next level
          down we've accessed his ambition
          and self-esteem. We feed him: "I
          WILL CREATE SOMETHING MYSELF."
          Then, the bottom level, we bring
          out the emotional big guns...

                    COBB
          "MY FATHER DOESN'T WANT ME TO BE
          HIM."

                    EAMES
          That could do it.

                    ARTHUR
          How do you produce these emotional
          triggers?
                                                        59.

                    EAMES
          I forge each emotional concept in
          the style and manner of Peter
          Browning, a key figure in Fischer's
          emotional life.

Two AFRICAN PEDESTRIANS wander into view.

                    ARTHUR
          Are those yours?

Eames shakes his head. Cobb turns to Yusuf.

                    ARTHUR
          Yusuf?

                    YUSUF
          Yup. Sorry.

                    COBB
          Suppress them. We don't bring our
          own projections into the dream-we
          let Fischer's subconscious supply
          the people.

                    EAMES
          Saito, when do I get to see
          Browning?

                    SAITO
          You fly out to Sydney on Tuesday.
          We've arranged for you to spend
          several days...

INT. ANTEROOM, MAURICE FISCHER'S OFFICE - DAY

Eames sits in the crowded room. Boxes and files are piled
high. Browning stands by a pair of double doors.

                    SAITO (V.O.)
          ...as part of a consulting
          litigation team working for
          Browning.

                    BROWNING
          I'm not smelling settlement here-we
          take them down.

                    LAWYER
          Mr. Browning, Maurice Fischer's
          policy is always one of avoiding
          litigation-

Browning turns to the lawyer. Calm, but POWERFUL.
                                                           60.

                    BROWNING
          Shall we relay your concerns
          directly to Maurice?

Browning opens the doors to Maurice Fischer's inner office.
Eames leans in to watch as Browning beckons the Lawyer into-

INT. MAURICE FISCHER'S INNER OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

The office is a MAKESHIFT HOSPITAL ROOM: a BED where the desk
should be. Browning addresses a figure at the window. ROBERT
FISCHER, 30'S, abstracted.

                       BROWNING
          How is he?

Fischer turns to Browning. Motions silence, as he glances at
his FATHER in the bed. Wheezing gently.

                    BROWNING
          I don't want to bother him
          unnecessarily but I know he-

                     FATHER
          Robert! I've told you to keep out
          the damn!-

MAURICE LASHES OUT, KNOCKING things from his bedside table. A
NURSE calms Maurice as Fischer crouches to retrieve a FRAMED
PHOTOGRAPH. He looks at the photo through the broken glass- a
YOUNG BOY holds a PINWHEEL CLEARLY MADE BY A CHILD (each of
the points is numbered in pen), his FATHER blows on it.

                    BROWNING
          Must be a cherished memory of his-

                    FISCHER
          I put it by his bed. He hasn't even
          noticed.

                    BROWNING
          Robert, we have to talk about a
          power of attorney. I know this is
          hard for you, but it's important
          that we start to think about the
          future-

                    FISCHER
          Not now, Uncle Peter.

Browning looks at Fischer, considering. Biding his time.

                    EAMES (V.O.)
          The vultures are circling. The
          sicker Maurice Fischer becomes, the
          stronger Peter Browning becomes...
                                                         61.

Eames WATCHES Browning, STUDYING his every move .

INT. BATHROOM - DAY

Eames gestures at a mirror, as if offering to shake hands...

                    EAMES (V.O.)
          I've had time to learn Browning's
          physical presence and mannerisms...
In the mirror: BROWNING GESTURES BACK.

INT. WORKSHOP - CONTINUOUS

                    EAMES
          Now, in the dream, I can impersonate
          Browning and suggest the concepts to
          Fischer's conscious mind...
              (draws a diagram)
          Then we take Fischer down another
          level and his own subconscious
          feeds it right back to him.

                    ARTHUR
              (impressed)
          So he gives himself the idea.

                    EAMES
          Precisely. That's the only way
          to make it stick. It has to seem
          self-generated.

                    ARTHUR
          Eames, I'm impressed.

                    EAMES
          Your condescension, as always, is
          much appreciated, Arthur.

INT. DESERTED HOTEL LOBBY - DAY

The team sit on the steps of the large marble lobby,
debating. Ariadne is showing Arthur the lobby.

                    EAMES
          He's not scheduled for surgery, no
          dental, nothing.

                    COBB
          I thought he had some knee thing?

                    EAMES
          Nothing they'd put him under for.
          Besides, we need a good ten hours.
                                                        62.

They turn to Saito.

          Twelve hours and forty-five
          minutes-one of the longest flights
          in the world. He makes it every two
          weeks...

EXT. AIRFIELD - DAY

Fischer steps out of a black town car and walks across the
tarmac towards a GULF STREAM JET, accompanied by two aides.

                    COBB (V.O.)
          Surely he flies private?

                    SAITO (V.O.)
          Not if there were unexpected
          maintenance with his plane.

Fischer is met at the steps by a DISTRAUGHT FLIGHT OFFICER.

INT. HOTEL LOBBY - DAY

Cobb chews this over. Arthur comes over.

                    ARTHUR
          It'd have to be a 747.

                      COBB
          Why?

                     ARTHUR
          On a 747 the pilots are up above,
          first class is in the nose so
          nobody walks through the cabin.
          We'd have to buyout the whole
          cabin, and the first class flight
          attendant-

                    SAITO
          We bought the airline.

Everyone turns to Saito.

                    SAITO
          It seemed... neater.

                    COBB
          Neater, huh?
              (gets to his feet)
          Well, now we have ten uninterrupted
          hours.

          Nice lobby, by the way.

INT. WORKSHOP - DAY

The group is back in the workshop, deep in discussion.

                    ARTHUR
          My question is how we go down three
          layers with enough stability. Three
          layers down a little turbulence is
          gonna translate into an earthquake.
          The dreams are gonna collapse with
          the slightest disturbance.

Yusuf clears his throat.

                    YUSUF
          Sedation. For sleep stable enough to
          create three layers of dreaming...

INT. MAKESHIFT LAB - DAY

Yusuf depresses a plunger. Arthur is SLEEPING in a chair.

                    YUSUF (V.O.)
          We will have to combine it with an
          extremely powerful sedative....

Eames SLAPS Arthur, HARD. Arthur does not stir.

INT. WORKSHOP - DAY

Arthur unconsciously rubs his cheek.

                    YUSUF
          The compound we'll be using to
          share the dream is an advanced
          Somnacin derivative. It creates a
          very clear connection between
          dreamers, whilst actually
          accelerating brain function.

          Buying us more time in each level.

          Brain function in the dream will be
          about twenty times normal.

          How much time?

                    YUSUF
          Three dreams... that's ten hours,
          times twenty, times twenty, times
          twenty...

                    EAMES
          Math was never my strong suit.

                    COBB
          It's basically a week one layer
          down, six months two layers down-

                    ARIADNE
          And ten years in the third level.
          Who wants to spend ten years in a
          dream?

                    YUSUF
          Depends on the dream.

                     EAMES
          It's not going to take us long to
          crack Fischer open once we get
          going. We'll be out in a couple
          days, max.

                     ARTHUR
          How do we get out once we've made
          the plant?
              (to Cobb)
          I hope you've got something a
          little more elegant in mind than
          shooting me in the head like last
          time.

Arthur tilts back in his chair. Yusuf turns to Cobb.

                    COBB
          A kick.

                    ARIADNE
          What's a kick?

Eames slips his foot under Arthur's chair leg. TIPS it-
Arthur's legs SHOOT UP INSTINCTIVELY for balance-

                    EAMES
          That, Ariadne, would be a kick.
                                                          65.

                    COBB
          That feeling of falling which snaps
          you awake. We use that to jolt
          ourselves awake once we're done.

                    ARTHUR
          But how are we going to feel that
          through the sedation?

                    YUSUF
          That's the clever part. I customize
          the sedative...

INT. MAKESHIFT LAB - DAY

Cobb, Eames and Yusuf watch Arthur, ASLEEP, in a chair.

                    YUSUF (O.S.)
          To leave inner ear function
          unimpaired...

Yusuf, with a wicked grin, slowly TIPS Arthur's chair
backwards... as he falls, Arthur's body JERKS, EYES OPENING
just before he HITS the floor.

INT. WORKSHOP - DAY

Arthur thinks, nodding slowly.

                    YUSUF
          That way, however deep the sleep, the
          sleeper will still feel falling...

INT. MAKESHIFT LAB - DAY

Yusuf gleefully LEANS a SLEEPING ARTHUR to one side ...

                    YUSUF (V.O.)
          Or tipping...

Arthur goes down with a CRASH, JERKING AWAKE-

INT. WORKSHOP - DAY

Arthur thinks this through.

                    ARTHUR
          Even that won't cut through three
          layers of deep sleep.

                    COBB
          The trick is to devise a kick for
          each level, then synchronize them
          to get a snap that penetrates all
          three layers.
                                                        66.

Arthur looks at Cobb, getting it.

                    ARTHUR
          We can use the musical countdown to
          synchronize the different kicks.

INT. WORKSHOP - NIGHT

Ariadne comes into the darkened main space. Cobb is lying on
one of the chairs, asleep. Plugged into the mechanism.
Ariadne stands over him. Watching.

She opens the case, PULLS one of the tubes, sits, checking
the dials as she injects the needle cap into her arm, and we-

                                                  CUT TO:

INT. CAGE STYLE ELEVATOR - DAY

Ariadne ascends. She looks at the buttons. Spots the "B." The
elevator STOPS. She looks through the grill at-

INT. YOUNG GIRL'S BEDROOM - DAY

Ariadne pulls back the grill and walks across the room,
considering the dusty furnishings. At the window is a doll's
house, front slightly ajar. Ariadne opens it. Inside is a
SAFE. She tries it. LOCKED. A NOISE STARTLES her- she turns,
looking through a doorway into another room...

INT. LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Ariadne looks into the room to see Cobb and Mal talking,
arguing. A private moment. Mal brushes at Cobb's hair, trying
to convince him. We hear snatches of conversation-

                     MAL
          You remember when you asked me to
          marry you?

                    COBB
          Of course...

                    MAL
          You said you had a dream...

                    COBB
          That we'd grow old together.

                    MAL
          And we can. You know how to find
          me... you know what you have to do.

Cobb is shaking his head, gently. Mal looks into Cobb's eyes-
gentle, loving... Mal SPOTS Ariadne spying on them.
                                                          67.

FREEZES, staring, hostile. Cobb turns, sees Ariadne, moves
towards her, leaving Mal.

                    COBB
          You shouldn't be in here.

Cobb guides her back into the elevator.

                    ARIADNE
          I wanted to know what "tests" you
          need to do on your own every night.

INT. CAGE STYLE ELEVATOR - DAY

Cobb shuts the CAGE DOOR. Ariadne hits a button. The elevator
RISES. Through the GRILL Ariadne can see a BEACH stretching
off into the distance. The elevator stops. Mal sits on the
sand. Beside her, the two children are crouched, away from
us, building a SANDCASTLE.

                    ARIADNE
          Why do you do this to yourself?

                    COBB
          This is the only way I can still
          dream.

                    ARIADNE
          Is it so important to dream?

Cobb stares at his family.

                    COBB
          In my dreams... we're still together.

The kids, WITHOUT TURNING AROUND, jump up and RUN AWAY.

INT. CAGE STYLE ELEVATOR - CONTINUOUS

The elevator descends.

                    ARIADNE
          But these aren't just dreams, are
          they? They're memories. You said
          never to use memories.

                    COBB
          And I shouldn't.

                    ARIADNE
          You're keeping her alive.

                    COBB
          No.
                                                          68.

                    ARIADNE
          You can't let her go.

                    COBB
          No. These are moments I regret.
          Moments I turned into dreams so I
          could change them.

Ariadne's fingers move across the buttons- stop at the "B."

                    ARIADNE
          What've you got buried down there
          that you regret?

Cobb pushes her hand away. Hits the third floor button.

                    COBB
          There's only one thing I need you
          to understand about me...

INT. KITCHEN, COBB AND MAL'S HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

Ariadne follows Cobb into the kitchen. A THIN MAN is there,
standing by the table. He holds a FOLDED PIECE OF PAPER.

                    ARIADNE
          This is your house?

                    COBB
          Mine and Mal's.

                    ARIADNE
          Where is she?

                    COBB
          She'd already died.

The Thin Man offers Cobb the piece of paper. A CHILD'S SHOUT-
Cobb TURNS. Ariadne follows his gaze to the garden. A small
blonde boy faces away from them, crouched on his haunches to
look at something on the ground.

                    COBB
          It's James. My boy. He's found
          something. Maybe a worm.

A slightly older girl RUNS into view.

                    COBB
          And there's Philippa.

She crouches beside the boy. Their FACES ARE AWAY FROM US.
They point and discuss whatever is on the ground.
                                                        69.

                    COBB
          I thought about calling out, so
          they'd turn and smile those
          incredible smiles... but I'm out of
          time-

The Thin Man thrusts the paper into Cobb's hand.

                    THIN MAN
          Right now. Or never, Cobb.

Cobb nods, turns from the window-

                    COBB
          Then I panic that I'll always wish
          I'd seen them turn, that I can't
          waste this chance...

Cobb TURNS BACK to call out- but the children RACE OFF...

                    COBB
          But the moment's passed. And
          whatever I do, the dream's always
          the same... When I'm about to
          call... they run.

Cobb watches them run off, calling for grandma, FACES UNSEEN.

                    COBB
          If I'm going to see their faces
          again-I've got to get back here in
          the real world...

Behind him, Ariadne SLAMS the grill shut. Cobb TURNS.

INT. CAGE STYLE ELEVATOR - CONTINUOUS

Ariadne hits the BASEMENT button. The elevator starts to
DESCEND. ariadne STARES, fascinated as glimpses of floors
slip past: Mal's childhood bedroom, a thundering wall of
freight train... The elevator STOPS. Through the grill
Ariadne sees a HOTEL SUITE. She pulls open the grill, steps
cautiously out into-

INT. ELEGANT HOTEL SUITE - CONTINUOUS (NOW NIGHT)

DISHEVELED bedclothes, UPENDED room service table,
STRAWBERRIES across the floor. A STRUGGLE. Ariadne steps
forwards- SMASH- she looks down to see that she has kicked
over a CHAMPAGNE FLUTE. Ariadne feels a draught. The CURTAIN
BILLOWS.

                    MAL (O.S.)
          What are you doing here?

Ariadne TURNS. Mal is there.
                                                        70.

                    ARIADNE
          My name is-

                    MAL
          I know who you are. What are you
          doing here?

                    ARIADNE
          I don't know. Trying to understand.

                    MAL
          How could you understand? Do you
          know what it is to be a lover? To
          be half of a whole?

                    ARIADNE
          No.

Mal moves slowly towards Ariadne...

                    MAL
          I'll tell you a riddle. You're
          waiting for a train. A train that
          will take you far away. You know
          where you hope this train will take
          you, but you don't know for sure...

Mal glides around Ariadne, looking her over.

                    MAL
          But... it doesn't matter. How can
          it not matter to you where that
          train will take you?

                    COBB (O.S.)
          Because you'll be together.

Cobb is standing in the elevator. Mal nods. Looks at him.

                    MAL
          How could you bring her here, Dom?

                    ARIADNE
          What is this place?

                    COBB
          A hotel. We spent our anniversaries
          in this suite.

                    ARIADNE
          What happened here?

Mal picks up the BROKEN STEM of a champagne flute...
                                                        71.

INT. CAGE STYLE ELEVATOR - CONTINUOUS

Cobb PULLS Ariadne into the elevator- Mal THROWS herself
towards Ariadne- Cobb SLAMS the GRILL- Mal SMASHES against it
AGAIN and AGAIN like a WILD ANIMAL- Ariadne FLINCHES-

                     MAL
          you PROMISED! YOU SAID WE'D BE
          TOGETHER!-

                    COBB
          We can. We will. But I need you to
          stay here for now-

                    MAL
          YOU SAID WE'D GROW OLD TOGETHER!-

Cobb pushes a button and the elevator starts to rise.

                    COBB
          I'll come back. I need you to stay
          here on your own for now. Just
          while I do this job. Then we can be
          together-

                    MAL
          WE'LL BE TOGETHER-YOU PROMISED!-

Mal THROWS herself against the grill, and. we-

                                                  CUT TO:

INT. WORKSHOP - NIGHT

Ariadne watches Cobb sleeping. His eyes gradually flicker
open. He sees her watching him.

                    ARIADNE
          You think you can just build a
          prison of memories to lock her in?
          You think that's going to contain
          her?

The LIGHTS COME ON: Saito and Arthur stand in the doorway.

                    SAITO
          Maurice Fischer just died in Sydney.

                    COBB
          When's the funeral?

                    SAITO
          Thursday. In Los Angeles.
                                                        72.

                    COBB
          Robert'll accompany the body
          Tuesday at the outside. We have to
          move.

Cobb gets up. Ariadne comes over to him.

                    ARIADNE
              (low)
          I'm coming with you.

                    COBB
          No. I promised Miles.

                    ARIADNE
          The team needs someone in there who
          understands what you're struggling
          with. If you don't want it to be me
          then you need to show Arthur what I
          just saw.

Cobb looks at Ariadne. Turns to Saito.

                    COBB
          We need one more seat on the plane.

INT. DEPARTURE GATE, SYDNEY - DAY

Saito stands looking out the window at a 747. Cobb arrives
beside him. They watch a COFFIN being loaded.

                    COBB
          If I get on this plane and you
          haven't taken care of things...
          when we land I go to jail for the
          rest of my life.

                    SAITO
          Complete the job en route, I make
          one phone call from the plane...
          you will have no trouble clearing
          immigration.

INT. FIRST CLASS CABIN, 747 - CONTINUOUS

The luxurious cabin has only ten seats. Cobb finds his- sees
Ariadne in the seat behind his. They do not acknowledge each
other. Behind her is Arthur, looking out the window. Eames
enters, STUFFS his bag into the overhead bin, BLOCKING the
passenger behind: ROBERT FISCHER, standing there, patient,
bag in hand, wearing black.

                       EAMES
          Oh, sorry.
                                                          73.

Eames SQUEEZES up against his seat to let Fischer BRUSH PAST.
Fischer moves to his seat, directly in front of Cobb. Eames
TOSSES Cobb a PASSPORT. Cobb flips it open: Fischer's.
Pockets it. Yusuf and Saito enter, take their seats.

EXT. RUNWAY - MOMENTS LATER

The 747 HURTLES down the runway.

INT. FIRST CLASS CABIN, 747 - MOMENTS LATER

Cobb looks down at his hand: a TINY VIAL taped to the center
of his palm. He removes the cap. The seatbelt sign goes dark.
Cobb unbuckles, stands.

                       COBB
          Excuse me?

Fischer looks up.

                       FISCHER
          Yes?

                    COBB
          I think this is yours...

Cobb holds up the open passport, comparing the picture to
Fischer. Fischer's hand goes to his pocket. Cobb hands
Fischer the passport.

                    FLIGHT ATTENDANT
          Would you gentlemen care for a
          drink?

                       FISCHER
          Water.

                       COBB
          Same.

Fischer gives Cobb a thin smile. Holds up his passport.

                    FISCHER
          Well, thank you.

                    COBB
          No problem. Look, I couldn't help
          noticing your name. You're not
          related to Maurice Fischer?

Fischer takes a beat. But Cobb seems harmless.

                    FISCHER
          Actually, he was my father.
                                                        74.

                    COBB
          I'm very sorry for your loss. He
          was an inspiring figure.

The Flight Attendant brings their drinks- Cobb takes them.

                    COBB
          Thanks.

As he turns to Fischer he LOWERS his right hand ... a CLEAR
LIQUID DROPS into Fischer's water as Cobb hands it to him.

                    COBB
          To Maurice Fischer.
              (they drink)
          I'll leave you in peace.

Fischer grants him a smile.

EXT. 747 - LATER

The great plane SOARS through a burning cloudscape.

INT. FIRST CLASS CABIN, 747 - MOMENTS LATER

Cobb reaches into the overhead for a blanket- lets it fall
onto Fischer's head- Fischer doesn't flinch. ASLEEP. Cobb
SIGNALS the others. The First Flight Attendant unlocks a
CUPBOARD in the galley, then leaves, closing the curtain.
Arthur moves into the galley and pulls out a MECHANISM CASE.

Cobb and Arthur open the mechanism- uncoil the tubes- feed
them around the window side of each of the seats. Arthur
rolls up Fischer's cuff- PUSHES the needle cap into Fischer's
wrist. Arthur pulls Fischer's cuff down and hides the tubes
behind the armrest of Fischer's seat.

Arthur runs the next tube to Ariadne. Cobb puts the case on
Yusuf's lap. Yusuf checks the TIMERS, tapping the syringes.
The others recline their seats. Yusuf HITS A BUTTON- closes
the case- places it at his feet. He settles back, and we-

                                                  CUT TO:

INT. SEDAN - DAY

Cobb DRIVES. Saito and Arthur are in the back. Rain BEATS
down. Cobb pulls over-

EXT. NEW YORK STREETS - CONTINUOUS

Yusuf stands on the corner, silver briefcase in hand, collar
turned up against the rain. He reaches for the door.
                                                          75.

INT. SEDAN - CONTINUOUS

Yusuf clambers into the back, brushing rain from his face.

                    ARTHUR
              (indicates rain)
          Couldn't you have peed before you
          went under?

                       YUSUF
          Sorry.

The front door OPENS and Eames climbs in, soaked.

                    EAMES
          Bit too much free champagne before
          takeoff, Yusuf?

                    YUSUF
          Ha bloody ha.

                    COBB
          At least we know he'll be looking
          for a cab in this.

INT./EXT. SEDAN ON RAINY NEW YORK STREETS - CONTINUOUS

Cobb pulls out into the heavy traffic. He weaves around
several cars before lining up behind a YELLOW CAB.

                    COBB
          Brace yourselves.

Cobb hits the gas- REAR ENDS the cab with a CRUNCH. The
CABDRIVER gets out, fuming. Heads to Cobb's window-

                    CABDRIVER
          Hey, asshole! Why don't you try
          driving without your thumb up-

He sees the SILENCED PISTOL Cobb is holding at his belly.

                       COBB
          Walk away.

The Cabdriver backs off. Arthur climbs into the cab. Both
cars pull away.

INT./EXT. CAB ON RAINY NEW YORK STREETS - CONTINUOUS

Arthur SLOWS in front of the TRAIN STATION, peering at the
pedes pedestrians. He SPOTS Fischer, lights the cab's sign.
Fischer FLAGS him down. Fischer JUMPS into the back, brushing
rain from his shoulders.
                                                           76.

                    FISCHER
          Third and Market. Snappy.

Eames JUMPS in from the other side.

                    FISCHER
          What're you doing?

                    EAMES
          Sorry, I thought it was free. Maybe
          we could share.

                       FISCHER
          Maybe not.

Saito gets into the front passenger seat. Pointing a gun.

                       FISCHER
          Great.

Arthur pulls away. Fischer pulls out his wallet and tosses it
at Eames.

                    FISCHER
              (contemptuous)
          There's 500 dollars in there. And
          the wallet's worth more than that.
          For that you ought to at least drop
          me at my stop.

Eames smiles at this.

                    EAMES
          I'm afraid-

A SHOT SHATTERS the window by Eames's head- another SHOT
IMPACTS by Saito-

                    EAMES
          Get us out of here!

Arthur hits the gas, but a BLACK S.U.V. SKIDS sideways in
front, BLOCKING the path-

A BLOCK BEHIND- Cobb is at a light. ARIADNE is getting in the
front. Cobb has HEARD the GUNFIRE-

                       COBB
          Come on!-

Cobb looks ahead to the AMBUSH, hits the gas- the sedan
ROCKETS forwards... but BAM- A FREIGHT TRAIN CLIPS THE FRONT
OF THE SEDAN, SHOVING IT SIDEWAYS AS AN ENDLESS TRAIN BARRELS
PAST, A WALL BETWEEN COBB AND THE AMBUSH-
                                                           77.

A SECOND S.U.V. is behind the cab- PLAIN CLOTHES SECURITY MEN
advance through the traffic, weapons trained on the cab.
Bullets RIP into the cab as Eames throws himself on top of
Fischer, PULLING a SACK over his head-

Inside the sedan, Ariadne watches the train passing-

                    ARIADNE
          This wasn't in the design-

Cobb BACKS UP, SPINS around, heading for the tail of the
train-

A Security Man emerges from the front S.U.V. carrying an
AUTOMATIC RIFLE- he steps towards the cab through the rain,
raises his weapon and BLASTS THE CAB'S WINDSCREEN-

Cobb clears the end of the train, and SKIDS across the tracks-

Arthur CROUCHES down- PUSHES the accelerator with his HAND-
YANKS the wheel- FLYING BLIND. The cab NAILS the Security
Man, CRUNCHING into the front S.U.V.-

Cobb SMASHES his car into the rear S.U.V., creating a GAP-

Arthur YANKS the transmission and REVERSES- SCRAPING through
the gap- Security Men DIVE out of the way- Arthur throws a
ragged J-turn to head down a SIDE STREET- Cobb follows in the
other car. Rain whips across Arthur's face as he BREATHES-

                    ARTHUR
          Everybody okay? Saito?

Arthur looks at Saito. Saito's hand is at his belly. Covered
in BLOOD.

EXT. WAREHOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

The sedan and cab pull into the side entrance- Eames jumps
out- PULLS the shutter down behind them-

INT. WAREHOUSE - CONTINUOUS

Yusuf and Eames PULL Fischer from the cab, HUSTLING him
through a doorway. Cobb JUMPS out of the sedan, furious.

                    COBB
          Arthur! Arthur what the-

Arthur pulls the bloody Saito from the front seat.

                    COBB
          Oh, Christ. Is he dying?
                                        78.

          ARTHUR
I don't know. What happened back
there? Where were you?

          COBB
We were blocked by a freight train.

          ARTHUR
    (to Ariadne)
Why would you put a train crossing
in a downtown intersection?

             ARIADNE
I didn't.

          COBB
    (snaps)
Why were we all ambushed, Arthur?!
Those weren't regular projections-
they'd been trained!

          ARIADNE
How could they be trained?

          ARTHUR
Fischer's had an extractor teach
his mind to defend itself. His
subconscious is militarized. It
should've shown on the research-

          COBB
So why the hell didn't it?!

             ARTHUR
Calm down.

          COBB
Don't tell me to calm down-you were
meant to check Fischer's background
thoroughly. You can't make this
kind of mistake-we're not prepared
for this kind of violence-

          ARTHUR
Cobb, we've dealt with sub-security
before. We just have to be more-

          COBB
This wasn't part of the plan, Arthur!
    (points at Saito)
He's dying!

          EAMES
So we put him out of his misery.
                                                          79.

Eames steps into the room, pulls his gun and moves over
Saito.

                    COBB
          No.

                    EAMES
          He's in agony. Let's wake him up-

Cobb GRABS Eames's arm.

                    COBB
          No!
              (they lock eyes)
          It won't wake him up.

                    EAMES
          What do you mean, it won't wake
          him? When you die in a dream you
          wake up.

                    YUSUF
          Not from this. We're too heavily
          sedated to wake up that way.

Eames looks at Yusuf, then to Cobb.

                    EAMES
          So what happens if one of us dies?

                    COBB
          That person doesn't wake up. Their
          mind drops into Limbo.

                    ARIADNE
          Limbo?

                    ARTHUR
          Unconstructed dream space.

                    ARIADNE
          What's down there?

                    ARTHUR
          Raw, infinite subconscious. Nothing
          there but what was left behind by
          anyone on the team who's been trapped
          there before. On this team... just
          Cobb.

                    ARIADNE
          How long would we be stuck there?
                                                        80.

                    YUSUF
          You couldn't even think about
          trying to escape until the sedation
          eases-

                      EAMES
          How long?

                    YUSUF
          Decades-it could be infinite-I
          don't know! Ask him-he's the one
          who's been there before!

Eames moves to Cobb. Looks him in the eye.

                    EAMES
          Great. So now we're stuck in
          Fischer's mind battling it out with
          his private army, and if we get hit
          we're stuck in Limbo 'til our
          brains dissolve into scrambled egg?

Cobb says nothing. Saito groans more loudly.

                    ARTHUR
          Let's just get him upstairs.

INT. OFFICE, WAREHOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

Saito is laid out on an old desk. Arthur examines him. He
motions to Ariadne. Eames watches Cobb.

                    ARTHUR
          Hold this. Firm pressure.

Arthur turns to Cobb.

                    ARTHUR
          You knew the risks and you didn't
          tell us.

                    COBB
          There wasn't meant to be any risk.
          We weren't supposed to be dealing
          with a load of gunnre.

                    ARTHUR
          You had no right.

                    COBB
          It's the only way you can go three
          layers deep, Arthur.

Arthur turns to Yusuf, hostile.
                                                81.

                    ARTHUR
          And you. You went along with this?

                    YUSUF
          I trusted him.

                    ARTHUR
          You trusted him? When? When he
          promised you half his share?

                    YUSUF
              (offended)
          No! His whole share. Plus, he told
          me he'd done it before.

Arthur turns to Cobb.

                    ARTHUR
          Oh, yeah? With Mal? That worked out
          great, didn't it, Cobb?

Cobb grabs Arthur.

                    COBB
          You don't know anything about that.
          This was the only way to do this
          job, Arthur. I did what I had to do
          to get back to my children.

                    EAMES
          So you led us into a war zone with
          no way out.

                    COBB
          We have a way out. The kick. We
          just have to push on, do the job as
          fast as possible and get out using
          the kick.

                    EAMES
          Forget it. We go any deeper, we
          just raise the stakes. I'm sitting
          it out on this level.

                    COBB
          You'll never make it, Eames.
          Fischer's security is surrounding
          this place as we speak. The ten
          hours of the flight is a week at
          this level-you'll never make it
          without getting killed. Downwards
          is the only way forwards. We have
          to carry on.

Saito groans. Cobb looks at him-
                                                           82.

                    COBB
          And we have to do it fast.

Eames and Arthur weigh this.

                    COBB
          Eames, go get ready. Arthur, let's
          get in there and soften him up.

INT. BATHROOM, WAREHOUSE - LATER

Cobb and Arthur, wearing BALACLAVAS, PULL the sack from
Fischer's head. He is chained to the radiator.

                    FISCHER
          I'm insured against kidnapping up
          to ten million-this'll be simple-

                    COBB
          No, it won't.

Fischer looks at Cobb, unnerved.

                    ARTHUR
          In. your lather's office, below the
          bookshelves, is his personal safe.
          We need the combination.

                    FISCHER
          I never noticed a safe-

                    COBB
          Doesn't mean you don't know the
          combination.

                    FISCHER
          Well, I don't.

                    ARTHUR
          We have it on good authority that
          you do.

                    FISCHER
          Whose?

INT. OFFICE, WAREHOUSE - CONTINUOUS

Yusuf looks through Fischer's wallet. Eames is opening a
HINGED, THREE-WING MIRROR.

                    YUSUF
          Five hundred dollars, this cost?

                    EAMES
          What's inside?
                                                        83.

                    YUSUF
          Cash, cards, ID... and this-

Yusuf holds up a SNAPSHOT: the photo from Maurice Fischer's
office- YOUNG ROBERT holds his HOMEMADE PINWHEEL, his FATHER
blows on it. Eames takes it from Yusuf. STUDIES it. Cobb
enters. Eames hands him the snapshot.

                    EAMES
          Useful?

Cobb studies the snapshot. Eames examines himself in the
hinged mirror from multiple angles: ONE BY ONE the myriad
Eames reflections BECOME BROWNINGS. Cobb pockets the photo.

                    COBB
          You're on. You've got an hour.

                    EAMES
          An hour? I was supposed to have all
          night to crack him.

                    COBB
          And Saito was supposed to keep his
          guts on the inside. You've got an
          hour-get something we can use.

Eames turns from the mirror AS BROWNING. He glances at his
watch, then SCREAMS, as if begging for mercy-

INT. BATHROOM, WAREHOUSE - CONTINUOUS

Browning's CRY reverberates- Fischer looks up, concerned-

                    FISCHER
          What's that?

                    ARTHUR
          Good authority.

Another cry rings out. Fischer recognizes the voice.

                    FISCHER
          Uncle Peter?! Make them stop-

                    ARTHUR
          The combination.

                    FISCHER
          I don't know it!

                    ARTHUR
          Why would Browning tell us you did?

                    FISCHER
          Let me talk to him-I'll find out.
                                                        84.

INT. BATHROOM, WAREHOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

Cobb pushes Browning (Eames), bloody and bruised, into the
room and forces him down next to Fischer. Cobb handcuffs
Browning's wrist to a metal bracket on the side of the sink.

                    COBB
          You've got an hour. Get talking.

Cobb leaves.

                    BROWNING (EAMES)
          They've had me for two days.
          They've got someone with access to
          your father's office and they're
          trying to open his safe-they
          thought I'd know the combination,
          but I don't-

                    FISCHER
          Neither do I, Uncle Peter.

                    BROWNING
              (confused)
          Maurice told me that after he
          passed only you would be able to
          open it.

                    FISCHER
          He never gave me the combination.

Browning thinks for a minute. Realizes something.

                    BROWNING
          He did, he just didn't tell you
          that it was a combination.

                    FISCHER
          What, then?

                    BROWNING
          Something only you would know. Some
          meaningful combination of numbers
          from your experiences with Maurice-

                    FISCHER
          We didn't have a lot of meaningful
          experiences together.

                    BROWNING
          Perhaps after your mother died...

                    FISCHER
          After my mother died, I went to him
          in my grief.
                    (MORE)
                                                        85.
                    FISCHER (CONT'D)
          You know what he told me? "There's
          really nothing to be said, Robert."

                     BROWNING
          He always had a hard time with
          emotional-

                    FISCHER
          I was eleven, Uncle Peter.

Browning (Eames) takes this in.

                    BROWNING
          He loved you, Robert. In his way.

                    FISCHER
          "In his way?" At the end he called
          me to his deathbed. He could barely
          speak, but he took the trouble to
          say one last thing to me. He pulled
          me close... I could make out only
          one word. "Disappointed."

Browning can say nothing.

INT. OFFICE, WAREHOUSE - CONTINUOUS

Cobb pulls off his balaclava. Looks down at Saito, who is
breathing fast, shallow.

                    COBB
          How's he doing?

                    ARIADNE
          He's in a lot of pain.

Cobb takes Saito's hand. Looks him in the eye.

                    COBB
          When we get you down to the next
          level, the pain will be less
          intense.

Saito nods, breathing hard.

                    ARIADNE
              (low)
          And if he dies?

                    COBB
          His conscious mind will drop out of
          the dream. He'll be trapped in
          Limbo for a lifetime...

                    ARIADNE
          What will that do to him?

Cobb looks at her. Grave.

                    COBB
          When he wakes... his mind could be
          completely gone.

                    SAITO
          When... when we wake I will still
          honor our arrangement...

Cobb looks down at Saito sadly.

                    COBB
          Saito-san, when you wake you might
          not even remember that we had an
          arrangement. You'll have forgotten
          this world. Limbo will be your
          reality. Lost there so long, you'll
          have become an old man...

                    SAITO
          Filled with regret?

                    COBB
          Waiting to die alone. Yes.

                    SAITO
          Then I'll take the chance and come
          back. And we'll be young men
          together again.

Saito smiles weakly. Cobb nods at him, turns to Ariadne.

                    ARIADNE
          When were you trapped in Limbo?

Cobb says nothing. Ariadne pulls him away from Saito.

                    ARIADNE
          Cobb, you might have convinced the
          rest of this team to carry on with
          the job. But they don't know the
          truth.

                    COBB
          What truth?

                    ARIADNE
          The truth that at any minute you
          might bring a freight train through
          the wall. The truth that Mal is
          bursting up through your
          subconscious.

                                                         87.
                    ARIADNE (CONT'D)
          The truth that as we go deeper into
          Fischer, we're also going deeper
          into you-and I'm not sure we're
          going to like what we find there.

Cobb stares back at Ariadne. Saying nothing.

                    ARIADNE
          This is not just about Fischer,
          it's about you. Tell me what
          happened to you and Mal. Trapped in
          Limbo.

Cobb looks at her. Thinking it through.

                    COBB
          We were on a job. Exploring dreams
          within dreams. But we didn't
          understand how your mind can turn
          hours into years. How you can get
          trapped. Trapped so deep that when
          you wash up on the shore of your
          subconscious...

          You can lose track of what's real.

                    ARIADNE
          How long were you stuck?

Cobb pauses before he answers. Looks at Ariadne.

                    COBB
          Fifty years.

Ariadne stares at him, incredulous.

                    ARIADNE
          How did you stand it?

                    COBB
          It's not so bad at first, being
          gods. The problem is knowing that
          it's not real. It became impossible
          for me to live like that.
                                                        88.

                    ARIADNE
          But not for her?

                    COBB
          She accepted it. At some point...

INT. MAL'S CHILDHOOD HOME - DAY

Mal opens a DOLL'S HOUSE. Inside is a SAFE. She opens it- it
is empty. She pulls out her SPINNING TOP.

                    COBB (V.O.)
          ...she'd decided to forget that our
          world wasn't real.

Mal places the top inside the safe. LOCKS IT AWAY...
INT. OFFICE, WAREHOUSE - CONTINUOUS

                    ARIADNE
          And when you finally woke up?

                    COBB
          To wake from that. From decades
          lived. To be old souls thrown back
          into youth. It was hard. At first
          Mal seemed okay. But I started to
          realize something was wrong.
          Finally she admitted it. This idea
          she was possessed by. This simple
          little idea that changed
          everything...

                    ARIADNE
          What was it?

                    COBB
          That our world was not real. No
          matter what I did, no matter what I
          said, she was convinced that we
          were still in a dream. That we
          needed to wake up again...

INT. COBB AND MAL'S KITCHEN - DAY (FLASHBACK)

Cobb is trying to calm Mal, who is hysterical.

                     COBB (V.O.)
          That to get home we'd have to kill
          ourselves.

INT. WORKSHOP - DAY

Ariadne looks at Cobb, appalled.
                                                          89.

                    ARIADNE
          What about your children?

Cobb has to look away.

                    COBB
          She... she believed they weren't
          real. That our real children were
          waiting. Somewhere above...

INT. COBB AND MAL'S KITCHEN - DAY (FLASHBACK)

Mal shakes her head at Cobb as he USHERS the children out of
the room, FACES UNSEEN-

                    COBB
          Calm down, Mal-

                    MAL
          They're projections, Dom. Your
          dreams. I'm their mother-don't you
          think I can tell the difference?

Cobb closes the door- turns to her, eyes full of bitter
tears.

                    COBB
          If it's my dream then why can't I
          control it? Why can't I stop this?

                    MAL
              (it's obvious)
          You don't know you're dreaming.

                    COBB
          You keep telling me I am-

                    MAL
          And you don't believe me!

                    COBB (V.O.)
          She was certain. But she loved me
          too much to go without me. So she
          made a plan...

INT. ELEGANT HOTEL CORRIDOR - NIGHT (FLASHBACK)

Cobb walks along, checking door numbers against a key.

                    COBB (V.O.)
          For our anniversary...

INT. ELEGANT HOTEL SUITE - CONTINUOUS (FLASHBACK)

Cobb enters the lavish suite. He notices the DISHEVELED
BEDCLOTHES.
                                                          90.

He steps forwards- SMASH- he has tipped over a champagne
glass with his foot... dinner for two is SPREAD ACROSS THE
FLOOR. He looks at the DEBRIS, confused... next to the broken
glass is a SPINNING TOP. He picks it up, studying it,
thinking. He feels a draught, looks to the window. The
CURTAIN BILLOWS.

EXT. EXTERIOR ATRIUM - CONTINUOUS (FLASHBACK)

Cobb looks out the window: Mal sits on the ledge of the
opposite window. HAIR BLOWING. Feet dangling over the
dizzyingly high atrium. She smiles.

                     MAL
          Join me.

                    COBB
          Mal, come back inside.

                    MAL
          No. I'm going to jump. And you're
          coming with me.

                    COBB
          No, I'm not. This is real-if you
          jump, you're not going to wake up,
          you're going to die. Let's go back
          inside and talk about this, please.

                    MAL
          We've talked enough.

She KICKS off a shoe and watches it DROP.

                    MAL
          Come out onto the ledge or I'll
          jump right now.

She means it. Cobb swings his legs out, sitting on the ledge
opposite is wife. He looks down at the drop.

                    MAL
          I'm asking you to take a leap of
          faith.

                    COBB
          I can't do that, Mal. I can't leave
          our children.

                    MAL
          If I go without you, they'll take
          them away, anyway.

                    COBB
          What do you mean?
                                                           91.

                     MAL
          I filed a letter with our attorney.
          Explaining how I'm fearful for my
          safety, how you've threatened to
          kill me...

Cobb looks back at the wrecked hotel suite, PANICKING...

                    MAL (CONT'D)
          I love you, Dom. I've freed you
          from the guilt of choosing to leave
          them. We're going home to our real
          children.

                    COBB
          Out children are here, Mal.

Mal CLOSES HER EYES. Cobb looks for some way to reach her...

                    MAL
          You're waiting for a train...

                    COBB
          NO! MAL, NO, I CAN'T!

                    MAL
          A train that will take you far
          away...

                    COBB
          DON'T DO THIS!

                    MAL
          You know where you hope this train
          will take you, you can't know for
          sure...

                    COBB
          DON'T!

                    MAL
          But it doesn't matter...

                    COBB
          NO!

                    MAL
          Because you'll be together...

Mal SLIPS FORWARD INTO SPACE. Cobb SCREAMS after her. Then
tries to bury his face in the wall...

INT. OFFICE, WAREHOUSE - DAY

Cobb stares as he remembers.
                                                           92.

                    COBB
          He letter to the authorities
          refuted all the claims about her
          sanity that she knew I'd make...

INT. COBB AND MAL'S KITCHEN - DAY (FLASHBACK)

Cobb stands with the Thin Man, who has a piece of paper.

                    COBB (V.O.)
          She'd had herself declared sane by
          three different psychiatrists.

Cobb hears a SHOUT- turns to the garden. James CROUCHES,
Philippa joins him, examining the ground, FACES UNSEEN...

                    COBB (V.O.) (CONT'D)
          It was impossible for me to explain
          the nature of her madness...

The Thin Man thrusts the paper into Cobb's hand.

                    THIN MAN
          Right now. Or never, Cobb.

Cobb turns back to the window- about to call out- James and
Philippa RUN OFF. Cobb turns from the window. Looks at the
paper in his hand. It is an AIRPLANE TICKET.

                    COBB (V.O.)
          So I ran. And I've been running
          ever since, trying to buy my way
          back to my family...

INT. OFFICE, WAREHOUSE - DAY

Cobb looks across at Ariadne.

                    ARIADNE
          Psychiatrists judged her sane?

                    COBB
          She was sane. She was just lost in
          the labyrinth.

                    ARIADNE
          Then why should you blame yourself?

                    COBB
          Because we were a family. And we
          had a life I would do anything to
          get back to now. But that reality
          wasn't enough for me then.
                                                        93.

                    ARIADNE
          It might have been your idea to
          push the limits, Cobb. But you're
          not responsible for the idea that
          destroyed her. The idea that her
          world wasn't real... that was her
          own idea from her own mind.

Cobb says nothing.

                    ARIADNE (CONT'D)
          Your guilt defines her. Powers her.
          If we're going to succeed in this,
          you're going to have to forgive
          yourself, and you're going to have
          to confront her. But you don't have
          to do it alone.

                    COBB
          You don't have to do this for me-

                    ARIADNE
          I'm doing it for the others. They
          don't know the risk they've taken
          coming in here with you.

Cobb looks at the rooftop opposite, sees a SNIPER take up a
position. Cobb shakes his head, frustrated.

                    COBB
          We can't stay here. Arthur?!

INT. BATHROOM, WAREHOUSE - CONTINUOUS

Browning puts his hand on Fischer's shoulder.

                    BROWNING
          These people are going to kill us
          if we don't give them the
          combination.

                    FISCHER
          They won't, they'll try to ransom
          us-

                    BROWNING
          I heard them-they're going to lock
          us in and run the can into the
          river.

                    FISCHER
          What is in the safe?
                                                           94.

                    BROWNING
          Something for you. Maurice always
          said it was his most previous
          gift... a will.

                    FISCHER
          Maurice's will is with Port and
          Dunn.

                    BROWNING
          It's an alternate. It supersedes
          the other only if you want it to.

                    FISCHER
          What does it say?

                    BROWNING
          It splits all the component
          businesses of Fischer Morrow into
          individual companies, transferring
          ownership to the boards of those
          companies...

                    FISCHER
          Leaving me nothing?

                    BROWNING
          A basic living. Nothing more. The
          entire empire would cease to exist.

                    FISCHER
          Destroy my own inheritance? Why
          would he suggest such a thing?

                    BROWNING
          I don't know, Robert.

Cobb OPENS the door. Arthur is behind him.

                    COBB
          Come to your senses?

                    FISCHER
          Let us go. I don't know the
          combination. Not consciously.

Cobb considers this. Opens his phone. Pulls out his gun.

                    COBB
          Let's try instinctively. I have
          someone standing in your father's
          office ready to tap in a
          combination.

He holds the phone to Fischer's mouth.
                                                           95.

                    COBB (CONT'D)
          First six numbers that come into
          your head. Right now.

                    FISCHER
          I have no idea-

Cobb SWINGS the gun onto Browning-

                       COBB
          RIGHT NOW!

                    FISCHER
          Five, two, eight... four, nine,
          one.

Cobb lowers his weapon. Listens to the phone. Shakes his
head. Shuts the phone.

                    COBB
          You'll have to do better. Bag `em.

Arthur puts SACKS over their heads.

INT. WAREHOUSE - CONTINUOUS

Cobb and Arthur drag Fischer and Browning to the van-

                    FISCHER
          We're worth much more to you
          alive...

Arthur places Fischer on the back seat- uses a DROPPER to
drop LIQUID onto Fischer's mask- his head SLUMPS FORWARDS.
"Browning" yanks the sack from his head- it is now EAMES.

                    EAMES
              (excited)
          His relationship with his father's
          much worse that we thought.

                    ARTHUR
          That helps us?

Arthur pulls a SNIPER RIFLE from a case by the van.

                    COBB
          The stronger the issues, the more
          powerful the catharsis.

Cobb motions for Yusuf to follow his upstairs.

                    ARTHUR
          But how do you reconcile them if
          they're that estranged?
                                                           96.

                    EAMES
          I'm working on that.

Arthur lines up a shot through the window-

                    ARTHUR
          Well, work fast-Fischer's
          projections are closing in quick,
          we need to break out of here before
          we're totally boxed in...

Arthur SHOOTS two snipers. Cobb and Yusuf gently load Saito
into the van. He groans. Ariadne straps him in, checks his
bandages. Arthur can't get the last sniper- he's too hidden
behind a wall-

                    EAMES
          Shouldn't be afraid to dream a
          little bigger, Arthur-

Eames lines up a shot with a grenade launcher. Fires- the
sniper EXPLODES into the air- Arthur looks at Eames.

                      EAMES (CONT'D)
          Shall we?

They climb into the van-

INT./EXT. VAN ON RAINY STREETS - CONTINUOUS

The van pulls out into the rain-drenched streets. Arthur
opens the mechanism case and hands out tubes-

                    COBB
          Shifting Fischer's antipathy from
          his father onto Browning should
          work.

                    EAMES
          We need the imagery, the words...

                    ARIADNE
          So you destroy his one positive
          relationship?

                    COBB
          No. We repair his relationship with
          his father and expose his
          godfather's true nature.

                    EAMES
          Hell, we should be charging Fischer
          as much as Saito.
                                                        97.

                    ARTHUR
          What about his security? It's going
          to get worse as we go deeper.

                    COBB
          We bring in Mr. Charles.

                       ARTHUR
          No.

                    EAMES
          Who's Mr. Charles?

                    ARTHUR
          A bad idea.

                    COBB
          Arthur, the second we approach
          Fischer in that hotel, they're
          gonna mow us down-we run with Mr.
          Charles like on the Stein job.

                    EAMES
          So you've done it before?

                    ARTHUR
          Sure. But it didn't work. The
          subject realized he was dreaming
          and his subconscious tore us to
          pieces.

Eames takes this in.

                    EAMES
          You learned a lot, though. Right?

                    COBB
              (to Eames)
          I'll need a decoy.

                    EAMES
          No problem. How about a pretty
          young lady I've used before?

                       COBB
          Fine-

Cobb looks back: a second S.U.V. pulls out, tailing them.

                    COBB (CONT'D)
              (to Yusuf)
          I know you've got to stay ahead of
          them, but drive with kid gloves,
          okay? The world down there is going
          to be very unstable-
                                                        98.

                    ARTHUR
          And don't make the jump too soon-
          that kick is our only way back, we
          have to be ready to catch it-

                     YUSUF
          I'll use the music to let you know
          when it's coming, but the rest is
          up to you.

Arthur puts the mechanism onto the front seat.

                    YUSUF (CONT'D)
          Everyone ready?

Nods all round.

                    YUSUF (CONT'D)
          Sweet dreams-

Yusuf hits a button and we-

                                                  CUT TO:

INT. HOTEL LOBBY BAR - SUNSET

Fischer nurses a drink. Staring at the ice cracking.

                    BLONDE (O.S.)
          Am I boring you?

Fischer looks up. A beautiful BLONDE is next to him.

                    BLONDE (CONT'D)
          I was telling you my story. I guess
          it wasn't to your liking.

                    FISCHER
          I have a lot on my mind.

Fischer looks around the bar. There are several STERN-LOOKING
CHARACTERS paying him too much attention.

INT. HOTEL LOBBY - CONTINUOUS

Arthur and Ariadne sit at a table across the lobby. They spot
Cobb moving across the lobby towards Fischer.

                    ARTHUR
          And there goes Mr. Charles.

                    ARIADNE
          Who or what, exactly, is Mr.
          Charles?
                                                        99.

                    ARTHUR
          It's a gambit designed to turn
          Fischer against his own
          subconscious.

INT. HOTEL LOBBY BAR - CONTINUOUS

Cobb approaches the bar, watched closely by Fischer's Sub-
security.

                    COBB
          Mr. Fishcer! Good to see you again.
          Rod Green, Marketing.
              (to Blonde)
          And you must be...

                     BLONDE
          Leaving.

She presses against Fischer as she slides off her stool and
deposits a cocktail napkin in front of him.

                    BLONDE (CONT'D)
          In case you get bored.

Cobb watches her walk away. The Sub-security FOLLOWS her.

                    COBB
          I think you just got blown off...
          unless her phone number really does
          have only six digits.

Fischer glances at the napkin: "528-491."

INT. HOTEL LOBBY - CONTINUOUS

Arthur watches the Sub-security follow the Blonde.

                    ARIADNE
          And why don't you approve?

                    ARTHUR
          Because it involves telling the
          mark that he's dreaming. Which
          involves attracting a lot of
          attention to us.

                    ARIADNE
          Didn't Cobb say never to do that?

                    ARTHUR
          You must've noticed by now how much
          time Cobb spends doing things he
          says never to do.
                                                       100.

INT. HOTEL LOBBY BAR - CONTINUOUS

Cobb turns to Fischer.

                    COBB
          Strange way to make friends.
              (off look)
          Lifting your wallet, I mean.

Fischer pats his pocket. Empty. He looks to the lobby where
he sees the Sub-security trailing the Blonde.

                    FISCHER
          Goddamn it. The wallet alone's
          worth-

                    COBB
          Five hundred bucks. I know. Don't
          worry, my guys are on it.

                    FISCHER
          Who did you say you were?

Fischer looks at him, curious. Cobb plows on, confident-

                    COBB
          I said I was Rod Green from
          Marketing-but I'm not. My name is
          Mr. Charles. I might seem familiar
          to you. I'm in charge of your
          security here.

INT. HOTEL LOBBY - CONTINUOUS

The Blonde hurries up to Saito, emerging from the elevator-

                    BLONDE
          Mr. Saito, can I have a minute?

She pushes him back into the elevator, closing the door as
the Sub-security approaches...

INT. ELEVATOR - CONTINUOUS

The Blonde fondles Saito's lapels, getting close.

                    SAITO
          I'm sorry, but...

Saito glances over her shoulder to see, in the tunnel of
infinite reflections created by the elevator's opposing
mirrors, three reflections in, THE BLONDE IS EAMES. He winks.

                    SAITO (CONT'D)
              (pushing him away)
          Very amusing, Mr. Eames.
                                                       101.

                    EAMES
          You look a bit perkier.

A SHUDDER ripples through the elevator.

                    SAITO
          Turbulence on the plane.

                    EAMES
          Feels closer. That's Yusuf's
          driving.

And we-

                                                  CUT TO:

INT./EXT. VAN ON RAINY DOWNTOWN STREETS - DAY

Yusuf FIGHTS the wheel as the van CUTS DOWN AN ALLEY, BUMPING
OVER POTHOLES and SMASHING TRASH CANS aside- THREE S.U.V.s IN
FURIOUS PURSUIT. Yusuf looks in the rear view mirror,
FRUSTRATED. He checks his WATCH, then checks the back: the
SLEEPERS SHAKE with the impact and we-

                                                  CUT TO:

INT. HOTEL LOBBY BAR - NIGHT

As a TREMOR echoes through the bar Fischer looks at Cobb
trying to place him.

                    FISCHER
          Security? You work for the hotel?

                    COBB
          No. My specialty is subconscious
          security.

                    FISCHER
          You're talking about dreams. You're
          talking about extraction.

                    COBB
          Exactly. My job is to protect
          you...

Behind Fischer a WAITER puts down a tray- tipping a champagne
glass over- SMASH- Cobb NOTICES. Pauses, looks across the bar-
HIS TWO CHILDREN ARE CROUCHED, BACKS TOWARDS US...

Cobb looks around the bar, the patrons start to STARE at
Cobb, suspicious- Cobb shifts back to Fischer-
                                                          102.

                    COBB (CONT'D)
          My job is to protect you from any
          attempt to access your mind through
          your dreams.

Cobb regains his patter- the patrons lose interest...

INT. ELEVATOR - CONTINUOUS

Eames pulls out Fischer's wallet, moves to hand it to Saito,
then PAUSES, opens it, leafs past the cast to find... The
SNAPSHOT: young Robert holding his HOMEMADE PINWHEEL, his
father blowing on it. The elevator doors open and Eames steps
off. HANDS Saito the wallet.

                    EAMES
          Get off at a different floor and
          keep moving. Dump the wallet, then
          meet me in the lobby. The security
          will try to track it down. We need
          to buy Cobb a little more time.

The doors close. Saito puts the wallet in his pocket. He
COUGHS- a deep, nasty cough.

INT. HOTEL LOBBY BAR - CONTINUOUS

Cobb looks over Fischer's shoulder to see a SUITED MAN
watching him. Another MAN is walking in from the lobby.

                    COBB
          You're not safe here.

Cobb steps away from the bar. Fischer does not move.

                    COBB (CONT'D)
          Trust me. They're coming for you.

Fischer sizes him up, A CLAP OF THUNDER ECHOES, and we-

                                                  CUT TO:

INT./EXT. VAN ON RAINY DOWNTOWN STREETS - DAY

GUNSHOTS BLAST out the rear and side windows of the van- a
Security Man is leaning out of the lead S.U.V. With a SHOTGUN-

WIND AND RAIN RIP THROUGH THE VAN- in the back, ARTHUR'S
SLEEPING FACE IS WHIPPED BY THE SPRAY, AND WE-

                                                  CUT TO:

INT. HOTEL LOBBY BAR - SUNSET

Fischer looks out the windows at sudden, HURRICANE-LIKE RAIN-
                                                         103.

                    COBB
          Strange weather, huh?

A TREMOR runs through the bar- Cobb looks around-

                    COBB (CONT'D)
          You feel that?

INT. HOTEL LOBBY - CONTINUOUS

Ariadne and Arthur watch the GUSTS OF WIND RATTLE the
windows. Arthur sees HOTEL GUESTS staring out at the weather,
PUZZLED. Several of them TURN TO LOOK DIRECTLY AT ARTHUR.

                    ARIADNE
          What's happening?

                    ARTHUR
          Cobb's drawing Fischer's attention
          to the strangeness of the dream.
          That's making his subconscious look
          for the dreamer. For me.

And we-

                                                    CUT TO:

INT./EXT. VAN ON RAINY STREETS - DAY

At the end of the alley-   Yusuf THROWS the van into a HARD
RIGHT TURN- we move into   EXTREME SLOW MOTION... THE SLEEPERS
IN THE BACK ARE DRAWN TO   ONE SIDE OF THE VAN BY THE
CENTRIFUGAL FORCE... and   we-

                                                    CUT TO:

INT. HOTEL LOBBY BAR - CONTINUOUS

The liquid in Fischer's drink RISES UP AGAINST ONE SIDE OF
THE GLASS- Fischer notices, confused.

                     COBB
          Very odd-the weather, the
          gravity...

Fischer looks around the bar- it's as if THE ENTIRE ROOM IS
SET AT A 45-DEGREE ANGLE- glasses SLIDING off tables...

                    COBB (CONT'D)
          But I can explain all this. You've
          actually been trained for this.
              (Fischer nods)
          Think of the strangeness of the
          weather, the shifts in gravity.
          None of this is real...
                    (MORE)
                                                         104.
                    COBB (CONT'D)
              (beat)
          We're in a dream.

Fischer looks at the room around them. Back to Cobb. All
through the bar, patrons turn to look at Cobb IN UNISON.

                    COBB (CONT'D)
          The simplest test of what I'm
          saying is for you to try and
          remember anything about the way you
          arrived in this hotel... okay?

Fischer stares at Cobb, trying to process this. All around
them, people STARE at Cobb. Several get up as if to approach.

                    COBB (CONT'D)
          Breathe. Remember the training.
          Accept the fact that we're in a
          dream. That's why I'm here
          protecting you.

As Fischer considers this we-

                                                    CUT TO:

INT./EXT. VAN ON RAINY STREETS - DAY

Yusuf STRAIGHTENS UP the van, RACING down the street,
swerving through traffic and we-

                                                    CUT TO:

INT. HOTEL LOBBY BAR - EVENING

The building gradually EASES BACK INTO ALIGNMENT-

                    FISCHER
          So you... you're not real?

The bar patrons start to ignore Cobb again.

                    COBB
          No. I'm a projection of your
          subconscious. I was put in place to
          protect you in the event that
          extractors pulled you into a dream.
          I believe that's what has happened.

Fischer takes this in. Then looks at the Security Men
approaching across the crooked floor, he nods at Cobb-
                                                          105.

INT. HOTEL LOBBY - EVENING

Cobb escorts Fischer across the lobby. As he does so, he
walks past the two CHILDREN, backs to us- Cobb ignores them-
The two Sub-security fall in behind. Cobb hurries Fischer up
the stairs- then PUSHES him into-

INT. HOTEL LOBBY BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS

Fischer stumbles in- turns to Cobb, angry-

                    FISCHER
          Hey-

Cobb reaches into his jacket- the First Man BURSTS in- Cobb
KICKS him to the ground- DRAWS his gun as the SECOND MAN
comes through the door, moving towards Fischer-

BLAM! Cobb BLASTS the Second Man in the back- TURNS and
SHOOTS the First Man.

                    FISCHER (CONT'D)
          Jesus Christ! What are you doing?!

Cobb turns to Fischer, calm. Convincing.

                    COBB
          Look at the gun in his hand.

Fischer looks: the Second Man was holding a pistol. Cobb
opens the First Man's jacket to show Fischer his holster and
sidearm.

                    COBB (CONT'D)
          These men were sent to abduct you.

Cobb pulls out the gun and HANDS it to Fischer.

                    COBB (CONT'D)
          If I'm going to help you, I need
          you to be calm.

Fischer remembers something.

                    FISCHER
          If this is a dream, I have to kill
          myself and wake up-

Fischer raises the gun towards his head-

                    COBB
          I wouldn't do that-they've probably
          got you sedated. If you pull that
          trigger, you might not wake up, you
          might drop into a lower dream
          state.
                    (MORE)
                                                       106.
                    COBB (CONT'D)
          Mr. Fischer, you know all this, you
          just have to remember it...

Fischer lowers his gun.

INT. HOTEL CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS

Saito walks down the corridor, followed by a Security Man.
Saito DUCKS around the corner, moves to a GARBAGE CHUTE and
DROPS Fischer's WALLET into it. He SLIPS into the stairwell
as the Security Man comes abreast of the chute and pauses.

INT. HOTEL CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS

Arthur leads Ariadne to a particular room: 491.

INT. ROOM 491 - CONTINUOUS

Arthur leads Ariadne in. He opens the closet, opens the room
safe, pulls our FOUR BRICKS OF PLASTIC EXPLOSIVE.

                    ARTHUR
          So, if everything's correct, this
          room should be directly below 528.

INT. HOTEL LOBBY BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS

Cobb looks reassuringly at Fischer.

                    COBB
          What do you remember from before
          this dream?

                    FISCHER
              (thinking)
          Rain... gunfire... Uncle Peter.
              (looks up)
          Christ-we've been kidnapped.

                    COBB
          Where were they holding you?

                    FISCHER
          They had us... in the back of a
          van...

                    COBB
          Your body's bouncing around in the
          back of a van right now-that
          explains the gravity shifts.

                    FISCHER
          It was... to do with a safe...
          Christ, why's it so hard to
          remember?
                                                        107.

                    COBB
          It's like trying to remember a
          dream after you've woken up. It
          takes years of practice to do it
          easily. So, you and Browning have
          been pulled into this dream so they
          can steal something from your mind.
          What?

                    FISCHER
          They wanted a combination to a
          safe... they demanded the first
          numbers to pop into my head.

                    COBB
          That's them extracting a locator.

                       FISCHER
          A locator?

                    COBB
          A number from your own
          subconscious. It can be used any
          number of ways...
              (thinking)
          This is a hotel. Room numbers. What
          was the number you gave them?

                    FISCHER
          5, 2... something... it was a long
          number. 528... 528, 4 something.

                    COBB
              (opens phone)
          Well, we know where to start.
              (into phone)
          Fifth floor.

INT. ROOM 491 - CONTINUOUS

Arthur hangs up the phone. He is standing on a chair,
attaching the explosives to the ceiling.

                    ARIADNE
          Do you use a timer?

                    ARTHUR
          No, I have to judge it myself. Once
          you're all asleep up in room 528, I
          wait `til Yusuf starts his kick...

                    ARIADNE
          How will you know?
                                                        108.

                    ARTHUR
          His music warns me it's coming,
          then the van hitting the barrier of
          the bridge should be unmistakable-
          that's when I blow the floor out
          from underneath us and we get a
          nice synchronized kick. Too soon,
          and we won't get pulled out; too
          late and I won't be able to drop
          us.

                       ARIADNE
          Why not?

                    ARTHUR
          The van will be in free fall. I
          can't drop us with no gravity.

Arthur finishes setting the charges.

INT. HOTEL LOBBY - CONTINUOUS

Saito moves through the lobby. Browning is coming in the
other direction. Saito assumes him to be Eames.

                    SAITO
          I see you've changed.

                       BROWNING
          I'm sorry?

Eames comes up behind Browning, catching Saito's eye.

                    SAITO
          I'm... I mistook you for a friend.

                    BROWNING
          Good-looking fellow, I'm sure.

Browning moves off. Saito approaches Eames.

                    EAMES
          That's Fischer's projection of
          Browning. We'll keep an eye on how
          he behaves-

                       SAITO
          Why?

                    EAMES
          How he acts will tell us if
          Fischer's starting to suspect his
          motives the way we want him to.
                                                       109.

INT. HOTEL CORRIDOR, FIFTH FLOOR - MOMENTS LATER

Cobb leads Fischer around a corner. Arthur and Ariadne are
waiting in the corridor.

                    COBB
          They work for me.

Fischer starts looking at room numbers. Stops at 528. Cobb
draws his gun, steps back from the door and KICKS it open.

INT. ROOM 528 - CONTINUOUS

Cobb JUMPS into the room, gun up. The room is empty. Arthur
and Ariadne search the room. Saito and Eames arrive. Eames
shuts the door. Arthur FINDS something-

                    ARTHUR
          Mr. Charles!

Arthur holds up a MECHANISM CASE. Cobb shows it to Fischer.

                    COBB
          You know what this is?

Fischer's eyes roam over the dials and plungers.

                    FISCHER
          I think so. But I don't understand.

                    COBB
          They were going to put you under.

                    FISCHER
          I'm already under.

                    COBB
          Under again.

                    FISCHER
          A dream within a dream?

                    ARTHUR
          Shhhh!

Arthur is at the door. Someone is there. A key goes into the
lock- the door starts to open- Arthur REACHES OVER and GRABS
the person entering, THROWS THEM TO THE FLOOR- puts his gun
in their face. IT IS BROWNING.

Fischer stares, disbelieving, at his own godfather.

                    FISCHER
          Uncle Peter. What's going on?

Cobb pulls the key from Browning's hand: ROOM 528.
                                                        110.

                    COBB
          You said you were kidnapped
          together?

                    FISCHER
          Not exactly, they already had him.
          They'd been torturing him...

                    COBB
          You saw them torture him?

Fischer shakes his head. Looks at Browning. Thinking.

                    FISCHER
          The kidnappers are working for you.

                    BROWNING
          No, Robert-

                    FISCHER
          You're trying to get that safe
          open. To get the alternate will.

Browning looks up at Fischer.

                    BROWNING
          Fischer Morrow's been my entire
          life. I can't let you destroy it.

                    FISCHER
          I'm not going to throw away my
          inheritance. Why would I?

                    BROWNING
          I couldn't take the chance of you
          rising to your father's final
          taunt.

                    FISCHER
          What taunt?

                    BROWNING
          That will. I'm sorry, Robert, but
          it's his final insult. A challenge
          to build something for yourself.
          He's telling you that you aren't
          worthy of his achievements.

Fischer takes this in. Devastated.

                    FISCHER
          That he was "disappointed?"
                                                       111.

                    BROWNING
          I'm so sorry. But he was wrong.
          You'll make his company even
          greater than he ever could.

                    COBB
          Your godfather's lying, Robert.

Fischer turns to Cobb.

                    FISCHER
          How do you know?

                     COBB
          It's what I do. He's hiding
          something.

Cobb looks at Browning.

                    COBB
          Let's find out what.

Cobb nods at Arthur, who starts unpacking the mechanism.
Browning watches. Silent.

                    COBB
          Let's do to him what he was going
          to do to you.

Cobb rolls up his sleeve. Nods at Fischer to do the same.

                    COBB
          We'll penetrate his subconscious
          and find out what he doesn't want
          you to know.

Fischer looks Cobb in the eye. Decides- rolls up his sleeve,
offering his bare arm. The team run tubes to each other-
Arthur injects Fischer, whose head slumps.

                      ARTHUR
          He's out.

                    ARIADNE
          Wait, Cobb-I'm lost. Whose
          subconscious are we going into?

                    COBB
          Fischer's. I told him it was
          Browning's so he'd come with us as
          part of our team.

                    ARTHUR
              (impressed)
          He's going to help us break into
          his own subconscious.
                                                       112.

                    COBB
          That's the idea. He'll think that
          his security is Browning's and
          fight them to learn the truth about
          his father.

Arthur hits buttons on the mechanism. The team goes out one
by one. Cobb is last.

                    COBB
          Fischer's subconscious is going to
          run you down hard.

                    ARTHUR
          I'll lead them on a merry chase.

                    COBB
          Be back in time for the kick.

                       ARTHUR
          I'm on it.

Cobb is no longer listening- he stares at the net curtains,
BILLOWING like those in Mal's suite- a GLIMPSE of someone
(Mal?) As the screen goes WHITE, and we are-

EXT. SNOW-COVERED MOUNTAINS - DAY

CLOSE ON Cobb's face, staring. Fixed.

                    ARIADNE (O.S.)
          Cobb? Cobb?

Ariadne is beside him. They stand on a cliff, dressed in
white snowsuits, carrying white-painted weapons like WWII
commandos. Cobb checks his SNIPER RIFLE, examines their
objective: a massive FORTIFIED MEDICAL FACILITY a mile below.

                    ARIADNE
          What's down there?

                    COBB
          Hopefully, the truth we want
          Fischer to learn.

                    ARIADNE
          I meant what's down there for you?

Cobb turns to her. Eames, Saito and Fischer arrive, SKIING
down from the hill above. Cobb pulls Eames out of Fischer's
earshot.

                    COBB
          You're the dreamer. I need you to
          draw the security away from the
          complex.
                                                       113.

                    EAMES
          Then who guides Fischer in? You?

                    COBB
          If I know the route... we could be
          compromised.

Eames looks as Cobb, uneasy. Ariadne comes over.

                    ARIADNE
          I designed the place.

                    COBB
          No. You're with me.

                    SAITO (O.S.)
          I could do it.

They turn to Saito. Saito shrugs at Eames. Eames smiles.

                    COBB
          Eames, brief Saito on the route
          into the complex. What we're
          looking for is going to be in the
          most heavily fortified section.
          That north tower.

Cobb moves to Fischer. Saito COUGHS. SPITS. Eames sees BLOOD
on the snow. Looks at Saito.

                     COBB
          Mr. Fischer, you're going in with
          Mr. Saito.

                    FISCHER
          You're not coming in?

                    COBB
          You have to do this on your own.
          You have to get in there, break
          into your godfather's mind and find
          out the truth about your father.

Cobb taps Fischer's radio mike.

                    COBB
          Keep this live at all times. I'll
          be listening in, covering you.
              (holds up the sniper
               rifle)
          The windows on the upper floors are
          big enough that I can cover you
          from that south tower.
                                                       114.

Cobb slips into his skis, shoulders his rifle.

                                                  CUT TO:

INT. ROOM 528 - NIGHT

Arthur checks the mechanism. He hears LOW BOOMS like thunder.
He checks his watch- THE SECOND HAND CRAWLS FORWARDS. With a
last look at the sleepers, he heads out into the corridor...

INT./EXT. VAN ON RAINY DOWNTOWN STREETS - DAY

A GUNSHOT slams into the van as Yusuf DRIVES- he glances back
to see a MOTORCYCLE pulling up behind him, the REAR PASSENGER
FIRING A SHOTGUN- the bike pulls alongside Yusuf's window as
the passenger RELOADS- Yusuf YANKS the wheel TOWARDS the
bike, bringing the shotgun barrel into the cab so he can GRAB
it, spin the wheel back- PULLING the passenger from the back
of the bike... Yusuf turns a corner, heading into a disused
MARKET-

INT. HOTEL CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS

Arthur walks towards the elevator. It OPENS- a SECURITY MAN
emerges, heading right for him. Arthur takes a TURN, speeding
up. The BOOMS are louder, and we-

                                                  CUT TO:

INT./EXT. VAN ON RAINY DOWNTOWN STREETS - DAY

The bike crosses behind the van, catching up again as the
driver pulls a handgun and starts BLASTING. Up ahead, an
S.U.V. sits in a side road, lining up to head off the van-
the SECURITY MAN driving the S.U.V. guns it, as the bike
creeps up on the other side of the van- Yusuf HITS THE
BRAKES, forcing the bike out into the path of the S.U.V.,
tossing the rider like a rag doll-

Heading out of the market, the van races onto a FREEWAY ON
RAMP, approaching the BRIDGE. An S.U.V. SMASHES into the
van's side, FORCING it up against a CRASH BARRIER... the van
starts to SLOWLY TILT OVER THE BARRIER as the S.U.V. PUSHES-

                                                  CUT TO:

INT. HOTEL CORRIDOR - NIGHT

As Arthur hurries down the corridor, the corridor starts to
TILT, and Arthur is forced to run UP ONTO THE WALL- he rounds
a corner- STRAIGHT INTO another Security Man- Arthur HEAD
BUTTS him and they STRUGGLE- as they struggle, the corridor
SPINS around, THROWING THEM UP ONTO THE WALLS, THE CEILING-
as wall becomes floor they DROP through a door into-
                                                          115.

INT. HOTEL ROOM - CONTINUOUS

The fight continues all over the spinning room- and we-

INT./EXT. VAN ON RAINY OFF RAMP NEAR BRIDGE - DAY

SLEEPING ARTHUR BOUNCES around as the van TILTS, SCRAPING
along the barrier- the van CLEARS THE END OF THE BARRIER AND
ROLLS DOWN THE EMBANKMENT, and we-

                                                    CUT TO:

INT. HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

Arthur and the Security Man DROP to the floor, Arthur on top.
Arthur gets up- heads to the stairwell.

INT./EXT. VAN ON RAINY STREETS NEAR BRIDGE - DAY

The van SETTLES with a thump. Yusuf BREATHES hard. Then
SMILES as he realizes he is in one piece. A RINGING BELL up
ahead makes him look up to the bridge, where the barriers are
starting to come down. Yusuf checks his watch-

                    YUSUF
          Bugger.

Yusuf hits the gas, heading for the bridge. An S.U.V. lines
up behind him, trying to catch up before the van crosses the
barrier onto the bridge-

The van JUST MAKES IT- the S.U.V. behind RIPS its read axle
off, SCRAPING to a halt on the rising section. The Security
Man inside starts FIRING on the van...

INT. HOTEL STAIRWELL - CONTINUOUS

Arthur RACES down the steps- OPENS the door to the fourth
floor- spots SECURITY MEN outside room 491.

                    ARTHUR
          Hey!

They TURN- he DARTS back into the stairwell- RACES down the
stairs- the Security Men follow- they start SHOOTING, and we-

EXT. SNOW-COVERED MOUNTAINS - DAY

Eames SKIS down within sight of the hospital complex. He
reaches into his pack and lets off a FLARE.
                                                       116.

EXT. HOSPITAL COMPLEX - CONTINUOUS

Security Men on the ramparts spot the flare and send PATROLS
out on skis and SNOWMOBILES to investigate.

EXT. SNOW-COVERED MOUNTAINS - CONTINUOUS

Eames watches them close in, then launches himself down the
mountain, STREAKING across the icy slope, and we-

                                                   CUT TO:

INT./EXT. VAN ON RAINY RISING BRIDGE - DAY

Yusuf PULLS FORWARD, looking over his shoulder to line up a
BACKWARDS RUN at the edge. He DUCKS as vicious FIRE from the
S.U.V. HAMMERS the vehicle. He looks at his watch. The SECOND
HAND TICKING SLOWLY...

                    YUSUF
          Sod it. I hope your ready.

He grabs an MP3 player and reaches into the back to place
HEADPHONES on sleeping Arthur's head. As he does so, he
notices Saito's bandage BLEEDING THROUGH. Yusuf hits PLAY-
Edith Piaf's "Non, je ne regrette rien" starts up and we-

Arthur STOPS, hearing something- MASSIVE LOW-END MUSICAL
TONES- he looks up PANICKED-

                    ARTHUR
          No, Yusuf. Too soon!

SHOTS slam into the stairs around him and we-

EXT. SNOW-COVERED MOUNTAINS - DAY

Cobb and Ariadne make their way down towards the complex.

                    EAMES (OVER RADIO)
          Cobb? Are you hearing that?

Cobb listens. The wind sounds unusually LOW.

EXT. FOREST, SNOW-COVERED MOUNTAINS - CONTINUOUS

Eames is hidden at the base of some trees, whispering as a
patrol passes beneath his position.
                                                        117.

                    EAMES
          I noticed it twenty minutes ago-at
          first I thought it was just wind...

EXT. SNOW-COVERED MOUNTAINS - CONTINUOUS

Cobb is listening intently. The "wind" changes pitch.

                    COBB
          No, it's music. Dammit.

                    EAMES (OVER RADIO)
          What do we do?

                    COBB
          We move fast. Saito, did you copy?

EXT. MOUNTAINS, THE OTHER SIDE OF THE COMPLEX - CONTINUOUS

Saito and Fischer CLIMB down a CLIFF FACE above the complex-

                    SAITO
          We're going as fast as we can.

EXT. SNOW-COVERED MOUNTAINS - CONTINUOUS

Ariadne looks at Cobb, concerned.

                    ARIADNE
          How long do we have?

                    COBB
          Yusuf's about ten seconds from the
          jump, which gives Arthur about
          three minutes, which gives us about-

                    ARIADNE
          Sixty minutes.

                    COBB
          The route you gave them, can they
          do it in under an hour?

                    ARIADNE
          I don't think so. They've still got
          to climb down to the middle
          terrace.

                    COBB
          They need a new route-a direct
          route.

                     ARIADNE
          The building's designed as a
          labyrinth.
                                                       118.

                    COBB
          There must be access routes that
          cut through the maze.

          Eames?

EXT. FOREST, SNOW-COVERED MOUNTAINS - CONTINUOUS

Eames cannot answer- he SLALOMS through the forest, Sub-
security in hot pursuit, bullets smashing into the trunks...

EXT. SNOW-COVERED MOUNTAINS - CONTINUOUS

Cobb turns to Ariadne.

                    COBB
          Did Eames add any features?

                    ARIADNE
          Yes.

                    COBB
          What did he add?

Ariadne looks at Cobb.

                    ARIADNE
          I shouldn't tell you. If Mal-

                    COBB
          There's no time-what did he add?

                    ARIADNE
          Utility closets, trap doors...

                    COBB
          What about service features? Did he
          add any large pipes or-

                    ARIADNE
          Ducts. He added an air duct system-
          it doesn't follow the maze. They
          can use it to go straight from the
          outer walls to the upper tower.

                    COBB
          Explain it to them.

          Saito?

EXT. CLIFF FACE BEHIND COMPLEX - CONTINUOUS

Saito is using a hammer to tap in a belay.

          Go ahead.

INT./EXT. VAN ON RAINY RAISED BRIDGE - DAY

Yusuf looks at the Security Man in the S.U.V., gives him the
finger and hits the GAS- RACING BACKWARDS at the barrier...

                                                   CUT TO:

INT. HOTEL STAIRWAY - NIGHT

Arthur RUNS UP the stairs, gun in hand- rounds a corner and-
IMPOSSIBLY- arrives behind the Security Man, who looks at
him, CONFUSED, then looks down to realize he is now at the
edge of a dangerous drop- Arthur shrugs.

                      ARTHUR
          Paradox.

Arthur PUSHES him over the edge- he falls- Arthur races up to
the fourth floor- throws open the door- and we-

Arthur is SPRINTING down the corridor when a TREMENDOUS CRASH
sends him FLYING into the air- and we-

EXT. SNOW-COVERED MOUNTAINS - DAY

A MASSIVE RUMBLE prompts Cobb to look across the valley-

EXT. FOREST, SNOW-COVERED MOUNTAINS - CONTINUOUS

Eames shoots out of the trees, then FALLS to the snow as he
sees a great CRACKING up ahead- the SLOPE IS FALLING AWAY IN
AN AVALANCHE-
                                                       120.

EXT. CLIFF FACE BEHIND COMPLEX - CONTINUOUS

Saito hears the RUMBLE above them. He looks down, Fischer is
below, near the bottom of the sheer face-

                      SAITO
          Look out!

Saito CUTS the rope- they FALL- HIT the icy face and SLIDE
down the slope, clearing the path of the avalanche- and we-

Arthur is still FLYING through the corridor, NOT LANDING-
GRAVITY HAS DISAPPEARED... he scrambles for a handhold,
GRABBING a sconce- and we-

EXT. SNOW-COVERED MOUNTAINS - DAY

Cobb watches the avalanche cloud slide past the complex.

                    ARIADNE
          What was that?

                      COBB
          The kick.

                    EAMES (OVER RADIO)
          Cobb? Did we miss it?

                    COBB
          Yeah, we missed it.

EXT. FOREST, SNOW-COVERED MOUNTAINS - CONTINUOUS

Eames is lying on the snow.

                    EAMES
          What the hell do we do now?

                    COBB (OVER RADIO)
          Finish the job before the next
          kick.
                                                         121.

                    EAMES
          What next kick?

EXT. SNOW-COVERED MOUNTAINS - CONTINUOUS

Cobb looks at Ariadne as he talks into the radio.

                    COBB
          When the van hits the water. I
          figure Arthur's got a couple
          minutes and we've got about twenty.

Cobb and Ariadne MOVE towards the base of the complex.

EXT. HOSPITAL COMPLEX - CONTINUOUS

Saito and Fischer RUN around the base of the building. They
find a large EXHAUST PORT. Lay a charge on the GRILL. They
blow the charge. Climb into the open vent.

INT./EXT. VAN - DAY

In EXTREME SLOW MOTION, the van seems SUSPENDED IN MID-AIR
TEN STORIES ABOVE THE RIVER... and we-

INT. HOTEL CORRIDOR - NIGHT

In ZERO GRAVITY, Arthur pulls himself to the door of 491,
opens it. He looks at the charges planted on the ceiling.

                    ARTHUR
          How the hell do I drop you?

He PULLS the charges from the ceiling. Hurrying. And we-

                                                    CUT TO:

INT. DUCT SYSTEM, HOSPITAL COMPLEX - CONTINUOUS

Saito and Fischer hurry through the duct system. Saito is
falling behind, coughing up blood.

EXT. UPPER TERRACE, HOSPITAL COMPLEX - CONTINUOUS

Cobb GRABS a Security Guard from behind, strangling him
unconscious. He beckons to Ariadne, covering her as she runs
towards him. They enter the base of the south tower.

INT. TOP ROOM, SOUTH TOWER, HOSPITAL COMPLEX - CONTINUOUS

A guard is manning the tower. Cobb and Ariadne enter- Cobb
SHOOTS the guard and moves to the window.
                                                       122.

                    ARIADNE
              (she points)
          That's the antechamber outside the
          strongroom.

Cobb looks at the large windows of the antechamber.

                    COBB
          What about the strongroom? Doesn't
          it have any windows?

                    ARIADNE
          Wouldn't be very strong if it did.
              (off look)
          Look, if you wanted to design it
          yourself-

                    COBB
          It's fine. Better hope that we like
          what Fischer finds in there.

Cobb sets up his sniper rifle. Through the scope he can see
three guards on the balcony outside the chamber. Three more
inside. Cobb casually picks them off with his rifle. Ariadne
watches through binoculars, appalled.

                    ARIADNE
          These projections, they're part of
          his subconscious?

                    COBB
          Yeah.

                    ARIADNE
          Are you destroying those parts of
          his mind?

                    COBB
          No, of course not. They're just
          projections.

                    EAMES (OVER RADIO)
          Cobb? Something's wrong?

EXT. FOREST, SNOW-COVERED MOUNTAINS - CONTINUOUS

Eames is watching the patrols HEAD BACK towards the complex.

                    EAMES
          They're heading your way. Like they
          know something.

INT. TOP ROOM, SOUTH TOWER, HOSPITAL COMPLEX - CONTINUOUS

Cobb hears this. Concerned.
                                                         123.

          Buy us some time.

                       EAMES (OVER RADIO)
          On my way.

EXT. FOREST, SNOW-COVERED MOUNTAINS - CONTINUOUS

Eames TAKES OFF towards the base of the complex. And we=

INT. ROOM 528 - NIGHT

Arthur FLOATS into the room. The SLEEPERS are floating,
loosely connected by their tubes. Arthur looks at them, MIND
RACING. He PULLS Cobb towards Eames, and we-

                                                   CUT TO:

INT. DUCT SYSTEM, HOSPITAL COMPLEX - DAY

Saito and Fischer approach the grate covering the exit to the
anteroom. Saito SLUMPS to the floor of the duct, pulls out
his radio. Fischer looks at him- he is PALE, SHIVERING.
Fischer takes the radio, WHISPERS into it.

                    FISCHER
              (into radio)
          We're here. Are we clear to
          proceed?

INT. TOP ROOM, SOUTH TOWER, HOSPITAL COMPLEC - CONTINUOUS

Cobb SCANS the anteroom through the scope-it looks clear.

                    COBB
          You're clear, but hurry-there's an
          army headed your way...

Ariadne watches the patrols approaching the complex...

INT. DUCT SYSTEM, HOSPITAL COMPLEX - CONTINUOUS

The SQUELCH from the radio is too loud- Fischer GRABS it and
turns the volume to zero as he starts to remove the grate...

EXT. BASE OF THE HOPISTAL COMPLEX - CONTINUOUS

Eames is setting MINES along the LOWEST WALL of the
structure. He moves carefully-there is a SHEER DROP below the
wall...
                                                       124.

INT. TOP ROOM, SOUTH TOWER, HOSPITAL COMPLEX - CONTINUOUS

Cobb SPOTS something through his scope. Something above the
main windows, glimpsed through the side of the skylight.

                    COBB
          Shit. There's someone else in
          there.

Cobb prepares to fire. Ariadne GRABS the radio-

                    ARIADNE
          Fischer, stop! It's a trap!-

INT. DUCT SYSTEM, HOSPITAL COMPLEX - CONTINUOUS

Fischer does not see the flashing light on his radio as he
carefully lifts the grate. He motions for Saito to stay...

INT. TOP ROOM, SOUTH TOWER, HOSPITAL COMPLEX - CONTINUOUS

Cobb TENSES to fire.

                    COBB
          Come on... a little lower... a
          little-

COBB FREEZES- IT IS MAL IN HIS SIGHTS. Ariadne puts up her
binoculars. Spots Mal. Fischer is climbing out of the vent...

                    ARIADNE
          Cobb, that's not really her-

Cobb turns to her-

                    COBB
          How can you know that?

INT. ANTECHAMBER - CONTINUOUS

Fischer moves into the antechamber, cautious-

                       FISCHER
          I'm in.

Fischer turns up the volume-

                    ARIADNE (OVER RADIO)
          Fischer, look out!-

Mal DROPS gracefully to the floor behind him-

                       MAL
          Hello.
                                                       125.

INT. TOP ROOM, SOUTH TOWER, HOSPITAL COMPLEX - CONTINUOUS

Cobb looks at Ariadne-

                    ARIADNE
          Cobb, she's just a projection.
          Fischer... he's real.

Cobb thinks. Nods, TURNS back to the scope- too late- MAL
SHOOTS FISCHER- Cobb reflexively pulls the trigger- Mal GOES
DOWN- Cobb steps back from the scope, STUNNED.

                    ARIADNE
          Eames? Get to the anteroom now!

They run for the door.

INT. DUCT SYSTEM, HOSPITAL COMPLEX - CONTINUOUS

Saito STARTS as he hears the shot. He starts edging forwards,
clutching his belly. And we-

INT. ROOM 528 - NIGHT

The sleepers are floating in a rough stack, top-and-tailed.
Arthur pulls the bedding from the bed and uses the sheet to
bind the sleepers together. And we-

INT. HOTEL CORRIDOR - NIGHT

Arthur PUSHES the floating stack of sleepers to the elevator.
He hits the button- the doors open- he pushes them in- GRABS
the charges- climbs through the hatch in the ceiling and we-

INT. DUCT SYSTEM, HOSPITAL COMPLEX - DAY

Eames steps over Saito, who looks up at him with DYING eyes-

INT. ANTECHAMBER, HOSPITAL CORRIDOR - DAY

Eames jumps out of the vent to find Cobb and Ariadne standing
over the bodies of Fischer and Mal.
                                                       126.

                    EAMES
          What happened?

                    ARIADNE
          Mal killed Fischer-

                    COBB
          I wouldn't shoot her.

Eames grabs a defibrillator from the wall and pulls Fischer's
jacket open-

                    COBB
          It won't do any good-

Eames SHOCKS Fischer's chest...

                    COBB
          Even if you could revive his body,
          his mind's trapped down there. It's
          over.

Eames listens for a pulse. Looks up at Cobb.

                    EAMES
          So that it, then? We failed.

                       COBB
          I'm sorry.

                    EAMES
          It's you who doesn't get back to
          your family.

Eames looks down at Fischer. Then over to the double doors.

                    EAMES
          I wanted to know what was going to
          happen in there. I think we had
          this one.

                    ARIADNE
          There's still a way: We follow
          Fischer down-

They look at her.

                    EAMES
          We're almost out of time-

                    ARIADNE
          Down there they'll be enough time.
          We'll find him-soon as you hear
          Arthur's music start, you use the
          defibrillator to revive him-we give
          him his own early kick from below.

                    ARIADNE (CONT'D)
          Get him in there-
              (points to doors)
          Then, as the music ends you blow
          the hospital and we all ride the
          kick back up through the layers.

Eames looks at her, then to Cobb.

                    EAMES
          Okay, Saito can hold them off while
          I plant the rest of the charges.

                    COBB
          Saito's not going to last, Eames.

                    ARIADNE
          We have to try!

                    EAMES
          Go for it, but I'm taking the kick
          whether you're back or not...

Eames pulls the mechanism from his pack. Offers it to
Ariadne. Cobb watches. Silent. Ariadne pulls out the tubes-

                    ARIADNE
          Can I trust you to do what's
          needed? Mal's down there-

                    COBB
          And I can find her. She'll have
          Fischer.

                    ARIADNE
          How do you know?

                    COBB
          She wants me to come after him. She
          wants me back down there with her.

Cobb rolls up his sleeve. Ariadne rolls up her own sleeve.
Eames NODS. Cobb and Ariadne lie down. Eames hits the button-
WATER. BUBBLES. DROWNING. And we are-

EXT. COAST (LIMBO) - DAY

Ariadne lies in the SURF, STARING up at a CLOUDLESS SKY. A
tremendous BOOM prompts her to look around her- URBAN
BUILDINGS PILED right down to the water. The buildings are
DECAYING, falling into the ocean like a GLACIER calving. Cobb
WADES towards her through the shallow water. Ariadne looks up
at the crumbling city around them.

                    ARIADNE
          This is your world?
                                                         128.

                    COBB
          It was. And this is where she'll
          be.

And we-

INT. ELEVATOR SHAFT - DAY

Arthur floats on top of the elevator, planting small charges
on the EMERGENCY BRAKES and CABLE. He sets them, GRABS the
other explosives, then PUSHES AWAY, shooting up the shaft. As
he hits the DETONATOR, BLASTING the braking and safety

INT. ANTECHAMBER - DAY

Eames RACES around, full speed- getting the defibrillator
paddles- laying them by Fischer's body- he runs into the duct-
pulls Saito up to a seated position and hands him a handgun.

                    EAMES
          Come on, Saito. I need you to cover
          Fischer while I plant the charges.

Saito nods weakly, tries to hold the gun. Eames moves to the
window- pulls his machine gun off- checks its load. Ready. He
watches the security patrols climb up the outer walls...
Eames lays down a HAIL of covering fire- then heads outside-

EXT. HOSPITAL COMPLEX - CONTINUOUS

Eames races along the upper terrace dodging fire- BULLETS
SHATTER a window behind him and we move into SLOW MOTION, the

EXT. COAST (LIMBO)- DAY

Cobb and Ariadne climb out of the waves, full speed. They
move into the shadow of the tall, crumbling buildings. The
streets are eerily DESERTED. As they move further in, the
buildings become NEWER, different. Ariadne marvels at the
extraordinary collection of buildings- every architectural
style imaginable in waves of FAILED UTOPIAS.

                    ARIADNE
          You built all this?

                    COBB
          We both did.
                                                       129.

                    ARIADNE
          It's incredible.

                    COBB
          We built for years. Then, when that
          got stale, we started in on the
          memories.

A child's SHOUT echoes through the deserted canyons,
prompting Cobb to look down a side street: a LITTLE BLONDE
BOY crouched, his back to us. A LITTLE BLONDE GIRL joins the
boy, and, as Cobb turns down the street, they run off.

Cobb and Ariadne emerge into a peculiar SQUARE lined with an
eclectic mix of buildings, from APARTMENT BLOCKS to HOUSES.

                    COBB
          This is our neighborhood.

                    ARIADNE
              (confused)
          From what city?

                    COBB
          No. Our neighborhood.
              (pointing)
          That was our first apartment...
          then we moved to that building...
          we got that small house when Mal
          became pregnant.

                    ARIADNE
          You reconstructed them all from
          memory?

                    COBB
          We had time.

Cobb pauses in front of a French country house. Staring.

                    ARIADNE
          What's that?

                    COBB
          The house Mal grew up in.

                    ARIADNE
          Will she be in there?

                    COBB
          No. Come on-

Cobb leads Ariadne to the entrance of a glass skyscraper.
                                                        130.

INT. SKYSCRAPER LOBBY (LIMBO) - CONTINUOUS

Cobb leads Ariadne across the gleaming lobby to the
elevators.

                    COBB
          We both wanted a house, but we both
          loved skyscrapers. In the real
          world we had to choose. Not here.

INT. SKYSCRAPER ELEVATOR (LIMBO) - CONTINUOUS

Cobb pulls out his handgun, and a ziplock bag full of
bullets.

                    ARIADNE
          How do we send Fischer back?

                    COBB
          We need some kind of kick.

                    ARIADNE
          What?

                    COBB
          I'll improvise.

Cobb COCKS his weapon, and the ELEVATOR STOPS. The doors
open. Ariadne moves to exit, Cobb stops her.

                     COBB
          There's something you have to
          understand about me. About
          inception. You see, an idea is like
          a virus...

Cobb leads her out of the lift...

INT. PENTHOUSE (LIMBO) - CONTINUOUS

Cobb and Ariadne step off the lift and into the incongruous
interior of a craftsman house. They cautiously move down the
corridor towards the back of the house...

                    COBB
          Resilient...
              (turns to Ariadne)
          Highly contagious, and an idea can
          grow. The smallest seed of an idea
          can grow to define or destroy your
          world...

Cobb is staring into the kitchen. Mal is sitting at the
table, back to them, staring out at the porch- the TOWERS of
Limbo stretching off behind it.
                                                        131.

                    MAL
          The smallest idea, such as... "Your
          world is not real."

Cobb hands Ariadne his gun and moves towards Mal.

                    MAL
          A simple little thought that
          changes everything...

Ariadne watches as Cobb sits down beside Mal. And we-

Arthur FLIES back down the shaft to the top of the elevator,

INT. PENTHOUSE (LIMBO) - DAY

Cobb touches Mal's arm- she TURNS, angry. It is only now that
we see that she holds a CARVING KNIFE. Mal looks at Ariadne.

                     MAL
          So certain of your world. Of what's
          real. Do you think he is-
               (points at Cobb)
          Or do you think he's as lost as I
          was?

                    COBB
          I know what's real.

                    MAL
          What are the distinguishing
          characteristics of a dream? Mutable
          laws of physics? Tell that to the
          quantum physicists. Reappearance of
          the dead? What about heaven and
          hell? Persecution of the dreamer,
          the creator, the messiah? They
          crucified Christ, didn't they?

                    COBB
          I know what's real.

                    MAL
          No creeping doubts? Not feeling
          persecuted, Dom? Chased around the
          globe by anonymous corporations and
          police forces? The way the
          projections persecute the dreamer?
                                                       132.

Mal puts her hand on his face. Pitying.

                    MAL
          Admit it, Dom. You don't believe in
          one reality anymore. So choose.
          Choose your reality like I did.
          Choose to be here. Choose me.

                    COBB
              (rising anger)
          I have chosen, Mal. Our children. I
          have to get back to them. Because
          you left them. You left us.

                    MAL
          You're wrong, Dom. You're confused...
          our children are here-

A child's SHOUT draws Cobb- James CROUCHES on the porch, back
to us. Philippa joins him, also turned away. Cobb watches,
moved. Mal leans in close.

                    MAL
              (whispers)
          And you'd like to see their faces
          again, wouldn't you, Dom?

                    COBB
          Our real children are waiting for
          me up above.

And we-

INT. ELEVATOR - NIGHT

Arthur scrambles to arrange the sleepers on the floor of the
car- as his hand comes away from Saito, he sees BLOOD on it.
He looks at Saito's belly- the blood is coming through his
shirt. Arthur sticks headphones on sleeping Eames, and we-

Eames throws a GRENADE, blowing up the security forces trying
to ascend the terraces. He DUCKS to the ground to avoid HEAVY

Mal laughs at Cobb.

                    MAL
              (laughs)
          Up above? Listen to yourself. You
          judged me for believing the very
          same thing.

Mal points at the children-

                    MAL
          These are our children. Watch.
              (turns to the kids)
          Hey, James! Philippa?!

The children START TO TURN to us- BUT COBB CLOSES HIS EYES.

                    COBB
          They're not real, Mal. Our real
          children are waiting for us-

The children run off. Cobb opens his eyes.

                    MAL
          You keep telling yourself that but
          you don't believe it-

                       COBB
          I know it-

                    MAL
          And what if you're wrong? What if
          I'm what's real?

Cobb is silent.

                    MAL
          You keep telling yourself what you
          know... but what do you believe?
          What do you feel?

Cobb looks at Mal. Struggling.

                    COBB
          Guilt. I feel guilt. And however
          confused I might get.

                                                       134.
                    COBB (CONT'D)
          However lost I might seem... it's
          always there. Telling me something.
          Reminding me of the truth.

                    MAL
          What truth?

                    COBB
          That you were wrong to doubt our
          world. That the idea that drove you
          to question your reality was a
          lie...

                    MAL
          How could you know it was a lie?

                    COBB
          Because it was my lie.

                    MAL
              (realizing)
          Because you planted the idea in my
          mind.

                     COBB
          Because I performed inception on my
          own wife, then reaped the bitter
          rewards...

                    ARIADNE
          Why?

                    COBB
          We'd become lost in here. Living in
          a world of infinite possibilities.
          A world where we were gods. I
          realized we needed to escape, but
          she'd locked away her knowledge of
          the unreality of this world...

INSERT CUT: Mal opens the doll's house. Takes the spinning
top, lies it down in the safe. LOCKS IT AWAY.

                    COBB
          I couldn't make Mal understand that
          we needed to break free. To die. So
          I started to search our world...

Cobb turns to Mal, but keeps talking to Ariadne...

INSERT CUT: Cobb WANDERS the streets of Limbo...

INSERT CUT: Cobb stops outside the VICTORIAN HOUSE, MAL'S
CHILDHOOD HOME, looking up at it. He heads inside...

                    COBB
          And when I found that place, that
          secret place where she had shut
          away her knowledge years before, I
          broke it open...

INSERT CUT: Cobb looks around Mal's childhood bedroom. Comes
to the doll's house...

                    COBB
          I broke into the deepest recess of
          her mind, to give her the simplest
          little idea.

INSERT CUT: Cobb throws open the safe doors. Sitting on the
shelf of the safe is a spinning top. On its side.

                    COBB
          A truth that she had once known,
          but had chosen to forget...

INSERT CUT: Cobb picks up the totem. He SPINS it in the safe.
IT SPINS AND SPINS WITHOUT END. Cobb CLOSES THE DOOR of the
safe...

          That her world was not real.

INSERT CUT: COBB AND MAL ARRIVE AT TRAIN TRACKS CUTTING
THROUGH WASTELAND.

                    COBB (V.O.)
          That death was a necessary escape.

They lie on the tracks looking into each other's eyes. Mal is
crying. Cobb takes her hand, reassuring. He starts to speak-

                    COBB
          You're waiting for a train. A train
          that will take you far away. You
          know where you hope this train will
          take you, but you can't know for
          sure. Yet it doesn't matter...

Mal looks at him across the railroad tracks. Replies-

                    MAL
          Because you'll be together.

The train comes, OBLITERATING the lovers.
Back in the present- Cobb looks into Mal's eyes. She is
crying.
                                                       136.

                    COBB
          I never thought that the idea I'd
          planted would grow in her mind like
          a cancer. That even after we woke...

INSERT CUT: Cobb looks around the HOTEL SUITE, confused. He
moves to the CURTAINS... Mal is on the ledge opposite.
                    COBB
          You'd continue to believe that your
          world was not real...

Crying, Mal nods-

                    MAL
          That death was the only escape?

INSERT CUT: Mal PLUNGES to her death.

                    MAL
          You killed me.

Cobb looks at Mal. Whispers-

                    COBB
          I was trying to save you-I'm sorry.

Mal comes in close to Cobb. Looks him over.

                    MAL
          You infected my mind. You betrayed
          me. But you can make amends. You
          can still keep your promise. We can
          still be together... right here. In
          our world. The world we built
          together.

Ariadne looks up as a LARGE BOLT OF LIGHTNING RIPS across the

below the rail.

                    ARIADNE
          He's here. And it's time. But you
          have to come with us.

Another massive lightning strike flickers across the sky-

                    ARIADNE
          Cobb, I'm not going to let you lose
          yourself in here! You have to get
          back to your children!

          Send Fischer, I have to stay-

                    ARIADNE
          You can't stay here to be with her-

Cobb turns from Mal. Looks at Ariadne.

                    COBB
          I'm not. Saito is dead by now. That
          means he's here. I have to stay
          here and find him.

Ariadne removes Fischer's gag- pulls him up, onto the rail.
Cobb looks back at Mal.

          I can't stay here to be with her
          because she's not real.

Mal looks at Cobb, furious.

                    MAL
          Not real? I'm the only thing you do
          believe in anymore. Here-doesn't
          this feel real, Dom?

She STABS him in the chest- Cobb WHEEZES- GASPING, looking at
Mal-
                                                          139.

                    COBB
          I wish you were. But I couldn't
          make you real. I'm not capable of
          imagining you in all your
          complexity and... perfection. As
          you really were. You're the best I
          can do. And you're not real.

Mal pulls the knife and moves to STRIKE again-

                    ARIADNE
          No!

A SHOT rings out, Mal GRABS her shoulder- Cobb turns to
Ariadne, who is pointing Cobb's gun.

                    COBB
          What're you doing?

                    ARIADNE
          Improvising.

She KICKS Fischer off the roof- AIMS again at Mal-

Fischer DROPS as the sky LIGHTS UP WITH ELECTRICITY- Fischer
SCREAMS, then GASPS, no longer falling, and we are-

INT. ANTECHAMBER - DAY

Eames pulls the defibrillator from Fischer's chest as he
COUGHS AWAKE.

                    EAMES
          Get in there-quick!

Fischer looks up at the double doors. STAGGERS to his feet.
Fischer pushes open the doors to the STRONGROOM.

INT. STRONGROOM - CONTINUOUS

Fischer walks into the silent white room. At one end of the
room is a bed. A figure lies in the bed. His FATHER.
Breathing with tremendous difficulty. Dying. And we-

                                                     CUT TO:

EXT. PENTHOUSE (LIMBO) - DAY

Ariadne takes aim at Mal-

                    COBB
          No!

Cobb holds Ariadne's gaze. She lowers the gun. And we-

                                                     CUT TO:
                                                        140.

Eames GRABS the detonator- then moves to the door of the
strongroom...

                                                  CUT TO:

INT. ELEVATOR, HOTEL - NIGHT

Arthur HITS THE DETONATOR-

INT. ELEVATOR SHAFT - CONTINUOUS

The CHARGES on the bottom of the elevator EXPLODE, and we
move into EXTREME SLOW MOTION as the flames BALLOON-

                                                  CUT TO:

INT. STRONGROOM - CONTINUOUS

A RUMBLE BUILDS as Fischer approaches the bed, overcome with
emotion. His Father sees him. Starts trying to speak. Fischer
leans in...

                    FATHER
              (hoarse whisper)
          I... was ... dis ... dis ...

                    FISCHER
          I know, Dad. You were disappointed
          that I couldn't be you.

The dying man SHAKES HIS HEAD with surprising energy.

                    FATHER
              (whisper)
          I was disappointed... that you
          tried.

Fischer hears this. And we-

                                                  CUT TO:

INT. ELEVATOR SHAFT - NIGHT

The elevator car is ROCKETED along its track by the explosion-

INT. ELEVATOR - CONTINUOUS

Arthur is SMASHED against the floor of the car next to the
sleepers who SHUDDER with the force of ACCELERATION- and we-

                                                  CUT TO:

INT. ANTECHAMBER - DAY

Eames WATCHES Fischer-
                                                       141.

                    EAMES
              (to himself) )
          Come on, come on...

INT. STRONGROOM - DAY

The Father collapses back onto the pillow. Fischer starts to
weep. His Father reaches out a trembling hand but when
Fischer tries to hold IT, he SHAKES his son's hand away...

He is reaching for the SAFE next to his bed. His fingers
fumble at the keypad, he can't open it. His son pushes
5,2,8,4,9,1 into the keypad. Opens it. Inside the safe is the
WILL. And beside it is a HOMEMADE PINWHEEL, clearly made by a
child. By Fischer. He takes it out, MARVELING at it. He turns
to his father, but his father is dead.

Eames, watching from the door, HITS THE DETONATOR-

EXT. HOSPITAL COMPLEX - CONTINUOUS

A line of EXPLOSIONS RIPS ALONG THE LOWER WALL... the ENTIRE
BUILDING STARTS TO SLIDE DOWN THE MOUNTAIN-

EXT. PENTHOUSE (LIMBO) - DAY

A FIERCE WIND starts HOWLING through the house as the sky
outside DARKENS. Cobb shields Mal against the blast- looks up
at Ariadne, who HOLDS the railing, FIGHTING the wind-

                    COBB
          That's the kick-you have to go!

                    ARIADNE
          You're coming!

                    COBB
          No, I'm not. I'm staying here to
          find Saito.
              (turns to Mal)
          And to say goodbye.

Ariadne loosens her grip on the railing...

                    ARIADNE
          Don't lose yourself. Find Saito.
          And bring him back.

                    COBB
          I will.

Ariadne lets the wind pull her off the edge- FALLING- and we-

INT. ANTECHAMBER - CONTINUOUS

Ariadne DROPS as the FLOOR COLLAPSES- her eyes SNAP OPEN-
                                                          142.

EXT. PENTHOUSE (LIMBO) - DAY

Cobb holds Mal in his arms. The wind DIES...

                    MAL
          We'd be together forever. You
          promised me.

                    COBB
          I know. But we can't. And I'm
          sorry.

                    MAL
          You remember when you asked me to
          marry you? You said you dreamt that
          we'd grow old together.

                    COBB
          And we did...

Mal looks at Cobb... thinking. Remembering.

INSERT CUT: TWO ELDERLY PEOPLE (MAL AND COBB) WALK THROUGH
LIMBO... ACROSS A WASTELAND... TWO ELDERLY HANDS CLUTCH EACH
OTHER AS THEY LIE DOWN ON THE RAILROAD TRACK...

                    COBB
          I miss you more than I can bear...
          but we had our time together. And
          now I have to let go...

She nods, weakly. Cobb holds Mal as her eyes close...
DYING... and we-

INT. STRONGROOM - CONTINUOUS

Fischer and his Father's body DROP AWAY-

INT. ELEVATOR - NIGHT

Ariadne DROPS inside the ROCKETING ELEVATOR, and as it
SMASHES INTO THE TOP OF THE SHAFT Ariadne SMASHES into-

INT./EXT. VAN INTO RIVER - DAY

THE WATER, THE VAN CRUNCHING WITH THE IMPACT- WATER CRASHING
THROUGH THE BROKEN WINDOWS FLOODING THE INTERIOR...

Fischer's EYES OPEN, PANICKING- he UNBUCKLES HIMSELF, pushes
out of the broken window- STOPS, goes back to UNBUCKLE
Browning and DRAG him out.
                                                       143.

EXT. RIVER - CONTINUOUS

Fischer breaks the surface with Browning, who COUGHS and
GASPS. He starts PULLING for the near bank, struggling
through the rain-impacted water-

INT. VAN, UNDERWATER - CONTINUOUS

Ariadne, Arthur and Yusuf wait calmly underwater. They are
sharing TWO REGULATORS pulled from beneath the front seat.
Arthur turns to Saito. There is blood in the water around
Saito's belly- his eyes are LIFELESS- Arthur feels for a
pulse... turns to Cobb, whose eyes are lifeless... Ariadne
GRABS Arthur's elbow, pulling him away...

EXT. RIVERBANK - MOMENTS LATER

Fischer turns Browning/Eames over. They lie there, exhausted.

                    BROWNING
          I'm sorry, Robert.

Fischer stares at the rain on the water.

                    FISCHER
          The will means that Dad wanted me
          to be my own man, not live for him.
              (turns to Browning) )
          And I'm going to, Uncle Peter.

Browning nods. Wipes the rain from his face. In the puddle
beside them, the reflection is not Browning, but Eames.

EXT. UNDERNEATH BRIDGE IN THE RAIN - MOMENTS LATER

Arthur sits on the riverbank, breathing heavily.

                    ARTHUR
          What happened?

                    ARIADNE
          Cobb stayed.

                      ARTHUR
          With Mal?

                    ARIADNE
          No. To find Saito.

Arthur looks out at the water below the bridge.

                    ARTHUR
          He'll be lost...

                    ARIADNE
          No. He'll be alright.
                                                       144.

And we-

                                                  CUT TO:

EXT. DAWN. CRASHING SURF.

The waves TOSS a BEARDED MAN onto wet sand.

As the Japanese Security Guard turns him onto his back, we
realize that this is Cobb- OLDER. WEARY. TRAVELLED...

INT. DINING ROOM, CASTLE - DAY

Cobb WOLFS his food. The Elderly Japanese Man (Saito, 90
years old) watches him.

                    SAITO
          So... have you come to kill me?

Cobb does not look up.

                    SAITO
          I've been waiting for someone to
          come for me...

                    COBB
          Someone from your half-remembered
          dream...?

Saito peers at Cobb.

                    SAITO
          Cobb? Not possible-he and I were
          young men together. And I am an old
          man...

                    COBB
          Filled with regret?

Saito REMEMBERS, nods...

                    SAITO
          Waiting to die alone, yes.

Cobb is STARING at something on the table.

                    COBB
          I came back for you... I came to
          remind you of what you once knew...

Cobb gestures at the table. Saito follows his gaze down to
the polished surface of the table...

                    COBB
          That this world is not real.
                                                       145.

The top IS STILL SPINNING PERFECTLY, AS IF IT WILL NEVER
TOPPLE. Saito looks at the top. Then back to Cobb.

                    SAITO
          You came to convince me to honor
          our arrangement?

                    COBB
          Yes. And to take a leap of faith.

As Saito-san listens to Cobb, he looks at the GUN on the
table between them...

                    COBB
          Come back and we'll be young men
          together again.

The elderly Saito looks at Cobb. Nods. And we-

                                                  CUT TO:

INT. FIRST CLASS CABIN, 747 - DAY

Ariadne watches Cobb. His eyes are closed.

                    FLIGHT ATTENDANT (O.S.)
          Hot towel, sir?

His EYES FLICKER OPEN. He takes the towel with a nod. Ariadne
smiles. Relieved.

                    FLIGHT ATTENDANT
          We'll be landing in Los Angeles in
          about twenty minutes. Do you need
          immigration forms?

Cobb nods. Takes a landing card. Looks around the cabin.

Saito is WATCHING him. Serious. Haunted. Holding Cobb's gaze,
SAITO PICKS UP THE PHONE AND DIALS. Cobb nods thanks...

INT. ARRIVALS, LAX - LATER

Cobb steps forwards to the IMMIGRATION OFFICIAL. Hands him
his passport. Nervous. The Official takes a beat, looks Cobb
up and down, then WHUMP!- the passport is stamped. As Cobb
takes it back, he spots Ariadne at the next counter. She nods
at him. He nods back. Then moves off...

As Cobb passes through baggage claim, he exchanges subtle
greetings with Eames and Yusuf.

Arthur smiles broadly at Cobb. Cobb brushes past Fischer, who
glances back at him as if thinking maybe he should know him,
then moves on...
                                                          146.

As Cobb emerges into the crowded arrivals hall, he spots
Professor Miles, waving at him...

INT. KITCHEN, COBB AND MAL'S HOUSE - DAY

Cobb enters with Miles. Drops his bags. Moves to the table,
looking out at the overgrown garden. He reaches into his
pocket, takes out his pewter spinning top, lowers it to the
table and SPINS IT- a CHILD'S SHOUT makes him look up-

Through the window, James and Philippa have run into view,
playing, THEIR FACES TURNED AWAY... Cobb STARES at the back
of his children's heads... Miles moves to the window and
KNOCKS on the glass-

James and Philippa TURN- see their Dad. He steps to the
window, watching their BRIGHT FACES SHINING as they run
towards him...

Behind him, on the table, the spinning top is STILL SPINNING.
And we-

FADE OUT.

                           MENNO MEYJES






	FADE IN:

	EXT. DESERT OF THE AMERICAN SOUTHWEST - DAY

	A mountain peak dominates the landscape.


	TITLES BEGIN.

	Riders on horseback cross the desert. From this distance they appear to be a
	company of Army Cavalry Soldiers.

	CLOSER ANGLES ON THE RIDERS

	reveal only details of saddles, hooves and uniforms. The riders are silhouetted
	against the rising sun as they ride into an ancient CLIFF PUEBLO.

	The OFFICER IN COMMAND raises his hand halting his troops.

			OFFICER
		Dis-mount!

	RIDERS climb down from their mounts... and only now do we realize that
	this is a TROOP OF BOY SCOUTS, all of them about thirteen years of age. The
	"Commanding Officer" is only their SCOUTMASTER, Mr. Havelock.

	One of the Scouts, a pudgy kid named HERMAN, steps away from his horse,
	bends over and pukes. The other Scouts rag on him.

               			FIRST SCOUT
		Herman's horsesick!

	A BLOND SCOUT, however, befriends Herman. He has a thatch of straw-colored
	hair and the no-nonsense expression common to kids whose curiosity and appetite
	for knowledge exceed what they teach in school. Additionally, he has adorned his
	uniform with an authentic HOPI INDIAN WOVEN BELT.

               			SCOUTMASTER
		Chaps, don't anybody wander off.
		Some of the passageways in here
		can run for miles.

	Two Boy Scouts climb up the rocky base of the cliff.


	INT. THE PASSAGEWAY - DAY

	The two boys head down the passageway. It's dark, and the temperature drops
	several degrees. Spiders have built huge webs that get caught in the boys' hair.

	HERMAN appears very uncertain as to the wisdom of this enterprise, but he's
	drawn on by his companion's adventurous curiosity.


CONTINUED:

               			HERMAN
		I don't think this is such a good
		idea.

	LAUGHTER is HEARD; the Blond Scout pulls Herman forward toward its source.

	The VOICES GROW LOUDER now as the boys get closer to their source. The light
	of kerosene lanterns dances on the tunnel walls ahead. The boys approach
	cautiously, careful to stay hidden.

			HERMAN
		What is it?

	This is what they see:


	FOUR MEN digging with shovels and pick-axes. They have broken into one of the
	pueblo's SECRET CHAMBERS... called "Kivas."

	The men are ROUGH RIDER (his name describes his dress), ROSCOE (a Bowery
	Boy bully of 14) and HALFBREED (with straight black hair that cascades over his
	shoulders).

	And the fourth man wears a LEATHER WAIST JACKET and BROWN FELT
	FEDORA HAT. He has his back turned to us, but we would be willing to bet
	anything that this is INDLANA JONES.

	However, when the man turns, and his face is illuminated by the lantern's glow,
	we are shocked to discover that it is someone else.

	We'll call him FEDORA.

TITLES END.

	The TWO BOYS are mesmerized by what they see.

	Now we realize that the Blond Scout is actually young INDIANA JONES.

                  		               FEDORA
	                 	Alfred, did you get anything yet?
			
			MAN
           	     	Nothing. Dig in.

	Two of the men stand and look at ROSCOE who steps forward holding a box in his
	hands.

                  			ROSCOE
		Hey, I've got something!

	Whoops from the other men.

		                ROSCOE
		I got something, Garth!

CONTINUED: (2)

	ROSCOE rushes forward and gives FEDORA the box. Fedora steps toward a
	lantern resting on a rock.

               			ROSCOE
		I got something... I got something
		right here.

	More whoops from the other men.

	FEDORA puts the box on the rock next to the lantern. HALFBREED pushes
	ROSCOE as he jumps with excitement. ROUGH RIDER steps forward to look at the
	box as Fedora opens it.

			ROSCOE
        		      (more whoops; then)
		Oh, look at thatl
        		      (more whoops)
		We're richl We're rich!

               			HALFBREED
		Shut up. Shut up.

	FEDORA takes a BEJEWELED CROSS from the box and holds it aloft. Fedora's
	comrades practically salivate at the sight of it.

               			ROSCOE (O.S.)
		Well, we're rich, ain't we?l

	INDY takes off his hat and looks down at the o.s. action.

               			HERMAN
		Indy? Indy? What are they doing?
		Indiana? Indiana?

               			INDY
		Shhhl

	FEDORA blows dust from the Cross, turning it in his hand, silently appraising its
	beauty... and its value. He seems aloof from the others; somehow superior to
	them.

               			HALFBREED
		Hey, we got to find more stuff
		to bring back.

	INDY stays hidden, but is astounded by what he sees.

			INDY
        		      (hushed; urgent)
		It's the Cross of Coronadol
		Cortes gave it to him in 15201


CONTINUED: (3)

	FEDORA continues to admire the Cross, then places it on the rock next to its box
	and the lantern.

	INDY turns back to observe the men.

               			INDY
		That Cross is an important artifact.
		It belongs in a museum.

	A look of resolve comes into INDY's expression, and he turns back toward
	HERMAN.

               			INDY
		Run back and find the others.
		Tell Mister Havelock that there
		are men looting in the caves.

	HERMAN doesn't seem to be listening. Instead, he watches in wide-eyed horror
	as a SNAKE SLITHERS ACROSS HIS LAP.

               			INDY
		Have him bring the sheriff.

	INDY matter-of-factly picks up the snake and tosses it aside. HERMAN gasps.

               			INDY
		It's only a snake.

	INDY grabs HERMAN's scout scarf and pulls him closer.

               			INDY
		Did you hear what I said?

               			HERMAN
		Right. Run back. Mister Havelock.
		The Sheriff. What, what are you
		gonna do?

               			INDY
		I don't know... I'll think of
		something.

	INDY releases the scarf, gives HERMAN a pat and Herman dashes off. Indy sees
	the Cross on the rock next to the lantern. As the Robbers continue to search for
	additional valuables, Indy is able to work his way unseen to within arm's reach of
	the Cross...

	FEDORA looks over at the men digging in a hole b.g.

               			FEDORA
		Dig with your hands.

	INDY picks up the Cross.


CONTINUED: (4)

               			FEDORA (O . S . )
		Not with your mouth.

	As FEDORA stands watching the other men digging, INDY puts the Cross in his
	pants and begins to pull himself up a rope hanging nearby. As he climbs, Indy's
	feet break a wooden beam, attracting the men's attention.

               			ROSCOE
		He's got our thing!

			 HALFBREED
		Get 'im!

                                  

	The three Robbers are so eager to get their hands on INDY, they almost knock
	each other over in the attempt.

	Only FEDORA is unperturbed. He casts a disgusted glance in
	the direction of his fleeing companionsthen sets off
	after INDY.


         
	EXT. THE  CLIFFS - DAY

	INDY EMERGES from the darkness of the Pueblo into the brightness of day.

	He pausessquintsshields his eyeslooks in all directions.

               			INDY
		Mister Havelock! Anybody
		Everybody's lost but me!

	He hears RUNNING FOOTSTEPS BEHIND HIM and dashes off. ROUGH RIDER,
	HALFBREED, and ROSCOE are quick to appear and run after him.

			FEDORA
		  There he isl                   

       			MEN
		      (AD-LIBS)
		Let's go! Let's get him! Let's
		go!

	Indy jumps from one rock to another; the SCOUT TROOP HORSES are below. Indy
	puts two fingers in his mouth and WHISTLES for his horse, who trots over. Indy
	puts the Cross in his belt.

	INDY PREPARES TO JUMP into the saddle. Hesitates. Then... he JUMPS. But
	the horse moves exactly at the wrong moment and Indy lands flat on his feet in a
	standing position. The impact sends a shock wave up his body that rattles his
	back teeth. Indy stands up and successfully mounts his horse.

	FEDORA AND HIS MEN ARRIVE at the roof's edge in time to see INDY climb into
	the saddle and gallop off.


CONTINUED:

 			INDY
		Hyahl Hyah!

                     

                                    		ROSCOE
		Hey! Come back here!

	FEDORA puts two fingers in his mouth and WHISTLES... and A VINTAGE TRUCK
	AND AUTOMOBILE come ROARING OUT from behind the Pueblo (Driven by two
	more gang members). Now we glimpse...


	THE MAN IN THE PANAMA HAT

	The passenger in the car. His face is concealed by the hat's wide brim. His arm
	is out the window, however, and we see an olive-colored hand protruding from
	the sleeve of an expensive white linen suit. He gestures to the Robbers, now in
	the truck.

                                  		PANAMA HAT
		Come on. Get him!

	INDY SPURS his mount on to greater speeds but the autos not only keep pace
	with his horse... they begin to squeeze in on it.

	Speeding Autos. Thundering hooves. Rushing wind. Flying dust. INDY crouched
	low and leaning forward in the saddle, his heart pounding, his adrenalin
	pumping.

	INDY VEERS OFF in a new directiontoward a RAILROAD TRACK.


	EXT. A CIRCUS TRAIN - DAY

	The train is barreling down the track. INDY rides up beside it. He glances over
	his shoulder and sees the car and truck gaining on him. No other choice... he
	LEAPS FROM HORSE TO TRAIN.

	He clings to the side of a BOXCAR, as HALFBREED and ROUGH RIDER leap from
	the truck onto the train.

	HALFBREED tries to grab INDY, but Indy leaps onto another boxcar. Halfbreed
	runs after him but Indy leaps from the boxcar onto some covered boxes stacked
	on a flatcar.

	INDY loses his balance but regains it. With HALFBREED and ROUGH RIDER still
	running after him, Indy enters the trap door of...


	INT. THE REPTILE CAR - DAY

	and finds himself CRAWLING on a CATWALK suspended from the car's ceiling.
	Several feet below are NUMEROUS VATS containing all manner of reptiles:
	Alligators, crocodiles, giant lizards, etc.


CONTINUED:

	Then, HALFBREED ENTERS through the trap doorfollowed by ROUGH RIDER.
	Halfbreed grabs hold of INDY's feet, but Indy kicks at him and he loses his grasp.

	INDY crawls away, toward an opening on the opposite side. HALFBREED grabs at
	Indy's feet again; Indy rolls away and we SEE large bins of squirming snakes.

	The combined weight of the three people is more than the catwalk was intended
	for, and the BOLTS BEGIN TO RIP FROM THE CEILING.

	Everyone holds their breath, afraid to make another move. Too late. SEVERAL
	BOLTS TEAR FREE. HALFBREED and ROUGH RIDER SCREAM... but it's Indy's
	end of the catwalk that DROPS DOWN... PLUNGING INDY to the floor of the car.

	He lands hard, with a SPLASH into a vat of water... where he finds himself eye-
	to-eye with an

	ENORMOUS ANACONDA

	The head of this snake is so damn big, it looks more like a Tyrannosaurus Rex.

			INDY
		Oh...		

	INDY jumps back in horror... only to land with a SQUISH into the SNAKE VAT.

			INDY
		Oh... Oh...

	Hundreds of slippery, squirming snakes. INDY sinks into them. They cover him.
	Engulf him. Almost smother him.

	INDY jumps out of the side of the vat, freeing himself.

	INDY locates a clean-out door at the bottom of the car and uses it to escape.

	HALFBREED, meanwhile, tries to open the closed window of the car. He groans.
	ROUGH RIDER moves to assist him.

			ROUGH RIDER
		Here, let me.



	EXT. THE TRAIN- DAY

	INDY stops, checks to see the Cross still lodged in his belt. Suddenly he looks
	worried as he frantically reaches into his shirt, REMOVES A SNAKE FROM and
	tosses it away.

	ROSCOE APPEARS atop the reptile car and manages to grab INDY. Indy kicks at
	him. Roscoe grabs onto the side of the reptile car as Indy moves on to...

	EXT. A FLATCAR - DAY

	INDY climbs over canvas-covered circus equipment. ROSCOE follows, grabbing a
	long stick with a hook on it. He reaches forward and trips Indy, who falls onto
	the roof of the rhino boxcar.


	INT. THE RHINO BOXCAR - DAY

	as a lamp falls from the ceiling with the impact of Indy's fall, hitting a HUGE
	BLACK RHINOCEROS.


	EXT. THE RHINO BOXCAR - DAY

	ROSCOE grabs INDY by the ankle and yanks him off his feet. The two struggle,
	rolling from side to side, coming perilously close to rolling right off the edge.
	Things get even more serious when Roscoe PULLS A KNIFE.


	IN THE BOXCAR BELOW

	... THE FEROCIOUS BLACK RHINO is becoming extremely agitated by the
	commotion going on atop his cage. Finally, he raises his head and THRUSTS HIS
	HORN THROUGH THE ROOF.

	BACK TO THE ROOFTOP

	as the horn SMASHES through the wood only inches from INDY's head. Indy and
	Roscoe stare at the horn in amazement as they continue to struggle.
	SMASH! The horn comes up againRIGHT BETWEEN INDY'S LEGS.

 			INDY
                   		Holy smokes!
                                    

	INDY kicks ROSCOE away. Roscoe rolls to the edge of the car but keeps from
	falling. Indy flips over onto his stomach.


	EXT. THE REPTILE CAR - DAY

	The WOODEN TRAP DOOR EXPLODES as a BULLET is FIRED from within. The
	door is pushed open and HALFBREED and ROUGH RIDER hurry out of the car.


	EXT. THE RHINO BOXCAR - DAY

	INDY gets to his feetlooks aheadsees a WATER TANK alongside the track
	directly up ahead. Indy gets an idea...

	In an instant, he calculates his approachtimes the distanceand LEAPS for
	the tank's WATER SPOUT.


CONTINUED:

	He catches it perfectly... but his velocity causes the water spout to ROTATE A
	FULL 360 DEGREES. With INDY hanging on, feet kicking, the water spout
	deposits him back on the train, onto the ROOF OF A STOCKCAR, where he looks
	up to see FEDORA walking toward him.

               			FEDORA
		Come on, kid. There's no way
		out of this.

	As INDY edges away from FEDORA, a portion of the STOCKCAR'S ROOF
	COLLAPSES and Indy FALLS THROUGH into the car below.


	INT. THE STOCKCAR - DAY

	INDY CRASHES down from above. Dust rises.

			INDY
                  		Ohhh!                                   

	INDY's eyes take a moment to adjust to the dark. A bit of sunlight leaks in
	through the cracks between the boards.

	Then INDY sees it. At the far end of the boxcar. Rising slowly to its feet... an
	AFRICAN LION. The Lion ROARS. The boxcar walls shake. Indy gasps. Dust
	swirls up into the shafts of sunlight.

	And INDY has one more surprise in store: The Cross of Cortes has been dislodged
	from his belt during the fall...

	INDY glances around, sees a coiled LION TAMER'S WHIP hanging on a nail. He
	carefully takes it down by the handle. The Lion sees this and GROWLS SOFTLY.

	INDY swallows hard and gives the whip a try. It unravels awkwardly, its TIP
	flying back and HITTING INDY IN THE FACE... CUTTING his chin.

	The Lion GROWLS LOUDER. Indy quickly gathers up the whip, wets his lips, and
	tries again. This timesuccess! The WHIP CRACKS SHARPLY. The Lion
	BELLOWS and SWATS the air... and steps back.

	INDY looks amazed and delighted. He CRACKS the whip again. The Lion backs
	away even more. Indy inches forwardbends down (never taking his eyes off
	the Lion)picks up the Crossand steps back again, sweat pouring down his
	face.

	But now... how to get out?

	He looks up at the opening through which he fell and sees FEDORA LOOKING
	DOWN AT HIM. Fedora extends his hand.

               			FEDORA
		Toss up the whip.

	EXT. THE ROOFTOP OF STOCKCAR

	FEDORA, assisted by HALFBREED and ROUGH RIDER, "reels" INDY out of the
	Stockcar as the Lion ROARS and lunges and Indy screams.

	The men, including ROSCOE, pull INDY through the hole in the roof. He stands to
	face them as ROUGH RIDER points a gun in his direction.

			FEDORA
         	 	You've got heart, kid.
		       (indicates Cross)
		But that belongs to me.

       			INDY
		       (takes Cross from his belt)
		It belongs to Coronado.

       			FEDORA
		       (overlapping)
          		Coronado is dead. And so are all
		his grandchildren.

			INDY
		This should be in a museum.

			ROSCOE
          		Now give me thatl

	ROSCOE makes a grab for the Crossbut INDY doesn't let go. A tug-of-war
	ensues until a SNAKE WIGGLES OUT FROM INDY'S SHIRTSLEEVE and WRAPS
	AROUND Roscoe's hand.

	ROSCOE SCREAMS BLOODY MURDERreleases his grip on the Cross and tries
	to shake off the snake. This is all the opportunity Indy needs. He LEAPS ONTO
	THE NEXT CAR.

			FEDORA
          		Don't let him get awayl

	INDY swings down to the caboose. He sees a sign above the caboose door reading
	"DR. FANTASY'S MAGIC CABOOSE."

			INDY
		Magic?

	He glances back at the men and quickly opens the door to the caboose, stepping
	inside.

	FEDORA puts out his arm, gesturing for the others not to follow INDY.

			FEDORA
          		Hold it. Make sure he doesn't
		double back.

	INT. THE CABOOSE - DAY

	which contains the circus MAGIC EQUIPMENT. INDY rushes to the rear door of
	the caboose but can't open it. He hears FEDORA coming, and dives into a MAGIC
	BOX.

               			FEDORA
		Okay, kid. out of the box.
		Now.

	FEDORA smiles confidently and advances toward the box. The box unexpectedly
	collapses; all four sides flop away... revealing NOTHING. INDY has completely
	vanished.

	FEDORA is mystified, frustrated and angered. Then he feels a breeze at his back.
	He turns and discovers that the caboose door is open. He rushes out onto the
	balcony and sees:

	INDY RUNNING along the tracks, turning up a street of modest clapboard houses.


			FEDORA
		Damn.


	EXT. STREET - SMALL TOWN - DAY

	as INDY runs from the railroad tracks and approaches his house we see the name
	"JONES" painted on the mailbox.

               			INDY
		Dad!

	INT. THE HOUSE - DAY

	INDY bursts through the front door holding the Cross in his hand. A Husky
	BARKS as Indy runs past in search of his father.

               			INDY
		Dad!

               			INDY
		Dad!

	INT. THE STUDY - DAY

	INDY charges in. The study is cluttered with books. Pictures, charts and maps
	clearly reflect the father's passion for Medieval studies.

	PROFESSOR HENRY JONES is absorbed at his desk. In fact, he is studying a very
	ancient parchment volume which lies open on the desk. The page shows a
	beautifully illuminated picture of what might be a stained-glass window. The
	sketch incorporates a series of Roman numerals. The Professor is not just
	studying it, he is copying it into his own notebook.


CONTINUED:

We never get to see the PROFESSOR's face in this scene.
So INDY CHARGES IN.
                 
			INDY
		Dad!

			HENRY
		Out!

			INDY
		It's important!

			HENRY
		Then waitcount to twenty.

			INDY
		No, Dad. You listen to me

			HENRY
                 		      (now he shouts)
		Junior!

	No question who is the boss here. INDY gulps, his look says "What am I going to
	do with this guy?" And obeys
	starts counting, VERY, VERY FAINTLY.

			INDY
		One, two, three, four...

	Now we see what HENRY is concentrating on. We see his hand
	sketching; then, he holds up one finger.

			HENRY
		In Greek.

	INDY's reaction:

			INDY
                 		     (louder, in Greek)
		One... two... three... four...

	An ancient car is heard arriving. Perhaps INDY glimpses it going past the
	window. Anyway, it stops outside the house. Two men sit in the front seat.
	HERMAN sits in the rear, BLOWING A TRUMPET.

	INDY's reaction: Trouble!

	HENRY is just finishing the sketch.

			HENRY
		May he who illuminated this...
		illuminate me...

	INT. THE FRONT ROOM - DAY

	The study door is just closing, INDY closing it behind him... just as HERMAN
	comes through the front door, still playing the trumpet.

	INDY reaches for the trumpet, pulling it from HERMAN's mouth. Herman
	continues to spitright into Indy's face. Indy flinches.

               			HERMAN
		I brought the Sheriff.

	HERMAN means the SHERIFF, who now enters the house.


               			INDY
		Just the man I want to see! Now,
		there were five or six of them.


            			SHERIFF
        		      (interrupting)
		All right, son.

              			INDY
        		      (overlapping)
		... they came after... me...


                          		SHERIFF
		You still got it?

               			INDY
		Well, yes, sir. It's right here!

	INDY shows the CROSS, more or less handing it to the SHERIFF to make his
	point. The Sheriff takes it casually.

               			SHERIFF
		I'm glad to see that... because
		the rightful owner of this Cross
		won't press charges, if you give
		it back.

	FEDORA enters the house, followed by ROSCOE, ROUGH RIDER and HALFBREED.
	He politely removes his hat and holds it in his hand. He nods at INDY in a
	friendly manner.

               			SHERIFF
		He's got witnesses, five or six
		of them.

	The SHERIFF and FEDORA are in Cahoots

	The SHERIFF hands the Cross to FEDORA. ROSCOE reaches in and takes it from
	Fedora, then runs out the door.

			ROSCOE
           		Yahoo!

CONTINUED:

	As ROSCOE runs outside INDY seesthrough the screen doorthe MAN IN
	THE PANAMA HAT waiting patiently beside the car that is parked out front.
	Roscoe approaches and gives the Man the Crossthe Man hands Roscoe some
	money in exchange.

	The SHERIFF tips his hat and leaves.

			SHERIFF
		Good day.

	FEDORA remains behind for a moment. He turns and speaks to INDY in an ironic
	man-to-man way.

                			FEDORA
     		You lost today, kid, but that
		doesn't mean you have to like it.

	Then, FEDORA takes off his hat and takes a step towards INDY. He holds the hat
	by the crown, and puts it on Indy's head, a show of respect and admiration for
	the boy. The hat blocks Indy's face.

	CLOSE ON THE TOP OF THE FEDORA HAT

	The hat brim fills the screen. As the brim tilts up, WE SEE the face of FULL
	GROWN INDIANA JONES.

	And... POW!... he's punched in the face while his arms are pinned behind his
	back.

	FADE IN TITLE: "PORTUGUESE COAST1938"

                                  		PANAMA HAT
		Small world, Doctor Jones.

                                     		INDY
		Too small for two of us.

	THE MAN IN THE PANAMA HAT (years older now) removes the CROSS OF
	CORONADO from Indy's belt.

                                  		PANAMA HAT
     		This is the second time I've had
     		to reclaim my property from you

                			INDY
     		That belongs in a museum

                			PANAMA HAT
		So do you.
		      (he moves his eyeline)
		Throw him over the side.

	THE DECK OF A PORTUGUESE CARGO SHIP

	It's NIGHT. RAIN POURS down. We're in the middle of a violent STORM AT SEA.
	Thirty-foot waves crash across the deck.

	The TWO PORTUGUESE SAILORS (who have Indy's arms pinned behind his back)
	propel INDY across the deck toward the rail.

	As they pass a BUNDLE OF FUEL DRUMS, INDY uses the Two Sailors as leverage
	to KICK UP HIS FEET and break open the CLAMP on the metal bands that hold
	the drums together.

	INDY jabs his elbows into the stomachs of the startled Sailors and rushes toward
	the MAN IN THE PANAMA HAT.

	PANAMA HAT sees INDY coming and hurries toward the ladder that leads up to
	the bridge. Indy withstands the force of waves crashing on the deck and makes
	his way to where Panama Hat is climbing the ladder. He pulls him off the ladder
	from behind the two men fall down on the deck. Indy takes the cross back from
	Panama Hat.

	A sailor delivers a powerful blow to Indy's face, sending the cross flying out of
	his grip and skittering across the deck. Indy grabs a crowbar and fends off two
	sailors who attack him from the sides.

	INDY sees that the Cross is about to be swept overboard. He lunges for it.

	He SNATCHES UP the Cross only to be knocked down to the deck by a giant wave.
	He struggles to his feet, managing to avoid the giant fuel drums sliding across the
	deck around him.

	SEVERAL MORE DRUMS come INDY's way. He sidesteps them all.

               			PANAMA HAT
		Grab him, he's getting away!
		Grab him!

	Indy turns around and pummels two sailors with one punch. Indy sees a large
	Stevedore's hook above him and he climbs up on crates to reach it. He grabs a
	hold of the hook and uses it to swing all the way across the deck, narrowly
	avoiding a huge wave behind him. He jumps into the rollicking ocean, still
	holding onto the cross. On the ship, a giant fuel drum rolls wildly, falling directly
	onto a crate of TNT. The crate explodes, causing the entire ship to blow, sending
	an enormous orange fireball into the sky.

	LONG SHOT - THE BOAT EXPLODING OUT OF THE WATER

	as bits of debris fall from the sky like rain.

	INDY BOBS UP

	in the water amid the debris, holding the Cross in his hand. He grabs for
	something to keep him afloat. It turns out to be one of the ship's LIFE
	PRESERVERS. INDY loops his arm through the preserver.


CONTINUED:

	Only now do we see the FADED LETTERING on the preserver revealing the
	destroyed ship's name and city of port:

                  VAZQUEZ de CORONADO
	BARCELONA

	A SHREDDED PANAMA HAT floats past.

	EXT. COLLEGE - DAY
	Students walk along brick, tree-lined paths.

			INDY (V.O .)
		Archaeology is...


	INT. COLLEGE LECTURE HALL - DAY

	DISSOLVE TO:

	INDY, dressed in professorial tweeds, stands before his class. He turns to the
	blackboard with a piece of chalk and writes the word: "FACT."

		               INDY
		... the search for fact. Not truth.
		If it's truth you're interested
		in, Doctor Tyree's Philosophy
		class is right down the hall.

	Laughter.

	INT. CORRIDOR - DAY

		               INDY
		So forget any ideas you've got
		about lost cities, exotic travel,
		and digging up the world. Eve
		do not follow maps to buried
		treasure and "X" never, ever,
		marks the spot.


	MARCUS BRODY approaches Indy's classroom. He peers through the window in
	the door to see INDY completing his lecture.

		               INDY
		Seventy percent of all archaeology
		is done in the library. Research.
		Reading.


	INT. LECTURE HALL - DAY

	BRODY enters the lecture hall and stands at the rear of the room.


CONTINUED:

		               INDY
		We cannot afford to take mythology
		at face value.

	The BELL RINGS. INDY stands at his desk as students begin to disperse. A
	pretty coed puts a note on the desk.

		               INDY
		Next week: "Egyptology." Starting
		with the excavation of Naukratis
		by Blinders Petrie in 1885. I will
		be in my office if anybody's got
		any problems for the next hour
		and a half.

	BRODY approaches as the last of the students leaves the lecture hall.

			INDY
		Marcus!
		      (slaps his pocket)
		I did it!

			BRODY
		You've got itl

	INDY removes the cloth-wrapped Cross from his desk. He places it on the desk
	and takes off his glasses as BRODY examines the Cross.

		               INDY
		You know how long I've been
		looking for that?!

			BRODY
		All your life.

			INDY
		All my life!


 		              BRODY
		Well done, Indy. Very well done,
		indeed This will find a place
		of honor in our Spanish collection.

	INDY gathers up his books and makes his way toward the door.

		               INDY
		We can discuss my honorarium over
		dinner and champagne tonight.

	He turns back toward BRODY, now holding the Cross.

			INDY
		Your treat.

			BRODY
		Yes. My treat.

	INT. INDY'S OUTER OFFICE - DAY

	Bursting with STUDENTS, all competing for his attention at once: "Professor
	Jones! " "Doctor Jonesl " etc., etc.

		               INDY
		Shush! Shush! Shushl

	INDY shoulders his way to the desk of his secretary, an overwhelmed Teaching
	Assistant named IRENE.

		               IRENE
		Doctor Jones! I'm so glad you're
		back! Your mail is on your desk.
		Here are your phone messages.

		               MALE STUDENT
		Doctor Jones, you promised...
		Doctor Jones

		               IRENE
		This is your appointment schedule.
		And these term papers still haven't
		been graded.

	INDY takes the term papers then turns to enter his PRIVATE OFFICE. Students
	once again CLAMOR for his attention: "Doctor Jones!" "Wait, Doctor Jonesl"
	"My grade!" "Sign my registration card!"

	INDY silences the mob with a raised hand.

			INDY
		        (very efficiently)
		Okay. Irene, put everyone's name
		on a list, in the order they
		arrived, and I'll see each and
		every one of them in turn.

	The Students descend upon poor IRENE, each claiming to be first. INDY slips into
	his -

	PRIVATE OFFICE

	where he goes to his desk and finds a thick envelope with a foreign postmark on it.

			INDY
		        (softly; reading)
		"Venice, Italy."

	Then, INDY stuffs his mail into his coat pockets, goes to the WINDOW, slides it
	open and STEPS OUT INTO THE GARDEN.


	EXT. SIDE OF COLLEGE BUILDING - DAY

	INDY escapes through the garden.

	EXT. FRONT OF COLLEGE BUILDING - DAY

	INDY walks briskly toward the street; smiling, erUoying his freedom. As he
	arrives at the curb, a LONG BLACK PACKARD SEDAN pulls up before him.


			MAN (O.S.)
		Doctor Jonesl

	THREE MEN step out of the sedan. Everything about them bespeaks "G-MAN."
	The First Man steps behind Indy.

		               MAN
		Doctor Jones?

	INT. PENTHOUSE APARTMENT - DAY

	INDY is ushered into a large Art Deco apartment and left alone. Numerous
	museum-quality artifacts are displayed around the room. Indy takes this
	opportunity to examine them.

	After a moment, WALTER DONOVAN enters from across the room. During the
	brief time that the door is open, we HEAR a COCKTAIL PARTY going on in the
	next room: VOICES and SOFT PIANO MUSIC.

	DONOVAN strides across the room toward INDY. Although in his late fifties,
	Donovan has the broad shoulders and trim physique of a much younger man.
	Dressed in a tuxedo, he exudes both confidence and power.

		               DONOVAN
		I trust your trip down was
		comfortable, Doctor Jones. My
		men didn't alarm you, I hope.

	He shakes hands with INDY.

		               DONOVAN
		My name is Donovan. Walter Donovan.

		               INDY
		I know who you are Mr. Donovan.
		Your contributions to the museum
		over the years have been extremely
		generous. Some of the pieces in
		your collection here are very
		impressive.

		               DONOVAN
		Well, like yourself, Doctor Jones,
		I have a passion for antiquities.
	               	         (beat)
		Have a look over here. This might

	DONOVAN goes to a table where an object is wrapped in cloth. He throws back
	the cloth revealing a flat STONE TABLETabout two feet square, inscribed with
	letters and symbols.

	INDY looks impressed. He puts on his glasses to make a closer examination.

		               INDY
		Well, it's sandstone. Christian
		symbol. Early Latin text. Mid-
		Twelfth Century, I should think.

		               DONOVAN
		That was our assessment as well.
	
		               INDY
		Where did this come from?

		               DONOVAN
		My engineers unearthed it in the
		mountain region north of Ankara
		while excavating for copper.
		        (beat)
		Can you translate the inscription?

	Translating the inscription is no easy matter, even for someone as knowledgeable
	as INDY.

	                                      INDY
		        (stumbling through it)
		"... who drinks the water I shall
		give him, says the Lord, will have
		a spring inside him welling up
		for eternal life. Let them bring
		me to your holy mountain in the
		place where you dwell.

	Donovan pours champagne into several fluted glasses as Indy reads.

		               INDY
		Across the desert and through
		the mountain to the Canyon of
		the Crescent Moon, to the Temple
		where the cup that"

	Suddenly INDY stops and looks up at DONOVAN with a startled expression.

		               INDY
		"Where the cup that holds the
		blood of Jesus Christ resides
		forever. "

				                                       (CONT'D)


CONTINUED: (2)

		        DONOVAN
		      (reverently)
		The Holy Grail, Doctor Jones.
		The chalice used by Christ during
		the Last Supper. The cup that
		caught His blood at the Crucifixion
		and was entrusted to Joseph of
		Arimathaea.

	INDY rubs his chin with a dubious expression as he takes the glass of champagne
	DONOVAN now offers him.

		               INDY
		The Arthur Legend. I've heard
		this bedtime story before.
	
		               DONOVAN
		Eternal life, Doctor Jones! The
		gift of youth to whoever drinks
		from the Grail.
		        (beat)
		Oh, now that's a bedtime story I'd
		like to wake up to!

		               INDY
		An old man's dream.

		               DONOVAN
		Every man's dream.
	      	      (beat)
		Including your father's, I believe.

	INDY stiffens slightly at the mention of his father, nods.

		               INDY
		Grail lore is his hobby.
		He's a teacher of Medieval
		Literature. The one the students
		hope they don't get.

	The door opens and MRS. DONOVAN steps into the room. She's a matronly
	woman in an expensive evening gown.

		               MRS. DONOVAN
		Walter, you're neglecting our
		guests.

		               DONOVAN
		Be along in a moment, dear.

	He leans over and kisses her cheek. MRS. DONOVAN sighs to herself and returns
	to the party. INDY, meanwhile, has turned his attention back to the Grail Tablet,
	obviously hooked by its archaeological promise. He moistens his finger with
	champagne and rubs it over the tablet. DONOVAN steps up next to Indy.


CONTINUED: (3)

		               DONOVAN
		Hard to resist, isn't it? The
		Holy Grail's final resting place
		described in detail!

		               INDY
		What good is it? This Grail
		Tablet speaks of deserts and
		mountains and canyons. Pretty
		vague. Where do you start
		looking? Maybe if the Tablet were
		intact, you'd have something to
		go on. But the entire top
		portion is missing.

		               DONOVAN
		Just the same, an attempt to
		recover the Grail is currently
		underway.

	INDY has to shake his head at DONOVAN's apparent lack of judgment.

		               DONOVAN
		Let me tell you another "bedtime
		story, " Doctor Jones.
		After the Grail was entrusted
		to Joseph of Arimathaea, it
		disappeared and was lost for a
		thousand years before it was found
		again by three Knights of the
		First Crusade. Three brothers,
		to be exact.

		               INDY
		I've heard this one as well.
		Two of these brothers walked out
		of the desert one hundred and
		fifty years after having found
		the Grail and began the long
		journey back to France. But
		only one of them made it. And
		before dying of extreme old
		age, he supposedly imparted
		his tale to ato a Franciscan
		friar, I think.

		               DONOVAN
		Not "supposedly," Doctor Jones.

	DONOVAN produces an ANCIENT LEATHER-BOUND VOLUME with very brittle
	pages. INDY views the manuscript with considerable interest.


CONTINUED: (4)

		               DONOVAN
		This is the manuscript in which
		the friar chronicled the Knight's
		story... it doesn't reveal on
		location of the Grail, I'm afraid...
		but the Knight promised that two
		"markers" that had been left
		behind would.
		       (indicates the Tablet)
		This Tablet is one of those
		"markers." It proves the Knight's
		story is true. But as you pointed
		outit's incomplete.
		       (beat)
		Now, the second "marker" is
		entombed with the Knight's dead
		brother. Our project leader
		believes that tomb to be located
		within the city of Venice, Italy.
		       (beat)
		As you can now see, Doctor Jones,
		we're about to complete a great
		quest that began almost two
		thousand years ago. We're only
		one step away.

		               INDY
		That's usually when the ground
		falls out from underneath your
		feet.

		               DONOVAN
		You could be more right than you
		know.

		               INDY
		Yes?

		               DONOVAN
		We've hit a snag. our project
		leader has vanished. Along with
		all his research. Uh, we received
		a cable from his colleague, Doctor
		Schneider, who has no idea of his
		whereabouts or what's become of
		him.
		        (beat)
		I want you to pick up the trail
		where he left off. Find the man
		and you will find the Grail.


CONTINUED: (5)

		                INDY
		You've got the wrong Jones, Mister
		Donovan. Why don't you try my
		father?

			DONOVAN
		        (after a pause)
		We already have. Your father is
		the man who's disappeared.


	EXT. A RESIDENTIAL STREET - DAY

	A FORD COUPE speeds down the tree-lined street.

	EXT. PROFESSOR HENRY JONES' HOUSE - DAY

	The Ford coupe pulls up in front of the house. INDY climbs from the car and
	hurries up the walkway. BRODY is a step behind.

		                BRODY
		Your father and I have been
		friends since time began. I've
		watched you grow up, Indy. And
		I've watched the two of you grow
		apart.
		        (beat)
		I've never seen you this concerned
		about him before.

	They climb the porch and notice that the front door is ajar. They exchange a
	quick look of concern as they enter.

	INT. THE HOUSE - LATE AFTERNOON

	INDY approaches the half-open front door.


                      		INDY
	                  	Dad?
	                            (to BRODY)
		He's an academic A bookworm.
		He's not a field mans

	He pushes open the door. He enters the house and calls out.

	                                    INDY
		Dad? Dad?
                                          
	INDY opens one half of the curtains dividing the hall from the sitting room.

	We see the place has been ransacked.


CONTINUED:

	BRODY sees INDY's face and opens the other half.

			BRODY
	                        Dear God.

	They walk into the room.


 		              BRODY
		What has the old fool got
		himself into now?

		               INDY
		I don't know. But whatever it
		is, he's in over his head!

	BRODY picks up some mail from Henry's cluttered desk.

			INDY
		Dad?              

		               BRODY
	       	It's today's mail. And it's been
		opened.

	INDY turns and sees the pile of torn papers and envelopes. Then something hits
	him.

		               INDY
       		Mail! That's it, Marcus!

	He immediately empties his pockets of his own mail taken earlier in the day from
	his college office and finds the envelope with the Venice postmark.

			INDY
		      (as he tears it open)
		Venice, Italy!

			BRODY
		What is it?


	INDY uncovers a small book. It looks like a JOURNAL or
	DIARY. Indy flips through it: Page after page of
	handwritten notes and drawings. BRODY glances at it with
	great curiosity.

		               INDY
		It's Dad's Grail Diary. Every
		clue he ever followed. Every
		discovery he made. A complete
		record of his search for the Holy
		Grail. This is his whole life.
		Why would he have sent this to me?


CONTINUED: (2)

		               BRODY
		I don't know. But someone must
		want it pretty badly.

		               INDY
		Do you believe, Marcus?

	As INDY asks the question, he turns to a PAINTING on the wall: A depiction of
	Christ on the Cross, his blood being captured in a golden chalice.

	A SECOND PAINTING on the wall shows Eleventh Century Crusaders plummeting
	to their deaths over a high cliff. One Crusader, however, floats safely in midair
	because he holds the Grail in his hands.

		               INDY
		Do you believe the Grail actually
		exists?

		               BRODY
		The search for the Cup of Christ
		is the search for the divine in all
		of us.

	BRODY sees that INDY is unsatisfied by this response.

		               BRODY
		But if you want facts, Indy, I
		have none to give you. At my age,
		I'm prepared to take a few things
		on faith.

		               INDY
		Call Donovan, Marcus. Tell him
		I'll take that ticket to Venice
		now.

		               BRODY
		I'll tell him we'll take two.


	EXT. AIRFIELD - DAY

	A LIMO is parked beside a PRIVATE AIRLINER that bears the DONOVAN
	CORPORATE LOGO. BRODY peers inside to DONOVAN and INDY.

		               BRODY
		Tell me, what's going to happen
		when we get to Venice?

			DONOVAN
		      (overlapping)
		Don't worry. Doctor Schneider will
		be there to meet you.

CONTINUED:

			BRODY
		      (overlapping)
		Schneider?

		               DONOVAN
		     (overlapping)
		I maintain an apartment in Venice,
		at your disposal.

               			BRODY
		Oh, well. That's good. Thank
		you.

	BRODY and DONOVAN shake hands. INDY steps from the back seat of the limo.
	He turns back to Donovan and shakes his hand.

		               DONOVAN
		Doctor Jones. Good luck. Be
		very careful. Don't trust anvbody.


	INT. AIRLINER - FLYING - DAY
	
	INDY opens the Grail Diary and thoughtfully turns through the pages. He stops
	at one page and glances at a PENCIL SKETCH of what might be a stained-glass
	window. Below the sketch is a SERIES OF NUMBERS.


	EXT. THE PRIVATE AIRLINER - FLYING - DAY

	SUPERIMPOSED over a MAP that traces a course from New York City to Venice,
	Italy.

	DISSOLVE TO:


	EXT. VENICE - BOAT LANDING - DAY

	INDY and BRODY disembark from the Water Bus onto the Boat Landing as other
	Gondoliers steer their boats in the water.

			INDY
		 Ah, Venice...

		               BRODY
		Yes. Uh, how will we recognize
		this Doctor Schneider when we
		see him?

		               INDY
		I don't know. Maybe he'll know
		us.


CONTINUED:

	Suddenly a WOMAN comes up to him. Attractive features. Blonde hair. Eyes
	that are bright and intelligent.

			ELSA
		Doctor Jones?

			INDY
		Yes?

		               ELSA
		I knew it was you

	She looks at him with an appraising expression that is brazenly flirtatious.

	                                      ELSA
	                       you have your father's eyes.

	INDY is instantly attracted to her.

		               INDY
		And my mother's ears. But the
		rest belongs to you.

		               ELSA
		Looks like the best parts have
		already been spoken for.

	INDY grins, enjoying the repartee. The WOMAN turns to BRODY, who tips his hat.

		               ELSA
		Marcus Brody?

		               BRODY
		That's right.

	The Woman, DR. ELSA SCHNEIDER, extends her hand to BRODY.

			ELSA
		        (introducing herself)
		Doctor Elsa Schneider.

	INDY's grin fades. BRODY registers a look of surprise.

		               BRODY
		Uh... how do you do?

					CUT TO:


	EXT. VENICE CANAL - DAY

	INDY, BRODY and ELSA walk along the narrow canal, lined with buildings on
	either side.


CONTINUED:

		               ELSA
		The last time I saw your father
		we were in the library. He was
		very close to tracking down the
		Knight's Tomb. I've never seen
		him so excited. He was as giddy
		as a schoolboy.

		               INDY
		Who? Attila the Professor? He
		was never giddy, even when he was
		a schoolboy!

	INDY can't take his eyes off ELSA. Perhaps he's feeling a bit like a schoolboy
	himself right now. As they cross over a bridge to the opposite side of the canal,
	Indy steals a flower from a street vendor. He holds it out to Elsa.

		               INDY
		Frauleinwill you permit me?

		               ELSA
		I usually don't.

		               INDY
		I usually don't either.

		               ELSA
		In that case, I permit you.

	INDY gives her the flower.

		               INDY
		It would make me very happy.

		               ELSA
		But I'm already sadby tomorrow
		it will have faded.

		               INDY
		Tomorrow I'll steal you another.

		               BRODY
		        (cutting in)
		I hate to interrupt youbut the
		reason we're here

			ELSA
		        (interrupting)
		Yes. I have something to show
		you.

	She hands a slip of paper to INDY.


CONTINUED: (2)

		               ELSA
		I left your father working in
		the library. He sent me to the
		map section to fetch an ancient
		plan of the city. When I got back
		to his tablehe'd gonewith
		all his papersexcept for that
		scrap which I found near his chair.

	INDY extends the scrap of paper to BRODY.

		               INDY
		Roman numerals.


	EXT. VENICE PIAZZA - DAY

	ELSA leads INDY and BRODY into the large piazza. People walk about and sit at
	tables in front of a large building.

		               ELSA
		Here is the library.

	They have arrived at the front steps of the library.

		               INDY
		That doesn't look much like a
		library.

		               BRODY
		It looks like a converted church.

	ELSA leads the way inside.


	INT. THE LIBRARY - DAY

	INDY, BRODY and ELSA enter, their heels CLICKING across the marble floor.

	We notice, along with INDY and BRODY, that the library contains many stained-
	glass windows.

		               ELSA
		In this case it's the literal
		truth. We're on holy ground.
		These columns over here...

	She indicates FOUR HUGE MARBLE COLUMNS that go from floor to ceiling.

		               ELSA
		... were brought back as spoils
		of war after the sacking of
		Byzantium during the Crusades.


CONTINUED:

	INDY glances at the Columns, then notices a Stained-Glass Window that depicts a
	Knight of the Crusades. Indy lingers for a moment in front of the window.

		               ELSA
		Now please excuse me. The library's
		closing in a few moments. I'll
		arrange for us to stay a little
		longer.

	The minute ELSA is out of earshot.

		               INDY
		MarcusI've seen this window
		before.

			BRODY
		Where?

	INDY whips out the Grail Diary and opens it to the sketch he noticed in the
	airplane.

		               INDY
		Right here. In Dad's Diary.
		You see?

	BRODY glances at the Diary, then at the windownoticing that the Roman
	numerals in question have been worked into the window's design.

	                                     BRODY
		Look, Indy. The Roman numerals!

		               INDY
		Dad was onto something here!

		               BRODY
		Well, now we know the source of
		the numbers, but we still don't
		know what they mean.

	INDY and BRODY now see ELSA approaching. Indy quickly tucks the Diary back
	into his pocket.

		               INDY
		      (explaining to Brody)
		My dad sent me this Diary for a
		reason. Until we find out why,
		I suggest we keep it to ourselves.

		               ELSA
		Find something?

	INDY doesn't reply. He's looking in five directions at once. His eyes moving
	across the walls and ceilingscharged with the thrill of discovery.


CONTINUED: (2)

		               BRODY
		        (to ELSA)
		Uh, yes. Three, seven and tent
		That window seems to be the source
		of the Roman numerals.

		               ELSA
		My God, I must be blind

		               INDY
		Dad wasn't looking for a book
		about the Knight's Tomb... he was
		looking for the Tomb itself

	ELSA wears a blank expression.

		               INDY
		Don't you get it? The Tomb is
		somewhere in the library! You
		said yourself it used to be a
		church! Look.

	INDY's eyes travel up one of the four huge marble columns.

			INDY
		Three.

INDY looks again to the stained-glass window. He points.

 		              INDY
		Three!

	INDY has discovered that each Column is numbered with a Roman Numeral. Indy
	hurries away toward Column VII. All BRODY and ELSA can do now is try to keep
	up with him.

		              INDY
		Seven.

	He points again to the stained-glass window.

			INDY
		Seven... Ten.

	He looks down to the scrap of paper in his hands.

		               INDY
		And ten. Now where's the ten?
		Look around for the ten.

	INDY walks past aisles of book-lined shelves. He stops, turns, then looks down.


CONTINUED: (3)

			INDY
		Three, seven and ten.
	
	He climbs a spiral staircase leading up to a LOFT and looks down at BRODY and
	ELSA. The floor beneath their feet is an elaborate tile design containing a huge
	"X"visible only from this higher angle.

			INDY
		Ten.
		      (wryly; to himself)
		"X" marks the spot.

	INDY rushes down the staircase and goes to the CENTER TILE where the two
	sides of the X intersect. He blows dust away from the tile and tries to pry it up,
	but cannot.

	INDY rushes past BRODY to a cordon held in place by a brass stand underneath
	the stained-glass window.

	INDY raises the brass stand and timing his actions, hits the tile precisely as the
	Librarian stamps a book. The Librarian regards the stamper curiously.
	
	INDY continues to pound at the tile as the Librarian resumes his stamping, still
	puzzled by the SOUND ECHOING through the library.

	Finally INDY breaks the tile. As he bends to remove the pieces of broken tile, a
	TWO-FOOT SQUARE HOLE IS REVEALED.

	Cold air and a wet, rancid smell escape from the hole.

			INDY
		Bingo.

			ELSA
		You don't disappoint, Doctor Jones.
		You're a great deal like your
		father.

			INDY
		Except he's lost, and I'm not.

			ELSA
		Lower me down.

	INDY is impressed with Elsa's spirit, and cooperates agreeablyholding her by
	the hands and lowering her into the hole. When her feet finally touch ground
	below, Indy releases his grip on her and slips the Grail Diary to BRODY.
	
			INDY
		Look after this for me, will you?

	Then INDY disappears into the hole.

	INT. CATACOMBS BELOW LIBRARY - DAY

	INDY jumps down a steep step. He reaches back to help ELSA.

			INDY
		Come on.

	INDY and ELSA glance around. This is really a horrid place. Dark and dank.
	foul smelling. Elsa turns. She removes a cigarette lighter with a unique ivory
	four-leaf clover design.

	INDY and ELSA inspect markings carved onto the walls.

		               ELSA
		Pagan symbols. Fourth or Fifth
		Century.

		               INDY
		Right. Six hundred years before
		the Crusades.

		               ELSA
		The Christians would have dug
		their own passages and burial
		chambers centuries later.

	INDY takes the lighter from her and lights their way down a dark passageway.

		               INDY
		That's right. If there's a
		Knight of the First Crusade
		entombed down here, that's where
		we'll find him.


	INT. LIBRARY - DAY

	THREE MEN carrying guns make their way down the spiral staircase toward an
	unsuspecting BRODY. One of the Men, KAZIM, raises his gun and brings it down
	hard on Brody's head.

		               BRODY
		Ohhhh. . .

	KAZIM gestures with his gun toward the now-unconscious BRODY. The other two
	men take Brody's hands and drag him into one of the book-lined aisles.

	INT. ANOTHER PART OF THE CATACOMBS - DAY

	DECOMPOSING CORPSES rest in niches carved into the stone walls. Grotesque
	skeletal remains with rotting linen stretched across blackened bones.

	INDY holds the lighter up as he and ELSA inspect symbols carved into the walls.


CONTINUED:

	ELSA spots a symbol cut into the wall that she doesn't recognize. As she blows
	away some cobwebs:

		               ELSA
		What's this one?

	INDY only has to give it a quick glance to know.

		               INDY
		The Ark of the Covenant.

			ELSA
		Are you sure?

			INDY
		      (deadpan)
		Pretty sure.

	INDY holds the lighter up and he and ELSA enter another dark passageway.

	ANOTHER PART OF THE CATACOMBS

	INDY steps to the wall and runs his hand over the stone. He scrapes the cobwebs
	away to reveal the ROMAN NUMERAL "X."

			INDY
		Watch out.

	ELSA now holds the lighter as INDY rams his shoulder into the wall. The wall
	collapses on impact and Indy falls through into another room.


	ANOTHER ROOM - THE CATACOMBS

	as INDY falls through the hole in the wall onto rocks surrounded by bubbling,
	green, slimy liquid. More skeletons surround him, resting in their carved niches.
	ELSA holds the lighter as she peers in at him through the hole in the wall.

		               INDY
		Petroleum. I could sink a well
		down here and retire.

	INDY reaches up and tears a piece of cloth from one of the skeletons, which
	breaks apart and falls into the oil-slick water.

	INDY uses the scrap of cloth and a bone to fashion a crude torch, which he then
	dips into the oily water.

		               INDY
		Give me the lighter.

	ANOTHER PART OF THE CATACOMBS

	Using the cloth-wrapped bone torch to guide their way, INDY and ELSA come
	upon a NARROW PASSAGEWAY. The water is knee-deep and TEEMING WITH
	RATS. Thousands of them Crawling on one another's backs. SQUEALING.
	Squirming. Thrashing in the water.

			INDY
		Oh, rats...

	ELSA gasps as the rats scamper between her legs.

	INDY moves forward through the rat-infested water as ELSA follows, still gasping
	in horror. Suddenly he slips into a hole. Recovering his balance, he reaches out
	to Elsa.

		              INDY
		Come onl

	She gasps once again, terrified. INDY lifts her and carries ELSA as he moves
	forward.


	THE CATACOMBS - THE HOLE IN THE WALL

	KAZIM and his men step to the opening Indy made earlier and shine their
	flashlights through to the rat-infested water.

	ANOTHER PART OF THE CATACOMBS

	More rat-infested water as ELSA, now walking again, follows INDY through
	another passageway lined with skulls and bones.

	INDY reaches for a wall to steady himself and inadvertently grabs a skeleton. A
	bone comes loose in his hand as rats scurry about and leap at him from all
	directions.

	He takes a moment to compose himself, then steps across the water to ELSA's
	side. He steps into the water, then reaches up to help Elsa do the same.

			INDY
		Come here.

	LARGE BURIAL CHAMBER

	The chamber is flooded with black, briny water.
			
			INDY
		Look. . .

	In the center of the chamber, jutting up above the water, is what amounts to an
	"island altar" on which SEVERAL ANCIENT COFFINS rest. They move toward the
	altar.


CONTINUED:

	INDY and ELSA begin to inspect the ornately carved COFFINS like the scholars of
	antiquity that they are. These are big oak caskets held together by straps of
	etched brass.

		             INDY
		It must be one of these...

		             ELSA
		Look at the artistry of these
		carvings and the scrollwork.

	One coffin is elevated above the others.

		             ELSA
		It's this one.

	Together they begin to push on the lidSTRAINING and GROANING until it
	slides away and BANGS against the stone platform.


	INSIDE THE COFFIN

	lie the DECOMPOSED REMAINS of a KNIGHT IN ARMOR. INDY and ELSA look
	in...Elsa gasps.

		               INDY
		This is itl we found it! Look
		the engraving on the Shield. It's
		the same as on the Grail Tablets
		The Shield is the Second Marker!

	INDY unfolds a piece of paper and holds it over the shield.

			ELSA
		What's that?

		               INDY
		It's a rubbing Dad made of the
		Grail Tablet.

	The missing portion of the rubbing is completed by the shield.

		               ELSA
		Just like your fathergiddy
		as a schoolboy.

	INDY laughs.

		               ELSA
		Wouldn't it be wonderful if he
		were here now to see this?

		               INDY
		       (chuckles)
		He never would have made it past
		the rats!  He hates rats!  He's
		scared to death of them!

	CLOSE - A HAND

	as it lights a match.

	PULL BACK TO REVEAL KAZIM dropping the lighted match into the oil-slick
	water.


	INDY AND ELSA

	ELSA holds the torch. INDY looks around. Listens. Something is wrong. And
	then he sees the GLOW OF FIRELIGHT dancing across the Catacomb walls.

	This is followed by THOUSANDS OF RATS FLEEING from around the corner of the
	Narrow Passageway, STAMPEDING toward ELSA and INDYSHRIEKING and
	SQUEALING as they approach.

	The rats literally wash over themlike a rodent tidal wavein their efforts to
	escape a:

	HUGE ORANGE BALL OF FIRE

	ROARING around the corner hurtling towards themfeeding on the oil slick;
	consuming the oxygen.

	ELSA SCREAMS.

	                                     INDY
		Get back! Back against the wall.

	INDY braces his back against the altar and TOPPLES THE COFFIN with his feet.
	It CRASHES against the stone platform and SPLASHES into the water.

	                                     INDY
		Quick! Under it!

	They jump into the water beside the bobbing, overturned coffin.

	                                     INDY
		Air pocket!

	ELSA hesitates. INDY literally DUNKS her and pushes her underneath.


	UNDER THE COFFIN

	ELSA surfaces into the air pocket created by the coffin, SPUTTERING and
	SPITTING.

	Now INDY pops up into the air pocket. He looks at ELSAthey are both soaking
	wet.

		           	INDY
		Don't wander off.


CONTINUED:

			ELSA
		What?

	INDY disappears under the water and swims out from under the coffin.

			ELSA
		What?

	UNDER THE WATER

	INDY swims, looking for an escape route.

	UNDER THE COFFIN

	The rats are beginning to force their way inside, swimming through the water
	and climbing on ELSA, who squirms and screams in terror.

	INDY pops back up through the water.

			INDY
		I think I've found a way out.
		Deep breath.

	ELSA groans. They take a deep breath and both dive under the water.


	EXT. VENICE PIAZZA - OUTDOOR CAFE - DAY

	The perfect picture postcardSt. Mark's Square and the Grand Canal beyond.
	Cafe customers are startled to see INDY and ELSA climb out of the sewer, wet
	and smelly. Indy looks around at the postcard-perfect setting and smiles.

                  			INDY
		           (wryly)
		Ah, Venicel

	Indy's delight, however, is short-lived since KAZIM and TWO OTHER TURKISH
	AGENTS are running towards them with drawn guns.

	He grabs ELSA by the hand and the two of them run down the dock and LEAP
	INTO A MOTORBOAT.


	INT. THE MOTORBOAT - DAY

	INDY fires up the engine and pulls away from the dock... but not before a
	Turkish Agent JUMPS in with him.

	ELSA grabs the wheel and begins to steer the boat while INDY and the Turk trade
	punches.

	EXT. THE HARBOR - DAY

	Indy's Speedboat BOUNCES across the choppy waters heading in the direction of
	the DOCKED STEAMSHIP.

	KAZIM and his men rush to TWO MORE SPEEDBOATS tied to the dock.

	They chase after INDY.

	INDY grapples with the Turkish Agent. As Indy grips his arms, we SEE a GUN in
	the Agent's hand. It FIRES.

	As INDY fights with the Turk, he becomes aware of the Speedboats behind him
	and two enormous Freighters ahead of him, joined together by two giant ropes.

	INDY, having gained the advantage, leans on top of the Turkish Agent.

			INDY
		      (to ELSA)
		Are you crazy?! You don't go
		between them!

	ELSA can barely hear INDY over the noise of the motor.

	                                      ELSA
		Go between them? Are you crazy?!

	INDY finally delivers the punch that sends the Turkish Agent flying overboard.
	Turning, Indy sees that ELSA has committed the speedboat to a course BETWEEN
	the two Freighters, now being pushed even closer together by a Tugboat.

			INDY
		I said go around!

			ELSA
		You said go between them!

			INDY
		I said don't go between them!

	It's purely academic at this point since the hulls of the the two Freighters loom
	up on either side of them like cavern walls.


	EXT. FULL SHOT - THE HARBOR - DAY

	One Enemy Speedboat chases INDY between the two Freighters. But the Speedboat
	containing KAZIM veers off and goes around.


	EXT. BETWEEN THE TWO FREIGHTERS - DAY

	It's a race for daylight as the two Freighters drift ever closer to one another.

	Indy's Speedboat just manages to squeeze through the gap. But the Enemy
	Speedboat EXPLODES as it is crushed between the two Freighters, FLYING INTO
	THE AIR and SPLASHING back down into the water.

	INDY AND ELSA

	spin their boat around in a sharp half-circle to see KAZIM'S SPEEDBOAT appear
	racing toward them. He stands in the moving boat, FIRING A MACHINE GUN at
	INDY and ELSA.


	KAZIM'S SPEEDBOAT
	
	matches Indy's move for move.

	FULL SHOT - THE HARBOR

	The two boats race across the water nearly side-by-side. A CHATTERING
	MACHINE GUN from Kazim's boat SPLINTERS the wood of Indy's boat, until
	finally the rear of the boat CATCHES ON FIRE.

	The machine gun runs out of ammunition. KAZIM puts it down and takes control
	of the wheel from one of the Turkish Agents in the boat with him.

	As Indy's boat drifts toward the GIANT, TURNING PROPELLERS at the STERN of
	ANOTHER STEAMER, Kazim's boat draws up alongside and hits them. INDY
	steps into Kazim's boat. He knocks one of the Turkish Agents to the deck, then
	turns his attention to KAZIM. The two men trade punches as the boat spins
	helplessly in the churning water.

			ELSA
		No!!

	INDY kicks KAZIM in the face, knocking him into the water, then pulls him back
	into the boat, now being SUCKED THROUGH THE CHURNING WATER toward the
	Steamer's giant propeller blades.

		               INDY
		Why are you trying to kill us?

		               KAZIM
		Because you're looking for the
		Holy Grail.

		               INDY
		My father was looking for the
		Holy Grail. Did you kill him
		too?

			KAZIM
		No.

		               INDY
		Where is he? Talkor you're
		dead. Damn it, tell me! Tell
		me!

			KAZIM
		If you don't let go, Doctor Jones,
		we'll both die.


CONTINUED:

		               INDY
		Then we'll die.

		               KAZIM
		My soul is prepared. How's yours?

	By now half the boat has been chopped up into matchwood and the blades are
	getting closer.

		               INDY
		This is your last chance.

		               KAZIM
		No, Doctor Jones. It's yours!

	The wind of the blades is on their necks. INDY grabs KAZIM just in time and
	jumps... into the motorboat, driven by ELSA, which gets alongside in the nick of
	time.

			INDY
		All right! Where's my father

		               KAZIM
		If you let me go, I will tell you
		where he is.

		               INDY
		Who are you?

		               KAZIM
		My name is Kazim.

		               INDY
		And why were you trying to kill
		me?

		               KAZIM
		The secret of the Grail has been
		safe for a thousand years. And
		for all that time the Brotherhood
		of the Cruciform Sword has been
		prepared to do anything to keep
		it safe.

	KAZIM pulls back his shirt to reveal a birthmark... or is it a tattoo? Whatever it
	is, it's a cruciform sword; a Christian cross which tapers down, like the blades of
	a broadsword.

		               KAZIM
		Let me get off at this jetty.

	The boat is close to the edge of the canal. INDY gives ELSA a nod, telling her to
	bring the boat in. KAZIM steps ashore.


CONTINUED: (2)

		               KAZIM
		Ask yourself, why do you seek
		the Cup of Christ? Is it for His
		glory, or for yours?

		               INDY
		I didn't come for the Cup of
		Christ. I came to find my father.

		               KAZIM
		In that case, God be with you in
		your quest. Your father is being
		held in the Castle of Brunwald on
		the Austrian-German border.

	KAZIM walks away.

	INT. VENICE APARTMENT - DAY

	CLOSE ON THE WATER-SOAKED PAPER IMPRESSION: The rubbing taken from
	the shield of the Grail Knight.

	BRODY is giving it careful study while he dabs the lump on the back of his head
	with an ice pack.

		               INDY
		How's the head?

			BRODY
		It's better, now I've seen this.
		It's the name of a city.
		"Alexandretta?" Hmmm...

	INDY, wearing a bathrobe, leans over to study the impression.

		               INDY
		The Knights of the First Crusade
		laid siege to the city of
		Alexandretta for over a year.
		The entire city was destroyed.

	BRODY lowers the ice pack from his head and looks at INDY.

		               INDY
		The present city of Iskenderun
		is built on its ruins. Marcus
		you remember what the Grail
		Tablet said. "Across the desert
		and through the mountain to the
		Canyon of the Crescent Moon."
		       (pause)
		But where exactly?


CONTINUED:

		               BRODY
		Your father would know. Your
		father did know. Look. He
		made a map.

	BRODY picks up the Grail Diary.

		               BRODY
		He must have pieced it together
		from clues scattered through the
		whole history of the Grail Quest.
		A map with no names.


	INSERT: A PENCIL-DRAWN MAP

	It covers two pages of the Diary. BRODY's finger moves across it.

		               BRODY
		Now, he knew there was a city
		with an oasis due east. Here.
		He knew the course turned south
		through the desert to a river, and
		the river led into the mountains.
		Here. Straight to the canyon.
		He knew everything except where
		to begin, the name of the city.

			INDY
		      (solemnly)
		Alexandretta. Now we know.

		               BRODY
		Yes. Now we know.

			INDY
		      (rising)
		Marcus, get hold of Sallah. Tell
		him to meet you in Iskenderun.

	INDY closes the Grail Diary and puts it into the pocket of his robe.

		               BRODY
		What about you?

		               INDY
		I'm going after Dad.


	INT. INDY'S BEDROOM - DAY

	INDY opens the door. His bedroom has been ransacked...the mattress on the
	floor, the drawers turned out.

	INT. HALLWAY - DAY

	INDY approaches another door (Elsa's bedroom) and knocks.

		               INDY
		Elsa?

	He goes in.


	INT. ELSA'S BEDROOM - DAY

	... and finds that Elsa's bedroom is in a similar ransacked state to his own. The
	room is empty.

	He is worried for her, knocks and calls out:

		               INDY
		Elsa?

	He steps into the room and knocks upon the bathroom door.
	
		               INDY
		Elsa?

	He opens the bathroom door, peering inside.

		               INDY
		Elsa?


	INT. ELSA'S BATHROOM - DAY
	
	Elsa is standing before a mirror, wearing a silk bathrobe. She gasps, startled, as
	INDY enters. He retreats back into her bedroom as she reaches up to turn off a
	record player sitting on a ledge above the bathtub.


	INT. ELSA'S BEDROOM - DAY

	ELSA joins INDY, waiting in the ransacked room. she looks around in shock.

	                                       ELSA
                                    	My room!

			INDY		
		Mine, too.

			ELSA
		What were they looking for?

	She looks to INDY, who pulls the Grail Diary from his pocket.

			INDY
		This.


CONTINUED:

		               ELSA
		The Grail Diary.

		               INDY
		Uh-huh.

		               ELSA
		You had it? You didn't trust
		me!

	She looks hurt and beautiful. She comes closer to him.

		               INDY
		I didn't know you.

	She's awfully hard to resist.

		               INDY
		At least I let you tag along.

		               ELSA
		Oh, yes. Give them a flower and
		they'll follow you anywhere.

		               INDY
		Knock it off. You're not mad.

			ELSA
		No?

		                INDY
		No. You like the way I do things.

		               ELSA
		It's lucky I don't do things the
		same way. You'd still be standing
		at the Venice pier.

	She stomps her foot angrily. INDY flinches. She starts to walk away but Indy
	grabs her.

		               INDY
		Look, what do you think is going
		on here? Since I've met you,
		I've nearly been incinerated,
		drowned, shot at, and chopped into
		fish bait. We're caught in the
		middle of something sinister here.
		My guess is Dad found out more
		than he was looking for. And
		until I'm sure, I'm going to
		continue to do things the way I
		think they should be done.


CONTINUED: (2)

	He pulls her to him and kisses her.

		                ELSA
		How dare you kiss me!

	Now ELSA reaches for INDY and kisses him.

		                INDY
		Leave me alone. I don't like
		fast women.

	But he embraces her, and ELSA begins to nibble at his ear.

		                ELSA
		And I hate arrogant men.

	INDY smiles slyly as they fall to the bed.


	EXT. VENICE CANAL - DAY

	A GONDOLIER SINGS as he steers his gondola carrying two passengers past
	Indy's window.


	INT. INDY'S BEDROOM - DAY

	INDY lies on top of ELSA, kissing her. He stops for a moment as he hears the
	GONDOLIER SINGING.

		                INDY
		Ahh, Venice.

	ELSA reaches up and pulls him back down to her.


	EXT. ROAD THROUGH THE AUSTRIAN MOUNTAINS - DAY

	A Mercedes-Benz glides through the sharp mountain curves. This is
	SUPERIMPOSED OVER A MAP that charts their course from Venice across Austria
	toward Salzburg.


	EXT. CASTLE IN THE AUSTRIAN MOUNTAINS - DAY

	Storm clouds darken the skies. THUNDER EXPLODES in the
	distance; lightning flashes. The Mercedes-Benz drives into the courtyard of the
	formidable stone castle.

		                INDY
		What do you know about this
		place?

		                ELSA
		I know the Brunwalds are famous
		art collectors.

	INT. MERCEDES-BENZ - DAY

	INDY reaches into the back seat and retrieves his bullwhip.

			ELSA
		What are you going to do?

			INDY
		Don't know. Think of something.

	He glances up to the beret ELSA is wearing. She reaches up and adjusts it.


	INT. CASTLE ENTRANCE HALL - DAY

	A BUTLER walks to the door and opens it to reveal INDY and ELSA standing
	outside in the rain. she now wears Indy's fedora; Indy is wearing Elsa's beret.

			BUTLER
		Yes?

	INDY, followed by ELSA, steps inside, shaking the water from his overcoat. He
	adopts a Scottish accent.

		               INDY
		And not before time! Did you
		intend to leave us standing on
		the doorstep all day? We're
		drenched!

	As INDY says this he pushes his way past the startled BUTLER, pulling a
	handkerchief from the man's pocket. ELSA follows, taking off her coat. INDY
	SNEEZES HARD.

		               INDY
		Now look! I've gone and caught
		a sniffle.

	INDY dabs at his nose with the handkerchief as ELSA looks on in amused
	amazement.

			BUTLER
		      (coldly; with
		       Austrian accent)
		Are you expected?

		               INDY
		Don't take that tone with me, my
		good man. Now buttle off and tell
		Baron Brunwald that Lord Clarence
		MacDonald and his lovely assistant
		are here to view the tapestries.


				                                       (CONT'D)

CONTINUED:
			BUTLER
		Tapestries?

		               INDY
		Dear me, the man is dense. This
		is a castle, isn't it? There are
		tapestries?

		               BUTLER
		This is a castle. And we have
		many tapestries. But if you're a
		Scottish lord, then I am Mickey
		Mouse.

		               INDY
		How dare he?!

	Simultaneously knocking the BUTLER cold with one slug on the jaw. The Butler
	falls against a wall tapestry, sliding down to the floor, out cold.


	INT. CASTLE HALLWAY - DAY

	INDY and ELSA move cautiously and quietly down the wide, vaulted hallway.
	APPROACHING VOICES ARE HEARD. Indy and Elsa creep past a room full of
	NAZI SOLDIERS working around a large table with a map atop it..

	INDY reacts to the sight of them.

			INDY
		        (to ELSA; softly)
		Nazis. I hate these guys.

	INDY and ELSA continue down the hallway. Indy carries a gun in his hand and
	his whip hangs from his belt. He steps to a closed door and listens.

 		              INDY
		This one. I think he's in here.

			ELSA
		How do you know?

	INDY points out an ELECTRICAL WIRE.

		               INDY
		Because it's wired.

	He studies the situation for a moment, then decides to enter one of the other
	doors. He knocks at the doorthere is no response. He looks back at ELSA and
	enters.

INT. CASTLE ROOM - DAY

	The room is dark and empty. INDY throws open the window shutters and looks
	out. RAIN comes down in sheets. There is a wide ledge beneath each window
	but below that is a SHEER DROP. Indy wants to get out onto the window ledge,
	which is several yards away.

			ELSA
		Indy? Indy?

	INDY reassures her.


		               INDY
		Don't worry... this is kid's play.
		I'll be right back.

	He leans out the window and wraps his bullwhip around some wires that protrude
	from the castle wall above the next window.

	He gives the whip a forceful tug to make certain it will hold his weight.


	EXT. THE CASTLE - DAY

	INDY SWINGS from the window to the stone gargoyle.

	CLOSE ON THE WINDOW LEDGE

	A PAIR OF WOODEN SHUTTERS seals the window.

	INDY takes hold of the bullwhip with both hands, pushes off with his feet...
	swings toward the shuttered window with his feet extended... CRASHING
	THROUGH THE WOODEN SHUTTERS as a CLAP OF THUNDER disguises the noise.


	INT. THE ROOM - DAY

	INDY CRASHES THROUGH SHUTTERS AND GLASS into the room. The broken
	shutters hang by their hinges. Rain and cold air whip through the open window.

	No sooner does Indy get to his feet, than a VASE COMES CRASHING DOWN ON
	THE BACK OF HIS HEAD.

	Stunned, INDY sinks to one knee... and Indy's father, PROFESSOR HENRY JONES,
	steps out of the shadows.

			HENRY
		Junior?

	INDY gets to his feet.

			INDY
		      (a reflex)
		Yes, sirl

CONTINUED:

	This reply is a kneejerk reaction on Indy's part. Now they look at each other.

			HENRY
		It is you Junior!

			INDY
		     (an old familiar
		      irritation)
		Don't call me that, please.

			HENRY
		     (amazed)
		But what are you doing here?

			INDY
		I came to get you! What do you
		think? 

	NAZI VOICES ARE HEARD approaching. INDY and HENRY press themselves
	against the wall, Henry still holding the broken vase in his hand.

	INDY steps to the window and looks down. HENRY moves to a lamp, holding the
	vase under the light for a closer look.

			HENRY
		       (sotto, mumbled)
		Late Fourteenth Century, Ming
		Dynasty.

	HENRY is all about the broken vase which he still holds in his hand. Father and
	son get onto crossed lines for a couple of moments.

			HENRY
		Oh, it breaks the heart.

		                 INDY
		    (quietly to himself)
		And the head.
		    (to HENRY, aggrievedly)
		You hit me, Dad!

			HENRY
		     (referring to the
		      vase)
		I'll never forgive myself

			INDY
		       (surprised,
		        misunderstanding)
		Don't worryI'm fine.

			HENRY
		Thank God!


CONTINUED: (2)

	HENRY has clearly been concentrating entirely on the vase... he is examining the
	broken end carefully.

		               HENRY
		... it's fake. See, you can tell
		by the cross section.

	HENRY throws the vase against the wall where it SHATTERS.

		               INDY
		No! Dad, get your stuff. We've
		got to get out of here.

		               HENRY
		Well, I am sorry about your head,
		though. But I thought you were
		one of them.

		               INDY
		Dad, they come in through the
		doors.

			HENRY
		      (laughs)
		Good point.

	INDY steps to the door and stands, listening.

			HENRY
		But better safe than sorry.

	HENRY slides his umbrella through the straps of his bag.

		               HENRY
		Humpfso I was wrong this time.
		But by God, I wasn't wrong when I
		mailed you my Diary. You obviously
		got it.

		               INDY
		I got it and I used it. We found
		the entrance to the catacombs.

			HENRY
		     (excited)
		Through the library?

		               INDY
		Right.

		               HENRY
		I knew it. And the tomb of Sir
		Richard?


CONTINUED: (3)

	INDY nods.

		               INDY
		Found it.

			HENRY
		     (breathless)
		He was actually there? You saw
		him?


		               INDY
		Well, what was left of him.

			HENRY
		      (trembling with
		       anticipation)
		And his shield... the inscription
		on Sir Richard's shield...?

		               INDY
		Alexandretta.
		    (beat)

	It's a great moment in HENRY's life. He turns aside, lost to himself for a
	moment, then turns to INDY with joy.

		               HENRY
		Alexandretta... of course... on
		the pilgrim trail from the Eastern
		Empire. Oh, Junior...

	INDY winces, and would interrupt but suddenly it's not the moment.

			HENRY
		... you did it.


		               INDY
		No, Dad. You did. Forty years.

		               HENRY
		If only I could have been with
		you.

			INDY
		There were rats, Dad.

			HENRY
		Rats?

			INDY
		Yeah. big ones. What do the
		Nazis want with you Dad?

			HENRY
		They want my diary.


CONTINUED: (4)

			INDY
		     (interested)
		Yeah?

	INDY's interest is a moment which becomes important later but for now it passes.

		               HENRY
		I knew I had to get that book as
		far away from me as I possibly
		could.

	INDY's hand moves unconsciously to his pocket. His eyes turn inward.

	                                      INDY
		      (thoughtfully)
		Yeah. . .

	Then... BAMI The door is kicked open and three NAZIS enter. One is an S.S.
	OFFICER. The other two are SOLDIERS with machine guns. HENRY and INDY
	raise their hands.

			S.S. OFFICER
		Doctor Jones!!

			HENRY & INDY
		Yes!!


		               S.S. OFFICER
		I will take the book now.

			INDY/HENRY
		      (simultaneously)
		What book?

			S.S. OFFICER
		     (to INDY)
		You have the Diary in your pocket.

	HENRY laughs genuinely, believing himself to be laughing at the expense of the
	S.S. OFFICER.

		               HENRY
		You doltl Do you think that my
		son would be that stupid that
		he would bring my Diary all the
		way back here?

	At which point an awful thought strikes HENRY.

		               HENRY
		You didn't, did you?
		    (a beat)
		You didn't bring it, did you?


CONTINUED: (5)

			INDY
		Well, uh...

			HENRY
		You did!!


			INDY
		Look, can we discuss this later?

			HENRY
		I should have mailed it to the
		Marx Brothers.

			INDY
		       (overlapping)
		Will you take it easy....!

			HENRY
		Take it easy?! Why do you think
		I sent it home in the first place?
		        (points towards
		        the NAZIS)
		So it wouldn't fall into their
		hands!!

			INDY
		I came here to save you.

			HENRY
		Oh yeah? And who's gonna come to
		save you, Junior??

	INDY's eyes blazes His nostrils flares He's so pissed off, he literally RIPS A
	MACHINE GUN from the hands of one of the startled soldiers... and for a moment
	we think he's going to use it on his dad.

			INDY
		I told you--

	He turns and sprays the room with machine gun fire, cutting all three NAZIS to
	ribbons and blowing them backwards across the room.

			INDY
		--don't call me Junior!

	HENRY looks shocked and horrified.

			HENRY
		Look what you did!!

	Indy grabs him and pushes him ahead.

			HENRY
		     (aghast)
		I can't believe what you just....

	INT. CASTLE HALLWAY - DAY

	INDY leads HENRY down the hallway as he searches for Elsa.

			INDY
		Elsa? Elsa?

	He opens a door and enters:

	INT. FIRST CASTLE ROOM - DAY


	INDY and HENRY rush back into the room where ELSA had been left, only to
	find: A Nazi COLONEL HOLDING ELSA HOSTAGE.

	His name is VOGEL: a vicious-looking, lantern jawed brute. One arm is wrapped
	around Elsa's waist, the other hand presses the muzzle of a LUGER behind her
	ear.

		               VOGEL
		That's far enough Put down the
		gun, Doctor Jones. Put down the
		gun or the Fraulein dies.

		               HENRY
		But she's one of them!

			ELSA
		Indy, please!

			HENRY
		She's a Nazi!

			INDY
		What?!

	INDY  is thrown. He doesn't know what to do. He looks at ELSA, then back to his
	father. Everyone is yelling at once:

			HENRY
		Trust me!


		               ELSA
		Indy, no!

		               VOGEL
		I will kill her!

		               HENRY
		Oh yeah? Go ahead!

		               INDY
		No! Don't Shoot!


CONTINUED:

			HENRY
		        (to Indy)
		Don't worry. He won't.

			ELSA
		Indy, please! Do what he says!

			HENRY
		And don't listen to her!

			VOGEL
		Enough! She diesl

	VOGEL jams the barrel of the luger painfully into ELSA's neck. Elsa SCREAMS.

			INDY
		Wait!  Waitl

	And then Indy gives in. He drops the machine gun to the table and it slides
	across, SHATTERING GLASS. HENRY GROANS audibly.

	VOGEL releases his grip on ELSA and shoves her toward INDY. She is propelled
	directly into his arms. He holds her tightly. She buries her face in his chest.

	                                     ELSA
		I'm sorry.

	INDY comforts her.

	                                     INDY
		No, don't be.

	Her hand slips into his coat pocket and removes the Grail Diary.

	                                     ELSA
		But you should have listened to
		your father.

	She steps back next to VOGEL. INDY is stunned. HENRY gives him his most
	withering look of reprimand.


	INT. BARONIAL ROOM - DAY

	A large baronial room decorated with ancient tapestries and suits of armor.
	Firelightfrom the giant fireplacedances across the ceiling and walls.

	INDY and HENRY are ushered in, hands tied behind back, accompanied by VOGEL
	and ELSA and TWO NAZI GUARDS.

	ELSA crosses the room toward a high-backed chair facing the fireplace. INDY and
	HENRY do not have the advantage of seeing who is sitting in that chair. They
	only see a HAND REACH OUT AND TAKE THE BOOK.


CONTINUED:

			INDY
		        (quietly to HENRY)
		She ransacked her own room and I
		fell for it. How did you know
		she was a Nazi?

		               HENRY
		Umh?

		               INDY
		How did you she was a Nazi?

		               HENRY
		She talks in her sleep.

	INDY nods, and then the statement catches up with him. He looks at HENRY
	with surprise.

		               HENRY
		I didn't trust her. Why did
		you?

		               MAN IN CHAIR
		Because he didn't take my advice.

	The MAN IN THE CHAIR gets to his feet and turns, revealing himself to be...
	WALTER DONOVAN. INDY and HENRY react with stunned expressions.

		               INDY
		Donovan
	
		               DONOVAN
		Didn't I warn you not to trust
		anybody, Doctor Jones?

	DONOVAN smiles benignly and flips through the Grail Diary.

		               HENRY
		I misjudged you WalterI knew
		you'd sell your mother for an
		Etruscan vase.
		But I didn't know you'd sell your
		country and your soul to the slime
		of humanity.

		               DONOVAN
		        (suddenly erupting)
		Doctor Schneider There're pages
		torn out of thisl

	ELSA rushes to DONOVAN's side. she takes the Grail Diary from him. Elsa takes
	a look for herselfthen glances up at Indy.


CONTINUED: (2)

		               ELSA
		This book contained a mapa
		map with no namesprecise
		directions from the unknown city
		to the secret Canyon of the
		Crescent Moon.

			INDY
		So it did.


		               DONOVAN
		Where are these missing pages?
		This maps we must have these
		pages backs

	HENRY gives INDY a look of surprise. Indy smirks.

			ELSA
		        (to Donovan)
		You're wasting your breath. He
		won't tell us. And he doesn't
		have to... it's perfectly obvious
		where the pages are...
		        (looking at Indy)
		... he's given them to Marcus
		Brody.

	HENRY now wears a pained expression.

			HENRY
		        (to Indy)
		Marcus?! You didn't drag poor
		Marcus along, did you? He's not
		up to the challenge.

		               DONOVAN
		He sticks out like a sore thumb.
		We'll find him.

		               INDY
		The hell you will. He's got a
		two-day head-start on you, which
		is more than he needs.
		        (beat)
		Brody's got friends in every town
		and village from here to the Sudan.
		He speaks a dozen languages, knows
		every local custom. He'll blend
		in. Disappear. You'll never see
		him again. With any luck, he's
		got the Grail already.

	HENRY looks amazed and impressed.

	EXT. TRAIN STATION - CITY OF ISKENDERUN - DAY

	BRODY disembarks from the train along with the other PASSENGERS, a cross-
	section of ARABS and TUSKS.

		               BRODY
		Does anyone here speak English?
		Or even ancient Greek?

	A Man in the crowd holds out a cup of water to BRODY.

		               BRODY
		No water, no thank you. No, fish
		make love in it.

	BRODY continues through the crowd past various STREET VENDORS. A Woman
	holds a chicken out to him.

		               BRODY
		Thank you so much. No, I don't
		like that. No, I really don't
		want... No, no, thank you very
		much. No, thank you, madam.
		I'm a vegetarian.


	The Woman walks away, leaving BRODY alone in the crowd.

		               BRODY
		Does anyone understand a word I'm
		saying here?

	SALLAH shoulders his way through the mob toward BRODY.

			SALLAH
		Mister Brodyl

	They meet and hug, then begin to walk.

			BRODY
		Oh, Sallahl What a relief!

			SALLAH
		     (laughs)
		Marcus Brody, sir. And where is
		Indy?

			BRODY
		     (overlapping)
		Oh, he's in Austria. A slight
		detour.

		               SALLAH
		You are on your own?

	A Woman runs in and tugs on BRODY's coat. He waves her away.


CONTINUED:

		               BRODY
		Yes, but don't panic. Everything's
		under control. Have you. . .have
		you arranged our supplies?

		               SALLAH
		Oh, yes, of course. But where
		are we going?

		               BRODY
		Oh, this map will show you. It
		was drawn by, uh...

	BRODY searches in his coat pocket for the map as a SINISTER MAN approaches.

			SINISTER MAN
		Mister Brody?

	BRODY puts the map back in his pocket. The SINISTER MAN clicks his heels and
	bows quickly.

		               SINISTER MAN
		Welcome to Iskenderun. The
		Director of the Museum of
		Antiquities has sent a car for
		you.

	BRODY takes off his hat.

		               BRODY
		Oh, what?... your servant, sir.

			SALLAH
		And I am his.


			SINISTER MAN
		Follow me, please.

	The man turns and joins a SECOND MAN. BRODY and SALLAH follow them.

		               BRODY
		My reputation precedes me.

			SALLAH
		There is no museum in Iskenderun.

	The SECOND MAN overhears SALLAH. He and his companion turn quickly.

			SECOND MAN
		Papers please.

		               SALLAH
		Papers?
		     (laughs)
		Of course.


CONTINUED: (2)

	SALLAH puts Brody's luggage down and glances at BRODY.

			SALLAH
		Run.


	BRODY does not run. SALLAH pats his clothing, searching for his papers.

			BRODY
		Yes.

			SALLAH
		Papers, sir. Got it here.

	SALLAH laughs and pulls out a newspaper.

			SALLAH
		Just finished reading it myself.
		         (laughs; then, to
		          Brody)
		Run!

	BRODY looks confused. SALLAH shows the newspaper to the SECOND MAN.

			BRODY
		Yes.


		              SALLAH
		Egyptian Mail. Morning edition.
		     (to Brody)
		Run!

		              BRODY
		Did you say...? Uh, uh...

	SALLAH puts the newspaper in front of the SECOND MAN's face, then punches
	him through the newspaper.

			SALLAH
		Run!


	The SECOND MAN falls, knocking over a vendor's stand. SALLAH and BRODY
	begin to run. SALLAH knocks the FIRST MAN into another vendor's stand. The
	STAND COLLAPSES on impact.

	SALLAH grabs BRODY and pulls him through the crowded streets.

			SALLAH
		        (to Brody; pointing)
		Okay, okay, quick, quick, quickl
		Hide in that doorl Hide in that
		door!

	SALLAH points to a DARKENED DOORWAY, hung with a curtain, at the top of a
	ramp. BRODY runs up the ramp, throws back the curtain and disappears into
	the darkness.


CONTINUED: (3)

	ThenMETAL DOORS ARE SLAMMED behind Brody and we realize that he has
	actually run into the back of a Nazi TROOP TRUCK.

	SALLAH runs after the Truck until he reaches a wall, then leans against the wall
	dejectedly as the Truck drives away with BRODY inside.


	INT. CASTLE ROOM - DAY

	The room is dark. Ancient, floor-length drapes cover the windows. A HUGE
	FIREPLACE that's nearly large enough for a man to stand upright in dominates
	one wall.

	The NAZI GUARDS have tied INDY and HENRY back-to-back in a pair of chairs.
	ELSA and DONOVAN stand over them. VOGEL enters.

			HENRY
		Intolerable.


		               VOGEL
		Doctor Schneider. Message from
		Berlin. You must return immediately:
		a rally at the Institute of Aryan
		Culture.

		               ELSA
		So?

		               VOGEL
		Your presence on the platform is
		requested... at the highest level.

		               ELSA
		Thank you, Herr Oberst.
		      (to DONOVAN)
		I will meet you at Iskenderun.

		               DONOVAN
		Take this Diary to the Reich
		Museum in Berlin. It will show
		them our progress, ahead of
		schedule. Without a map, I'm
		afraid it's no better than a
		souvenir.

	He hands her the Grail Diary.

			VOGEL
		         (to DONOVAN, meaning
		          Indy and Henry)
		Let me kill them now.


CONTINUED:

		               ELSA
		No. If we fail to recover the
		pages from Brody, we'll need them
		alive.

			DONOVAN
		    (to VOGEL, with a
		     helpless shrug)
		Always do what the doctor orders.

	DONOVAN leads VOGEL out. The NAZI GUARDS follow. Once they are gone,
	ELSA turns to INDY.

		               ELSA
		Don't look at me like thatwe
		both wanted the Grail, I would
		have done anything to get it.
		You would have done the same.

	INDY shakes his head "no."

		               INDY
		I'm sorry you think so.

	She runs her hand down the side of his face. INDY pulls away.

	INDY and HENRY are still tied back-to-back of course. ELSA bends to speak
	quietly into INDY's ear... which is near enough to Henry's ear.

			ELSA
		      (whispers)
		I can't forget... how wonderful
		it was.

		               HENRY
		Thank you. It was rather wonderful.

	She smiles and kisses INDY passionately. HENRY glances back and looks rather
	disappointed.

	VOGEL appears to remind ELSA of her appointment.

		               VOGEL
		Doctor Schneider! Your car is
		waiting.

			ELSA
		     (to INDY, after
		      finishing the kiss)
		That's how Austrians say goodbye.

	ELSA exits. VOGEL stays behind for another moment.


CONTINUED: (2)

		               VOGEL
		And this is how we say goodbye in
		Germany, Doctor Jones.

	VOGEL punches INDY in the jaw. A hard and vicious jab that snaps Indy's head
	around.

			HENRY
		Ohh. . .

	VOGEL exits. INDY shakes his head clear.

			INDY
		      (to himself)
		Ooooh... I like the Austrian way
		better.

			HENRY
		So did I.

		               INDY
		Let's try and get these ropes
		loose. We've got to get to Marcus
		before the Nazis do!

			HENRY
		     (confused)
		You said he had two days' start.
		That he would blend in. Disappear!

		               INDY
		Are you kidding?I made that
		up! You know Marcushe got
		lost once in his own museum!

	Indy and Henry are pulling at the ropes with great urgency.

		               INDY
		Can you try and reach into my
		left jacket pocket?

	HENRY is able to wiggle his hand towards Indy's coat pocket. INDY squirms his
	body around towards Henry's hand.

		               HENRY
		What am I looking for?
	
		               INDY
		My lucky charm.

		               HENRY
		Feels like a cigarette lighter.


CONTINUED: (3)

			INDY
		Try and burn through the ropes.

	HENRY's fingers open the lighter and ignite the flame.

			HENRY
		Very good.

	HENRY yelps as the cigarette lighter burns his hand. He drops the lighter to the
	floor. Henry kicks at the lighter, trying to reach it, but cannot. The rug starts to
	burn. INDY doesn't know it yet.

		               HENRY
		I ought to tell you something.

		               INDY
		Don't get sentimental now Dad
		save it 'til we get out of here.

		               HENRY
		The floor's on fire! See?!

		               INDY
		        (turns and sees)
		What???

		               HENRY
		And the chair.

		               INDY
		All right, movel Move!  Rock
		your Chair.  Do what I do.

	They begin to rock their chair legs, inching their way off the burning carpet.


	EXT. CASTLE - DAY

	as ELSA is driven away. VOGEL and DONOVAN remain behind, flanked by NAZI
	SOLDIERS .

	Another car pulls up and VOGEL holds the door open for DONOVAN who gets into
	the rear seat. A LIEUTENANT approaches with a written message for Donovan.

			LIEUTENANT
		Etwas wichtig, mein Herr.

	DONOVAN puts on his glasses to read the message.

		               DONOVAN
		Well, we have Marcus Brody. But
		more important, we have the map.

	A RADIO OPERATOR steps forward with yet another written message for
	DONOVAN.


CONTINUED:


		               RADIO OPERATOR
		Aus Berlin, mein Herr.

		               DONOVAN
		        (reading)
		"By the personal command of the
		Fuhrer. Secrecy essential to
		success. Eliminate the American
		conspirators."
		        (to VOGEL)
		Germany has declared war on the
		Jones boys.
		        (to DRIVER)
		Los fahren.

	The car drives off.

	INT. CASTLE ROOM - DAY

	INDY and HENRY are still in their chairs, tied back-to-back. Indy tries to
	communicate with Henry, but each time he calls him, the men turn their heads in
	opposite directions.

		               INDY
		Dad!

		               HENRY
		What?

		               INDY
		Dad!

		               HENRY
		What?

		               INDY
		Dad!

	Finally they turn their heads in the same direction.

			HENRY
		What?

			INDY
		Head for the fireplace!

			HENRY
		Oh.


	BANGING, ROCKING and HOPPING their chairs, they work their way INTO THE
	FIREPLACEthe only safe place from the now ROARING FIRE.

CONTINUED:

			INDY
		I think I can get these ropes
		off.

	Indy struggles to free his hands. His foot kicks out and accidentally hits a metal
	grill that operates a Secret Door.

			INDY
		Whoopsl

	The fireplace floor rotates like a Lazy Susan and Indy and his father find
	themselves in the:


	INT. RADIO ROOM - DAY

	where a NAZI RADIOMAN wearing headphones sits at an elaborate panel of dials,
	switches and meters, and a WOMAN stands over a map plotting coordinates.
	Their backs are turned to INDY and HENRY.

	The floor begins to rotate again, and INDY and HENRY find themselves back in:


	INT. CASTLE ROOM - DAY

	inside the fireplace, still tied back-to-back.

			HENRY
		Our situation has not improved.

	INDY glances over his shoulder at HENRY.

			INDY
		Listen Dad... I'm almost free.

	INDY's foot hits the grill again... and the fireplace rotates to:


	INT. RADIO ROOM - DAY

	FOUR NAZI RADIOMEN and the WOMAN are still hard at work with controls and
	coordinates. Suddenly the Woman looks up and spots HENRY and INDY. She
	screams.

			WOMAN
		Alarm!

	Now the RADIOMEN turn to see HENRY and INDY.

			WOMAN
		Schnel!!

	TWO NAZIS draw their revolvers and FIRE SEVERAL SHOTS at INDY and HENRY

	INT. CASTLE ROOM - DAWN

	INDY and HENRY rotate into the room which is now an INFERNO. The carpet,
	drapes and furniture are all ablaze.

		               HENRY
		This is intolerable!

			INDY
		I'm out, Dad!


	INDY finally breaks free. And he immediately begins to untie his father.

			HENRY
		Well done, boy!

	INT. RADIO ROOM - DAY

	All FOUR RADIOMEN now have their guns drawn. They activate the lever and
	begin to rotate through the Secret Door.


	INT. CASTLE ROOM - DAY

	The RADIOMEN appear in the fireplace on the other sidebut there is NO SIGN
	OF INDY AND HENRY.

	The RADIOMEN move cautiously toward the flame, shielding their faces with one
	hand, holding their guns with the other. Is it possible that INDY and HENRY
	escaped through these flames?

	Not a chance.

	They've hidden themselves UP THE CHIMNEY. And now they DROP DOWN,
	BEHIND the RADIOMEN.

	One of the RADIOMEN grabs INDY by the neck. As they struggle they fall against
	the rotating wall and disappear into the next room, leaving a frightened HENRY
	behind.

	HENRY presses against the wall, which rotates again. As he disappears into the
	next room, a DEAD NAZI RADIOMAN swivels into the room. The other NAZIS
	rush forward to him.

	INT. RADIO ROOM - DAY

	INDY picks up a BUST OF HITLER and uses it to jam the rotating wall in place,
	sealing the NAZIS inside the burning room.


	INT. CASTLE HALLWAY- DAY

	Vogel strides purposefully down the hallway. He BARKS an order, and TWO
	MORE NAZIS fall into step with him.

	INT. RADIO ROOM - DAY

	INDY grabs his whip, his leather sack and Henry's case from a table. He hands
	the case to HENRY and they begin to run.

			INDY
		Come on Dad.

	INT. SECRET ROOM - DAY

	INDY and HENRY step into an empty room.

			INDY
		Dead end.

	HENRY looks horrified by what he's been forced to do as INDY searches
	frantically for an exit.

		               INDY
		There's got to be a... a secret
		door around. A passageway or
		something.

	INDY begins to run his hands over the wallsfrantic.

		               HENRY
		I find that if I just sit down
		and think...

	HENRY sits on a chair which tips back, hitting the wall behind it. The floor at
	INDY's feet suddenly begins DROPPING AWAYI

	INDY grabs a railing to keep from falling, but loses his grip and plunges through
	the opening which has formed a SPIRAL STAIRCASE. He rolls down the stairs.

			INDY
		Dad! 

			HENRY
	                   ... the solution presents itself.

	HENRY follows INDY down the staircase.


	INT. CAVERN/UNDERGROUND HARBOR - DAY

	The stairway deposits Indy and Henry into an enormous WATERY CAVERN
	beneath the mountain on which the castle was built.

	A full-scale Nazi BOAT DOCK has been built inside the cavern. We see
	MOTORBOATS, GUNBOATS, SUPPLY BOATS, etc.

		                  INDY
		Great. More boats.


CONTINUED:

	INDY boards one of the motorboats and STARTS THE MOTOR.

		               HENRY
		Would you say this has been just
		another typical day for you? Huh?

	HENRY tosses his case at INDY who catches it and angrily throws it back to his
	father.

			INDY
		        (ironically)
		Ooofl No! It's been better than
		most.

	INDY moves back to the dock and pushes the boat away. HENRY looks confused.

			INDY
		Come on, Dad. Come onl

		               HENRY
		What about the boat? We're not
		going on the boat?


	INT. SECRET ROOM - DAY

	VOGEL and the NAZI SOLDIERS enter the room and spot the spiral staircase
	leading below. They quickly descend the stairs.


	INT. CAVERN/UNDERGROUND HARBOR - DAY

	as VOGEL and the NAZI SOLDIERS rush to the dock. Vogel sees that a motorboat
	is missing. He orders the Nazi Soldiers into a boat.

		               VOGEL
		Sie alle ins Boat. Schnell!

	CAMERA PULLS BACK TO REVEAL a large box which suddenly BREAKS APART
	as INDY, now on a motorbike with HENRY in the sidecar, ROARS PAST THE
	DOCK, hitting TWO NAZI SOLDIERS who scream as they fall into the river.

	VOGEL screams after INDY and HENRY as they drive off.

	STRAIGHT CUT TO:

	EXT. COUNTRY ROAD - DAY

	INDY looks pleased as he drives the motorbike along the road, but HENRY
	appears worried.

	                                     INDY
		Ha!

	FOUR NAZI SOLDIERS ON MOTORCYCLES

	They chase down the road after INDY and HENRY.

	INDY turns the motorbike down a smaller, dusty tree-lined road. HENRY gasps
	as he is jostled about in the sidecar. One of the NAZI SOLDIERS gives chase along
	a higher road running in the same direction.


	EXT. ROAD BARRICADE - DAY

	INDY approaches the barricade from one direction as one of the NAZI SOLDIERS
	approaches from a higher road.

	A GUARD steps from the road station and calls to the vehicles as INDY and
	HENRY SMASH THROUGH THE BARRICADE.

		               GUARD
		Halt! Halt!

	THE NAZI SOLDIER rides his motorcycle through the other side of the barrier--
	IT SHATTERS.

	INDY AND HENRY

	INDY grabs at a FLAGPOLE as they roar pastit snaps off in his hand.

	The NAZI SOLDIER drives his motorcycle toward INDY and HENRY. He
	unshoulders his machine gun.

	INDY uses the broken flagpole as a lance and knocks the NAZI SOLDIER from his
	motorcycle.

	THE RIDERLESS MOTORCYCLE

	drives on toward the other NAZI SOLDIERS now approaching the guardhouse,
	COLLIDING WITH TWO OF THEM.

	The remaining NAZI SOLDIER maneuvers his motorcycle around his fallen
	comrades and continues the chase.


	INDY AND HENRY

	As the remaining NAZI SOLDIER rides alongside their motorbike he cocks his gun,
	preparing to fire.

	INDY quickly jams the remaining portion of the flagpole through the spokes of the
	Nazi's front wheel.

	The NAZI SOLDIER'S MOTORCYCLE FLIPS THREE TIMES, throwing him high into
	the air.


CONTINUED:

	INDY glances back and smiles, but the smile fades as he looks forward again to
	see a sign at a CROSSROAD. Arrows pointing in opposite directions indicate the
	way to BERLIN or VENEDIG.

	Indy starts down the road marked VENEDIG.

			HENRY
		Stop!

			INDY
		What?

			HENRY
		Stop! Stop!

	The motorbike skids to a stop.


		               HENRY
		You're going the wrong Way!  We
		have to get to Berlin!

			INDY
		     (pointing towards
		      Venedig)
		Brody's this way.

		               HENRY
		My Diary's in Berlin.

		               INDY
		You don't need the Diary, Dad.
		Marcus has the map.

		               HENRY
		There is more in the Diary than
		just the map.

		               INDY
		All right Dadtell me.

		               HENRY
		Well, he who finds the Grail must
		face the final challenge.

		               INDY
		What final challenge?

		               HENRY
		Three devices of such lethal
		cunning.

		               INDY
		Booby traps?


CONTINUED: (2)

		               HENRY
		Oh, yes. But I found the clues
		that will safely take us through,
		in the Chronicles of St. Anselm.

		               INDY
		But what are they? Can't you
		remember?

		               HENRY
		I wrote them down in my Diary so
		that I wouldn't have to remember

		               INDY
		Half the German Army's on our
		tail and you want me to go to
		Berlin? Into the lion's den?

		               HENRY
		Yes! The only thing that matters
		is the Grail.

		               INDY
		What about Marcus?

		               HENRY
		Marcus would agree with me.

		               INDY
		Two selfless martyrs. Jesus
		Christl

	HENRY slaps him across the face. INDY is rocked to his foundations, not by any
	means entirely by the blow itself.

		               HENRY
		That's for blasphemy. The quest
		for the Grail is not archaeology.
		It's a race against evil.
		If it is captured by the Nazis,
		the armies of darkness will march
		all over the face of the earth.
		Do you understand me?

		               INDY
		This is an obsession Dad. I never
		understood it. Never. Neither
		did Mom.

		               HENRY
		Oh yes, she did. Only too well.
		Unfortunately she kept her illness
		from me until all I could do was
		mourn her.

	EXT. CROSSROADS - DAY

	Arrows point in opposite directions to VENICE and BERLIN. The CAMERA MOVES
	IN on the portion of the sign reading BERLIN.


	EXT. CITY SQUARE - BERLIN - NIGHT

	A Nazi Rallya book-burning is in process.

	The mound of burning books is ten feet tall and growing by the minute as College
	Students and Nazi Brownshirts continually toss more books onto the fire.

	Flags, banners and standards displaying the swastika are waved rhythmically
	from side to side in a motion that echoes the mounting frenzy of the enormous
	crowd.

	INDY and HENRY walk toward the Square. Indy wears the uniform of a Nazi
	Soldier. He is now buttoning up the tunicwhich happens to be several sizes
	too big.

			HENRY
		My boy, we are Pilgrims in an
		unholy land.

	Then... Indy sees something that makes him stop in his tracks. WE PAN ALONG
	HIS LINE OF SIGHT to:

	THE PODIUM

	where high-ranking Officers of the Third Reich stand flanking ADOLF HITLER as
	they oversee the rally.


	ANOTHER ANGLE

	ELSA is walking away in an open area, background of torches, vehicles, Nazi
	Officers... one of whom is now none other than INDY, coming up to her before she
	knows he is there. His voice is quiet and tough, his eyes hard.

	                                      INDY
		Fraulein Doctor. Where is it?

	Still startled, her reaction makes it clear that Indy is even now a lover in her
	thoughts.

	                                      ELSA
		How did you get here?

	                                      INDY
		Where is it? I want it.

	INDY pushes ELSA against a column and begins to search her clothing for the
	Diary. He pulls the book from Elsa's pocket.


CONTINUED:

		               ELSA
		You came back for the book?
		Whv?

		               INDY
		My father didn't want it
		incinerated.

	She understands him. It's as though he slapped her.

		               ELSA
		Is that what you think of me?
		I believe in the Grail, not the
		Swastika.

			INDY
		      (vicious)
		Yet you stood up to be counted
		with the enemy of everything the
		Grail stands forwho gives a
		damn what you think?


			ELSA
		     (hard and fast)
		You do.

	Now it's as though she'd slapped him back. His hands fly to her neck.

			INDY
		All I have to do is squeeze.

			ELSA
		All I have to do is scream.

	It's a standoff emotionally. He knows he'd never do it. she knows it too. And
	the same goes for screaming.

	INDY releases her and backs away. she looks at him with a lover's pain. He
	moves over to HENRY.

			INDY
		I've got it. Let's get the hell
		out of here.

	They move off and almost run headlong into HITLER and his entire entourage
	coming down from the Podium. 50 kids push their autograph books for Hitler's
	signature.

	HITLER pauses to sign them. Hitler looks Indy's way. They make eye contact. It
	only lasts a moment but the moment is electric.

	HITLER breaks the spell by taking the Grail Diary from him, opens it to the first
	page and signs his autograph. He hands it back and moves on.

	EXT. AIRFIELD - BERLIN, GERMANY- DAY

	Indy's motorcycle pulls up to the main terminal.


	INT. TERMINAL BUILDING - DAY

	A Plainclothes Agent distributes leaflets bearing HENRY'S PICTURE to Nazi
	Soldiers inside the terminal.

	HENRY leans in a doorway reading a newspaper as INDY enters down the stairs
	and taps Henry's shoulder.

	They begin to walk toward the boarding gates.

		               HENRY
		What did you get?

		               INDY
		I don't know. The first available
		flight out of Germany.

		               HENRY
		Good.

	INDY and HENRY show their papers to the Boarding Guards, then join the line of
	passengers, which has already begun to move toward a:


	MOORED ZEPPELIN

	Ten stories tall and longer than two football fields: Flying in the grand tradition!


	INT. THE ZEPPELIN - PASSENGER COMPARTMENT - DAY

	The Zeppelin is about to take off. INDY and HENRY make themselves comfortable
	in one of the compartments.

		               INDY
		Well, we made it.

	HENRY looks over his newspaper at INDY.

		               HENRY
		When we're airborne, with Germany
		behind us, then I'll share that
		sentiment.

		               INDY
		Relax.

	But INDY looks out the window and is suddenly concerned when he sees:
	VOGEL AND A GESTAPO AGENT
	rushing across the tarmac toward the Zeppelin.

		             VOGEL
		Nicht zumachen! Wir steigen ein!

	INDY

	sits back in his chair, looks to HENRY, now reading his newspaper.

	A STEWARD enters and sets a bowl of nuts on the table in front of INDY and
	HENRY, then continues down the aisle of passengers. Indy follows after the
	Steward. He puts his arm around the Steward's shoulder and together they walk
	up a flight of stairs.

	VOGEL

	now walks up the aisle. He approaches a MALE PASSENGER hidden behind a
	newspaper. VOGEL uses his walking stick to lower the newspaper and show the
	Passenger the leaflet with Henry's photograph.

			VOGEL
		Haben sie disen Mann gesehen?

	The Passengers at the table shake their heads in the negative. VOGEL shows the
	picture to other Passengers.

			FEMALE PASSENGER
		Nein.

			INDY (O.S.)
		Fahrscheine, bitte.

			MALE PASSENGER
		Nein.

	VOGEL turns to see:

	INDY

	WEARING THE HAT AND JACKET OF THE CHIEF STEWARD.

			MALE PASSENGER (O.S.)
		Ich habe ihn night gesehen.

			INDY
		Tickets please.

	The Passengers do not react to the request, made in English.

			INDY
		Fahrscheine meine Dame. Bitte.

	VOGEL

	approaches HENRY, still hidden behind his newspaper. Again, VOGEL uses his
	walking stick to lower the paper, revealing Henry's face.

			VOGEL
		Guten Tag, Herr Jones.

	Now INDY, still playing the role of Steward, asks VOGEL for his ticket.

			INDY
		Fahrscheine meine Herr.

			VOGEL
		Weg.

			INDY
		Tickets please.

	HENRY looks confused.

			VOGEL
		      (in German)
		Was?



	VOGEL glances up and recognizes INDYwho quickly punches Vogel in the face,
	knocking him toward the window. In another quick move, Indy TOSSES HIM OUT
	THE WINDOW onto the tarmac below.

	Shocked Passengers blink in bewilderment.

			INDY
		     (in German; with a
		      shrug)
		No ticket.

	Everyone else with a ticket quickly produces it and waves it in Indy's face.


	EXT. AIRFIELD TARMAC - DAY

	VOGEL gets to his knees as the huge Zeppelin rises into the sky above him,
	revealing an airplane attached to the belly of the airship. Vogel shakes his fist at
	the rising Zeppelin.

			VOGEL
		Du wirst nochmal boren von mir!

	INT. ZEPPELIN - DAY

	INDY and HENRY together again in their compartment.

		                HENRY
		You know, sharing your adventures
		is an interesting experience.

CONTINUED:

			INDY
		        (meaning ELSA)
		That's not all we shared. It's
		disgraceful. You're old enough to
		be her fa---er, her grandfather!

		               HENRY
		Well, I'm as human as the next
		man.

		               INDY
		I was the next man.

		               HENRY
		       (laughs)
		Ships that pass in the night...

	HENRY opens his Diary and begins to thumb through it.

		               INDY
		Do you remember the last time we
		had a quiet drink? I had a milk
		shake.

		               HENRY
		Hmmm... What did we talk about?

		               INDY
		We didn't talk. We never talked.

		               HENRY
		And do I detect a rebuke?

		               INDY
		A regret. It was just the two of
		us, Dad. It was a lonely way to
		grow up. For you, too. If you
		had been an ordinary, average
		father like the other guys' dads,
		you'd have understood that.

		               HENRY
		Actually, I was a wonderful father.

			INDY
		When?


	HENRY looks up from his Diary.

		               HENRY
		Did I ever tell you to eat up?
		Go to bed? Wash your ears? Do
		your homework? No. I respected
		your privacy and I taught you self-
		reliance.


CONTINUED: (2)


		               INDY
		What you taught me was that I was
		less important to you than people
		who had been dead for five hundred
		years in another country. And I
		learned it so well that we've
		hardly spoken for twenty years.

		               HENRY
		You left just when you were
		becoming interesting.

		               INDY
		Dad, how can you --?

			HENRY
		        (interrupting)
		Very well. I'm here now.

	He closes the Diary and leans back in his seat.

		               HENRY
		What do you want to talk about?
		Hmmm?

	INDY stutters uncomfortably as HENRY stares at him, waiting for a response.

			INDY
		        (laughs)
		Well... I can't think of anything.

		               HENRY
		Then what are you complaining
		about?
		        (laughs)
		Look, we have work to do. When
		we get to Alexandretta we will
		face three challenges.
		        (he reads from the
		         Diary)
		"First, the breath of God. Only
		the penitent man will pass.
		Second, the Word of God, only in
		the footsteps of God will he
		proceed. Third, the Path of God,
		only in the leap from the lion's
		head will he prove his worth. "

		               INDY
		What does that mean?

			HENRY
		        (laughs)
		I don't know. We'll find out.


CONTINUED: (3)


	Sunlight falls across the table from the window. INDY reaches for the drink. The
	bar of sunlight turns like the hand of a clock over the tabletop across the drinks.

	We see INDY puzzled. Only for a moment.

		               INDY
		They're turning around. They're
		taking us back to Germany.


	INT. FRAMEWORK OF ZEPPELIN - DAY

	INDY and his father emerge from the hatchway into the belly of the Zeppelin.
	The Zeppelin's elaborate metal framework is exposed.

	INDY and HENRY hurry down the catwalk until arriving at a PAIR OF
	DOORWAYS framed into the Zeppelin's outer skin.

		               INDY
		Well, I thought it would take
		them a lot longer to figure out
		the radio was dead. Come on,
		Dad. Move!

	Then INDY opens the doors. We see plenty of blue sky and white clouds. We also
	see a small BIPLANE that is suspended from the Zeppelin by a HOOK & CRANE
	DEVICE.

		               INDY
		Come on, Dad. Come on!

	EXT. AIRPLANE - DAY

	INDY climbs into the cockpit of the Biplane as HENRY takes the tail gunner's
	seat.

			HENRY
		       (with delight)
		I didn't know you could fly a
		plane.

		               INDY
		Fly--yes. Land--no.


	INT. THE BIPLANE - DAY

	INDY turns in his seat to give HENRY the "thumbs up." Henry smiles valiantly
	and points down to the ground.

	Then they both become aware of a STRANGE SOUND in the skies behind them.
	Something between a ROAR and a WAIL.
	TWO MESSERSCHMIDT FIGHTER BOMBERS

	streak out of the clouds and race across the sky.


	INDY AND HENRY

	shrink in their seats as the MESSERSCHMIDTS (going three times as fast as they
	are) SCREAM past on either side.

		               INDY
		Dad, you're gonna have to use the
		machine gun. Get it ready.

	HENRY turns and grips the MOUNTED MACHINE GUN with a perplexed
	expression.

			INDY
		        (turning; pointing)
		Eleven o'clock!

	HENRY pulls out his watch.

		               INDY
		Dadeleven o'clock!!

		               HENRY
		What happens at eleven o'clock?

	INDY uses his arm to demonstrate that he's referring to a direction and not a
	time.

			INDY
		        (frustrated)
		Twelveeleventen. Eleven
		o'clock. Fire!

	HENRY doesand the EXPLODING GUN nearly shakes him out of his seat.

	Indy's slow speed and small size works to his advantage. The speeding
	Messerschmidts continually overshoot him, WHIZZING past in a blurmaking
	wide turns miles away in the sky.

	HENRY has one of the Messerschmidts in his sight. He pulls back on the trigger
	--RATTA-A-TAT-TAT!  RATTA-A-TAT-TAT!

	The Messerschmidt banks to the left, but HENRY keeps it in his gun sight. Henry
	swings the gun around, inadvertently CUTTING HIS OWN REAR STABILIZER IN
	HALF.

		               INDY
		Dad, are we hit?!

			HENRY
		More or less.

CONTINUED:


			HENRY
		Son, I'm sorry. They got us.

	INDY looks back at the missing tail section, then at his father.

	The plane begins to go down. INDY struggles to control its descent.

			INDY
		Hang on, Dads We're going in!

	HENRY slumps down fearfully in his seat.


	EXT. A FIELD - DAY

	The wheels of the plane touch down. OUT OF CONTROL, the PLANE SKIDS and
	CRASHES first into a corral of goats and then into the farmhouse beyond sending
	a cloud of dust into the air.

	As INDY pulls himself from the cockpit:

			HENRY
		        (sarcastic)
		Nice landing.

			INDY
		Thanks.


	Suddenly, INDY's attention is directed to:


	TWO SCREAMING MESSERSCHMIDTS

	coming in low. Guns BLAZING.

	As BULLETS EXPLODE around them, INDY and HENRY jump over a stone
	barricade. Henry, frightened, grabs at Indy.

		               HENRY
		Those people are trying to kill
		us!

			INDY
		I know, Dadl

			HENRY
		It's a new experience for me.

			INDY
		It happens to me all the time.


	EXT. ROAD - DAY

	An OLD MAN kneels at his car repairing a rear tire.

	THE MAN

	turns to the wheel, the hubcap in his hands. Suddenly the wheel moves forward,
	startling the Old Man.


	INT. THE CAR - TRAVELING - DAY

	INDY has the throttle down, both hands tightly gripping the steering wheel.
	HENRY is a very nervous passenger.

	INDY sees a LOW-FLYING MESSERSCHMIDT coming up behind him in the SIDE
	MIRROR.

	As the Messerschmidt ROARS by overhead, BULLETS EXPLODE around them,
	narrowly missing the car.

		               HENRY
		This is intolerable!

		               INDY
		This could be close.


	EXT. THE ROAD - LONG SHOT - DAY

	The car races toward a TUNNEL that cuts through a steep MOUNTAINSIDE.

	The Messerschmidt bears down on Indy's car, machine guns CHATTERING.

	The car ENTERS the tunnel. The Messerschmidt cannot pull up in time. It
	SLAMS into the MOUTH OF THE TUNNEL, SHEARING OFF its WINGS.


	INT. THE TUNNEL - DAY

	The FLAMING FUSELAGE continues to ROCKET through the tunnel like a bullet
	down the muzzle of a gun. SPARKS fly as its belly SCRAPES against the
	pavement and the sides of the tunnel.


	INT. THE CAR - DAY

	Indy and Henry look over their shoulders to see this wingless BALL OF FIRE
	gaining on them; about to overtake them.

			HENRY
		Faster, boy --faster!


	EXT. THE ROAD - OTHER SIDE OF THE MOUNTAIN - DAY

	The car exits the tunnel at top speed and veers off the
	road. The flaming Messerschmidt fuselage shoots past and
	EXPLODES in the middle of the road.

	INT. THE CAR - DAY

	As the car emerges safely from the flames, Henry wipes the sweat from his brow.

			HENRY
		Well, they don't come any closer
		than that!

	HENRY looks out the windshield and sees the second Messerschmidt SCREAMING
	out of the sky toward them.


	EXT. THE ROAD - LONG SHOT - DAY

	The MESSERSCHMIDT drops its single UNDER-FUSELAGE BOMB. It EXPLODES in
	the road directly ahead of the car, missing it by only several feet.

	THE CAR

	FALLS INTO THE HOLE made by the bomb.

	DISSOLVE TO:


	EXT. ROAD - DAY

	INDY climbs out of the car, still in the bomb crater. He turns back to HENRY.

		               INDY
		Dad, he's coming back.

	INDY and HENRY run down the mountainside to:


	A DESERTED MEDITERRANEAN BEACH - DAY

	INDY and HENRY run to the shoreline. Indy reaches for his gun, tucked in his
	pants. He opens the chamberthe GUN HAS NO BULLETS.


	THE MESSERSCHMIDT

	swings around and is coming in for another pass.


	INDY AND HENRY

	exchange a wordless glance. They don't even think about running: there is no
	place to run to. HENRY hands his case to INDY.

	Holding his umbrella, HENRY suddenly spins around and runs screaming and
	shouting into A FLOCK OF SEA GULLS...

	THE SEA GULLS take to the wing in flight. Thousands of them.

	INDY

	Bullets kick up sand leading up to him... then

	THE MESSERSCHMIDT AND THE SEA GULLS meet in midair. MASSACRE! Sea
	gulls are shredded by the Messerschmidt's whirling propeller blades into a
	FEATHERY WHITE PUREE that SPLATTERS against the cockpit and CLOGS THE
	ENGINE.

	ENGINE SPUTTERS... STALLS... Silence. The Messerschmidt falls from the skies
	and EXPLODES in an OFF CAMERA SOUND EFFECT.

	INDY stands as beforestunneda statue.

	HENRY walks back to INDY.

		               HENRY
		I suddenly remembered Charlemagne.
		"Let my armies be the rocks and the
		trees and the birds in the sky."
		       (he chuckles)

	INDY wears a proud expression as he watches HENRY walk down the beach.


	EXT. MOSQUE - DAY

	FADE IN TITLE: "REPUBLIC OF HATAY"

	FADE OUT TITLE.


	EXT. COURTYARD OF SULTAN'S PALACE - ISKENDERUN - DAY

	The SULTAN is seated in his royal chair, flanked by WALTER DONOVAN and
	VOGEL and surrounded by his minions.

	DONOVAN holds the missing Grail Diary pages.

		               DONOVAN
		These pages are taken from Professor
		Jones' diary, Your Highness. And
		they include a map that pinpoints
		the exact location of the Grail.

	DONOVAN and the SULTAN walk together through an archway.

		               DONOVAN
		As you can see, the Grail is all
		but in our hands.
		      (beat)
		However, Your Highness, we
		would not think of crossing your
		soil without your permission,
		nor of removing the Grail from
		your borders without suitable
		compensation.


CONTINUED:


		               SULTAN
		What have you brought?

		               VOGEL
		Bring den Schatzl

	TWO NAZI SOLDIERS bring forward a HUGE STEAMER TRUNK. They open the lid
	and begin to empty it of its contents:

	Gold and silver objects of every description.

		               DONOVAN
		Precious valuables, Your Highness,
		"donated" by some of the finest
		families in all of Germany.

	The SULTAN gets up from his chair and walks toward the trunk. He goes right
	past it and begins to inspect the Nazi staff car parked nearby.

		               SULTAN
		Rolls-Royce Phantom Two. 4.3
		litre, 30 horsepower, six cylinder
		engine, with Stromberg Downdraft
		carburetor.

	The SULTAN points to the engine under the hood.

		               SULTAN
		Can go from zero to 100 kilometres
		an hour in 12.5 seconds. And I
		even like the color.

			DONOVAN
		       (after a beat)
		The keys are in the ignition,
		Your Highness.

		               SULTAN
		You shall have camels, horses, an
		armed escort, provisions, desert
		vehiclesand tanksl

			DONOVAN
		You're welcome.

	Somebody else is also taking note...and we see that it is KAZIM, the spy at the
	court.

	ELSA is revealed coming down the stairs toward DONOVAN and VOGEL.

	                                     ELSA
		We have no time to lose. Indiana
		Jones and his father have escaped.

	EXT. ISKENDERUN STREET - DAY

	SALLAH drives his car through the crowded streets, INDY beside him and HENRY
	in the back seat.

		               SALLAH
		We go this way.

	SALLAH waves his arms and shouts to a CAMEL HERDER.

		               SALLAH
		Get that camel out of the way!

			INDY
		What happened to Marcus, Sallah?

			SALLAH
		      (overlapping)
		Ah, they set out across the desert
		this afternoon. I believe they
		took Mister Brody with them.

	HENRY removes his hat and hits INDY with it.

		               HENRY
		Now they have the map! And in
		this sort of race, there's no
		silver medal for finishing second.


	EXT. DESERT VALLEY - DAY

Elsa and Donovan's partyconsisting of a SUPPLY TRUCK, OPEN CAR, TUhKISH
SOLDIERS RIDING CAMELS, SPARE HORSES AND A TANK AND VARIOUS OTHER
VEHICLESall moving along through the ramble of this box canyon.

ELSA, DONOVAN and VOGEL travel in the open car. The TANK is a vintage World
War I model with enormous treads. The Turkish soldiers wear native dress and
carry both carbines and sabers.

BRODY sits alongside ELSA in the rear of the car carrying DONOVAN. Donovan
hands a canteen back to him.

		               DONOVAN
		Care to wet your whistle, Marcus?

			BRODY
		I'd rather spit in your face.
		But as I haven't got any spit...

	VOGEL snatches the canteen away from BRODY before he can drink.

		               VOGEL
		We must be within three or four
		miles. Otherwise we are off the
		map.


CONTINUED:


	He hands the map to ELSA, drinks from the canteen, and hands that back to
	DONOVAN.

		               DONOVAN
		Well, Marcus, we are on the brink
		of the recovery of the greatest
		artifact in the history of mankind.

		               BRODY
		You're meddling with powers you
		cannot possibly comprehend.

	HENRY and SALLAH are at INDY's side as he views Donovan's party in the
	distance. Parked nearby is a CAR containing all of their supplies.

		               INDY
		Ah, I see Brody. He seems okay.
		They've got a tank. Six-pound
		gun.

	Then Donovan notices a reflection from the hills.

	What he sees is:


	THE SUN REFLECTING OFF THE LENSES OF INDY'S BINOCULARS

			HENRY
		What do you think you're doing?!
		Get down!

		               INDY
		Dad, we're well out of range.

	At that moment the tank FIRES A SHELL in their direction.

	It WHISTLES overhead and BLOWS UP THE PARKED CAR. INDY, HENRY and
	SALLAH cover their heads as automobile fragments rain down upon them.

		               SALLAH
		That car belonged to my brother-
		in-law.

			INDY
		      (gesturing to the
		       others)
		Come on--come on!


	EXT. DESERT VALLEY - DAY

		               VOGEL
		I can't see anyone up there.


CONTINUED:

		               DONOVAN
		Maybe it wasn't even Jones.

		               ELSA
		No. It's him all right. He's
		here somewhere.

			DONOVAN
		      (to VOGEL)
		Put Brody in the tank.

	KAZIM peers over a rock, pointing his rifle at the group below.

			DONOVAN
		      (to ELSA)
		Well, in this sun, without
		transportation, they're as good
		as dead.

	BULLETS EXPLODE off the vehicles and cliff. DONOVAN and ELSA duck.

	A NAZI SOLDIER falls from the tank as BULLETS EXPLODE around him.

	KAZIM'S MEN, BRETHREN OF THE CRUCIFORM SWORD, continue to FIRE. ELSA
	and DONOVAN take cover beside the parked car.

		               DONOVAN
		It's Jones, all right.


	ANGLE ON INDY'S GROUP

	INDY and HENRY, followed by SALLAH, take cover behind a rock to watch
	Kazim's Men and the Nazi Troops exchanging fire below them.

		               HENRY
		Now, who are all these people?

		               INDY
		Who cares? As long as they're
		keeping Donovan busy. Dad, you
		stay here while Sallah and I
		organize some transportation.

	CUT BACK to the action. The BRETHREN are firing at the
	DONOVAN party and are being fired on by the Donovan party.

	TWO NAZI SOLDIERS throw HAND GRENADES into the cliffs. They EXPLODE,
	killing one of Kazim's Brethren.

	The battle continuesa fierce exchange of GUNSHOTS, GRENADES and
	MACHINE GUN FIRE with losses on both sides.

	INDY AND SALLAH

	crouch behind a rock watching as men on both sides of the battle run amongst
	camels and horses.

			INDY
		I'm going after those horses.

			SALLAH
		I'll take the camels.

			INDY
		I don't need camels.

			SALLAH
		But, Indy

			INDY
		No camels!


	DONOVAN AND ELSA

	They look down at KAZIM who lies mortally wounded on the ground at their feet.
	ELSA looks saddened.

			DONOVAN
		      (re KAZIM)
		Who is he?

		               KAZIM
		A messenger from God. For the
		unrighteous, the Cup of Life
		holds everlasting damnation.

	KAZIM dies.


	INDY

	leaps atop a TURKISH SOLDIER on horseback, pulling the man and the horse to
	the ground. A SECOND TURK comes to assist his comrade; INDY mounts the
	horse, knocking both Turks to the ground.


	INT. THE TANK - DAY

	BRODY has been left alone in the tank. HENRY climbs down into the tank and
	taps Brody on the shoulder, startling him.

		               HENRY
		Marcus!

		               BRODY
		Arghhh! Oh!


CONTINUED:

	They exchange an old University Club toast, swinging their arms at one another
	and missing. Then HENRY flaps his arms and tugs his ears.

			HENRY
		"Genius of the Restoration"

	Now BRODY tugs his ears, flaps his arms and touches his head.

			BRODY
		"aid our own resuscitation!"

	They exchange a handshake.

			BRODY
		Henryl What are you doing here?!

			HENRY
		It's a rescue, old boys Come on.


	As HENRY starts to climb out of the tank, TWO NAZI SOLDIERS DROP DOWN from
	above, their Lugers drawn. They are followed by VOGEL.

			VOGEL
		       (re HENRY)
		Search him.

	The NAZI SOLDIERS point their guns at HENRY and BRODY.

			VOGEL
		       (to HENRY)
		What is in this book? That
		miserable little Diary of yours!

	VOGEL removes a glove and slaps HENRY with it.

			VOGEL
		Here's the map. The book is
		useless, and yet you come all the
		way back to Berlin to get it.
		Why? 

	He slaps HENRY again.

			VOGEL
		What are you hiding?

	Another slap.

			VOGEL
		What does the Diary tell you that
		it doesn't tell us?!

	VOGEL reaches out to slap HENRY yet again, but Henry grabs his arm, stopping
	him.


CONTINUED: (2)

		               HENRY
		It tells me that goose-stepping
		morons like yourself should try
		reading books instead of burning
		them.

	DONOVAN appears at the turret cover.

		               DONOVAN
		Colonel? Jones is getting away.

		               VOGEL
		        (indicating HENRY)
		I think not, Herr Donovan.


	EXT. TANK - DAY

		               DONOVAN
		Not that Jonesthe other Jones!

		               NAZI SOLDIER
		Herr Colonel!


	EXT. DESERT VALLEY - DAY

	INDY rides away on one horse, leading three others as he goes.

	SALLAH approaches on horseback leading five camels.

		               INDY
		Sallah, I said no camels! That's
		five camels. Can't you Count?

		               SALLAH
		Compensation for my brother-in-
		law's car. Indy, your father and
		Brody

		               INDY
		Where's my father?

		               SALLAH
		They have them. In the belly of
		that steel beast.

	INDY and SALLAH charge forward leading their horses and camels.

	Then VOGEL commands the Tank Driver to give chase.


	INT. TANK - DAY

	VOGEL shouts to the Tank Driver.

			VOGEL
		Fire!


	EXT. DESERT VALLEY - DAY


	The tank starts firing at INDY on horseback. Indy zigs and zags as the tank fires
	two rounds at Indy, barely missing him. Each time Indy emerges from the plume
	of desert dust, hanging like a toadstool in the air.


	INT. TANK- DAY

	HENRY and BRODY hold their hands over their ears.


	EXT. DESERT VALLEY - DAY

	DONOVAN shouts orders to the Troops. INDY is followed by various vehicles in
	the caravan.

	INDY notices that the side gun that is now firing at him can only pivot so far.
	Indy makes a mental note of this and while riding right in front of the tank,
	turns his horse completely around, 180 degrees. The tank starts to follow.


	POV THROUGH THE VIEWING PORT

	VOGEL watches the ground turning 180 degrees as he tries to catch up with
	INDY.

	Cleverly, INDY has turned the tank directly into a head-on
	collision course with some of the pursuit vehicles and a Kubelwagon.

	The tank and the Kubelwagon smash into each other, the German military sedan
	becoming lodged between the treads while blocking the front view and any use of
	the six-pound cannon on the turret.

	INDY, meanwhile, leans down on his horse, scooping up a stone from the wall of
	a culvert. He reigns his horse, paralleling the tank, as everyone scurries about
	inside, looking through viewing ports, trying to figure out exactly where Indy is.


	INT. TANK- DAY

	VOGEL shouts to the Gunner.

	                                      VOGEL
		Der Kubelwagon sprengen!

	The Gunner puts a shell into the large gun. He FIRES, CATAPULTING THE
	KUBELWAGON into the air, where it EXPLODES.  The tank drives through the
	resulting smoke an dust, then rolls over the Kubelwagon, crushing it
	
	EXT. DESERT VALLEY - DAY

	INDY gallops up to the side cannon and jams the stone down the barrel, lodging
	several rocks inside. Then he steers his horse directly in range of that gun.


	INT. TANK - DAY

	A NAZI SOLDIER pushes HENRY away from the window.

	                              	NAZI SOLDIER
		Keine Bewegung.

	He points his gun at HENRY and BRODY.

			NAZI SOLDIER
		Keine Bewegung.

	The smaller gun, blocked by the rocks, BACKFIRES, blowing the breech out into
	the face of the gunner, killing him and filling the tank with smoke.

	BRODY, HENRY, VOGEL and the driver begin to choke.


	EXT. DESERT VALLEY - DAY

	INDY rides his horse alongside the tank.

			INDY
		Dad!  Dad!  Dad!


	INT. TANK - DAY

	HENRY and BRODY still held at gunpoint by the NAZI SOLDIER.

			HENRY
		Junior? Junior? Junior!

	The NAZI SOLDIER swings his fist, knocking HENRY off his seat.


	EXT. DESERT VALLEY - DAY

	Smoke pours from the top of the tank as the turret pops open. VOGEL emerges
	and aims his gun at INDY.

	INDY and VOGEL EXCHANGE SHOTS as Indy chases the tank on his horse.

	INDY pulls the trigger againhis gun is empty! Indy immediately takes the
	high trail.

	Now INDY is above the tank twelve feet on a paralleling trail. He moves out of
	the saddle and leaps from the speeding horse onto the trundling tank.


	CLOSE UP - VOGEL

	Hate-staring at INDY

	CLOSE UP - INDY

	Hate-staring back at VOGEL.

Suddenly, from nowhere a German soldier flies INTO FRAME, tackling Indy.

					CUT TO:

	SIDE ANGLE

	One of the two troop carriers is paralleling the tank and like pirates boarding a
	galleon, Nazi Soldiers leap over the treads and are swarming all over INDY.

	INDY is struggling with a German's Luger.

	INDY presses the luger against his assailant and forces the Nazi to squeeze off a
	shot into himself. The bullet not only passes through the Nazi, but passes
	through two other Nazis standing directly behind him on the crowded tank top
	and three bodies fall away, leaving Indy to stare at the gun in disbelief.
	
	Another Soldier leaps from the truck onto the tank and raises his knife as he
	grabs INDY. They struggle and fall.

	INDY sits up to see VOGEL standing over him. Vogel wraps a chain around Indy's
	neck.


	INT. TANK- DAY

	INDY appears at the entrance, the chain still wrapped about his neck and held by
	VOGEL.

			INDY
		Dad!

	He drops the gun down into the tank.

			INDY
		Dad! Dadl Get it!

	VOGEL pulls INDY from the tank entrance, yanking on the chain wrapped around
	his neck.


	EXT. TANK - DAY

	A NAZI SOLDIER approaches.

	INDY hits him, knocking him onto the tank tread. The Nazi Soldier screams as he
	is dragged under the rolling tank.

	Now INDY and VOGEL struggle with one another, the chain still wrapped around
	Indy's neck.


	INT. TANK- DAY

	THROUGH THE PERISCOPE

	We SEE INDY and VOGEL struggling atop the tank. Indy lifts his feet, lunging
	toward the periscope and pulling Vogel with him.

	INDY's face is pressed up against the lens of the periscope.


	INT. TANK - DAY

	The NAZI SOLDIER looking through the periscope pulls away from it, smiles, then
	turns back to it.


	THROUGH THE PERISCOPE

	INDY's face, still pressed against the lens.

	VOGEL pulls INDY from the periscope.


	INT. TANK - DAY

	The NAZI SOLDIER pulls away from the periscope again.

			PERISCOPE SOLDIER
		        (laughing)
		Diese Amerikane. Sie Kampfen wie
		Weiber.

	EXT. TANK - DAY

	INDY now lies on top of VOGEL. He kicks out at the periscope which spins
	around.


	INT. TANK - DAY

	The periscope handle spins around and hits the PERISCOPE SOLDIER in the head.
	He falls against the NAZI SOLDIER guarding HENRY and BRODY.

	HENRY pushes the NAZI SOLDIER aside and grabs the gun. The PERISCOPE
	SOLDIER struggles to take the gun from Henry.


	EXT. TANK- DAY

	VOGEL holds the chain around INDY's neck, pushing his head downward toward
	the revolving tread.


	INT. TANK - DAY

	The PERISCOPE SOLDIER holds HENRY from behind, forcing the gun toward him.
	Henry reaches down and pulls a fountain pen from his coat pocket.



CONTINUED:

	As the PERISCOPE SOLDIER pulls on HENRY's face, Henry lifts the fountain pen
	and squirts ink into his face. The Soldier falls, his head smashing into the wall of
	the tank. At the same time, Henry loses his grip on the gun which falls to the
	floor.


			BRODY
		Henry, the pen

			HENRY
		What?


		               BRODY
		But don't you see? The pen is
		mightier than the sword.


	EXT. DESERT VALLEY - DAY

	A troop truck pulls near the tank.


	INT. TANK- DAY

	HENRY fires the TANK GUN at the troop truck. SOLDIERS FLY INTO THE AIR.
	The TROOP TRUCK flips over and EXPLODES.


	EXT. TANK - DAY

	The EXPLOSION knocks INDY off the tank and onto the tread. He grabs onto the
	shredded gun protruding from the side of the tank.

	VOGEL looks down at INDY and smiles smugly.

	The tank is approaching a cliff wall. As INDY tries to secure footing, VOGEL
	steps on his hands.


	INT. TANK - DAY

	BRODY looks at HENRY.

			BRODY
		Look what you didl

		               HENRY
		It's war.


	EXT. TANK - DAY

	VOGEL now swings a shovel at INDY, smashing at his hands.

	BRODY climbs up out of the tank, followed by HENRY.



CONTINUED:

			HENRY
		Didn't I tell you it was a rescue,
		huh?

	A NAZI SOLDIER appears and pulls HENRY down.

	VOGEL raises the shovel above his head and brings it crashing down on INDY,
	still hanging from the protruding gun.

	INDY loses his grip and now hangs from the gun suspended only by the strap of
	his leather pouch. He screams as the gun scrapes against the cliff wall, sending
	stones tumbling down over him.


	INT. TANK - DAY

	The NAZI SOLDIER knocks HENRY into a pile of boxes, then punches him in the
	face.

	As the SOLDIER raises the gun to HENRY's face, BRODY hits him over the head
	with a canister. The Soldier falls, discharging the gun into the air.

	The BULLET RICOCHETS around the tank, past the Tank Driver who is
	manipulating levers at the control panel. SPARKS FLY; then the BULLET PINGS
	AGAINST THE WINDOW and RICOCHETS ONCE MORE, this time passing THROUGH
	THE TANK DRIVER'S HAT. Blood flows from under the hat as the Tank Driver
	slumps forward, his body depressing the levers.


	EXT. TANK - DAY

	INDY still hangs from the strap of his leather pouch as the tank swerves, barely
	missing the rocks and causing VOGEL to fall. Indy finally manages to pull
	himself atop the tank once more where he punches Vogel over the side, then
	peers down to HENRY, still inside the tank.

			INDY
		Dad?

			HENRY
		You call this archaeology?

			INDY
		Get out of there, Dad!

	INDY pulls HENRY and BRODY from the tank. VOGEL pulls himself back atop the
	tank armed again with the shovel which he swings at Indy, who ducks and grabs
	Vogel's arm.

			BRODY
		How does one get off this thing?

	As INDY winds up to punch VOGEL he catches BRODY in the face on the
	backswing, then completes the movement and knocks Vogel down.

	INT. TANK - DAY

	Vogel's hat sails in and falls to the floor.


	EXT. TANK- DAY

			HENRY
		        (to INDY)
		Where's Marcus?!

	Before INDY can answer, VOGEL is up and swinging with the shovel. Indy ducks
	but the shovel catches HENRY sending him over the side and onto the moving
	tread.

	INDY grabs his whip, knocking VOGEL aside.

	As HENRY speeds toward the front of the tank to certain doom, INDY, with
	lightning speed, whips out his bullwhip, wrapping the end of the whip around
	Henry's right ankle.

			INDY
		Dad!

	HENRY is bouncing across the treads like a rag-doll. INDY struggles to hold onto
	the end of the bullwhip.

			INDY
		Hang on, Dad!

	SALLAH draws his horse next to the treads. He tips his fez to HENEY.

		               SALLAH
		Father of Indygive me your
		hand!

	VOGEL now punches INDY in the back and grabs him around the neck. Still,
	INDY refuses to let go of the whip.

			INDY
		Sallah! Get Dadl

	SALLAH reaches out to HENRY.

		               SALLAH
		Give me your hand!

	SALLAH manages to hold onto HENRY as he brings his horse to a stop just at the
	cliff's edge.

	INDY finally frees himself of VOGEL's grasp, twisting his arm painfully away
	from Indy's neck, then landing a hard blow to Vogel's head.


	INDY

	looks down at the fast-approaching cliff, his face filled with horror.  We SEE his
	HAT BLOW OFF and sail over the cliff's edge.

	VOGEL

	He sees his life passing before him, he screams at the top
	of his lungs!


	LONG SHOT

	The tank trundles over the cliff and PLUMMETS TO THE BOTTOM.


	EXT. CLIFF EDGE - DAY

	HENRY, BRODY and SALLAH look down at the flaming wreckage
	of the tank.

			HENRY
		Junior?!

	We HEAR the TANK EXPLODING.

			SALLAH
		Indy?!


		               HENRY
		Oh, God. I've lost him. And I
		never told him anything. I just
		wasn't ready, Marcus. Five
		minutes would have been enough.

	And then... looking dazed and bewildered, INDY STAGGERS UP BEHIND THEM.
	He joins the others at the edge of the cliff, looking down at the wreckage below
	with a bewildered expression.

	Finally, Henry becomes aware of his presence.

	HENRY says nothing. He just looks at Indy, overcome with emotion. Finally, he
	throws his arms around him.

			HENRY
		I thought I'd lost you, boy.

	After a moment, Indy's head clears. And he becomes aware of his father's
	embrace. Something he hasn't felt in a long timeif ever. And it touches him.
	He hugs his father back.

		               INDY
		I thought you had too, sir.

	BRODY and SALLAH are moved by this sudden reconciliation.

			HENRY
		Wellwell done! Come on!

	HENRY pats INDY on the back and Indy collapses, sitting hard on the rocky cliff
	edge.



CONTINUED:

	Unaware, HENRY, SALLAH and BRODY start to walk away. Henry turns back to
	see INDY still sitting on the ground.

		               HENRY
		Let's go then. why are you
		sitting there resting when we're
		so near the end? Come on
		let's go!

	HENRY turns and walks toward the horse with BRODY and SALLAH. Suddenly
	the FEDORA, borne on the wind, BLOWS INTO SCENE and lands at INDY's feet.


	EXT. MOUNTAIN ROAD - DAY

	DONOVAN peers through binoculars to see the CANYON OF THE CRESCENT
	MOON. He lowers the binoculars and turns to ELSA.

			DONOVAN
		The Canyon of the Crescent Moon.

	Now ELSA peers through the binoculars.


	EXT. SECRET CANYON - DAY

	INDY, HENRY, SALLAH and BRODY ride into the canyon. They hear a WAILING
	WIND. Feel the biting cold. And sense the danger.

	Now we turn a corner and they see the hidden city. Its spectacular Grecian
	facade is carved directly into the rock. It is a stunning sight. The vehicles,
	camels and horses belonging to DONOVAN's party have been left at the entrance.

					CUT TO:


	INT. TEMPLE - DAY

	INDY, SALLAH, HENRY AND BRODY creep forward to see:

	THE TERRIFIED FACE OF A TURKISH SOLDIER

	He's walking slowly. Eyes darting. Muttering a prayer under his breath.
	What's going on here?


	FULL SHOT - INSIDE THE MOUNTAIN TEMPLE

	THE TURK stands alone in the center of the Temple. It is very dark. GIANT
	COLUMNS define the Temple's perimeter.

	ELSA AND DONOVAN

	watch him from a safe distance.

	THE TURK

	is about to approach the spot where a TURKISH SOLDIER LIES DEAD. We don't
	notice it right away, but the dead soldier has been DECAPITATED.

	THE TURK stopsonly one step away from the beheaded soldier.


	THE TURK

	takes one more stepa fatal step, it turns out. We hear a ROARA WHOOSH
	of airbut we SEE NOTHINGexcept THE TURK'S HEAD FLY OFF AND
	BOUNCE across the ground.


	INDY, HENRY, BRODY AND SALLAH

	react to the sight.


	ELSA AND DONOVAN

	She looks at him, horrified.


			DONOVAN
		Helmut, another volunteer!

	TWO NAZI SOLDIERS force another Turk forward. Suddenly...


	The SOUND OF RIFLE BOLTS being cocked. Everyone turns to discover INDY and
	his party surrounded by NAZI SOLDIERS. Indy's group are relieved of their guns.


	FULL SHOT - THE TEMPLE

	INDY, HENRY, BRODY and SALLAH are brought forward by the Nazi Soldiers.


	ELSA's eyes light up: glad Indy's not dead. she controls herself and continues
	more coldly.

			ELSA
		       (to INDY)
		I never expected to see you again.

		                INDY
		I'm like a bad penny. I always
		turn up.

		                DONOVAN
		Step back now, Doctor Schneider.
		Give Doctor Jones some room. He's
		going to recover the Grail for us.



CONTINUED:

	INDY laughs.

		               DONOVAN
		Impossible? What do you say,
		Jones? Ready to go down in
		history?

			INDY
		As what? A Nazi stooge like you?

			DONOVAN
		       (scornfully)
		Nazis?!Is that the limit of
		your vision?! The Nazis want to
		write themselves into the Grail
		legend and take on the world.
		Well, they're welcome. But I want
		the Grail itself. The cup that
		gives everlasting life.
		Hitler can have the world, but
		he can't take it with him. I'm
		going to be drinking my own health
		when he's gone the way of the
		Dodo.
		      (he draws his
		       pistol)
		The Grail is mine, and you're
		going to get it for me.

			INDY
		Shooting me won't get you anywhere.

		               DONOVAN
		You know something, Doctor Jones?...
		you're absolutely right.

	Then DONOVAN shifts his aim, just a bit, and SHOOTS HENRY. The bullet enters
	his side below the ribs.

			INDY
		Dad?!

			HENRY
		Junior. . .

			ELSA
		No!!

			DONOVAN
		     ( to ELSA)
		Get back!

	HENRY collapses. Blood flowing from the wound. BRODY and SALLAH rush to
	his assistance.



CONTINUED: (2)


	INDY spins toward DONOVAN with murder in his eyes.

	DONOVAN points the gun at him:

			DONOVAN
		You can't save him when you're
		dead.

	INDY hesitates.

		               DONOVAN
		The healing power of the Grail is
		the only thing that can save your
		father now. It's time to ask yourself
		what you believe.

	INDY takes in the situation. The two decapitated men lie a few yards in front of
	him. He walks to the entranceway, flanked by two stone lions. We get silent
	reaction shotsELSASALLAHBRODYDONOVANregistering their
	different emotions

	INDY proceeds forward. His hands open the Grail Diary.

		               INDY
		"The Breath of God... Only the
		penitent man will pass. Only
		the penitent man will pass. . . "

	INDY takes a few steps forward.

		               INDY
		"The penitent man will pass.
		The penitent man..."

	INDY stops. He is about to reach the spot where two men have just died.

	HENRY looks at INDY. Indy looks at Henry.

			HENRY
		        (in a raspy voice)
		"Only the penitent man will pass.
		Only the penitent man will pass."

			INDY
		        (quietly to himself)
		The penitent man will pass. The
		penitent... the penitent. The
		penitent man...

			HENRY
		The penitent man. The penitent...

	INDY takes a step forward through the cobwebs.



CONTINUED: (3)


			INDY
		The penitent man is humble before
		God.

			HENRY
		Penitent. Penitent...

			INDY
		The penitent man is humble...

	The cobwebs begin to move....

			INDY
		He kneels before God.
		       (to himself; suddenly)
		Kneel!!

	We hear the awful rush of airWHOOSH! Because INDY is in the act of
	kneeling, only his hat is knocked off and his hair flies in his face.

	Instinctively he ROLLS FORWARD on the ground out of harm's way and looks up.
	From his new position he is able to see what is causing all the trouble: A RAZOR
	SHARP TRIPLE PENDULUM.

	INDY gets cautiously to his feet. Now he sees the pendulum has been guarding a
	SMALL CORRIDOR which turns a corner to the left fifty yards ahead. Wooden
	wheels turnthe mechanism controlling the spinning blades. INDY loops a rope
	around the wheels, jamming the mechanism and stopping the blades in mid-swipe.

			INDY
		I'm through!


	ELSA AND DONOVAN

			DONOVAN
		We're through!

	BRODY and SALLAH smile, relieved.

			SALLAH
		      (to HENRY)
		He's all right.

	HENRY shakes his head.

			HENRY
		No.

	BACK TO INDY

	holding the Grail Diary, reading once again, his fedora now covered in cobwebs.


			INDY
		"The second challenge is the
		 Word of God. Only in the
		footsteps of God will he proceed."
		       (to himself)
		The Word of God... The Word of...


	INDY pulls away some cobwebs to reveal a cobblestone path. Each cobble is
	engraved with a letter.

			INDY
		"Proceed in the footsteps of the
		Word."



	HENRY

	lifts his head painfully.


			HENRY
		The Word of God...



			BRODY
		No, Henry. Try not to talk.


			HENRY
		The Name of God...

	BACK TO INDY

	as he studies the cobblestones before him.


			INDY
		The Name of God... Jehovahl



	HENRY

	still lies in SALLAH's arms. BRODY leans over him.


			HENRY
		But in the Latin alphabet,
		"Jehovah" begins with an "I."


	BACK TO INDY


			INDY
		"J."

	INDY takes a step and immediately a stone breaks away and INDY falls up to his
	hip -- his leg stuck through the hold where the stone once was.

	HENRY

	reacts.


		               HENRY
		Oh dear!

	BACK TO INDY

	who grunts as he pulls himself from the hole, the v-rail Diary in his hand.

		               INDY
		In Latin, "Jehovah" starts with
		an "I." "I"...

	Now we SEE each letter on the stones as INDY carefully walks forward.
	DONOVAN and ELSA follow in his footsteps.

			INDY
		"E"... "H"... "O"... "V"... "A"...


	INDY sighs with relief and steps forward to:


	THE GREAT ABYSS

	INDY stands in a small opening, just small enough for his shoulders to squeeze
	through and beyond that a 100 foot drop to the rocks below and 100 feet across,
	nothing but a rough, stony cliff wall.


	BACK TO INDY

	He can see nowhere to cross. He looks again to the v-rail Diary.

		               INDY
		"The path of flood. Only in the
		leap from the lion's head will
		he prove his worth."

	INDY looks around and then he notices that inscribed into
	the rock above his head is the head of a lion.

			INDY
		Impossiblel Nobody can jump this!

	INDY looks down into the Diary and tortures over what it
	is asking him to do.


	BRODY

	rushes forward and calls to INDY.

			BRODY
		Indy... Indy, you must hurry!!
		Come quickly!

	BACK TO INDY

			INDY
		     (realizing)
		It's... a leap of faith. Oh,
		God.

	HENRY

	calls to his son.


		               HENRY
		You must believe, boy. you must...
		believe.

	We see him do it. We see him leap into space. We see that he is in midair. We
	see that he is not going to make it. His hands claw for the opposite wall but he is
	going to fall 100 feet to his death. And thenhe doesn't! He appears to be held
	up by thin air as he lands on his hands and knees.

	INDY looks around and down and now he figures it out.

	Ingeniously, the First Crusaders have painted a pathway to align with the rocks
	100 feet below. It is a perfect forced perspective image of the rocks below with
	lines from a hundred feet continuing six feet below his sight line where his feet
	are stepping.

	It's painted to blend in with the rocks below. Highly evolved camouflage... in
	perfect alignment with everything we see below.

	When INDY leans out to the left or right... that's when he sees the perfect
	alignment shift that betrays the trick. Indy throws some dirt on the bridge and
	he crosses it like the first Crusader from the painting over Henry's desk.

	Indy crawls through a small opening in the side of the cliff and enters a Temple.

	A vast array of chalices is displayed on the altar of this small Temple. Perhaps a
	hundred or more. Many sizes, many shapes, some gold, some silver, but they all
	glitter and shine.

	INDY is mesmerized by their number and their beauty. And then he realizes that
	a man is praying at the altarl

	He has his back turned to INDY... but he is dressed as what he is! A GRAIL
	KNIGHT.


	CLOSE ON THE GRAIL KNIGHT

	But we can't see the Grail Knight's face. The visor of his helmet is down.
	Perhaps we see his eyes.



CONTINUED:

	When the GRAIL KNIGHT sees INDY he gets wearily to his feet and, surprisingly,
	prepares to give combat...taking up his two-handed broadsword...he comes at
	Indy, attempting to swing the huge, heavy sword but finding the effort almost too
	much. Indy dodges two or three clumsy swings of the sword, making no attempt
	to fight back...until the Knight, exhausted, drops the sword and collapses. Indy
	approaches him and raises the visor and we see that the Knight is a very ancient
	man.

		               KNIGHT
		I knew you'd come, but my strength
		has left me.

		               INDY
		Who are you?

		               KNIGHT
		The last of three brothers who
		swore an oath to find the Grail
		and to guard it.

		               INDY
		That was seven hundred years ago.

		               KNIGHT
		A long time to wait.

	The GRAIL KNIGHT reaches forward and fingers Indy's clothing.

		               KNIGHT
		You're strangely dressed...for a
		knight.

		               INDY
		I'm not exactly...a knight. What
		do you mean?

		               KNIGHT
		I was chosen because I was the
		bravest and the most worthy. The
		honor was mine until another came
		to challenge me to single combat.
		I pass it to you who vanquished me.

	The GRAIL KNIGHT holds his sword out to INDY.

			INDY
		      (gulp)
		Listen, I don't have time to
		explain, but

	At that moment DONOVAN and ELSA appear. Donovan turns to face the display
	of cups.

		               DONOVAN
		Which one is it?



CONTINUED: (2)

		               KNIGHT
		You must choose.
		     (beat)
		But choose wisely. For as the
		True Grail will bring you life
		the False Grail will take it from
		you.

		               DONOVAN
		I'm not a historian. I have no
		idea what it looks like. Which
		one is it?

		               ELSA
		Let me choose.

		               DONOVAN
		Thank you, Doctor.

	ELSA and INDY exchange looks. He thinks he is seeing her in her true colors.

	ELSA chooses a cupa solid gold, emerald encrusted goblet.

	DONOVAN instantly takes it from her.

		               DONOVAN
		Oh, yes. It's more beautiful than
		I'd ever imagined. This certainly
		is the cup of the King of Kings.

	DONOVAN rushes to the well and fills the goblet with water.

			DONOVAN
		Eternal life!

	DONOVAN drinks from the goblet.

	Then, DONOVAN'S entire body starts to convulse. His face contorts in agony. He
	grabs his stomach and turns toward ELSA.

		               DONOVAN
		What . . . is . . . happening. . . to . . .
		me. . .?

	He starts to agefast! His hair grows long and gray and brittle. His face sinks.
	Fingernails curl back on themselves. Milky cataracts coat his eyes.

	ELSA gasps and screams.

	                                     DONOVAN
		What. . . is . . . happening. . . ?

	His skin turns brown and leathery and stretches across his bones until it splits.
	His skeletal hands reach for ELSA's throat, choking her.



CONTINUED: (3)

	INDY rushes forward and pushes DONOVAN away. As he falls he BODY BREAKS
	INTO FLAMES, then SHATTERS AGAINST THE WALL.

			KNIGHT
		He chose...poorly.

	INDY studies the array of chalices.


	                                     ELSA
		It would not be made out of gold.

	INDY picks up another cupa simple earthenware jug.

	                                     INDY
		That's the cup of a carpenter.

	He and ELSA exchange a look.

	                                     INDY
		There's only one way to find out.

	INDY goes to the well and fills the earthenware jug with water, then pauses.
	INDY brings the jug to his lips and takes several large swallows.

	A strange sensation overcomes him, a feeling of peace and contentment...and we
	see his wounds begin to heal.

	                                    KNIGHT
	            You have chosen wisely. But the
	            Grail cannot pass beyond the
	            Great Seal. That is the boundary
	            and the price of immortality.


	CUT TO BRODY AND SALLAH who attend to Henry awaiting Indy's return.

	INDY and ELSA come forward with the Grail.

	The TWO NAZI SOLDIERS are over-awed by the possessors of the Grail. They put
	down their guns and kneel.

	INDY kneels by HENRY's side and tilts his head forward and holds the Grail to
	his lips.

	HENRY is too weak to even open his eyes.

	HENRY swallows some of the water. Much of it runs down the corners of his
	mouth. Finally INDY pours the water over the wound and everyone watches in
	astonishment as the wound and the blood stain disappear before their eyes. The
	color returns to Henry's face.

	HENRY's eyes open. The first thing he sees is the Grail and they light up. Then
	they shift to INDY's faceand they light up even more...

	NAZI SOLDIERS

	run forward. SALLAH points a rifle at them.

	                                     SALLAH
		Drop your guns. Please.

	The NAZI SOLDIERS drop their weapons at their feet and raise their arms in
	surrender.

	                                      INDY
		     (to HENRY)
		Dad, come on. Get to your feet.

	ELSA

	steps forward and picks up the Grail. She turns to INDY, her face alight with
	possession of the Grail.

			ELSA
		We have got it. Come on.

	ELSA steps onto the edge of the Great Seal.

			INDY
		Elsa! Elsa, don't movel

	                                      ELSA
		It's ours, Indy. Yours and mine.

	                                      INDY
		Elsa, don't cross the Seal. The
		Knight warned us not to take the
		Grail from here.

	A RUMBLING SOUND IS HEARD and the ground roars and shifts. Dirt falls from
	the ceiling of the cavern. ELSA falls on the Great Seal. The Grail bounces away
	from her grasp. She reaches for it and the ground beneath her begins to SPLIT
	OPEN. ELSA slips into the crevasse. She screams.

	ELSA is hanging perilously in the abyss, with the Grail almost within her reach.
	As her hands lose their grip, INDY just manages to one of them, he himself
	sliding forward across the slanted floor.

	                                     HENRY
		Junior!  Junior!

	With her free hand, ELSA is trying to get the Grail. INDY can't save her unless
	she gives him her free hand. She has to choose.

			INDY
		Elsa. Elsa don't. Elsa. Elsa.
		Give me your other hand,
		honey. I can't hold you.



CONTINUED:

			ELSA
		I can reach it. I can reach it...

	Her hand begins to slip from Indy's grasp.

		                INDY
		Elsa! Give me your hand. Give
		me your other hand!

	ELSA just manages to touch the Grail. In doing so, she has tipped the balance too
	farINDY slides down another yard, Elsa loses her grip and falls screaming to
	her death.

			INDY
		     (horrified)
		Elsa!!

	Now the ledge INDY lies upon begins to break apart. HENRY grabs one of his
	hands as Indy struggles to reach the Grail with the other.

			HENRY
		Junior, give me your other hand!
		I can't hold on!!

		                INDY
		I can get itI can almost
		reach it, Dad.

	INDY looks down into the black bottomless pit beneath him from which nothing
	can ever be retrieved.

			HENRY
		Indiana. Indiana!!

	INDY snaps his look up to his father. His father has never called him this before.


			HENRY
		     (very calmly)
		... let it go...


	INDY abandons the Grail and grabs onto HENRY with both hands.
	HENRY pulls him up to safety.


	THE GRAIL KNIGHT

	looks through the falling debris to INDY and HENRY. SALLAH and BRODY rush
	from the crumbling Temple.

			INDY
		Dad. . .

	The GRAIL KNIGHT raises his arm to HENRY.


CONTINUED:


			INDY
		Please, Dad...

	INDY and HENRY down the passageway just as a huge stone column tumbles
	down upon the spot where they stood. The GRAIL KNIGHT lowers his arm as he
	watches them leave.


	EXT. ENTRANCE TO MOUNTAIN TEMPLE - AFTERNOON

	INDY, HENRY, SALLAH and BRODY emerge from the Mountain Temple through
	the Grecian Facade.

	From within the Mountain Temple, the ROAR OF WALLS CAVING IN IS HEARD. A
	cloud of dust and smoke billows out from the entrance.

	HENRY turns to INDY.

			HENRY
		Elsa never really believed in the
		Grail. She thought she'd found a
		prize.

			INDY
		What did vou find, Dad?

			HENRY
		Me?... Illumination.

	HENRY and INDY mount their horses. Henry turns back to his son.

			HENRY
		What did you find, Junior?

			INDY
		Junior?! Dad...


			SALLAH
		Please...What does it always
		mean, this...this "Junior?"

			HENRY
		That's his name. Henry Jones,
		Junior.

			INDY
		I like Indiana.

			HENRY
		We named the dog Indiana.

			BRODY
		May we go home now, please?



CONTINUED:


			SALLAH
		        (to INDY)
		The dog!?
		        (laughs)
		You are named after the dog...

			INDY
		        (embarrassed)
		I've got a lot of fond memories
		of that dog.

	A moment passes as they all ready their mounts and SALLAH continues to laugh
	at INDY.

		               INDY
		Ready?

		               HENRY
		Ready.

		               BRODY
		Indy! Henryl Follow met I know
		the way!
		        (to his horse)
		Haaa!

			HENRY
		        (to INDY)
		Got lost in his own museum, huh?

			INDY
		Uh-huh.


		               HENRY
		After you, Junior.

			INDY
		Yes, sir!
		   (to his horse)
		Haaa!		


	EXT. THE SECRET CANYON - AFTERNOON

	They THUNDER through the canyonwhose towering walls threaten to collapse
	upon them.


	EXT. ENTRANCE TO CANYON - SUNSET

	as BRODY, INDY, HENRY AND SALLAH ride from the canyon toward the SETTING
	SUN.

               FADE IN:

               EXT. PERU - HIGH JUNGLE - DAY

               The dense, lush rain forests of the eastern slopes of the 
               Andes, the place known as "The Eyebrow of the Jungle". Ragged, 
               jutting canyon walls are half-hidden by the thick mists.

               The MAIN TITLE is followed by this:

                                           PERU
                                           1936

               A narrow trail across the green face of the canyon. A group 
               of men make their way along it. At the head of the party is 
               an American, INDIANA JONES. He wears a short leather jacket, 
               a flapped holster, and a brimmed felt hat with a weird feather 
               stuck in the band. Behind him come two Spanish Peruvians, 
               SATIPO and BARRANCA. Bringing up the rear are five Yagua 
               INDIANS. They act as porters and are wrangling the two heavily-
               packed llamas. The Indians become increasingly nervous. They 
               speak to each other in bursts of Quechua. The American, who 
               is known to his friends as Indy, glances back at them.

                                     BARRANCA
                              (irritated)
                         They're talking about the Curse again!

               He turns and yells at the Indians in Quechua, his anger giving 
               an indication of his own fears. The party reaches a break in 
               the canyon wall and takes the trail through it.

               When they emerge, their destination is revealed to them in 
               the distance. Beyond a thick stand of trees is the vegetation-
               enshrouded TEMPLE OF THE CHACHAPOYAN WARRIORS.

               The entire party is struck by the sight. The Indians, 
               terrified now, chatter away. Suddenly the three at the back 
               turn and run, dropping their packs as they go. Barranca yells 
               at the fleeing Indians and pulls his pistol out. He starts 
               to raise his arm to aim but Indy restrains it in a muscular 
               grip.

                                     INDY
                         No.

               Barranca looks evilly at Indy's hand upon him. Indy releases 
               him and smiles in a friendly way.

                                     INDY
                         We don't need them.

               Satipo watches this confrontation with some concern.

                                     BARRANCA
                         I do not carry supplies.

                                     INDY
                         We'll leave them. Once we've got it, 
                         we'll be able to reach the plane by 
                         dusk.

               He turns back to the trail. Satipo gets the two remaining 
               Indians moving behind Indy. Satipo and Barranca then have a 
               fast, silent communication: Barranca indicates his desire to 
               slit Indy's throat; Satipo gives him a look that says "Be 
               patient, you idiot".

               THE APPROACH TO THE TEMPLE

               The party fans out to fight their way through the entwined 
               trees that guard the temple. Visibility is cut to five feet 
               in the heavy mist. Satipo extracts a short, native dart from 
               a tree and examines the point gingerly

                                     SATIPO
                              (showing Indy)
                         The Hovitos are near. The poison is 
                         still fresh... three days. They're 
                         following us, I tell you.

                                     INDY
                         If they knew we were here, they would 
                         have killed us already.

               The two Indiana jabber in Quechua, near hysteria. Barranca 
               is sweating profusely, eyes darting. He yells at the Indians 
               in Quechua to "shut up".

               In the undergrowth, there is slithering movement.

               Indian #1 draws aside a branch and is faced with a horrific 
               stone sculpture of a Chachapoyan demon. The Indian is so 
               frightened no sound comes out when he screams. He turns and 
               runs silently away.

               Indian #2 calls to his friend. Getting no response, he steps 
               in that direction. A huge macaw, flushed from the undergrowth, 
               screams and flies away. Indian #2 does exactly the same thing, 
               never to be seen again.

               Indy, Satipo and Barranca, just clearing the trees, look 
               back in that direction. They all turn to face the Temple.

               It is dark and awesome. Vegetation curls from every crevice, 
               over each elaborate frieze. The entrance - round, open and 
               black - has been designed to look like open jaws.

                                     INDY
                         So this is where Forrestal cashed 
                         in.

                                     SATIPO
                         A friend of yours?

                                     INDY
                         Competitor. He was good, very good.

                                     BARRANCA
                              (nervous)
                         No one has ever come out of there 
                         alive. Why should we put our faith 
                         in you?

               Indy takes the weird feather from the band of his hat. From 
               around its point, he slips a tightly rolled piece of 
               parchment. Barranca and Satipo exchange a quick "So that's 
               where is was!" look. They all kneel as Indy spreads out the 
               parchment. On it is one-half of a crude floorplan of the 
               Temple.

                                     INDY
                         No one ever had what we have... 
                         partners.

               Indy fixes them with an expectant stare. Satipo produces a 
               similar, but folded, piece of parchment. He lays it - the 
               other half of the floorplan - next to Indy's. They all regard 
               it for a moment, then Indy stands and walks toward the Temple. 
               Barranca's eyes are shining as they dart between the floorplan 
               and Satipo.

                                     INDY
                              (back turned)
                         Assuming that pillar there marks the 
                         corner and...

               Barranca is suddenly on his feet, quietly drawing his pistol. 
               He raises it toward Indy as Satipo realizes with alarm what 
               he's doing. Too late. Indy's head turns and he sees Barranca.

               Indy's next move is amazing, graceful and fast, yet totally 
               unhurried. His right hand slides up under the back of his 
               leather jacket and emerges grasping the handle of a neatly 
               curled bullwhip. With the same fluid move that brings Indy's 
               body around to face the Peruvian, the whip uncoils to its 
               full ten foot length and flashes out.

               The fall of the whip (the unplaited strip at the end of the 
               lash) wraps itself around Barranca's hand and pistol. He 
               could not drop the gun now if he tried.

               Indy gives the whip a short pull and Barranca's arm in jerked 
               down, where it involuntarily discharges the gun into the 
               dirt. Barranca is amazed, but feels some slack in the whip 
               and immediately raises the gun toward Indy again, cocking it 
               with his free hand.

               Indy's face goes hard. And sad.

               Indy sweeps his arm in a wide arc. Barranca spins around, 
               enclosed in the whip, his gun hand stuck tight against his 
               body. Indy gives one more short jerk on the whip handle and 
               Barranca's gun fires. Barranca falls dead.

               Indy looks quickly at Satipo, who is shocked and frightened. 
               He raises his arms in supplication.

                                     SATIPO
                         I knew nothing! He was crazy! Please!

               Indy looks him over, then nods. He frees the whip from 
               Barranca's body and picks up the man. His eyes sweep the 
               surrounding woods.

                                     INDY
                         Let's go.

               INT. TEMPLE - INCLINED PASSAGE - DAY

               Indy and Satipo, carrying a torch, walk up the slightly 
               inclined, tubular passage from the main entrance. The interior 
               is wet and dark, hanging with plant life and stalactites. 
               Their echoing footsteps intermittently overpower the sounds 
               of loud dripping, whistling air drafts and scampering claws.

               HALL OF SHADOWS

               Indy leads the way down a twisting hallway, Satipo's torch 
               barely lighting his way from behind. Indy disappears in a 
               shadow and when he reappears a moment later a huge black 
               tarantula is crawling up the back of his jacket. Indy doesn't 
               notice and disappears into another shadow, emerging with two 
               more tarantulas on his back.

               Satipo sees them and makes a frightened grunting sound. Indy 
               looks at him, sees what he's pointing at and casually brushes 
               all three spiders off with his rolled whip, as he would a 
               fly. Satipo pirouettes for an inspection and Indy flicks one 
               off the Peruvian's back.

               Indy begins picking up little pocket-sized artifacts from 
               the niches and ledges of the Temple. He continues to do this 
               as the men penetrate the Temple. His collecting is quick and 
               expert, evaluating the pieces in an instant, discarding some, 
               stuffing others into his clothes, and never stopping his 
               forward progress.

               CHAMBER OF LIGHT

               The men reach an arch in the hall. The small chamber ahead, 
               which interrupts the hall, is brightly lit by a shaft of 
               sunlight from high above. Indy stops, looks it over.

                                     SATIPO
                         What's wrong? Are you lost?

               Indy picks up a stick and throws it through the shaft of 
               light. Giant spikes spring together from the sides of the 
               chamber with a ferocious CLANG! And impaled on the spikes 
               are the remains of a white man, half-fleshed, half skeleton, 
               in explorer-type grab. Indy reaches out and takes hold of 
               the man's carcass. As the spikes slowly retract, Indy pulls 
               it free and seats the remains gently on the floor.

                                     INDY
                         Forrestal.

                                     SATIPO
                              (gulps)
                         We can go no further.

                                     INDY
                         Now, Satipo, we don't want to be 
                         discouraged by every little thing.

               Indy steps sideways into the chamber. His back pressed against 
               the very points of the retracted spikes, he moves along the 
               edge of the light beam, and steps clear on the other side. 
               Satipo grimaces and begins sweating his way through.

               STAIRWAY

               Indy and Satipo come down stone stairs to a tight landing. 
               Framing the entry are a carefully strung network of dead 
               vines, each somehow hooked into the wall, narrowing the 
               opening even more.

                                     INDY
                              (taking torch)
                         Let me see that.

               He lowers the torch to the floor of the landing. The landing 
               is carpeted with human skeletons, one on top of another, all 
               squashed flat as cardboard. Satipo gasps. Indy looks up at 
               the ceiling of the landing, then steps onto skeletons, which 
               make a cracking noise under his feet.

                                     INDY
                         Try not to touch the vines.

               FOYER OF THE SANCTUARY

               The men are in a high, straight hallway 50 feet long.

               The door at the end is flooded with sunlight.

                                     SATIPO
                         Señor, I think we are very close.

               Indy stands still looking at the hall.

                                     SATIPO
                              (impatient)
                         Let us hurry. There is nothing to 
                         fear here.

                                     INDY
                         That's what scares me.

               They begin walking down the hall side by side. Satipo has 
               inched a little ahead. Suddenly his lead foot comes down and 
               through the floor! As Satipo begins to pitch forward, Indy 
               grabs him by the belt and pulls him back. They both look 
               down at the "floor".

               Indy swings his whip across the floor. Fifteen feet of it 
               cuts open beneath the lash, falling away to reveal black pit 
               as wide as the hall. The illusory floor was made of dust-
               covered cobwebs. Satipo picks up a stone and drops it down 
               the pit. No sound. The two men exchange glances. Indy looks 
               up at the high roof of the hall. He swings the whip up around 
               a support beam, tests its strength with a pull and swings 
               over the pit on the whip. From the other side he swings the 
               whip back to Satipo, who throws Indy the torch. Satipo swings 
               across. When they are both standing on solid floor there is 
               a moment of quiet in which they hear, from far, far below - 
               SPLASH! Indy wedges the whip handle into the wall and leaves 
               it strung to the beam for quick retreat.

               THE SANCTUARY

               A large, domed room. Ten evenly-spaced skylights send their 
               shafts of sunlight down to a unique tiled floor: white and 
               black tiles laid out in a lovely, intricate pattern. Indy 
               and Satipo stand at the door and look across the wide room 
               at the altar. There, in the supreme hallowed spot, is a tiny 
               jeweled figurine, Indy's real objective.

               Two torches, many years old, are in holders by the door. 
               Indy takes one down and lights it. He gives the regular torch 
               to Satipo.

                                     SATIPO
                         There's plenty of light, amigo.

               Indy kneels and uses the unlit end of the torch to reach out 
               and tap a white tile. It is solid. He taps a black tile. 
               There is a whizzing sound and a tiny dark sticks in the torch. 
               Satipo points to the wall nearby: there is a recessed hole 
               there.

                                     SATIPO
                         From that hole!

               Indy nods, stands and looks around the sanctuary. The entire 
               room is honey-comed with the same kind of hole. Satipo sees 
               it too and is properly impressed.

                                     INDY
                         You wait here.

                                     SATIPO
                         If you insist, señor.

               Torch in hand, Indy begins his careful walk across the 
               sanctuary. Stepping only on the white tiles, he almost appears 
               to be doing a martial arts kata. Before each big move he 
               waves the torch in front of him head to toe, looking at the 
               flame. Halfway out, he sees something on the floor and kneels 
               to look at it.

               A dead bird lies on one of the white tiles. Its body is 
               riddled with little deadly darts. This has great significance 
               to Indy and he stands with even greater caution. He waves 
               the torch ahead of him and at waist height an air current 
               whips at the flame. Indy ducks under it and leaves a burn 
               mark on the white tile beneath it.

               Satipo watches, wide-eyed and mystified.

               Indy reaches the altar. The tiny idol looks both fierce and 
               beautiful. It rests on a pedestal of polished stone. Indy 
               looks the whole set-up over very carefully. From his jacket 
               he takes a small, canvas drawstring bad. He begins filling 
               it with dirt from around the case of the altar. When he has 
               created a weight that he thinks approximates the weight of 
               the idol, he bounces it a couple times in his palm 
               concentrating. It's clear he wants to replace the idol with 
               the bag as smoothly as possible. His hand seems ready to do 
               that once, when he stops, takes a breath and loosens his 
               shoulder muscles. Now he sets himself again. And makes the 
               switch! The idol is now in his hand, the bag on the pedestal. 
               For a long moment it sits there, then the polished stone 
               beneath the bag drops five inches. This sets off an AURAL 
               CHAIN REACTION of steadily increasing volume as some huge 
               mysterious mechanism rumbles into action deep in the temple.

               Indy spins and starts his kata back across the sanctuary at 
               four times the speed.

               Satipo's eyes widen in terror. He turns and runs.

               THE RETREAT - INTERCUTTING INDY AND SATIPO

               The sanctuary has begun to rumble and shake in response to 
               the mysterious mechanism. Just as Indy goes out the door, a 
               rock shakes loose from the wall and rolls onto the tiles 
               floor. Immediately, a noisy torrent of poison darts fills 
               the room.

               IN THE FOYER

               Satipo swings across the pit. He makes it just as the whip 
               comes undone from the beam, leaving Indy without an escape. 
               Satipo, extremely nervous, regards the whip a moment then 
               turns back to face Indy, who has run up to the far side of 
               the pit.

                                     SATIPO
                         No time to argue. Throw me the idol, 
                         I throw you the whip.

               Indy hesitates, eyeing the rumbling walls.

                                     SATIPO
                         You have no choice! Hurry!

               Indy concurs with that assessment. He tosses the idol across 
               the pit to Satipo. Satipo stuffs it in the front pocket of 
               his jacket, gives Indy a look, then drops the whip on the 
               floor and runs.

                                     SATIPO
                         Adios, amigo!

               Indy grimaces. He had a feeling this might happen. He looks 
               around.

               AT THE VINED LANDING

               Satipo flies through like a chubby ballet dancer and takes 
               the steps five at a time.

               IN THE FOYER

               Indy runs in full stride to the edge of the pit and broad 
               jumps into space. He doesn't make it. His body hits the far 
               side of the pit and he begins to slide out of view. Only 
               wild clawing with his fingers at the edge of the pit stops 
               his descent. With just the tips of his fingers over the edge, 
               he begins pulling himself up.

               AT THE CHAMBER OF LIGHT

               Satipo has slowed down. He begins to edge carefully around 
               the light shaft.

               AT THE VINED LANDING

               Indy sails through sideways and rolls to a stop at the bottom 
               of the steps. His whip is grasped in his hand. As he raises 
               himself, he hears, from above the giant spikes of the Chamber 
               of Light CLANG! and an abrupt, sickening rendition of SATIPO'S 
               LAST SCREAM. Indy runs up the steps. The rumbling sound grows 
               louder.

               AT THE CHAMBER OF LIGHT

               Indy slides to a stop. The spikes have retracted, taking 
               Satipo's body to one side. Indy edges into the chamber with 
               his back to the shaft of light. Soon he is face to face with 
               the dead Satipo; spikes protrude from several vital spots in 
               the Peruvian's body. Indy removes the idol from Satipo's 
               pocket and moves quickly out the other side.

                                     INDY
                         Adios.

               THE INCLINED PASSAGE

               Indy shoots out of a cut-off hallway and turns toward the 
               exit. The rumbling is very loud and now we see why: right 
               behind Indy a huge boulder comes roaring around a corner of 
               the passage, perfectly form-fitted to the passageway. It 
               obliterates everything before it, sending the stalactites 
               shooting ahead like missiles. Indy dashes for the light of 
               the exit. His hat flies off his head. Almost immediately it 
               is crushed by the boulder. Indy dives out the end of the 
               passage as the boulder slams to a perfect fit at the entrance, 
               sealing the Temple.

               EXT. FRONT OF THE TEMPLE - DAY

               Indy lies on the ground, gasping for air. A shadow falls 
               across him and he looks up.

               WHAT HE SEES

               Looming above him are three figures. Two are HOVITOS WARRIORS 
               in full battle paint and loin cloths. They carry long blow 
               guns. But the man in the center draws Indy's attention. He 
               is a tall, impressive white man, dressed in full safari outfit 
               including pith helmet. His name is EMILE BELLOQ. His face is 
               thin, powerful; his eyes hypnotic; his smile charming, yet 
               lethal. His heavily French-accented speech is deep, 
               mellifluous, wonderful. Back beyond Belloq and his two 
               escorts, thirty more Hovitos Warriors hover at the edge of 
               the trees.

                                     BELLOQ
                         Dr. Jones, you choose the wrong 
                         friends. This time it will cost you.

               Belloq extends his hand. Indy looks at it, then produces the 
               idol and hands it to Belloq. Belloq extends his other hand, 
               smiling. Indy hands over his gun. Belloq sticks it in his 
               jacket.

                                     BELLOQ
                         And you thought I'd given up.

                                     INDY
                              (eyeing the Hovitos)
                         Too bad they don't know you like I 
                         do, Belloq.

                                     BELLOQ
                              (smiles)
                         Yes, too bad. You could warn them... 
                         if only you spoke Hovitos.

               With that, Belloq turns dramatically and holds the idol high 
               for all the Hovitos to see and says something in Hovitos. 
               There is a murmur of recognition and all the Indians, 
               including Belloq's escorts, prostrate themselves upon the 
               ground, heads down.

               Indy is immediately up and running toward the edge of the 
               clearing.

                                     BELLOQ
                              (in Hovitos)
                         Kill him!

               AT THE EDGE OF THE CLEARING

               Indy disappears into the foliage. An instant later, the leaves 
               are peppered with a rain of poison darts and spears.

               EXT. THE JUNGLE - INDY'S RUN - VARIOUS SHOTS - DAY

               Indy runs like hell through steadily falling terrain. And 
               always close behind, a swift gang of angry Hovitos. 
               Occasionally they get close enough to send a dart or spear 
               whizzing past Indy's head.

               EXT. THE URUBAMBA RIVER - DUSK

               An amphibian plane sits in the water beneath a green cliff. 
               Sitting on the wing is JOCK, the British pilot. Indy breaks 
               out of some distant brush and runs along the path at the top 
               of the cliff.

                                     INDY
                              (yelling)
                         Get it going! Get it going!

               Jock hops in and fires up the plane's engines. Indy reaches 
               a spot on the cliff above the place, glances back, them jumps 
               into the river. He comes up, swims to the plane and grabs a 
               strut.

                                     INDY
                         GO!

               Jock starts the plane moving across the water as Indy walks 
               across the wing and falls into the passenger compartment.

               INT. JOCK'S PLANE - DUSK

               Indy relaxes and lies across the seat, a big smile on his 
               face. One hand drops to the floor of the cabin and Indy jumps, 
               hitting his head. On the floor of the cabin is a huge boa 
               constrictor. Indy tries to get his whole body onto the seat. 
               Jock sees what's happening.

                                     JOCK
                         Don't mind him. That's Reggie. 
                         Wouldn't hurt a soul.

                                     INDY
                         I can't stand snakes.

                                     JOCK
                         The world's full of them, you know.

                                     INDY
                         I hate them.

                                     JOCK
                         Come on now, Sport, show a little of 
                         the old backbone.

               EXT. JOCK'S PLANE - TWILIGHT

               It soars off over the dark jungle.

               INT. INDY'S OFFICE, SMALL EASTERN COLLEGE - DAY

               It's autumn and the pretty, New England campus out Indy's 
               window reflects it in dazzling color. A few weeks before the 
               start of classes. Activity just picking up. Some students 
               about.

               Indy is at a bookcase near the window and he looks quite 
               different in this setting. His outfit is tweedy, slightly 
               rumpled in the professional style. Part of his attention is 
               focused in a book and he wears glasses to see the fine print. 
               The office is cramped, absolutely inundated with books, maps, 
               etchings and archeological artifacts. In fact, the only neat 
               spot in the room right now is Indy's desk, which has been 
               cleared off expressly for the benefit of -

               MARCUS BRODY

               The Curator of the National Museum in Washington, D.C. Brody 
               is examining the small artifacts Indy pocketed on his way 
               into the Peruvian Temple. He occasionally uses a jeweler's 
               eyepiece to get a closer look. But he is distracted, his 
               concerns elsewhere, and it is this that his old friend Indy 
               senses from across the room.

                                     BRODY
                         Do you think the idol will ever show 
                         up?

                                     INDY
                         I don't know. Just because Belloq 
                         had it doesn't mean he kept it.

               Indy snaps the book closed and puts it on the shelf. He takes 
               his glasses off and focuses on Brody. At the windowed door 
               to his office, two pretty Coeds pause for a moment, look in 
               at their sexy Archeology professor, giggle and disappear.

                                     INDY
                         Getting it away from those Indians 
                         would be a neat trick
                              (a hard look)
                         I hope they got him.

               A young male graduate student, Indy's TEACHING ASSISTANT, 
               taps on the door and then pushes his way in with an armload 
               of reference books. Indy helps him find a spot for them.

                                     TEACHING ASSISTANT
                         I couldn't get the McNabe, Professor. 
                         Someone's got it checked out 'til 
                         next month when classes start.

                                     INDY
                         That's all right, Phil. Thanks a 
                         lot.

                                     TEACHING ASSISTANT
                              (eager to please)
                         Will there be anything else?

                                     INDY
                         No. I'll see you Thursday.

               The Teaching Assistant leaves. Brody is scowling as he 
               examines the last of the artifacts.

                                     INDY
                         Hey, if you don't like them, I can 
                         always return them.

                                     BRODY
                         No, they're beautiful. The Museum 
                         will buy them as usual. No questions 
                         asked.

                                     INDY
                         Then what's wrong?

                                     BRODY
                         I brought along some people today.

                                     INDY
                         What kind of people?

                                     BRODY
                         Government.

                                     INDY
                              (concerned)
                         Government?

                                     BRODY
                         Don't worry, it's not about your 
                         business.
                              (indicates the 
                              artifacts)
                         They're from the Army.

                                     INDY
                         I've already served.

                                     BRODY
                         Army Intelligence. They're looking 
                         for Abner.

               INT. INDY'S LECTURE HALL / CLASSROOM - DAY

               Indy's course - a combination of archeology and anthropology - 
               is taught in this amphitheater-type lecture hall. His desk 
               and lectern hold large reference books; blackboards line the 
               wall. Bones, maps, charts festoon the walls.

               Indy leans against his desk talking with Brody and two 
               uniformed Army officers, COLONEL MUSGROVE and MAJOR EATON, 
               who are situated around the first seats in the classroom.

                                     MUSGROVE
                         But you did study under Professor 
                         Ravenwood at the University of 
                         Chicago?

                                     INDY
                              (nods)
                         We haven't spoken in ten years. I'm 
                         afraid we had a bit of a falling 
                         out.

                                     EATON
                         You know nothing of his whereabouts?

                                     INDY
                              (negative)
                         Just rumors. Somewhere in Asia, last 
                         I heard.

               Musgrove and Eaton exchange a look; they're disappointed.

                                     EATON
                              (to Musgrove)
                         Maybe Dr. Jones can make sense of 
                         it.

               Again the military men have a silent communication, deciding 
               what to reveal.

                         Well... you must understand, Dr. 
                         Jones, this is all strictly 
                         confidential.

                                     INDY
                         I understand.

                                     MUSGROVE
                         Yesterday, one of our European 
                         sections intercepted a Nazi communiqué 
                         from Cairo to Berlin. We don't quite 
                         know what to make of it.

               Musgrove takes a sheet from his briefcase.

                                     MUSGROVE
                         Here it is - "Tanis development 
                         proceeding. Acquire headpiece, Staff 
                         of Ra, General Tengtu Hok, Shanghai. 
                         Locate Abner Ravenwood, U.S."

               Brody is excited. He looks at Indy.

                                     BRODY
                         Tanis. They must have discovered the 
                         lost ruins.

               Indy contemplates this big news; he's impressed.

                                     INDY
                              (to himself)
                         Tanis. Ain't that somethin'!

                                     EATON
                         Frankly, we're a little suspicious... 
                         An American being mentioned so 
                         prominently in a secret Nazi cable.

                                     INDY
                         Ah, Ravenwood's no Nazi.

                                     EATON
                         Then what do they want him for?

                                     INDY
                         They're looking for the headpiece to 
                         the Staff of Ra.

                                     MUSGROVE
                              (indicates his sheet)
                         But it says here that's in China.

                                     INDY
                         Only half of it. Ravenwood had the 
                         other half.

                                     EATON
                         What would the Nazis want with this - 
                         this Staff of Ra?

                                     BRODY
                         I can tell you that. Over the last 
                         two years the Nazis have had teams 
                         of archeologists running around the 
                         world looking for all kinds of 
                         religious artifacts.

                                     MUSGROVE
                         That's right. Hitler's a nut on the 
                         subject. Crazy. He's obsessed with 
                         the occult.

                                     EATON
                         What is this Staff of Ra, anyway?

                                     INDY
                         It all has to do with the Ark of the 
                         Covenant.
                              (the Army guys look 
                              mystified)
                         The chest the Hebrews used to carry 
                         around the Ten Commandments.

               Now it's the Army men who are impressed.

                                     INDY
                         An Egyptian pharaoh stole the Ark 
                         from Jerusalem and took it back to 
                         the city of Tanis. A short time later, 
                         Tanis was consumed by the desert in 
                         a sandstorm that lasted a year. But 
                         before that, the Pharaoh had had the 
                         Ark hidden away in a secret chamber 
                         called the Well of the Souls. Which 
                         is where the Staff of Ra comes in.

               Indy moves to the blackboard and makes a quick sketch to 
               give a rough idea of the system as he describes it. (and we 
               get a glimpse of what an interesting and enthusiastic teacher 
               he must be).

                                     INDY
                         Now this was rather clever. The Staff 
                         was really just a big stick - oh, I 
                         don't know, say like this -
                              (he indicates about 
                              six feet)
                         no one really knows for sure. Any 
                         way, it was capped by an elaborate 
                         headpiece with a carving of the sun 
                         at the top. What you had to do was 
                         take the Staff to a special map room 
                         in Tanis - it had the whole city 
                         laid out in miniature on the floor. 
                         When you placed the Staff in a certain 
                         spot in this room, at a certain time 
                         of day, the sun would shine through 
                         a hole here in the headpiece and 
                         then send a beam of light down here - 
                         to the map - giving you the location 
                         of the Well of the Souls...

                                     MUSGROVE
                         ...where the Ark of the Covenant was 
                         kept.

                                     INDY
                              (nods)
                         Which is probably what the Nazis are 
                         after.

                                     EATON
                         What's this Ark look like?

                                     INDY
                         Look like? Why, it's right here...

               Indy pulls a big format book from the stack on his lectern 
               and flips through the pages until he finds a large color 
               print. The other men gather to look.

               THE PRINT

               Fills the screen.

               It shows a Biblical battle. The Israelite Army is vanquishing 
               an opposition force. At the forefront of the Israelite ranks, 
               two men carry the Ark of the Covenant, a beautiful gold chest, 
               crowned by two sculptured gold angels. The men do not touch 
               the Ark itself; rather they carry it by use of two long wooden 
               poles which pass through rings in the corners of the Ark. 
               The painting is very dramatic, full of smoke, tumult and 
               sinewy dying men. But the most astounding thing in the picture 
               is the brilliant jet of white light and flame issuing from 
               the wings of the angels. It pierces deep into the ranks of 
               the retreating enemy, wreaking devastation and terror.

                                     EATON
                         Good God!

                                     INDY
                         Yes. That's what the Hebrews thought.

                                     MUSGROVE
                         What's that supposed to be coming 
                         out of there?

                                     INDY
                         Who knows... lightning... fire... 
                         the power of God.

                                     EATON
                         I'm beginning to understand Hitler's 
                         interest in this thing.

                                     INDY
                         Oh yes. The Bible tells of it leveling 
                         mountains and wasting entire regions. 
                         Moses promised that when the Ark was 
                         with you, "your enemies will be 
                         scattered and your foes fell before 
                         you".
                              (pause)
                         An army which carries the Ark before 
                         it is invincible.

               Eaton and Musgrove exchange worried looks.

                                     INDY
                         Oh, there's one other thing that 
                         Hitler undoubtably believes about 
                         the Ark...
                              (a long pregnant pause)
                         It's said that the Lost Ark will be 
                         recovered at the time of the coming 
                         of the True Messiah.

                                     MUSGROVE
                         Dr. Jones, you've been very helpful. 
                         I hope we can call on you again if 
                         we have questions.

                                     INDY
                         Most certainly.

               Brody and Indy exchange a look as they all shake and Brody 
               starts to leave with the Army men.

               EXT. FRONT DOOR, INDY'S HOUSE - NIGHT

               Indy's English Tudor, upper middle class home. Quite toney; 
               well beyond the financial reach of an honest college 
               professor. Marcus Brody has already rung the bell. Indy opens 
               the door. He is dressed in a tuxedo.

                                     BRODY
                         I've got to talk to you.

                                     INDY
                         This isn't really a good time.

                                     BRODY
                         Indy, it's important.

                                     INDY
                         All right. Come on in.

               INT. FOYER, INDY'S HOUSE

               The lush tone continues here in Art Deco and shiny marble. 
               Indy motions Brody toward the study to one side.

                                     INDY
                         I'll be in a minute.

               As Brody passes the entrance to the expansive living room, 
               he spots a beautiful, silk-gowned Harlow-type lounging on 
               the sofa in front of a roaring fire. She is sipping champagne.

               INT. STUDY, INDY'S HOUSE

               Brody enters the book-lined, dark-wooded study. He paces for 
               a moment before the fire which is dying in the fireplace, 
               then spots something and goes over to Indy's big desk. The 
               surface is covered with open books, monographs, maps and 
               drawings - all about the Ark of the Covenant. Brody smiles; 
               he knows his friend very well. Indy comes in, closing the 
               door behind him. Brody turns to him with a triumphant 
               expression.

                                     BRODY
                         They want you to go for it. And 
                         they'll pay.

                                     INDY
                              (smiles)
                         Good work, Marcus. I had a feeling 
                         this would happen. And, of course, 
                         the Museum gets the Ark when we're 
                         done.

                                     BRODY
                              (smiles)
                         Of course.

               Indy's manner is vigorous, aggressive.

                                     INDY
                         Okay, here's the way it's gonna be. 
                         First, I'll high-tail it to Shanghai 
                         and get the piece from General Hok. 
                         Then I think I know where I can find 
                         Ravenwood. If only I can get -

                                     BRODY
                         General Hok's a tough customer. They 
                         don't call him the Wild Boar for 
                         nothing. And he's tied in with the 
                         Japanese.

                                     INDY
                         I'll worry about that when the time 
                         comes. My only hope is to find the 
                         Well of the Souls before the Nazis 
                         do.

                                                                   WIPE TO:

               A Pan Am Clipper flies west over the Pacific.

               INT. KEHOE'S CAR (SHANGHAI AIRPORT) - DAY

               Indy is barely into the front seat of a dilapidated Ford as 
               the driver, BUZZ KEHOE, is peeling out into traffic. In the 
               back seat is a Chinese named BANG CHOW. Kehoe zigs crazily 
               through traffic with only his left hand as he reaches over 
               to shake with Indy.

                                     KEHOE
                         Buzz Kehoe, Army Intelligence. You've 
                         met Bang Chow.

                                     INDY
                         What's the hurry?

                                     KEHOE
                         Some German agents got here two hours 
                         ago. Luckily, Bang was able to have 
                         them detained at Customs. We'll have 
                         to hurry.

               EXT. HOK'S STREET - DAY

               Kehoe's car emerges from an alley. Down the block is Tengtu 
               Hok's modest, walled palace. Kehoe's car slows a bit and 
               Bang steps from the moving car with a small black suitcase 
               in his hand. While he heads down the street toward Hok's 
               place, Kehoe's car continues across the street and into an 
               alley on the other side.

               EXT. HOK'S STREET - IN FRONT OF PALACE - DAY

               A Mercedes limousine appears round a corner and squeals to a 
               stop at the front gate of the palace, which is manned by a 
               sturdy Chinese Gateman. There are three Germans inside, one 
               the driver.

               EXT. ALLEY BEHIND HOK'S MUSEUM - DAY

               Kehoe, alone now, pushes a trash container casually into 
               position to hide a newly created hole in the rear wall of 
               Hok's Museum where several stone blocks have been removed. 
               He looks around and ambles back to the car.

               INT. HOK'S PALACE - ENTRY HALL

               The three Germans wait impatiently in a magnificent foyer. A 
               chime sounds and huge double doors open to reveal TENGTU 
               HOK, flanked by two uniformed Japanese Soldiers and a robed 
               Chinese Advisor. He wears a fantastic gold ornamental robe. 
               Despite the majesty, however, nothing can disguise the fact 
               that Hok is basically a wild, fat barbarian; an animal. Hok 
               and his escort group bow in what is the beginning of a long 
               welcoming ceremony. The Germans exchange impatient glances 
               but decide they should play it as it comes. They bow.

               INT. HOK'S MUSEUM

               No person in sight. Instead, we see a magnificent display of 
               ancient artifacts. Glass cases hold the velvet-couched pieces 
               at random spots on the shining marble floor. We hear an odd 
               sound. Near the floor on the rear wall of the museum, a steel 
               ventilation grate moves. A hand slides it gently across the 
               marble. Indy sticks his head out and looks around.

               INT. HOK'S PALACE - TEA ROOM

               The three Germans are being served tea and exotic delicacies. 
               A pleased Tengtu Hok watches from a throne-cushion. When the 
               tray of tiny delicacies is presented to him, he takes a 
               massive handful, crushing them together on their way to his 
               smiling mouth.

               INT. HOK'S MUSEUM

               A huge golden gong, seven feet in diameter, is suspended 
               from the ceiling by a hook. An enormous hammer hangs poised 
               above it, from which emanate myriad tiny threads which run 
               up and across the ceiling, then down to the various display 
               cases. Indy looks up at the gong, then continues his quick, 
               quiet foray among the cases. Beyond him, a high window.

               INT. HOK'S PALACE - TEA ROOM

               Hok and his visitors stand to go. The German's pleased 
               expressions make it clear they're finally on their way to 
               the museum.

               INT. HOK'S MUSEUM

               Indy arrives at his destination. The lovely, carved gold 
               section of the headpiece is nested on purple velvet in a 
               glass case. At the bottom of the piece is a round hollow 
               where the staff would fit. There is a grunting sound behind 
               Indy and he spins, already reaching for his revolver.

               A fierce Japanese Samurai is running at Indy full speed down 
               an aisle of display cases. His sword is raised over his 
               shoulder ready to cut Indy in half. He's six feet away when 
               Indy's gun levels and fires twice, blasting him backwards. 
               Indy is still looking over his gun when another samurai sword 
               comes down from the side and knocks the pistol brutally out 
               of Indy's grip; his hand avoids amputation by a quarter of 
               an inch.

               An amazed Indy backs away from the crossing aisle as the 
               Second Samurai steps in to face him, sword raised. Indy backs 
               away into an open space and his bullwhip appears in his hand. 
               He gives it one savage CRACK! to announce its arrival and 
               the Samurai slows down, eyeing it curiously. The Samurai 
               does not look unhappy about this confrontation. How pure it 
               is - The Sword versus The Whip.

               EXT. HOK'S PALACE - SECOND FLOOR WALKWAY - DAY

               Tengtu Hok and the Germans have obviously heard something. 
               They are hurrying along the walkway at the side of the 
               building, Hok in the lead. Up ahead is the foot bridge which 
               crosses from the palace to the museum entrance over a moat.

               EXT. STREET IN FRONT OF THE PALACE - DAY

               The Lovely Mercedes limousine blows up.

               EXT. HOK'S PALACE - SECOND FLOOR WALKWAY - DAY

               The Germans spin toward the blast. Drawing weapons, they run 
               back to investigate. Hok follows them, confused.

               INT. HOK'S MUSEUM

               Indy and the Samurai face each other. They're both breathing 
               hard from previous, no-contact passes at each other. Now 
               Indy begins swinging the whip over his head again. It whizzes 
               out toward the Samurai's face. The Samurai takes two lightning-
               quick cuts at the leather, but misses. Indy swings for the 
               Samurai's feet; the Japanese jumps nimbly, slashing at the 
               whip. Indy does it again. The Samurai hops it. Once more. 
               The Samurai is concentrating on hopping it.

               Indy sees it. The split second he wants. The whip flashes up 
               from the floor and wraps solidly and irrevocably around the 
               Samurai's neck. Indy gives it a murderous pull and the Samurai 
               is dead on his feet.

               EXT. HOK'S PALACE - SECOND FLOOR WALKWAY - DAY

               Hok and the three Germans are looking down at the flaming 
               remains of the Mercedes. A look of concern crosses Hok's 
               face. He turns and runs back toward his beloved museum.

               INT. HOK'S MUSEUM

               Indy is at the case containing the headpiece. He smashes the 
               glass with a samurai sword, reaches in and grabs the piece. 
               Immediately, behind him, the huge hammer falls and the sound 
               of the gong thunders through the museum.

               EXT. HOK'S PALACE - SECOND FLOOR WALKWAY - DAY

               At the sound of the gong, the running Hok skids to a halt 
               with a crazed expression on his face. He disappears for two 
               seconds in an alcove and emerges holding a big, black Thompson 
               Submachine Gun. He runs across the foot bridge and is just 
               barely over it when it blows up. Hok, safe, looks behind him 
               in amazement and then turns to the museum.

               INT. HOK'S MUSEUM

               The double doors at the entrance slam open to reveal Hok. 
               Indy is halfway along an unprotected wall back to his 
               ventilation entry route. Hok opens up on him, cutting off 
               his retreat. Indy jumps behind a marble column, which is 
               promptly blasted with machine gun fire.

               Indy looks above him, sees the giant disk of the gong. 
               Reaching up, pushing with tremendous effort, he maneuvers it 
               off the hook. It bounces down to the floor on its side, 
               chipping the marble with its monstrous weight. Indy steadies 
               it and then puts his whole body into rolling it across the 
               room toward the window. As it starts to roll, Indy slips 
               behind it and runs across the room with it.

               Hok can see the rolling gong. He opens up on it. The vicious 
               cacophony of machine gun fire is joined by the musical reports 
               of bullets hitting the gong and ricocheting away. Very, very 
               noisy.

               Behind the gong, Indy gauges his move. As the gong is about 
               to be stopped by a marble bench, Indy talks a long stride 
               onto the bench and dives through the glass of the high window. 
               Hok's bullets hit the wall.

               EXT. ROOF - DAY

               Indy lands in a shower of glass on the jutting roof of the 
               museum's first floor. He rolls to a crouch and is immediately 
               being fired upon. The Germans, cut off from the museum, are 
               standing on the palace walkway firing at him. Indy takes off 
               fast for the rear of the museum.

               EXT. ALLEY BEHIND MUSEUM - DAY

               Kehoe, craning to locate Indy, has the Ford rolling slowly 
               along the back of the museum. Bang scouts from the back seat. 
               Indy appears on the roof at a run, gauges the movement of 
               the car and jumps from the roof of the museum to the roof of 
               the sedan. Unfortunately, the roof of the old car can't take 
               it and Indy's legs knife right on through to the interior, 
               where he scares the hell out of Kehoe.

               INT. KEHOE'S CAR - DAY

               Indy squirms his way down into the front seat.

                                     KEHOE
                         Jesus! Are you all right!

                                     INDY
                              (he's felt better)
                         Great. Got it.

               Kehoe guns it, throwing Indy back against the cushions.

                                     KEHOE
                         What now?

                                     INDY
                         I've got to get to Nepal.

                                                                   WIPE TO:

               EXT. DC-3 IN THE AIR - DUSK

               The plane flies west into the sunset.

               INT. DC-3 - NIGHT

               Under a meager seat light, Indy is pouring over a journal 
               article by Abner Ravenwood and related map of Nepal.

               A few rows back, across the aisle, a trenchcoated European 
               Spy eyes Indy.

                                                                   WIPE TO:

               INT. "THE RAVEN" SALOON - PATAN, NEPAL - NIGHT

               A huge stuffed raven, wings spread wide, is mounted behind 
               the long bar in the noisy, crowded saloon. A lively mix of 
               patrons is represented in the late hour tableau: Nepalese 
               natives, fierce Sherpa mountain guides, sleazy international 
               smugglers and fugitives, and, of course, mountain climbers 
               from every corner of the earth. A tall Nepalese, MAHDLO, is 
               the bartender.

               In a corner near the fireplace trouble breaks out suddenly 
               between the groups at two neighboring tables. Ferocious 
               representatives from each table - one a wild-looking SHERPA, 
               the other a muscular Australian CLIMBER - jump up to face 
               each other. As the two contenders stand poised for action, 
               their respective supporters shift in their places, fondling 
               lethal ice axes and clubs.

                                     SHERPA
                         Gmoiska! Shurga rintoik!

                                     CLIMBER
                         Aye! That'll be your last word.

               The bar has quieted ominously and so we hear with startling 
               clarity when - a door behind the bar slams open with a huge 
               BANG! and some Presence, too small to be seen as it moves 
               through the forest of towering patrons, makes a beeline for 
               the troubled corner of the bar. A path clears for it.

               The Sherpa and the Climber are about to kill each other when 
               the Presence arrives directly between them: she is MARION 
               RAVENWOOD, twenty-five years old, beautiful, if a bit hard-
               looking. At this moment, however, that look does not hurt. 
               She is not intimidated by the combatants; she jabs accusatory 
               fingers into their chests. She is angry as hell. The patrons 
               shrink under her gaze.

                                     MARION
                         That does it! I've been patient with 
                         you no-goods long enough. I'm not 
                         open at 2 o'clock for myself, you 
                         know. It's all for you. And how do 
                         you repay me: Trouble and noise and 
                         blood on my floor! I won't have it. 
                         Everybody out! Out! Out! We're closed. 
                         Closed! Do your killing outside! And 
                         don't leave any bodies on the porch!

               The place clears quickly. Stragglers and grumblers are given 
               special attention by Marion and Mahdlo, who has come from 
               behind the bar carrying a big axe handle. Mahdlo herds the 
               crows out the front door as Marion turns and walks behind 
               the bar.

               A scowl on her lovely face, she has just begun clearing the 
               bar of glasses when she notices one remaining Patron huddled 
               over a glass at the far end of the bar. Grimacing in 
               exasperation, she heads that way like a locomotive.

                                     MARION
                         Hey you, deaf one! I said out of my 
                         place. I don't mean next Easter, I 
                         mean now -

               She is almost on him when Indy looks up smiling. Marion stops, 
               stares, shocked.

                                     INDY
                         Hello, Marion.

               She hits him with a solid right to the jaw, knocking him off 
               the barstool on the floor. He rubs his jaw and smiles up at 
               her.

                                     INDY
                         Nice to see you, too.

                                     MARION
                         Get up and get out.

                                     INDY
                              (getting up)
                         Take it easy. I'm looking for your 
                         father.

                                     MARION
                              (bitterly)
                         Well you're two years too late.

               Indy's attitude changes instantly. This is sad news. He is 
               silent for a long time. Mahdlo comes in the front door and 
               hurries forward when he sees Indy with Marion. He looks to 
               her for guidance, but she stays him with a gesture.

                                     MARION
                         Go home, Mahdlo. I'll see you 
                         tomorrow.

               Mahdlo is hesitant, but lays the axe handle on the bar and 
               goes out. Indy has been barely aware of him. Now he settles 
               again on the barstool. Marion has a vindictive look. She'll 
               let him stay, but she wants to inflict as much pain as 
               possible.

                                     INDY
                         What happened?

                                     MARION
                         Avalanche. Up there. He was digging. 
                         What else? He spent his whole life 
                         digging. Dragging me all over this 
                         rotten earth. For what?

                                     INDY
                         Do you find him?

                                     MARION
                         Hell no. He's buried where he was 
                         working. Probably preserved real 
                         good, too. In the snow.

               Suddenly the hardness cracks. She is on the verge of tears 
               and does not want him to see them. She turns away and takes 
               a whiskey bottle from the shelf, then turns back to pout 
               herself a drink.

                                     INDY
                         Not a bad way to go. Doing what he 
                         loved.

                                     MARION
                              (vitriolic)
                         Don't give me that stuff! What do 
                         you know?
                              (she takes a drinks)
                         I'm the one that was left in a bad 
                         way. He didn't have a penny. Guess 
                         how I lived, Mister Jones. I worked 
                         here. And I wasn't the bartender.
                              (another swallow)
                         Finally the guy that owned the joint 
                         went crazy. Snow crazy. They took 
                         his away screaming. As they dragged 
                         him out, he said the place was all 
                         mine for life.

               She looks around the saloon.

                                     MARION
                         Can you imagine a more evil curse?
                              (pause)
                         So far, it's working.

                                     INDY
                         Why not leave? Go back to the States.

                                     MARION
                         I'll go back. I'll get there. Not 
                         that there's a soul there who knows 
                         my name or cares. But I'll go. And 
                         when I do, they'll know me. 'Cause 
                         I'm going to go back in style. With 
                         money. A goddamn lady!

                                     INDY
                         Where you gonna get it?

                                     MARION
                         If I knew that, you think I'd still 
                         be running this dive?

               Indy looks at her, thinking. Under his gaze, she blushes, 
               for reasons only she understands. She looks into her glass 
               and, for a moment, she softens.

                                     MARION
                         I'll tell you something Indy. I've 
                         learned to hate you in the last ten 
                         years. But somehow, no matter how 
                         much I hated you, I always knew that 
                         someday you'd come through that door. 
                         I never doubted that. Something made 
                         is inevitable.
                              (hopefully)
                         Why are you here... now... tonight?

               Indy takes a long time to answer.

                                     INDY
                         I need one of the pieces your father 
                         collected.

               Marion's eyes go icy. She swings at him again with her right, 
               but this time he catches her at the wrist. Then he stops her 
               left, which she has brought up to slap him.

                                     MARION
                         You son-of-a-bitch! You know what 
                         you did to me, to my life? This is 
                         your handiwork.

                                     INDY
                         I never meant to hurt you.

                                     MARION
                         I was a child!

                                     INDY
                         You knew what you were doing.

                                     MARION
                         I was in love.

                                     INDY
                         I guess that depends on your 
                         definition.

                                     MARION
                         It was wrong. You knew it.

               Indy releases her arms.

                                     INDY
                         Look, I did what I did. I don't expect 
                         you to be happy about it. But maybe 
                         we can do each other some good.

                                     MARION
                         Why start now?

                                     INDY
                         Shut up and listen for a second. I 
                         want that piece your father had. 
                         I've got money.

               This stops her.

                                     MARION
                         How much?

                                     INDY
                         Enough to get you back to the States. 
                         Where are his things?

                                     MARION
                         Gone. I sold it all. It was all junk. 
                         The junk he wasted his life on.

                                     INDY
                         Everything?

               Marion nods.

                                     INDY
                              (giving up)
                         That's too bad.

               Indy feels tired, defeated. Marion is pleased.

                                     MARION
                         You look disappointed. I like that. 
                         How's it feel?

               Indy has to smile at her glee.

                                     MARION
                              (nods at his empty 
                              glass)
                         What are you drinking?

                                     INDY
                         Seltzer.

                                     MARION
                              (refilling his glass)
                         Real man's drink. Me, I like scotch. 
                         And I like bourbon. And vodka and 
                         gin. I'm not much for brandy. I'm 
                         off that.

               She pours herself another as Indy watches, amused.

                                     INDY
                         You're a tough broad now, aren't 
                         you?

                                     MARION
                         It's no act, pal. This ain't 
                         Schenectady.

                                     INDY
                         I can only say I'm sorry so many 
                         times.

               Marion looks at him thoughtfully, takes a drink.

                                     MARION
                         You really have money? You don't 
                         look rich.
                              (Indy nods)
                         I may be able to locate some of his 
                         things. I know who's got them. What 
                         do you want?

                                     INDY
                         A bronze piece, about this size. In 
                         the shape of the sun. Probably broken 
                         off at the bottom. Has a little hole 
                         in it, off-center. Does that sound 
                         familiar?

               Marion thinks, nods slowly.

                                     INDY
                         Do you know where it is?

                                     MARION
                         Maybe. How much?

                                     INDY
                         Three thousand. American.

                                     MARION
                              (negative)
                         That'll get me back, but not in style. 
                         This doodad must be pretty important.

                                     INDY
                         Maybe.

               A huge smile lights up Marion's face.

                                     MARION
                         I knew it would happen eventually. I 
                         knew it. Something had to go my way.
                              (pours herself another 
                              drink)
                         I've got to think this out. I'm used 
                         to bargaining with yaks.

                                     INDY
                         Okay, five thousand. That's all I 
                         can give you now. I can get you more 
                         when you land in the States.

                                     MARION
                         You word, huh?
                              (Indy nods)
                         Just like you said you'd be back 
                         last time? That was your word too.

                                     INDY
                         I'm back, aren't I?

               Marion sneers and they smile together.

                                     INDY
                         You can trust me.

                                     MARION
                         Come back tomorrow.

                                     INDY
                         Why?

                                     MARION
                         Because I said so, that's why. It's 
                         about time I called the shots in 
                         this relationship.

               Indy nods, gets up to go.

                                     MARION
                         Wait a minute. Leave the five thousand 
                         here.
                              (Indy hesitates)
                         You want trust, give some. I want to 
                         smell your money.

               Indy thinks about this a moment, then reaches inside his 
               shirt and pulls cash from a money belt. He lays five grand 
               on the bar.

                                     INDY
                         I trust you.

                                     MARION
                         You're an idiot.

                                     INDY
                         I've heard that.

               Indy starts for the door. Marion takes another think. She is 
               getting high.

                                     MARION
                         Hold it. Come here.

                                     INDY
                              (moving back)
                         Bossy, aren't you?

                                     MARION
                         That's right. Give me a kiss.

               Indy looks into her eyes, then leans over the bar and kisses 
               her deeply. When the kiss ends, their faces are very close. 
               Marion is flushed. She liked it and would like more. She 
               raises her glass between them to discipline herself.

                                     MARION
                         Get out of my place.

               Indy smiles and walks to the front door. Then, without looking 
               back -

                                     INDY
                         Tomorrow.

               He's gone. Marion stares after him, thinking. She takes a 
               drink. Then slowly, her hand comes up to loosen the scarf 
               that is draped around her throat. It falls away, revealing 
               her graceful neck above the dipping top of her blouse. Hanging 
               there on a gold chain against her white skin is a sun-shaped 
               golden medallion. The bottom looks broken off. Marion lifts 
               the medallion so she can see it in her hand, then looks 
               thoughtfully after Indy.

               EXT. STREETS OUTSIDE "THE RAVEN" - NIGHT

               Indy sits thinking at the wheel of an old car. Finally, he 
               puts the car in gear and drives away.

               Across the street, the shadow in a doorway comes to life. A 
               dark form steps out to look at Indy's departing car; it is 
               the European Spy from the DC-3. He hurries off in the opposite 
               direction.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               INT. "THE RAVEN" - NIGHT

               Marion stands before the fire that is shrinking in the 
               fireplace. She jabs at it abstractedly with a poker, thinking. 
               Suddenly tears well up in her eyes. She lets the poker slip 
               from her hand, wipes away the tears. She walks across the 
               room to the end of the bar, still cluttered with bottles and 
               glasses, and stops at the pile of American money Indy has 
               left. She takes the chain from around her neck and lets the 
               medallion slide off it into her hand. She places it on the 
               bar next to the pile of money, thinking. Then, having reached 
               some decision, she picks up the pile of bills, walks up the 
               back of the bar and pulls a small wooden box from under the 
               bar. She flips open the top, puts the cash inside and closes 
               the top. She leaves the box on the bar and starts back toward 
               the medallion. The front door of the saloon bursts open and 
               Four Bad Men come in. Marion, halfway between the valuable 
               possessions and not wishing to draw attention to either, 
               stops where she is.

               The Four Bad Men who advance on her are:

               1.) the obvious leader, a short, vile, sadistic German in 
               spectacles by the name of BELZIG.

               2.) a trenchcoated SECOND NAZI.

               3.) a ratty-looking NEPALESE and

               4.) a mean MONGOLIAN. The second NAZI and the MONGOLIAN both 
               carry submachine guns.

                                     BELZIG
                         Good evening, Fraulein.

                                     MARION
                         The bar's closed.

                                     BELZIG
                         We are not thirsty.

               The Mongolian and the Nepalese poke around, checking to make 
               sure there's no one else there.

               Down at the end of the bar, the medallion lies partially 
               hidden by surrounding glasses and bottles. The Second Nazi 
               stops very near it, but turns his back to it to face Belzig 
               and Marion.

                                     MARION
                         What do you want?

                                     BELZIG
                         The same thing your friend Dr. Jones 
                         wanted. Surely he told you there 
                         would be other interested parties.

               Marion shakes her head.

                                     BELZIG
                         Ah, the man is nefarious. I hope for 
                         your sake he has not yet acquired 
                         it.

                                     MARION
                         Why, are you willing to offer more?

                                     BELZIG
                         Almost certainly. Do you still have 
                         it?

                                     MARION
                         No. But I know where it is.

               Belzig's smile fades at this news. He's not a patient sort. 
               Marion is chilled by the look. She turns and moves to the 
               shelf of bottles behind her, reaching high for one, very 
               near the large stuffed raven. He hand lingers there a moment 
               and we see -

               From an angle behind the stuffed raven, that the left wing 
               spread hides a Baretta automatic pistol. Marion's hand is 
               very near it, but withdraws with only a whiskey bottle as 
               the Mongolian walks toward her behind the bar.

               Marion opens the bottle before Belzig, who watches her 
               intently.

                                     MARION
                         How 'bout a drink for you and your 
                         men?

               The Second Nazi lights up at this suggestion. Belzig gives 
               him a withering look.

                                     BELZIG
                         We will stick to the business at 
                         hand, Fraulein.

                                     MARION
                              (tough)
                         Fine. Why don't you come back tomorrow 
                         when Jones is here and we'll have an 
                         auction?

               Belzig gives her a cold look then turns and walks over toward 
               the fireplace. As soon as his back is turned, the Second 
               Nazi grabs the nearest whiskey bottle and takes a quick pull. 
               In so doing, he leaves the medallion completely exposed. 
               Marion is aware of this as she looks at him. But he quickly 
               puts the bottle down again, obscuring the medallion, when 
               Belzig speaks from the fireplace.

                                     BELZIG
                         I'm afraid an auction is not possible.
                              (pause)
                         Your fire is dying here, Fraulein.
                              (a beat, then 
                              threatening)
                         Why don't you tell us where the piece 
                         is right now?

                                     MARION
                         Listen, Herr Mac, I don't know who 
                         you're used to dealing with, but no 
                         one tells me what to do in my place.

               Belzig, still looking in the fire, sneers and shakes his 
               head.

                                     BELZIG
                         Americans! You're all alike. Fraulein 
                         Ravenwood. I'll show you want I'm 
                         used to.

               He motions with his hand. The Mongolian moves up behind Marion 
               and lifts her roughly over the top of the bar, knocking over 
               bottles and spilling liquor. He deposits her on the other 
               side, where the Nepalese and the Second Nazi flank her and 
               hold her cruelly, arms behind her back. Marion raises a 
               ruckus.

               Belzig turns from the fireplace. In his hand is the poker, 
               its end glowing orange. He advances on Marion. Marion stops 
               yelling, her eyes widen in terror.

                                     MARION
                         Wait! I can be reasonable -

                                     BELZIG
                         That time is passed.

               The glowing poker point moves inexorably across the room 
               toward Marion's face.

                                     MARION
                         You don't need that. I'll tell you 
                         everything!

                                     BELZIG
                         Yes, I know you will.

               Belzig has no intention of stopping now. The glowing tip is 
               approaching Marion's face. The Nepalese watches with savage 
               glee.

               The tip of the poker is five inches from Marion's nose when 
               there is a loud CRACK! and the fall of Indy's bullwhip wraps 
               around the middle of the poker and tears it out of Belzig's 
               hands. The poker sails high across the room, free of the 
               whip, and lands in the heavy curtains that cover one window. 
               The curtains immediately burst into flame.

               The four Bad Men look in surprise toward the front entrance. 
               Indy is poised there, the whip in his right hand, a .45 
               automatic raised toward them in his left.

                                     INDY
                         Hello.

               Now everything begins to happen very fast -

               The Mongolian had just come around the bar at the end opposite 
               the medallion. He dives back to crouch behind the end of the 
               bar, raising his submachine gun.

               Belzig and the Second German dive behind tables near the 
               bar. The Nepalese is slower to leave Marion, he draws a Luger. 
               Indy's .45 barks and the Nepalese dies spinning against the 
               bar. Indy fires in the direction of the Mongolian.

               Marion swings up over the top of her bar. Belzig fires at 
               her, but his bullets smash bottles behind the bar and thud 
               into the raven.

               Marion flattens out on the floor behind the bar as bullets 
               hit above her. She reaches up, snatches the axe handle from 
               where Mahdlo left it, and begins crawling down the length of 
               the bar toward -

               The Mongolian, who sticks his submachine gun out and fires 
               blindly in Indy's direction.

               Indy is in a crouch behind a table, trying to get a shot at 
               someone. He doesn't notice in the din and confusion when the 
               door bursts open. An incredible, fearsome GIANT SHERPA, almost 
               seven feet tall, soars in and tackles Indy from behind. The 
               whip flies from Indy's hand as he and the Giant Sherpa roll 
               across the floor, upsetting furniture.

               The Mongolian, seeing this, stands up confidently. Marion 
               rises behind him and bashes him over the head with the axe 
               handle. He goes down and out.

               Fire has completely engulfed the curtains and is working 
               across the ceiling on decorative yak skin bunting. A burning 
               fragment drops to the top of the bar, which immediately lights 
               up, fueled by the spilled alcohol. Full whiskey bottles 
               explode like Molotov cocktails.

               Rolling on the floor, Indy and the Giant Sherpa are fighting 
               for control of Indy's .45. Belzig sees this and shouts to 
               the Second Nazi, who is rising from cover with submachine 
               gun in hand.

                                     BELZIG
                         Shoot them both!

                                     SECOND NAZI
                         He's our man!

                                     BELZIG
                         Do as I say!

               Both the Giant Sherpa and Indy hear this. The Giant Sherpa 
               exchanges an alarmed look with Indy and together they swing 
               the .45 around toward the surprised Second Nazi. Two blasts 
               blow him away.

               That done, Indy brings a brass spittoon down on the Giant 
               Sherpa's wrist and the .45 slides away. Indy jumps up and 
               kicks the Giant Sherpa, who barely seems to feel it. He grabs 
               Indy and flips him effortlessly onto a table.

               Belzig now has a clear shot at Indy. He raises his luger.

               Marion, at the end of the bar, finally gets the hand of the 
               Mongolian's submachine gun. It roars to life in the general 
               direction of the ceiling.

               Belzig runs for cover as Marion gets control of the gun and 
               levels it. Belzig dives around the end of the bar opposite 
               Marion. When he has set himself, he peeks up over the edge 
               of the scorched bar. The alcohol fire has moved down the bar 
               and now, much to Belzig's surprise, he finds himself staring 
               at the fire-blackened sun-shaped medallion!

               His eyes widen. He cannot believe his good fortune. Without 
               hesitation he picks up the metal medallion, palming it. 
               Immediately there is a sickening searing sound and Belzig's 
               expression changes from joy to agony. He screams in pain and 
               tries to shake the red-hot medallion from his skin. Marion 
               opens up and the bar starts to splinter in front of Belzig. 
               The medallion comes free of Belzig's hand and rolls across 
               the floor.

               Belzig has had enough. In excruciating pain, he turns, sees 
               a window, runs and dives through the glass.

               An exhausted Indy uses his whole body to upend the Giant 
               Sherpa, who lands hard on his back. They are surrounded by 
               flames.

               EXT. "THE RAVEN" - SNOW BANK - NIGHT

               Belzig has his burned hand stuck deep in the snow. Now he 
               withdraws it, steaming, and scurries off into the night like 
               a wounded animal.

               INT. "THE RAVEN" - NIGHT

               Marion throws down the empty submachine gun and moves through 
               the flames to the center of the bar where she left the box 
               with the five grand. She finds the remains of the box and 
               its contents: a shapeless pile of ash and charred wood.

                                     MARION
                         Unbelievable!

               At the end of the bar, the Mongolian has come back to life. 
               He shakes out his head, then reaches inside his coat and 
               pulls out a Mauser pistol.

               Indy smashes a chair over the head of the Giant Sherpa and 
               the huge creature goes down.

               The Mongolian points his Mauser through the smoke and flame 
               at Indy. Suddenly, the Mongolian is shot dead.

               Marion stands beneath her stuffed raven with the Baretta.

               Indy moves quickly through the flames, his eyes scanning the 
               floor. He picks up his bullwhip and his crumpled felt hat. 
               He peers through the smoke till he spots Marion moving among 
               the burning furniture.

                                     INDY
                         Let's get out of here!

                                     MARION
                         Not without that piece you want!

                                     INDY
                         It's here?

               Marion nods, kicks aside a burning chair. Another burning 
               beam falls from the roof. Indy pulls Marion close to him 
               protectively.

                                     INDY
                         Forget it! I want you out of here. 
                         Now!

               He begins dragging her out.

                                     MARION
                              (pointing)
                         There!

               She breaks away from him, darts back and picks the hot 
               medallion up in the loose cloth of her blouse.

                                     INDY
                         Let's go!

                                     MARION
                              (looking around)
                         You burned down my place!

                                     INDY
                              (figuratively)
                         I owe you plenty!

                                     MARION
                              (literally)
                         You owe me plenty!

                                     INDY
                              (smiles)
                         You're something!

                                     MARION
                         I am something. And I'll tell you 
                         exactly what -

               She holds up the medallion possessively.

                                     MARION
                         I'm your partner!

               EXT. CAIRO - VARIOUS SHOTS - DAY

               First we see the sprawl, the soaring minarets, the ancient 
               skyline. Then we're closer, in the narrow, exotic streets, 
               teeming with life: fierce-looking men in tattered galabiyas, 
               black-gowned women with veiled faces, ragged, barefoot 
               children.

               INT. DINING ROOM - SALLAH'S HOUSE (OLD CAIRO)

               Indy and Marion have been welcomed like family into the 
               crowded home of SALLAH, his wife FAYAH, and their NINE 
               CHILDREN (ages 4 - 18). Fayah, a huge, imposing woman, 
               appears, at first glance, to be the power in the house. 
               Sallah, a small, cheerful, energetic fellow in his forties 
               defers to his wife in all matters of little importance. 
               Suddenly the general liveliness at the children's table 
               escalates into pandemonium, attracting the attention of the 
               adults.

                                     FAYAH
                         Silence!
                              (there is silence)
                         Why do you forget yourselves?

               The gaggle of grinning off-spring parts to reveal in their 
               midst - a MONKEY. It is munching some flat Arab bread.

                                     FAYAH
                         What is this? Who brought this animal 
                         in?

               All the children chatter their innocence at once. The Monkey 
               chatters too; it's an entertainer. The Monkey jumps from the 
               children's table to the adults' and struts slowly up toward 
               Marion, who thinks it's the cutest thing she ever saw. When 
               it reaches her, it takes off its turban and does a deep, 
               grand bow to her. She is delighted and takes the Monkey into 
               her arms. The Monkey kisses her cheek. The children laugh.

                                     MARION
                         Why, thank you. I like you too.

                                     FAYAH
                         Then it shall be welcome in our house.

                                     MARION
                         Oh, no! You don't have to have it 
                         around if you don't want it -

                                     SALLAH
                              (cheerfully)
                         All of Allah's creatures are welcome 
                         here. You please us by letting us 
                         please you.

               EXT. COURTYARD - SALLAH'S HOUSE - NIGHT

               Indy and Sallah sit in the small, protected courtyard. Sallah 
               holds the two sections of the headpiece, the medallion and 
               the base, and has for the first time fitted them together. 
               They fit perfectly and complete the headpiece. He peruses 
               the markings on the headpiece quizzically. Indy is cleaning 
               and loading a .45 automatic.

                                     INDY
                         I knew the Germans would hire you, 
                         Sallah. They couldn't have an 
                         excavation in the desert without the 
                         best digger in Egypt.

                                     SALLAH
                         All Arabs look alike to them, Indy.

                                     INDY
                         Tell me about the map room at Tanis.

                                     SALLAH
                         We found it three days ago. I broke 
                         through myself.

                                     INDY
                         Those Nazis are moving awfully fast.

                                     SALLAH
                         The Frenchman is helping them.

               Indy reacts.

                                     INDY
                         Belloq. So he got away from the 
                         Indians. This is going to be more 
                         interesting that I thought.

                                     SALLAH
                         I'm afraid this has put the Germans 
                         close to finding the Well of the 
                         Souls.

                                     INDY
                              (indicates the 
                              headpiece)
                         Even Belloq won't be able to find it 
                         without that. Can you make anything 
                         of those markings? They're nothing 
                         I'm familiar with.

                                     SALLAH
                              (shakes his head "no")
                         But I know someone who might. You 
                         can go to see him tomorrow.
                              (a worried expression)
                         Indy... something bothers me.

                                     INDY
                         What is it, my friend?

               Sallah finds it hard to say. When he finally speaks, his 
               words are accompanied by a strange, eerie, foreboding rush 
               of wind through the courtyard. Just a coincidence we might 
               suppose.

                                     SALLAH
                         It is the Ark. If it is there, at 
                         Tanis... It is not something man was 
                         meant to disturb... Death has always 
                         surrounded it. It is not of this 
                         earth.

               The wind dies down. Indy shakes off a chill and stares 
               thoughtfully at his friend.

               EXT. HEAVILY TRAFFICKED CAIRO STREET - DAY

               Indy and Marion are briskly walking along one of Cairo's 
               busy bazaar streets. Vendors with fine cloth, pottery, 
               baskets, jewelry, etc line the street. Marion has the Monkey 
               from Sallah's house on her shoulder.

                                     INDY
                         Do you really need that monkey?

                                     MARION
                         I'm surprised at you, Indy. Talking 
                         that way about our baby. He's got 
                         your looks, too.

                                     INDY
                         And your brains.

               As Indy and Marion turn a corner, the Monkey seems to notice 
               something and immediately jumps from Marion's shoulder and 
               hurries off at a frantic pace down the street.

                                     MARION
                              (looking disappointed)
                         Hey! Hey!... where're you going?

                                     INDY
                              (dragging Marion on)
                         He'll be OK. Come on. Come on.

               EXT. ANOTHER CAIRO STREET - DAY

               The Monkey is seen running around another corner and jumps 
               into the waiting arms of MONKEY MAN, who appears to be like 
               a beggar with a dirty turban and an eye patch. Monkey Man 
               immediately hurries down the street and passes into a 
               building. In the building are two GERMAN AGENTS. Monkey Man 
               and the Monkey both give the Heil Hitler salute and engage 
               in quick talk.

               Monkey Man quickly leaves the two German Agents and gets 
               back to the street. He is obviously shadowing Indy and Marion. 
               Indy and Marion are just now passing by the Monkey Man ducks 
               back behind some baskets.

               EXT. ANOTHER BUSY CAIRO STREET - DAY

               Indy and Marion are passing under a balcony where a lone 
               GERMAN AGENT stands watch. After they pass, the Agent nods 
               to some BAD ARABS who are hiding in the shadows of the street. 
               In a moment, Indy and Marion pass by the break. Monkey Man 
               turns and looks up at a roof further down the alley. He waves 
               with his hand. Someone up there waves back.

               EXT. A SMALL BAZAAR - DAY

               Indy and Marion have reached a tiny square, made even more 
               cramped by its use as a small bazaar. They have started 
               working their way through the crowd when several Bad Arabs 
               and a German Agent begin to converge on them. Indy immediately 
               sees what's happening and pulls the bull whip from his jacket. 
               The first Bad Arab to reach them gets hit in the mouth by 
               the handle of the whip. Now all hell breaks loose, with Bad 
               Arabs, Innocent Shoppers, baskets of fruit and tables of 
               goods flying every which way in the constricted space.

                                     INDY
                              (to Marion)
                         Run! Get out of here!

               Indy catches a dagger-wielding Bad Arab around the legs with 
               the whip and flips him. Marion is reluctant to leave Indy.

                                     INDY
                         Go, dammit! Go!

               Marion goes. She runs off between two buildings. A Bad Arab 
               takes off after her. Monkey Man, now standing at the edge of 
               the square, points at Marion. The Monkey jumps off his 
               shoulder and follows Marion.

               EXT. BETWEEN THE BUILDINGS - DAY

               Marion runs along the narrow space and soon encounters a 
               five foot wall. She flops over it. The Bad Arab is right on 
               her heels. He reaches the wall and vaults over. On the other 
               side of the wall, the Bad Arab lands in a crouch, looks ahead 
               and doesn't see Marion. Immediately a heavy earthen pot 
               smashes over his head, putting him out. Marion steps from an 
               alcove and starts to run toward the street at the other end 
               of the walkway. Suddenly another Bad Arab and a new German 
               Agent appear in the street at that end. Before they can spot 
               her, Marion retreats to the alcove again. There is a huge 
               rattan basket sitting there. Marion climbs in and closes the 
               top above her.

               The only witness: The Monkey, who is now perched on the fire 
               foot wall.

               EXT. THE SMALL BAZAAR - DAY

               Chaos. An entire booth of pots and pans collapses on a Bad 
               Arab and a German Agent as Indy whips away a support.

               EXT. BETWEEN THE BUILDINGS - DAY

               The chattering Monkey leads a German Agent and two Bad Arabs 
               to Marion's hiding place, gesturing maniacally.

               EXT. THE SMALL BAZAAR - DAY

               Indy ducks under the swinging blade of a huge Arabian sword 
               and kicks the Bad Arab Swordsman in the groin.

               EXT. SIDE STREET - DAY

               The German Agent leads the way as the two Bad Arabs carry 
               the huge basket above their heads. The basket top has been 
               fastened closed, but Marion is making a fuss inside. At the 
               place where the street cuts across the far side of the bazaar, 
               Marion is able to wedge the top open one inch and screams -

                                     MARION
                         Indy-y-y-y!

               EXT. THE SMALL BAZAAR - DAY

               Indy has heard her. He looks across the square as the basket 
               and its escorts disappear beyond a building. One last Bad 
               Arab rises before him. Indy's whip flashes and the Bad Arab's 
               robe falls down to his ankles. Indy frantically pushes his 
               way through the panicked mass of humanity in the direction 
               the basket has gone.

               EXT. THE FOOT CHASE - INTERCUTTING INDY AND THE MOVING 
               BASKET - DAY

               The Bad Guys move the basket as fast as they can through 
               streets, alleys and passageways thick with people. Indy always 
               seems to round a corner just in time to catch a glimpse of 
               the basket before it disappears around a new corner. Indy 
               must fight a flow of humanity as powerful as an ocean riptide. 
               Finally, at the head of one particularly crowded alley, Indy 
               leaps up onto a wall for a clearer view. Whatever he sees 
               gives him an idea and he cuts between two buildings rather 
               than following the basket.

               EXT. DESERTED ALLEY - DAY

               Two Bad Arabs come running down the Alley with the basket 
               between them. Suddenly, Indy's whip flashes out sending both 
               Arabs and the basket tumbling. Indy steps into view, his .45 
               trained on the sprawled Arabs, and looks at the basket. The 
               top has come flying off and the contents have clattered onto 
               the cobblestone: inside is not Marion, but a load of 
               contraband pistols, rifles and ammo. Indy is advancing on 
               the trembling Bad Arabs with an ugly look when suddenly he 
               hears Marion scream around the corner.

               EXT. DESERTED SQUARE - DAY

               Indy rounds the corner and is immediately driven back by 
               machine gun fire. Taking cover, he gets quick, intermittent 
               glimpses of this scene: At the far corner of the large, 
               deserted square is a canvas-covered truck. Two Bad Arabs are 
               hurrying toward is with a large rattan basket between them, 
               Marion screaming inside. A German Agent is covering their 
               retreat with a machine gun from the cab of the truck. Indy 
               runs up to see the rattan basket being heaved into the back 
               of the truck.

               EXT. BACK OF THE TRUCK - DAY

               What Indy cannot see is that the basket lands among an ominous 
               load of German munitions, dynamite and firearms. The truck 
               immediately peels out.

               EXT. DESERTED SQUARE - DAY

               The German Agent has stopped firing in order to drive. He 
               floors it, aiming for a street at the corner of the square. 
               Indy uses the lull to take careful aim at the German Agent's 
               profile and fire off three careful shots. The German Agent 
               is hit, blasted dead against the steering wheel. The speeding 
               truck swerves, hits a wall, rolls over and explodes in an 
               enormous, multi-leveled eruption as its contents ignite. 
               Several surrounding buildings are leveled.

               Indy, blown back across the square, looks on, astounded and 
               horror-stricken.

                                     INDY
                         Marion.

               INT. ARAB BAR - NIGHT

               A dark, smoke-filled den on iniquity. The patrons, almost 
               all fearsome Arabs, sit in small shadowy groups around the 
               room. Indy stands at the bar finishing off a fifth of bourbon. 
               He is drunk. The ARAB BARTENDER places a new bottle of 
               expensive bourbon in front of him. Indy eyes is queerly.

                                     ARAB BARTENDER
                         The gentleman in the corner sent it. 
                         He would like you to join him.

                                     INDY
                              (doesn't even look)
                         Too bad. I'm drinking alone.

               The Arab Bartender does a take, looking at the three, tough 
               GERMAN HENCHMEN who have surrounded Indy from out of the 
               smoke, their hands stuffed in bulging trenchcoat pockets. 
               Indy notices them now with a bleary glance. He decides he's 
               in no shape to kill or be killed and moves with them across 
               the room, taking his bottle with him. The Arab patrons take 
               this in and mind their own business.

               The occupant of the smoke-shrouded corner table becomes 
               visible only as Indy reaches there: it is Emile Belloq. He 
               is drinking wine.

                                     INDY
                         Belloq.

                                     BELLOQ
                         Good evening, Dr. Jones.

                                     INDY
                         I ought to kill you right now.

                                     BELLOQ
                         It was not I who brought the girl 
                         into this dirty business.

               Indy knows its true; that's what's tearing him up.

                                     BELLOQ
                         Sit down, please, before you fall 
                         down. We can behave as civilized 
                         people. I'm afraid it will be your 
                         last opportunity.

               Indy sits, glancing at the German Henchmen, who settle nearby, 
               just out of earshot.

                                     INDY
                         Not a very private place for a murder.

                                     BELLOQ
                              (looking around)
                         These Arabs will not interfere in 
                         the white man's business. They do 
                         not care if we kill each other off.
                              (takes a sip of wine, 
                              refers to it)
                         Terribly difficult finding a decent 
                         vintage here. You were quite vigorous 
                         in Shanghai. Unfortunately, our friend 
                         the Wild Boar had taken the precaution 
                         of making several copies of the piece.

               Indy registers this as he takes a drink. Belloq watches him 
               with disdainful amusement.

                                     BELLOQ
                         How odd that is should end this way 
                         for us, after so many... stimulating 
                         encounters. I almost regret it. Where 
                         shall I find a new adversary so close 
                         to my own level?

                                     INDY
                         Try the local sewer.

                                     BELLOQ
                         I know you despise me. We always 
                         hate in others that which we most 
                         fear in ourselves. And you and I are 
                         very much alike.

                                     INDY
                         Now you're getting nasty.

                                     BELLOQ
                         We have always done the same kind of 
                         work. Our methods have not differed 
                         as much as you pretend. I am a shadowy 
                         reflection of you. But it would have 
                         taken only a nudge to make you the 
                         same as me, to push you out of the 
                         light.

               There's a certain amount of truth to this; the recognition 
               of it flickers across Indy's bleary eyes. Belloq sees it 
               there.

                                     BELLOQ
                         You know it to be true! How nice. 
                         And how ironic the timing.

               Belloq leans forward, eyes shining, voice suddenly different.

                                     BELLOQ
                         Do you realize what the Ark is?
                              (very intense)
                         It's a transmitter. A radio for 
                         talking to God! And now it is within 
                         my grasp.

                                     INDY
                         What about your boss, der Fuhrer? I 
                         thought he was waiting to take 
                         possession.

               Belloq glances into the gloom at the German Henchmen.

                                     BELLOQ
                              (quieter)
                         When the time is right. When I am 
                         finished with it.

                                     INDY
                         I hope your friends are patient. 
                         Dangerous work, Belloq.

                                     BELLOQ
                         Yes. Very. You may consider yourself 
                         fortunate that your involvement 
                         concludes here.

                                     INDY
                         Tell me, did you get away with the 
                         idol?

                                     BELLOQ
                              (negative)
                         I was lucky to get away with my life. 
                         The Hovitos proved quite narrow-minded 
                         about the whole matter.

               Indy takes a drink.

                                     INDY
                         You know, if it's God you want to 
                         talk to, maybe I can arrange it.

                                     BELLOQ
                              (smiles)
                         You have not changed. But, please, 
                         do not reach for your weapon until 
                         you are ready to die.

               The front door of the bar slams open and all nine of SALLAH'S 
               CHILDREN scamper in and over to a surprised Indy. Two of the 
               smallest hop into his lap.

                                     LITTLE SON
                         Uncle Indy, we have been looking for 
                         you.

                                     LITTLE DAUGHTER
                         Come home now, Uncle. Hurry!

               Suddenly the Arab patrons of the bar take an intense interest 
               in the situation, shifting their weapons.

                                     INDY
                         Yes. Yes, I'll come now.

               Indy stands up. The German Henchmen and poised. Belloq eyes 
               the Arab patrons and signals for the Henchmen to relax.

                                     BELLOQ
                         Next time, Indiana Jones, it will 
                         take more than children to save you.

               The children usher Indy out.

               INT. SALLAH'S TRUCK - IN FRONT OF ARAB BAR - NIGHT

               Indy climbs into the cab of Sallah's truck with a smiling 
               Sallah as the children pile into the back. Sallah pulls out.

                                     SALLAH
                         I thought we would find you there.
                              (indicating the kids)
                         Better than the United States Marines, 
                         eh?

                                     INDY
                              (nods)
                         Thanks you.
                              (grave)
                         Marion's dead.

                                     SALLAH
                         Yes, I know. I am sorry.
                              (pause)
                         More reason than ever to beat the 
                         bastards.
                              (he touches Indy)
                         Life goes on, Indy.
                              (indicates the kids 
                              again)
                         There is the proof.

               Indy looks back there, nods.

                                     SALLAH
                         I have much to tell you, Indy.

               INT. SALLAH'S HOUSE

               Fayah brings in a tray of food and puts it on the table. The 
               bowl of dates is in one corner. As Fayah leaves the room, 
               the Monkey slips out of Sallah's lap and disappears under 
               the table. Indy leans over the food tray, his hand hovering 
               over the dates. But he chooses some cheese and bread instead.

                                     INDY
                         And they made the calculation in the 
                         map room?

                                     SALLAH
                              (nods vigorously)
                         This morning. Belloq and the boss 
                         German, Shliemann. When they came 
                         out of the map room, we were given a 
                         new spot in which to dig... out away 
                         from the camp.

                                     INDY
                              (resigned)
                         The Well of the Souls.

               Sallah nods, moves to the food. He picks up a date, then 
               changes his mind and drops it, taking a bunch of grapes 
               instead. Indy picks up a chicken leg in one hand and a date 
               in the other, his mind distracted. Fayah enters the room 
               just in time to see Indy flip the date high into the air and 
               try to catch it in his mouth. It bounces off his chin and 
               falls to the floor. Indy looks sheepishly at Fayah. Fayah 
               picks up the fallen date and puts it in the dirty ash tray 
               she is now removing. Amir speaks in a slow, raspy voice 
               without looking up.

                                     AMIR
                         Come. Look.

               The two men go and huddle over the old man. The Monkey peeks 
               up over the edge of the table at the array of food. He picks 
               up a date and disappears below the table. Amir points to 
               some markings on the lower part of the headpiece.

                                     AMIR
                         This is a warning... not to disturb 
                         the Ark of the Covenant.

                                     INDY
                         Just want I need.

               The Monkey's paw comes up over the edge of the table and 
               grabs another date.

                                     INDY
                         How 'bout the height of the staff? 
                         Did Belloq get it off of there?

                                     AMIR
                         Yes... it is here.

               Indy, nervous, goes back to the food tray, picks up another 
               date. When he turns back to the men, the Monkey's paw grabs 
               another date.

               We see the headpiece in closeup on the table. Amir's crooked 
               fingers trace a line of markings along the bottom section to 
               the break in the piece.

                                     AMIR
                         It says it is... ten jamirs high...

                                     SALLAH
                         About seventy-five inches.

                                     AMIR
                         Wait! I am not finished...

               Amir's finger moves across the break as the markings continue 
               on the sun medallion.

                                     AMIR
                              (reading)
                         "And one jamir to honor the Hebrew 
                         God whose Ark this is."

               Indy, still holding the date, exchanges a long look with 
               Sallah.

                                     INDY
                         You said their top section was blank. 
                         Are you absolutely sure?

               Sallah nods.

                                     INDY
                         Belloq's staff is seven and a half 
                         inches short. They're digging in the 
                         wrong spot!

               Sallah and Indy begin to laugh. Amir gives them a glance and 
               returns to his wine. Sallah leans over and kisses the old 
               man.

                                     SALLAH
                              (to Amir)
                         A home run, my friend, grand slam!
                              (to Indy)
                         We have a saying - "A little luck is 
                         better than much smartness." Indy, 
                         pardner, you are very lucky fellow.

               Indy hoots. Then he takes the data in his hand and flips it 
               high in the air. He opens his mouth to catch it, but it 
               doesn't come down. He has inadvertently thrown it into a 
               bowl of a hanging lamp. This makes the men laugh even harder.

               Indy goes over and picks up another date. He turns laughing 
               to Sallah and doesn't see as the Monkey's paw comes up, 
               slowly, takes another date and begins to withdraw. Suddenly 
               the paw is stricken with palsy and the unseen Monkey goes 
               into its death throws. Sallah watches the paw as though 
               hypnotized. Finally the paw slips from sight and we hear a 
               solid THUMP! on the floor. Sallah walks around the table and 
               looks at the floor. The Monkey lies dead among a mess of 
               date pits.

               Indy is in a happy world of his own. He throws his date high 
               in the air. He positions himself under it and waits for it 
               to drop in. Here it comes. Right on target. As it's about to 
               disappear into Indy's mouth, Sallah's hand flashes in and 
               grabs it. Indy looks mystified and disappointed. Sallah 
               motions toward the dead Monkey.

                                     SALLAH
                         Bad dates.

               EXT. DESERT ROAD - MORNING

               Two old trucks come down a narrow mountain road and onto the 
               flat surface of the desert.

               Further out into the desert, the one in the lead, Sallah's 
               truck, stops and the second one, Omar's truck, pulls up beside 
               it. There are half dozen Arab Diggers in Omar's truck. Indy, 
               dressed as an Arab, gets out of the cab of Sallah's truck 
               and moves over to confer with OMAR, another old friend. They 
               point off into the desert and reach some conclusion. Indy 
               gives him a pat on the back; Omar turns off the road and 
               drives into the desert with his workers. Indy hops back in 
               the cab of Sallah's truck with Sallah. As they move down the 
               road we see that the back of the truck holds three other 
               Arab Diggers.

               EXT. RISE ABOVE THE TANIS DIGS - MORNING

               Indy and Sallah are lying in classic shouting fashion at the 
               top of the rise looking down on the Tanis Digs. Down behind 
               them, Sallah's truck is parked with the three Arab Diggers.

                                     INDY
                         My God! They aren't kidding!

               WHAT HE SEES

               The Tanis Digs are laid out below like a painting. Trucks, 
               bulldozers, Arab workers and German supervisors are 
               everywhere. The excavations themselves are extensive and 
               somewhat random-holes have been dug and then abandoned, 
               foundations and passageways unearthed and then deserted. 
               Beyond the main digs, a crude airstrip has been created. 
               Sallah points to what appears to be a mound of dirt with a 
               hole in it near the center of the activity.

                                     SALLAH
                         There! That is the map room!

                                     INDY
                         What time does the sun hit the map?

                                     SALLAH
                         Just after eight.

                                     INDY
                         We haven't got much time. Where are 
                         the Germans digging for the Well of 
                         the Souls?

               Sallah points out into the desert a short way beyond the 
               main area of activity. The desert turns to sand dunes out 
               there, the surface undulating into the distance. Several 
               trucks and men are out there and a bulldozer is lumbering 
               noisily toward it.

                                     INDY
                         Okay. Let's go.

               EXT. THE TANIS DIGS - MORNING

               Sallah's truck drives through the camp, one of the Arab 
               Diggers at the wheel. Indy and Sallah are in the back and 
               look just like the other two Arab Diggers. Sallah's truck 
               does behind a tent and when it appears on the other side, 
               Indy and Sallah are gone.

               EXT. AMONG THE TENTS - MORNING

               Indy and Sallah move stealthily among the tents. Indy carries 
               a smooth wooden staff almost seven feet tall. They stop 
               between two tents and look across a path at the entrance to 
               the map room. What appeared to be a mound of dirt is actually 
               the roof on the ancient building. The hole/entrance is a 
               five-foot square skylight. Indy looks around, then walks 
               casually to the edge of the hole and looks inside. Sallah 
               joins him, producing a length of rope from his robes. Indy 
               drops the staff into the unseen map room as Sallah ties the 
               rope around on oil drum. When it's secure, Indy wastes no 
               time disappearing down it into the map room.

               INT. MAP ROOM

               Indy is down the twenty feet to the floor of the room in 
               seconds. He tugs on the rope and it immediately gets pulled 
               up. Indy looks around with real wonder and excitement. The 
               room is lovely, with elaborate wall carvings and frescoes, 
               all lit by the bright stream of sunlight flooding in from 
               above. This beam of light leads Indy's eye to the far end, 
               and the room's truly remarkable feature: built into the floor 
               in meticulous relief is a miniature stone model of the ancient 
               city of Tanis. Already, the sunlight has worked its way down 
               the far wall and is edging onto the miniature of the city. 
               On the floor, to the skylight side of the miniature, is an 
               elaborate line created by embedded mosaic tiles. The evenly 
               spaced slots in the line, each accompanied by a symbol of a 
               time of year, are for the base of the staff. Indy pulls the 
               headpiece from his robes - it has been welded together - and 
               reaches for the staff.

               EXT. ABOVE THE MAP ROOM - DAY

               An extremely nervous Sallah has the gathered rope in his 
               hands and is trying to appear casual as he inches back toward 
               the oil drum. There is now a good bit of activity going on 
               up here.

                                     JEEP GERMAN (O.S.)
                         Hey! You, the skinny one!

               Sallah jumps about three feet. The JEEP GERMAN is standing 
               in an open space ten yards away looking at Sallah.

                                     JEEP GERMAN
                         Yes, you. What are you doing there?

               Sallah gestures his innocence.

                                     JEEP GERMAN
                         Well bring that rope over here, you 
                         cur.

               The Jeep German starts back toward his major concern: his 
               jeep is stuck in some sand beyond the next tent. Some Arab 
               Workers are trying in vain to budge it. Now another German 
               has backed his truck up to it. Sallah can think of nothing 
               to do expect obey. With a worried glance at the map room, be 
               begins untying the rope from the oil drum.

               INT. THE MAP ROOM

               Indy is examining the results of Belloq's work. Red paint 
               marks one of the miniature buildings in the layout and a 
               white calibrated tape has been strung from that building 
               back to a miniature of the map room. Now Indy begins examining 
               the mosaic base line for the staff. Sunlight has moves further 
               down across the miniature.

               EXT. IN THE CAMP - DAY

               Sallah watches nervously as his precious rope is pulled taut 
               between the pulling truck and the stuck jeep. He doesn't 
               notice that he has chosen to stand next to a large, steaming 
               kettle of food until -

                                     HUNGRY GERMAN (O.S.)
                         Bring us some of that!

               He points to the kettle. Sallah looks frantically from the 
               rope, back to the skylight of the map room, to the kettle of 
               food.

                                     HUNGRY GERMAN
                         Now, idiot!

               Sallah picks up some serving pieces and gets to work.

               INT. THE MAP ROOM

               The moment has arrived. Even the tension of the circumstances 
               cannot distract Indy from the purity of what he is about to 
               do. All his calculations are adjustments complete, Indy takes 
               the Staff of Ra and places it - CLINK! - in the right 
               depression on the base line. This is as active and exciting 
               a moment as any archeologist can dream of and, at heart, 
               that is exactly what Indy is. The sunlight catches the very 
               top of the headpiece and moves within a fraction of an inch 
               of the tiny hole in its sun.

               The edge of the sunlight moving across the miniature city is 
               still a good two feet beyond the spot Belloq has settled on. 
               And now that line of light is broken by the shadow of an 
               ornate sun at the top of the staff.

               Indy's face reflects his concentration. And then his immense 
               pleasure. He sees what he came for.

               Out of the miniature city, one small building is being lit 
               by a tiny beam of sunlight in the center of the shadow of 
               the metal sun. And by some trick of ancient artistry, this 
               one building responds to the sunlight like none of the others. 
               The golden light permeates it: it seems to glow. The building 
               is in a direct line with Belloq's - all the Frenchman's other 
               calculations were right - but it is a foot and a half beyond 
               it.

               EXT. IN THE CAMP - DAY

               Sallah, sweating profusely, has finished serving the line of 
               Breakfasting Germans and now heads back to replace the kettle 
               and get away.

                                     HUNGRY GERMAN
                         Water. Bring us water.

               INT. MAP ROOM

               Indy is on his knees at the miniature city, a special tape 
               measure in his hand. Indy has the tape strung from Belloq's 
               mistaken spot to his own correct spot. He gets his reading, 
               leaps up and crosses to the erect staff. He pulls the 
               headpiece off the staff and hides it in his robes. He quickly 
               breaks the wooden staff in two and throws the pieces behind 
               a pile of debris. Then he moves quickly to beneath the 
               skylight.

                                     INDY
                              (stage whisper)
                         Sallah.
                              (he waits, then louder)
                         Sallah!

               More waiting. Nothing. Indy looks around for some alternative 
               means of escape. The room doesn't offer any. He looks up at 
               the skylight again.

                                     INDY
                              (loudest)
                         Sallah!

               A long pause. Then something comes down. A makeshift rope. 
               Really just a bunch of clothing tied together - tunics, robes, 
               pants. But what we see first and most prominently, the first 
               section of Indy's escape rope, is a bright Nazi flag. Indy 
               beams and climbs.

               EXT. ABOVE THE MAP ROOM - DAY

               Indy sticks his head out the skylight, sees it clear and 
               flops his body out. Sallah, crouching behind the oil drum, 
               immediately starts pulling in the makeshift rope. Sallah 
               stuffs the rope in the oil drum and the two men begin waking 
               toward some tents.

                                     HUNGRY GERMAN (O.S.)
                         Hey, you! More water over here!

               Sallah glances at Indy, Then hurries back in that direction. 
               The Hungry German focuses on Indy.

                                     HUNGRY GERMAN
                         Why aren't you at the digs? Come 
                         here!

               Indy bows in wild subservience and hurries off in the opposite 
               direction.

                                     HUNGRY GERMAN
                              (yelling after him, 
                              irritated)
                         No, dummkopf, I said come!

               EXT. BETWEEN TWO TENTS - DAY

               Indy hustles between the tents. Up ahead, two German Officers 
               stop to talk, blocking his exit. He moves along the side of 
               one of the tents until he finds an opening and slips inside.

               INT. THE TENT

               Indy finds himself in a tent set up for rather comfortable 
               living. He has just started to cross it when he hears a loud, 
               excited grunting. He turns toward the sound. In the corner, 
               tied to a chair and gagged is Marion. Indy rushes to her, 
               snatches the gag from her mouth and embraces her. They kiss, 
               deep and long.

                                     INDY
                         I though you were dead.

                                     MARION
                         They were throwing me around like a 
                         rag doll.

                                     INDY
                         They must have switched baskets. 
                         Thank god for that! Bless those 
                         bastards. Have they hurt you?

                                     MARION
                         No. Not since I got here. They just 
                         asked about you - what you knew. The 
                         Frenchman's got the hot's for me. 
                         I've been playing that along. Oh, 
                         Indy, get me out of here.

               Indy pulls out a knife and then stops suddenly, thinking.

                                     MARION
                         What's wrong?

                                     INDY
                              (putting the knife 
                              away)
                         I have to leave you here for a little 
                         while. I know where the Ark is. If I 
                         take you out of here they'll start 
                         combing the place for us.

                                     MARION
                              (louder)
                         Cut me loose!

                                     INDY
                         Keep your voice down.

                                     MARION
                              (screaming)
                         I said get me out of -

               Indy pops the gag back in her mouth. Her eyes widen in fury 
               and she grunts obscenities at him.

                                     INDY
                         Look, you don't know how glad I am 
                         to see you. And I don't like doing 
                         this. But the whole thing will be 
                         shot if you don't just sit here 
                         quietly. They haven't hurt you in 
                         the last twenty-four hours, they 
                         aren't going to start now. I'll be 
                         back to get you in no time.

               He kisses her forehead, jumps up and hurries out of the tent.

               EXT. SAND DUNE OUTSIDE DIGS - DAY

               With the digs behind them, Indy and Sallah run up to the 
               ridge of the dune and over the top. At the bottom of the far 
               side, Omar's truck is parked. Omar and his men are waiting.

               EXT. DIFFERENT DUNE - DAY

               This new spot gives Indy a higher, better view of the whole 
               scene. Indy is using a surveyor's instrument to take a reading -

               WHAT HE SEES

               Looking through the instrument, Indy gets a line from the 
               map room through the site where the Nazis are digging in the 
               dunes to a spot several dunes over. We focus on that virgin 
               spot of well-hidden sand as -

                                     INDY
                         There!

               EXT. INDY'S DIG - DAY

               Omar's truck is parked at the spot just viewed from afar. 
               Dunes rise on either side. One of Omar's men has been posted 
               as a lookout up on a ridge. Everybody else - Indy, Sallah, 
               Omar, and his men - have begun digging for the Wells of the 
               Souls.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               SAME SCENE - NIGHT

               They continue to dig furiously, all of them drenched in sweat. 
               The hole has grown but this is slow, back-breaking work.

               INT. COMMAND TENT - TANIS DIGS - NIGHT

               Belloq, SHLIEMANN the ranking Nazi, and Shliemann's Aide, 
               GOBLER, come into the tent, which is full of charts and maps, 
               drawings of the Ark, radio equipment, liquor and food. The 
               men have been out digging for the Well all day. They are 
               tired, discouraged, testy. In all matters, Gobler shows his 
               alliance with Shliemann against Belloq with small looks and 
               body language. The Frenchman has disappointed them and he is 
               feeling the isolation of a scapegoat. Belloq gets himself a 
               drink as Shliemann towels off his face.

                                     BELLOQ
                         I cautioned you about being premature 
                         with that communiqué to Berlin. 
                         Archeology is not an exact science. 
                         If does not adhere to time schedules.

                                     SHLIEMANN
                         The Fuhrer is not a patient man. He 
                         demands constant reports and he 
                         expects progress. You led me to 
                         believe -

                                     BELLOQ
                         Nothing. I have made no promises. I 
                         said only that it looked very 
                         favorable. Perhaps the Ark will still 
                         be found in an adjoining chamber. 
                         Based on the information in our 
                         possession, my calculations were 
                         correct. Perhaps some bit of evidence 
                         still eludes us. Perhaps

                                     GOBLER
                         Perhaps the girl can help us.

               Belloq shoots him an angry look.

                                     SHLIEMANN
                         My feeling exactly. She was in 
                         possession of the original piece for 
                         years. She may know much.
                              (really evil)
                         If properly motivated...

                                     BELLOQ
                         I tell you, she knows nothing useful.

                                     SHLIEMANN
                         I'm surprised to find you squeamish. 
                         That is not your reputation. But it 
                         needn't concern you. I have the 
                         perfect man for this kind of work.

               Shliemann signals Gobler, who steps outside the tent a moment, 
               calls someone and then reappears. Belloq looks warily at the 
               entrance. After a moment Belzig enters, reeking villainy. 
               When his eyes find Shliemann, his superior, he snaps a crisp 
               "Heil, Hitler!" at him, holding his palm rigid a long time, 
               exposing a burned scar in the prefect shape of the sun 
               medallion.

               EXT. INDY'S DIG - NIGHT

               In the eerie conjunction of moonlight and torchlight, Indy 
               and the other men step back in awe of their discovery: there, 
               flush with the bottom of their pit, is a heavy stone entry 
               door to an underground chamber. Special prying tools are 
               produced. With two men assigned to each of the two long tools, 
               they work in unison to open the vault. They open it a foot 
               and the other men rush in to flop the heavy door completely 
               open. Down inside, only blackness.

               The men quickly prostrate themselves around the edge of the 
               entry to look inside. Indy and Sallah each take a torch and 
               hold them down the hole.

               WHAT THEY SEE

               The Well of the Souls is a spooky chamber thirty feet deep. 
               The walls are covered with hieroglyphics and carvings. The 
               roof is supported intermittently by stone pillars, the closest 
               of which hits the roof very near the entry hole. The Well is 
               quite large; as Indy and Sallah wave their torches, more and 
               more of the room is revealed. Now the far end of the chamber 
               comes into view. There is a stone altar down there and on 
               this elaborated carved platform is a stone chest, big enough 
               to enclose the Lost Ark and protect it from the ravages of 
               time. This altar appears to be the only place on the floor 
               of the Well that is not covered by a strange, dark carpet of 
               some kind.

                                     INDY
                         The Ark must be in that stone case. 
                         What's that gray stuff all over the 
                         floor -

               He breaks off realizing exactly what that carpet is. He 
               blanches. Indiana Jones blanches.

               Indy drops his torch to the floor of the Well. This is 
               answered by the most horrific HISSING imaginable.

               WHAT HE SEES

               That think dark carpet is moving. It's alive. It's thousands 
               and thousands of deadly poisonous snakes - Egyptian asps. 
               And the only thing that seems capable of avoiding this 
               venomous groundcover is the altar. The snakes ebb and flow 
               near it, but never encroach on it, as though repelled by 
               some invisible force.

               Indy shakes his head and talks to himself.

                                     INDY
                         Why snakes? Why did it have to be 
                         snakes? Anything else.

               After a moment of this, he stops. He gathers his energy and 
               resolve and gets back to the task.

                                     SALLAH
                         Asps. Very dangerous.

               Where Indy's torch had landed is a circle of snake-free floor. 
               The snakes hate the flame; they stay away.

                                     INDY
                         Lots of torches. And oil. I want a 
                         landing strip down there.

               INT. THE WELL OF THE SOULS

               Fifteen torches have been dropped to the floor of the chamber, 
               combining to make a good-sized clear zone. Smoke begins to 
               fill the room. Several canisters of oil have been lowered 
               into this space. Now, a large wooden crate is lowered slowly 
               by rope. Rope handles are attached to each end of the crate.

               Up at the hole, Indy gives Sallah a reassuring pat, takes a 
               breath, and swings carefully onto a rope hanging from the 
               hole. Despite his care, he swings a bit and his feet hit the 
               stone pillar which is so near the entry. Surprisingly, the 
               pillar actually moves a bit, showering a light rain of 
               crumbled stone to the floor below.

               Indy lands on the floor of the Well. He looks at the altar 
               over a sea of undulating death. He picks up an oil canister 
               and splashes two parallel lines of oil and lights them. A 
               path six feet wide begins to open to the altar. Behind Indy, 
               Sallah comes quickly down the rope.

               We begin to INTERCUT all the action in the Well from here on 
               with insert shots of the snakes outside the flames. Snakes 
               and snakes. We see: snakes piled and entwined six inches 
               deep; mother snakes laying snake eggs; snake eggs hatching 
               little snakes; snakes cannibalizing other snakes.

               INT. MARION'S TENT

               Belloq has been talking to the still-bound Marion. He has 
               removed her gag. He is impatient, angry, uncomfortable. Caught 
               between two forces.

                                     BELLOQ
                         Believe me, you made a mistake. If 
                         you would just give me something to 
                         placate them. Some bit of information.

                                     MARION
                         I swear to you, I know nothing more. 
                         I have no loyalty to Jones. He's 
                         brought me only trouble.

               He wants to believe her.

                                     BELLOQ
                         I cannot control them.

               Marion's frightened look shifts suddenly to the entrance of 
               the tent. There are new arrivals there - Shliemann, Gobler 
               and Belzig. Belzig carries a black leather case. He steps 
               forward and smiles at Marion.

                                     BELZIG
                         We meet again, Fraulein.

               EXT. INDY'S DIG - JUST BEFORE DAWN

               The sky is just beginning to lighten over the dunes to the 
               east, making dangerously obvious the thin column of smoke 
               rising from the entrance to the Well. Omar and his men are 
               peering through the smoke down into the Well.

               INT. THE WELL OF THE SOULS

               Indy and Sallah are on the altar. Pushing together with all 
               their strength, the heavy stone top of the protective chest 
               begins to slide away. Indy and Sallah exchange slightly wary 
               but very excited looks, then continue to push. As the Ark 
               begins to be exposed, the air seems to almost vibrate, to 
               become electrostatically charged. We hear what sounds like a 
               low HUM. The sea of snakes around the altar draws back further 
               from this presence.

               As the top of the stone chest is pushed completely off and 
               slams down beside it, we see THE LOST ARK OF THE COVENANT. 
               It is awesomely beautiful, breathtaking. 4 feet long, 2.5 
               feet wide and 2.5 feet high. It's height, however, is 
               increased by the two sculptured gold angels mounted facing 
               each other on the top. Though the body of the Ark is acacia 
               wood, it has been overlaid with gold. An elaborate gold crown 
               surrounds the top edge and gold carrying rings are attached 
               to each corner.

               Sallah is mesmerized by the sight. His hand starts to reach 
               out and touch one of the angels, but Indy grabs it.

                                     INDY
                         Don't touch it! Never touch it!

               The wooden crate stands open next to the stone chest. Now 
               Indy extracts the wooden poles from its rings and begins 
               fitting them through the rings in the Ark. This takes some 
               maneuvering by the two men, but soon they are able to lift 
               the Ark clear of the stone chest and into the wooden crate. 
               They extract the poles, fasten the top of the crate and stick 
               the poles through the rings of the wooden crate. They start 
               back toward the space under the hole.

               The fire strips have begun to dwindle, as have some of the 
               torches. The snakes move slowly in toward the clear spaces. 
               Indy and Sallah eye them nervously as they hurry along with 
               their heavy load. Under the hole, they hurriedly attach ropes 
               to the wooden crate and it is pulled up. Indy's concentration 
               is on the tide of snakes.

                                     INDY
                         Hurry up! Why did it have to be 
                         snakes?

               Sallah takes the next rope and climbs quickly out of the 
               Well. Indy has picked up a torch and now throws it at a pool 
               of snakes who are too close for his comfort. He turns and 
               takes hold of the exit rope. He gives it a first tug and it 
               falls down into the Well, landing partly beyond the ring of 
               fire where is instantly disappears in a tangle of angry, 
               hissing asps. Indy looks up at the hole.

                                     INDY
                         What the -

               Smiling down at him from the perimeter of the entry are 
               Belloq, Shliemann and Gobler.

                                     BELLOQ
                         Why, Dr. Jones, whatever are you 
                         doing in such a nasty place?

               Belloq and the Germans laugh.

                                     INDY
                         Why don't you fellows come down here? 
                         I'll show you.

                                     BELLOQ
                         No thank you, my friend.
                              (he glances around 
                              him)
                         I think we are all very comfortable 
                         up here.

               EXT. INDY'S DIG - DAWN

               Sunlight is flooding this tableau: Sallah, Omar and his men 
               are being held at bay by ten armed Nazis. The wooden crate 
               sits safely nearby. Belzig and another Nazi have the gagged 
               Marion held in their rough grasp.

                                     BELLOQ
                              (down to Indy)
                         After all these years, it is most 
                         considerate of you to aid me in this 
                         way.

               As Belloq speaks, Shliemann exchanges a look with Belzig. 
               Belzig smiles and takes the gag from Marion's mouth.

               INT. WELLS OF THE SOULS

               Shliemann smiles down at Indy.

                                     SHLIEMANN
                         I'm afraid we must be going now, Dr. 
                         Jones. Our prize is awaited in Berlin. 
                         But I do not wish to leave you down 
                         in that awful place...
                              (he give a sign)
                         ...all alone.

               Belzig and the Nazi move Marion to the hole and, to Belloq's 
               surprise, push her in. Marion falls thirty feet screaming. 
               Indy drops his torch, braces, and catches her! Her weight 
               knocks him to the ground, almost into the snakes. She looks 
               around at the snakes, clinging to him more desperately as he 
               struggles to his feet trying to unload her.

                                     MARION
                         Don't put me down!

               Up at the hole, there's plenty of dissension.

                                     BELLOQ
                         The girl was mine!

                                     SHLIEMANN
                         She is of no use to us. Only our 
                         mission for the Fuhrer matters.

               Shliemann glances meaningfully around at the other Nazis.

                                     SHLIEMANN
                         I wonder sometimes, Monsieur, if you 
                         have that clearly in mind.

               Belloq feels how much he is the outsider, his own 
               vulnerability. He backs down with the wisdom of survival. He 
               turns to look down at Indy and Marion. His manner is gallant.

                                     BELLOQ
                         Goodbye, mademoiselle.
                              (a pause, then with 
                              respect)
                         Indiana Jones... adieu!

               Belloq and the others step back from the hole and unseen 
               Nazis slam the heavy stone door into place. Marion screams. 
               Her scream is accompanied by -

               A huge WHOOSH! as air is sucked out and the chamber is sealed. 
               Half of the torches still burning go out with the sound. The 
               remaining torches continue to extinguish at punctuating 
               intervals throughout the following action and the snakes 
               immediately flood into the newly-darkened spaces. Indy puts 
               Marion down and snatches up two burning torches. He hands 
               one to Marion.

                                     INDY
                         Don't panic. There's plenty of time 
                         for that later. Wave that at anything 
                         that slithers.

               Indy holds his torch out like a lantern and begins a slow O-
               turn, his eyes peering into the gloom, examining every inch 
               of wall and ceiling.

                                     MARION
                         What are you doing?

                                     INDY
                         Just watch the floor.

               Reminded of the encroaching snakes, Marion waves her torch 
               at the nearest edge of their circle. She looks faint. Indy 
               continues his slow turn.

                                     MARION
                         Whatever you're doing, do it faster.

                                     INDY
                              (he spots something)
                         There!

               His head whips around, looking at the pillars around the 
               room. He sees what he wants. He grabs one of the oil 
               canisters, looks back to the spot on the wall he's chosen 
               and splashes oil on the floor in that direction, then lights 
               it. A path opens toward that wall.

                                     INDY
                         Come on!

               Marion is frozen in her spot. Indy drags her after him. He 
               splashes oil the rest of the way to the wall. It lights and 
               Indy pulls Marion over to the wall. He pours the remaining 
               oil in a circle around them, creating a safe zone there.

                                     INDY
                         Stay here!

                                     MARION
                              (grabbing him)
                         Where are you going?

                                     INDY
                         I'll be back in a minute. We're going 
                         through this wall.

               Marion looks at the wall, which looks like all the rest to 
               her. She thinks he's crazy.

                                     INDY
                         Just keep your eyes open and get 
                         ready to run. No matter what happens 
                         to me.

                                     MARION
                              (panicked)
                         What do you mean?

               Too late. Indy runs back through the path of flames to the 
               center of the room. Snakes strike as his flying heels. Indy 
               reaches the base of the pillar which he touched briefly on 
               his original descent. He uses his torch to clear away the 
               scattered snakes climbing on it, then pulls out his whip. He 
               draws it back, then wraps is solidly around the pillar 15 
               feet up. With the torch in his mouth, he begins climbing the 
               pillar. It moves ominously under his weight.

               The last two torches still burning on the floor go out. Now 
               the only light in the chamber is provided by the torches 
               held by Indy and Marion and the dwindling oil flames. Snakes 
               move in and surround the base of Indy's pillar. The path 
               between Marion and the center of the room is overrun. The 
               circle of flame around Marion is dying down. She looks beyond 
               it with terror-widened eyes, then up through the increasing 
               smoke at the distant Indy.

               Near the top of the pillar, Indy's hands strain along his 
               taut whip, which he has moves higher. A snake slithers into 
               view there, inches from Indy's straining face. Indy turns 
               his head so the torch in his mouth can burn it. The snake 
               falls from the pillar. Indy's torch is dwindling. Indy works 
               his body around so that he is on the side of the pillar away 
               from Marion. The pillar moves, showering dust. Indy looks at 
               the chamber wall five feet away, takes a breath and swings 
               his legs up against it. He is now braced between pillar and 
               wall.

                                     MARION (O.S.)
                              (screaming)
                         Where are you?!

               Snakes are moving in force up the pillar toward Indy's 
               dwindling torch. Indy grasps the pillar for dear life, 
               grimaces with exertion and pushes against the wall with all 
               he's got. The pillar begins to break loose of the ceiling, 
               then stops. Indy's eyes are on the torch. It is just a spot 
               of flame now. Snakes are sliding up toward his hands. Indy 
               again pushes against the wall and the torch falls out of his 
               mouth.

               The pillar goes! In the dim light, we see it fall like a 
               tree directly at Marion. Indy rides it down. The top hits 
               the wall three feet from a cringing Marion and smashes through 
               to a black chamber beyond. Indy flies off into the darkness. 
               Gone. Marion clutches her torch at the black hole.

                                     MARION
                         Indy! Where are you?! Please Lord!

               There is a moment that seems an eternity, then Indy appears 
               like an apparition out of the void.

                                     INDY
                         Come on!

               He grabs her and helps her over the remains of the wall into -

               INT. THE CATACOMBS

               The winding string of connected chambers is revealed to them 
               only a few feet at a time as their torch lights the way.

                                     MARION
                         The snakes... are they here?

                                     INDY
                         I guess not. I think I'd be dead.

                                     MARION
                         Do you know where you're going?

                                     INDY
                         Absolutely.

                                     MARION
                         Thank god. Where?

                                     INDY
                         Out.

               They round a corner and flush a covey of bats. Marion screams.

                                     INDY
                         Don't do that. It scares me.

               Marion gives him a look. They round a corner and begin a 
               walk through a maze of chambers that present for their 
               inspection: moldering mummies and stacked sarcophagi; a room 
               decorated with a thousand human skulls; a wall crawling with 
               huge scarabaeid beetles. Marion is quite naturally a nervous 
               wreck; she jumps when Indy grabs her suddenly and points.

                                     INDY
                         Look!

               WHAT THEY SEE

               There, coming through the crack in the corner of the next 
               chamber, is white blessed sunlight.

               EXT. THE TANIS DIGS - NEAR AIRSTRIP - DAY

               Indy and Marion peek out into the light from the shadows of 
               an abandoned excavation. Before them is the improvised 
               airstrip serving the digs: a crude runway, a tent supply 
               depot, two fuel tank trucks. Down by the fuel trucks a German 
               Mechanic is looking skyward. Now Indy and Marion look there 
               too, drawn by the roaring sound of -

               A Flying Wing, which is circling over the digs in preparation 
               to landing.

               Now a new figure approaches the German Mechanic. It is Gobler; 
               he yells to the mechanic, indicating the plane.

                                     GOBLER
                         Get is gassed immediately! It has an 
                         important cargo to take out!

               In the distance, the Flying Wing lands and rolls toward the 
               men. Gobler spins and heads back toward the main camp, which 
               is hidden from view by a rise. Indy and Marion watch him go.

                                     INDY
                         When the Ark gets loaded, we're 
                         already going to be on that plane.

               The Flying Wing rolls up into the space near the fuel trucks. 
               The German Mechanic puts blue blocks in front of the tires 
               as the engines continue to roar.

               Indy and Marion run in a crouch to a hiding spot closer to 
               the plane, near the supply tent. Suddenly, a Second German 
               Mechanic appears behind them. He is as surprised as they 
               are, but recovers quickly and swings a big monkey wrench at 
               Indy. Indy grabs the swinging arm and the two men tumble out 
               into the open, wrestling. Marion remains hidden, moving fast 
               among the crates.

               The first German Mechanic, who is just pulling the fuel hose 
               from the tank truck to the plane, sees the combatants and 
               runs to help his countryman. He is almost upon them when 
               Indy puts the Second German away with a devastating left - 
               right - left combination. He turns to find the first German 
               Mechanic flying at him. The roll toward the rear of the Flying 
               Wing and its lethally spinning reversed propellers.

               In the cockpit of the Flying Wing, the Pilot has been fiddling 
               with his gauges just prior to shutting off his engines. Now 
               he notices the fight going on outside.

               The fistfight between Indy and the German Mechanic has taken 
               on a new stomach-tightening dimension. The men are fighting 
               and flailing in and out between the spinning props at the 
               back of the plane's wings. Each man comes within inches of 
               becoming instant mincemeat.

               The Pilot slides away the top of his cockpit and stands up. 
               He pulls a Luger from his side and points it, waiting for a 
               clear shot at Indy. The German Mechanic kicks Indy away from 
               him and the Pilot aims his pistol. Suddenly, Marion appears 
               behind the Pilot, standing on the opposite wing, and bashes 
               him over the head with one of the blue blocks that was holding 
               the tires. The Pilot drops down into the cockpit, his body 
               falling on the throttle. The engines roar louder, revving 
               up. The plane begins to roll, rotating around its one still-
               blocked set of tires. Marion grabs onto the cockpit to keep 
               from slipping into the props. She bends into the cockpit, 
               trying to pull the Pilot's body off the throttle. No luck. 
               She grimaces and climbs inside. Her shoulder bumps the top 
               of the cockpit; it slides tightly shut above her.

               Under the moving wing, Indy delivers a knockout rightcross 
               to the German Mechanic which sends him staggering back toward 
               a roaring propeller. Indy's grimace registers the man's demise 
               and a fine mist of blood wafts toward him. Indy spins toward 
               the sound of crumpling metal and sees -

               The other prop of the Flying Wing slice into a tank truck. 
               The airplane fuel inside floods out onto the pavement, 
               surrounding the plane. Indy backpedals away from the plane, 
               his eyes searching the scene for Marion. Suddenly, he is 
               shocked to see her in the cockpit. He runs toward her, 
               skidding through the gasoline.

                                     INDY
                         Get out! Get out!

               Marion is struggling with the top of the cockpit. She can't 
               budge it. She's trapped.

               EXT. THE COMMAND TENT - DAY

               Three Armed Nazis stand guard around the wooden crate 
               containing the Ark. It is sitting near the flopped-open 
               entrance to the Command Tent and there is furious activity 
               going on here. Belloq, Shliemann, Gobler, Belzig and assorted 
               Aides are packing up all the papers and personal items in 
               preparation for a hasty departure.

               A large crowd of Arab Diggers is milling about among the 
               tents. They all want to get a look at the Ark. Sallah is 
               among them. All at once, there is a earthshaking explosion. 
               Al eyes turn toward the rise that hides the airstrip. A huge 
               fireball floats into view over there. Everyone starts running 
               toward it. Shliemann yells at Belzig and the Armed Nazis.

                                     SHLIEMANN
                         Stay with the Ark!

               EXT. THE RISE ABOVE AIRSTRIP - DAY

               Almost all the Arabs and Germans in the digs have congregated 
               here and are staring at the burning remains of the Flying 
               Wing. Belloq and Shliemann arrive just as the second fuel 
               truck blows up. The concussion knocks many of the observers 
               flat. Belloq, Shliemann and Gobler watch the scene in alarm.

                                     SHLIEMANN
                         Sabotage!

                                     BELLOQ
                         We must get the Ark away from this 
                         place immediately!

                                     SHLIEMANN
                              (to Gobler)
                         Have it put on the truck. We'll fly 
                         out of Cairo.

               Gobler snaps his heels, turns to go.

                                     SHLIEMANN
                         And Gobler -
                              (Gobler stops)
                         I want plenty of protection.

               Gobler nods and runs off. Shliemann heads back toward camp. 
               Belloq hesitates a long moment, studying the burning wreckage 
               with an odd, suspicious look. Finally, he turns and leaves, 
               passing a nearby stack of barrels. When he has passed, Sallah 
               appears from among the barrels. He searches the crowd for 
               his people and starts a broken field run along some tents to 
               avoid a group of Germans and is running flat-out when someone 
               sticks out a leg and sends him flipping. Sallah, dust all 
               over his face, looks angrily toward the concealed culprit. 
               At once, a flashing white grin splits his darkened face. 
               Indy and Marion, splotched with soot and oil, are hiding in 
               the flap of a tent. Sallah runs into their arms and the three 
               embrace warmly. When they break -

                                     SALLAH
                         Holy smoke, my friends! I am so 
                         pleased you are not dead.

                                     MARION
                         Us too.

                                     SALLAH
                              (suddenly remembering)
                         The Ark! They're taking it on a truck 
                         to Cairo.

                                     INDY
                         Where is it?

               Sallah gestures to follow and all three run off stealthily 
               through the mostly deserted camp.

               EXT. AMONG THE TENTS - DAY

               Sallah, Indy and Marion run into a hiding spot behind some 
               water barrels near the Command Tent. They peek out at this 
               activity -

               In the big space near the Command Tent is parked an open 
               German staff car; inside is a Blond Driver and an Armed Guard. 
               Directly behind it is a canvas-topped troop truck. At this 
               moment, Belloq and Shliemann are supervising the careful 
               placement of the crated Ark in the back of the truck. When 
               it is securely placed inside, we hear an ominous marching 
               sound and Nine Armed Nazis appear at a trot from between 
               some tents and climb into the back of the truck with the 
               Ark.

               Behind the water barrels, Sallah and Marion exchange hapless 
               looks, But Indy just concentrates on -

               The scene by the truck: Belloq and Shliemann are about to 
               climb into the front staff car when they pause to check out 
               the final component of the convoy. Rolling into place behind 
               the truck is another open staff car. But this one is special - 
               mounted in the back is a big, black machine gun, manned by a 
               Gunner. At the wheel of the car is Gobler and next to him 
               sits Belzig.

               Sallah and Marion look at Indy. Belloq and Shliemann climb 
               in the back seat of the front car and the caravan pulls out. 
               Indy watches it go, thinking hard.

                                     INDY
                         You two get back to Cairo quick and 
                         get us transportation to England - a 
                         plane, a ship, anything.

                                     MARION
                         What about you?

                                     INDY
                         I'm going to get that truck. I'll 
                         meet you at Omar's. Be ready for me.

               Sallah nods. Marion looks at him like he's nuts. Indy jumps 
               up, looks around desperately.

                                     MARION
                         How are you going to get that truck?

                                     INDY
                              (still searching)
                         I don't know. I'm making this up as 
                         I go.

               He runs away between two tents.

               EXT. AT THE EDGE OF THE DIGS - DAY

               From among the tents, Indy suddenly bursts into view, happily 
               astride a magnificent white Arabian stallion. He gallops off 
               across the desert.

               EXT. THE DESERT (VARIOUS SHOTS) - DAY

               Indy cuts cross-country avoiding the road the convoy has 
               taken. He leaps gullies, climbs dunes, slides down slopes. 
               Soon the convoy comes into view far below him. He tears along 
               a parallel ridge, like an Indian shadowing a wagon train.

               EXT. DESERT ROAD - DAY

               The convoy is entering rougher country. The narrow mountain 
               road we've seen earlier ascends ahead. To the side of the 
               road are tall boulders. Suddenly, Indy shoots out from between 
               two rocks and rides directly for the truck. The Armed Nazis 
               in the back of the truck can see nothing because the canvas 
               hides their view. But Gobler, Belzig and the Gunner in the 
               rear staff car have a brief line on him. Belzig points and 
               the Gunner fires away and Indy, the bullets kicking up sand 
               near Indy's horse.

               The Armed Guard in the cab of the truck leans out to see 
               what's happening. Indy has been riding alongside. Now he 
               stands on the horse and leaps to the cab. In a second, he 
               has flipped the Armed Guard out of the truck. He slides into 
               the cab and begins grappling with the Truck Driver. The Truck 
               Driver tries to hit the brakes, but Indy kicks his foot away 
               and floors the gas pedal. The truck doubles its speed and 
               shoots onto the steep mountain road.

               EXT. MOUNTAIN ROAD - DAY

               The Blond Driver of the front staff car sees the truck move 
               up on him in the rearview mirror and speeds up. Belloq, 
               Shliemann and the Armed Guard in the car twist around to 
               look at the struggle in the truck. The Blond Driver begins 
               what will be a continuing preview of the twists in the road. 
               He turns his wheel sharply and takes the lead car around a 
               bend.

               In the cab of the truck, Indy and the Truck Driver stop their 
               fight temporarily and cooperate in turning the steering wheel. 
               The truck barely stays on the road.

               A full view reveals the incredible geography of this ride. 
               The convoy in tiny against the spectacular mountainside, the 
               cliffs drop hundreds of feet.

               At the wheel of the rear car, Gobler swerves to stay on the 
               road and accidentally sideswipes a boulder. The Gunner perched 
               in the back is flipped head over heels out of the car. Gobler 
               and Belzig are having trouble seeing the road through all 
               the dust the convoy is kicking up.

               The lead staff car reaches the summit of the road and barely 
               makes the hairpin turn there, delivering a destructive blow 
               to the guard rail that has been placed there. The guard rail 
               is now bent.

               In the cab of the truck, Indy and the Truck Driver again 
               stop trying to choke each other long enough to negotiate the 
               turn together. The bumper of the truck hits the broken guard 
               rail and sends it flying off the cliff. The truck, however, 
               holds the road.

               In the rear car, Gobler and Belzig are trying to see through 
               the thick clouds of dust. Suddenly is clears completely. 
               Unfortunately for them, this happens because their car has 
               shot out into space at the hairpin turn. They are flying to 
               their final reward. Belzig, eyes wide behind his evil 
               spectacles, screams as he goes.

               In the cab of the truck, the Truck Driver is distracted by 
               the sight of the flying staff car. Indy plasters him and he 
               tumbles out.

               Far, far below, Belzig's staff car explodes on the rocks.

               In the back of the truck, a TOUGH SERGEANT takes command of 
               the situation. He picks out six Armed Nazis and motions for 
               them to start climbing around the outside of the truck to 
               the cab. With some trepidation the lucky ones begin that 
               maneuver. The truck is swerving like crazy.

               In the front staff car, the Armed Guard aims his submachine 
               guns back at Indy, alone now in the truck's cab. Shliemann 
               knocks the barrel roughly away.

                                     SHLIEMANN
                              (yelling)
                         If anything happens to that Ark, 
                         we're all dead men ! The Fuhrer will 
                         see to it!

               Indy sees this from the cab and reacts by speeding up, putting 
               even more pressure on the Blond Driver.

               Along the back of the truck, Armed Nazis are edging up toward 
               the cab, three on each side. They hang on as the truck rounds 
               a corner and goes into a straightaway that leads through a 
               short tunnel.

               In the cab, Indy has been concentrating on the lead staff 
               car. Now, just before entering the tunnel, he looks in the 
               side view mirror and sees the Nazis on his side. A quick 
               glance to the other mirror reveals the others. As the truck 
               sweeps into the tunnel, we see Indy just start to turn his 
               steering wheel - he is going to sideswipe the walls of the 
               tunnel

               At the other end of the tunnel, we hear the roar of the two 
               engine and two long, screeching, scraping sounds. The lead 
               staff car shoots out of the tunnel, then the truck, its sides 
               cleaned of Nazis.

               In the rear of the truck, the Tough Sergeant is looking with 
               distaste back at the tunnel. There remains only him and two 
               Armed Nazis with the Ark. He sends these two climbing up 
               over the top of the truck.

               In the lead car, the Blond Driver is being pressed hard by 
               Indy, who now edges up to bump them from the rear. Suddenly 
               the Armed Guard next to the Driver sees the two Armed Nazis 
               appear on the top of the truck. Without thinking, he starts 
               to point them out to Shliemann, then realizes his stupidity.

               In the cab, Indy has seen this and is at first mystified. He 
               checks his sideview mirrors. Then he figures it out and slams 
               on his brakes. The brakes lock, the wheels burn and the truck 
               skids to a dusty halt. The two Armed Nazis fly off the truck, 
               over the cab to the road in front. Indy immediately hits the 
               gas again. The two Armed Nazis, just aiming their weapons, 
               get wiped out.

               In the rear of the truck, the crated Ark is bouncing all 
               alone, no one in sight, because -

               The Tough Sergeant is on the top of the truck, making his 
               way steadily forward. This guy clearly knows what he's doing. 
               A submachine gun is slung across his back.

               The truck and the staff car race through a series of S-curves. 
               In the staff car, Belloq and Shliemann spot the Tough Sergeant 
               as he reaches the front of the truck's top and begins to 
               lower his submachine gun barrel toward the cab. Indy is 
               unaware. Belloq and Shliemann exchange looks. Then Shliemann 
               yells to the Armed Guard in the front seat.

               The Tough Sergeant has a line on Indy. He points his gun. 
               The Armed Guard blasts away at the truck. The Tough Sergeant 
               dies in a hail of bullets and flies off.

               Indy, who has ducked at the gunfire, is confused. But when 
               he sees the Armed Guard up front lower his gun, Indy again 
               floors it and begins bumping the staff car in earnest.

               The road is almost down to a level now. In the distance - 
               Cairo. The road takes a little dogleg just before reaching 
               level ground again. Just as the staff car is about to make 
               the turn, Indy smashes them from behind. The staff car flies 
               off the road and down a twenty foot embankment. Indy takes 
               the truck speeding down the road and off toward Cairo.

               In the staff car, the occupants are bruised but safe. 
               Shliemann points at the departing truck and yells at the 
               Blond Driver. The staff car fishtails out of its sandy resting 
               place and takes off after the truck.

               EXT. OUTSKIRTS OF CAIRO (VARIOUS SHOTS) - DAY

               Indy has an ever-decreasing lead on the staff car as the 
               race thunders into the narrow streets. People and animals 
               leap out of the way; carts and barrels go flying helter 
               skelter. Indy takes the truck down a street so narrow there 
               are only inches to spare on each side. Pedestrians jump into 
               doorways.

               EXT. OMAR'S SQUARE - DAY

               When the truck clears the narrow street, it is in a small 
               square. Omar's garage is gaping open on the opposite side. 
               Indy hits the brakes and the truck skids across the square 
               and into the garage. The garage door slams shut and tenting 
               drops from the building to hide the door. Various Arabs, 
               friends of Omar, rush out with fruit carts and baskets and 
               set up a mini-bazaar in seconds. Two Arab Boys sweep the 
               tracks of the truck into oblivion. They throw aside their 
               brooms just as the staff car appears from the narrow street. 
               Belloq and Shliemann look around desperately as the Blond 
               Driver steers the car through the square and out the other 
               side.

               EXT. CAIRO DOCKS - NIGHT

               The waterfront is dark and misty. An old tramp steamer, the 
               BANTU WIND, sits by the pier. Several fierce Black African 
               Pirates, the crewmembers, are taking on final stores.

               A small light illuminates the top of the gangplank. In its 
               circle, Indy and Marion exchange long, warm embraces with 
               Sallah. A short distance away the ship's Captain, a handsome, 
               powerful black named SIMON KATANGA, watches from the rail, 
               smoking a pipe.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               EXT. OPEN SEA - THE MEDITERRANEAN - NIGHT

               The Bantu Wind is bathed in moonlight as it cuts across even 
               seas.

               INT. INDY'S CABIN - NIGHT

               Indy comes in, takes off his hat, jacket, whip and holster. 
               The door which connects this cabin to the next opens and 
               Marion appears. She is carrying a half-full glass of liquor, 
               but what you notice is the long, snow-white, high-necked 
               nightgown she is wearing. It is very prim. Very innocent. 
               And very sexy. Marion does a slightly embarrassed model's 
               turn for Indy.

                                     MARION
                         I have a feeling I'm not the first 
                         woman to travel with these pirates. 
                         There's a whole wardrobe in there.

                                     INDY
                         It's lovely.

               Indy sits on the cot, takes off his boots. He leans back 
               against the wall and rubs his eyes. Marion sits on the bed, 
               leans back against the wall with him and looks down at her 
               white nightgown. She chuckles.

                                     MARION
                         I feel like a virgin bride in this.

                                     INDY
                         That's what you look like.

                                     MARION
                              (takes a drink)
                         There are some things you can 
                         recapture in this life, but that 
                         isn't one of them.

                                     INDY
                         What would you like to recapture?

                                     MARION
                              (after a long pause)
                         Nothing. That is the way it is.

               He watches her closely as she drains her glass and puts it 
               down.

                                     INDY
                         Did I ever say I was sorry I burned 
                         down your tavern?

               She turns so their lips are very close.

                                     MARION
                         No. Then again, I burned up that 
                         plane.

                                     INDY
                         You saved my life.

                                     MARION
                         And you saved mine.

                                     INDY
                         Seems things have worked out kind of 
                         even.

                                     MARION
                         That's the way I like them.

                                     INDY
                         Maybe we should consider all past 
                         accounts closed.

               Marion thinks about this a long time.

                                     MARION
                         No. Not yet.

                                     INDY
                         What else?

               She looks into his eyes. A smile jumps from her lips to his. 
               He kisses her and they sink slowly to the cot.

               INT. IN THE HOLD

               The ship's rats are agitated. They tremble and chatter at 
               the edges of the compartment, darting about. Out in the center 
               of the hold, sitting all by itself, is the crated Ark. HUM-M-
               M-M.

               INT. INDY'S CABIN - DAY

               Marion awakes with a start, alone in the cot. Something's 
               wrong. The ship is quiet. Indy is strapping on his holster. 
               He pulls his ship and jacket from a hook.

                                     MARION
                         What is it?

                                     INDY
                         The engines have shut down.

                                     MARION
                         Why?

                                     INDY
                         I'm going to find out.

               EXT. LOWER DECK - DAY

               Indy runs toward the bow, then climbs some steps four at a 
               time. A MESSENGER PIRATE is hurrying to get him, but flies 
               by him on the steps. By the time the Pirate stops himself, 
               Indy is gone.

                                     MESSENGER PIRATE
                         Mister Jones! The Captain he say -

               EXT. THE BRIDGE - DAY

               Captain Katanga is looking with concern ahead of the ship. 
               Indy appears behind him.

                                     INDY
                         What's wrong?

                                     KATANGA
                         You have most important friends.

               Katanga turns quickly, pointing with a sweeping hand. Indy 
               looks. Arrayed in a rough semicircle around the ship are ten 
               German Wolf Submarines. All of their deck guns are manned 
               and trained on the Bantu Wind. Worse, at least five heavily-
               armed boarding parties in rafts are closing quickly on the 
               ship.

                                     INDY
                         Holy shit.

                                     KATANGA
                              (fast)
                         I sent my man for you. You and the 
                         girl must disappear. We have a place 
                         in the hold. Go, my friend!

               EXT. UPPER DECK - DAY

               Indy tears along the deck. He looks over the rail and sees 
               two Nazi rafts already next to the ship.

               EXT. LOWER DECK - DAY

               Indy flies down some stairs and starts to round a corner. 
               Suddenly he throws himself backwards, out of view. Three 
               uniformed Nazis are clustered near a cabin door holding the 
               Messenger Pirate. Now two more come out of the cabin trying 
               to maintain their grasp on a kicking, yelling Marion. She is 
               still wearing her white nightgown. More Nazis clamber onto 
               the deck and head toward Indy, slamming open doors, rousting 
               Pirates, spouting racial epithets. Indy steps backwards and 
               fades into the maze of the ship.

               EXT. / INT. THE BANTU WINDS (VARIOUS SHOTS) - DAY

               The ship is swarming with Nazis. The Black Pirates are herded 
               forward, subjected to rough physical and verbal abuse by the 
               Aryan Supermen. The Pirates are clearly under orders not to 
               resist, but not one of these strong men likes it. They'd 
               gladly give their lives to rip the throat out of a few Krauts. 
               In the hold, the door slams open and Nazis pour in; they 
               smile at the sight of the crated Ark.

               EXT. THE BRIDGE - DAY

               Captain Katanga watches as his crew is crowded into a circle 
               of Nazis on the wide deck below him. He is surrounded by 
               Belloq, Shliemann, and several Nazis, two of whom are holding 
               Marion. Now the Nazis from the hold appear on the lower deck 
               carrying the crated Ark by means of the long poles. Belloq's 
               eyes shine at the sight.

                                     SHLIEMANN
                         Take it aboard the Wurrfler!

                                     BELLOQ
                         And be very careful!

               The Ark is taken away.

                                     SHLIEMANN
                              (to a Sergeant below)
                         What about Jones?

                                     SERGEANT
                         Not a trace yet, sir!

                                     KATANGA
                         Jones is dead.

               Belloq and Shliemann regard him suspiciously.

                                     KATANGA
                         We killed him. He was of no use to 
                         us. The girl, however, has certain 
                         value where we are headed. She will 
                         bring a very good price. If that 
                         cargo you have taken was your goal, 
                         then go in peace with it. But leave 
                         us the girl. It will reduce our loss 
                         on this trip.

                                     SHLIEMANN
                         Savage. You are not in a position to 
                         ask for anything. We will take what 
                         we wish and then decide whether or 
                         not to blow your ship from the water.

               Belloq steps forward and puts a proprietary hand on Marion's 
               arm, fixing Shliemann with a steady look.

                                     BELLOQ
                         That girl goes with me. It will be 
                         part of my compensation. I'm sure 
                         the Fuhrer would approve.

               Shliemann considers.

                                     BELLOQ
                         If she fails to please me, you can 
                         do with her as you wish.

               This appeals to Shliemann's nature. He signals his agreement 
               with a gesture. Belloq ushers Marion away with her two 
               keepers.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               EXT. "THE WURRFLER" - CONNING TOWER - DAY

               The Nazis have returned to their subs. Shliemann is on the 
               bridge with the WURRFLER'S CAPTAIN and the Captain's Aides. 
               The Captain is an honorable career Navy man.

                                     THE WURRFLER'S CAPTAIN
                         Colonel Shliemann, all torpedoes are 
                         loaded.

               Shliemann nods and continues to stare at the Bantu Wind, as 
               does the Captain. The Pirate crew is all lined across the 
               bow. Towering above the others, standing on the rail, proud 
               and defiant, is Katanga. Shliemann looks at the Wurrfler's 
               Captain a moment.

                                     SHLIEMANN
                         What do you think, Captain?

                                     THE WURRFLER'S CAPTAIN
                              (earnestly)
                         I think not, Colonel. Nothing is to 
                         be gained. We are not at war.

               Shliemann mulls this, then turns to the hatch.

                                     SHLIEMANN
                         ...yet. Let the vermin live. We must 
                         be on our way.

               Shliemann disappears down the hatch. The Captain is very 
               pleased. A Radioman speaks into his headset, then follows 
               the other Aides down the hatch. In the distance the other 
               subs begin to move away from the ship. The Captain, alone on 
               the bridge, looks once more at Katanga.

               On the Bantu Wind, Katanga executes what might be taken for 
               a salute.

               The Wurrfler's Captain smiles, salutes crisply, then goes 
               below, pulling the hatch closed. Immediately, the Wurrfler 
               begins to move. And as it does, we see the rail at the aft 
               of the main deck. From nowhere, a wet sleeve appears and a 
               hand grabs the rail!

               Indy pulls his dripping body onto the sub's main deck. He 
               has lost his felt hat once and for all. Other than that, his 
               outfit is the same as always, just wetter. Suddenly, water 
               is washing over his feet; the Wurrfler is beginning to 
               submerge. Indy runs through quickly deepening water toward 
               the haven of the conning tower. Halfway there, he slips and 
               goes down. Only by grabbing the base of the aftmast light 
               does he keep from being swept away. He struggles to his feet 
               and sloshes through knee-deep water to the base of the conning 
               tower.

               Indy climbs the ladder to the bridge of the conning tower 
               and looks down. The water is rising toward his fast. Indy 
               climbs the ladder to the top of the turret and braces himself 
               between the two uprights there - the 7 foot radio mast and 
               the 20 foot periscope. Still the ocean comes up to meet him. 
               Soon the top of the turret is under water and the radio mast 
               is disappearing. Indy shifts his grip to the periscope, 
               working his way up it and hanging on for dear life as the 
               ocean whips at his body. The periscope is quickly going under. 
               Indy hangs on to the top three feet, all that remains above.

               The forward movement of the sub continues, but, to Indy's 
               slowly dawning delight, the dive stops. No more of the 
               periscope goes under. Indy smiles; it's a pretty good smile, 
               too, given the circumstances. Indy pulls out his bullwhip 
               and begins tying himself to the periscope.

               EXT. THE PERISCOPE - AFTERNOON

               The sun warms that part of his body Indy has contrived to 
               keep out of the water. The rest floats out behind. Indy isn't 
               comfortable, but all in all, it's not as terrible as he might 
               have feared.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               EXT. THE PERISCOPE - DUSK

               It's as terrible as Indy might have feared. He looks wasted. 
               Waterlogged and exhausted. The wet leather of the whip is 
               contracting and he must struggle constantly to keep it from 
               cutting into his skin.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               EXT. THE OCEAN - NIGHT

               Several shark fins cut the surface, appearing and disappearing 
               in the bright moonlight. They are shadowing -

               EXT. THE PERISCOPE - NIGHT

               Indy looks through barely open eyes at the sharks running 
               alongside. There is nothing to be done. His eyes close.

                                                                  FADE OUT:

               FADE IN:

               EXT. THE PERISCOPE - NIGHT

               The submarine has stopped. The water is calm. The moon is 
               bright. A gentle swell splashes Indy awake. He blinks, tries 
               to regain his senses. He makes an inventory of his body. 
               Surprised to find himself intact, his spirits lift. Some 
               hidden reserve of energy flows through him. He frees his 
               aching arms from the wet leather of his whip, leaving only 
               one loop around his waist to hold him to the sub. He rubs 
               his hands and stretches. Once again, he has survived. To 
               fight again. He looks around.

               WHAT HE SEES

               A lovely island. No sign of man's presence. The sub has 
               stopped at the mouth of a wide cove completely ringed by 
               tall white rock cliffs. Suddenly the sub begins to move again. 
               It is headed directly toward the center of the cliffs. Indy 
               holds on, mystified, alert. When the cliffs are very close, 
               the sub begins to dive.

                                     INDY
                         Damn!

               He thinks hard. Inspiration hits just before the water. Indy 
               flips his leather jacket up over his head and holds the jacket 
               out in front of him. His head is hidden by the jacket as he 
               goes under water.

               INT. THE UNDERWATER TUNNEL - NIGHT

               The sub enters an underwater tunnel that penetrates into the 
               cliffs. Indy is held to the periscope by his crossed legs 
               and the whip. His impromptu air bubble is working, but it's 
               a struggle to maintain it.

               The sub begins to cut through think marine vegetation. Each 
               dangling growth pulls at Indy's body and slaps at his leather 
               bubble. Now a clump of entwined seaweed rips the leather out 
               of his hands and his bubble of air rises away. Indy hangs 
               on, holding his breath, but the vegetation gets denser. 
               Finally, it pulls him off the periscope. The sub moves on, 
               disappearing ahead.

               Indy rises desperately through the dark water, his hand 
               outstretched. Then, almost simultaneously, hand and head hit 
               solid rock. But no air. Indy feels along the ceiling of rock. 
               Nothing. It's all submerged.

               Indy dives, stroking deep into the tunnel. When he has 
               descended 15 feet, he grabs a vine and steadies himself. His 
               eyes search the dim roof of the tunnel. He sees his last 
               hope in the distance - a small blue circle, an air pocket. 
               He swims for it.

               In the air pocket, Indy's head breaks the surface and smashes 
               into rock again. The pocket is only six inches deep. No 
               matter. Indy loves it. He'd like to move in. He gulps air.

               INT. THE SUB BASE - DOCKING BAY

               The Wurrfler has arrived at an extraordinary base built in 
               the hollow interior of the island. This chamber, with the 
               docking bay, is almost all water. A huge natural cavern, it 
               has been reinforced and enlarged by the Germans.

               The Wurrfler sits surfaced at the dock. The Ark has been 
               unloaded and placed on a cart. Shliemann, Belloq and Marion 
               have just disembarked and been met by a Nazi contingent from 
               the base. Marion looks worse for the trip. Her white nightgown 
               is now ripped and smudged.

               One of the greeting Nazis, a TALL CAPTAIN, salutes Shliemann 
               and Belloq. As he speaks to them, we notice that right behind 
               this group, just above a great deal of sub unloading activity, 
               Indy's whip hangs from the periscope. Working Nazis pass 
               within feet of it unaware; the Tall Captain would see it in 
               a moment if he were not so focused on the new arrivals.

                                     TALL CAPTAIN
                              (to Belloq)
                         The tents have been arranged in 
                         accordance with your radioed 
                         instructions, sir.

                                     BELLOQ
                         Good. We must take the Ark there 
                         now.

               Shliemann looks a little unhappy about this exchange, but 
               says nothing. The group moves swiftly toward the end of a 
               mine train arrangement. The train, consisting of small, 
               separate, electric-powered cars, sits on a track which 
               disappears into a tunnel cut in the rock.

               On the turret of the Wurrfler, the Wurrfler's Captain lights 
               a cigarette as he watches the mine train disappear, then 
               returns his attention to the activity on the dock. He leans 
               idly against the periscope, his head two feet below Indy's 
               dangling whip. Something catches his eye, he yells an order 
               and climbs down from the turret to deal with the matter. We 
               hold on the whip for a long moment, until its owner's hand 
               appears and quickly reclaims it.

               INT. TRAIN TUNNEL

               The Ark and its entourage are moving slowly up the tight 
               dark tunnel, their way lit by intermittent lanterns. The 
               tunnel is irregular, but generally about 7 feet wide. It's 
               height varies from an average of about 7 feet to a low of 
               only about 4.5 feet at the points (every 40 feet) where 
               support beams cross the track. The result is that there is 
               only about a foot of clearance above the mine cars at those 
               points; passengers must duck to keep from being hit in the 
               head. Shliemann, looking worried, and Belloq, very excited, 
               are focused on the Ark in the car ahead.

                                     SHLIEMANN
                         I am uncomfortable with the thought 
                         of this -
                              (spitting it out)
                         Jewish ritual. Are you sure it's 
                         necessary?

                                     BELLOQ
                              (playing him)
                         Let me ask you this - Would you be 
                         more comfortable opening the Ark in 
                         Berlin - for the Fuhrer - and finding 
                         out only then if the sacred pieces 
                         of the Covenant are inside? Knowing, 
                         only then, whether you have 
                         accomplished your mission and obtained 
                         the one, true Ark?

               Shliemann doesn't like any of his alternatives. He looks at 
               Belloq with some suspicion as the train comes into bright 
               light.

               INT. COMMAND CENTER

               A second natural cavern, even bigger than the first, has 
               been worked over by the Germans into a rectangular, three-
               story high supply center around a huge, open, center court. 
               Uniformed Nazi Soldiers are everywhere, wrangling supplies 
               and ammunition, monitoring electronic equipment. At the far 
               end of the court, a second train tunnel disappears into the 
               rock.

               Across the open court, Belloq sees his destination: a large, 
               brilliant white silk tent has been erected in the midst of 
               all this hardware. It looks incongruous, and more than a 
               little eerie. It is the Tabernacle.

               INT. TRAIN TUNNEL

               Indy is making his way up the tunnel. He hears cars coming 
               from up ahead and steps into the shadows. A mine car passes 
               with several laughing Nazis. Indy continues on his way.

               INT. THE TABERNACLE

               The light in here is lovely, unearthly. Oil lamps burn. The 
               Tabernacle is really several concentric, silk tents, which 
               creates a flowing maze effect. The innermost tent has at its 
               center a 3-foot high, tapestry-covered altar. Belloq watches 
               with gleaming, obsessed eyes as two Nazis carefully lift the 
               actual Ark out of its crate by means of the long poles. The 
               Ark dazzles the eye, seeming to glow gold in this strange 
               light. The two Nazis place it carefully on the altar. 
               Shliemann and some Aides hang back. Marion is nowhere to be 
               seen.

               INT. COMMAND CENTER - END OF TUNNEL

               Indy makes a fast break from the shadows of the tunnel to 
               the protection of a high stack of supplies. He climbs the 
               back of the stack, peeks over and surveys the area.

               WHAT HE SEES

               In addition to the Tabernacle, the second train tunnel 
               entrance, and all the activity, Indy's glance rests 
               momentarily on a large, heavy metal door halfway down one 
               wall toward the Tabernacle. It bears the words, in German: 
               "DANGER - MUNITIONS"

               Indy continues to scan the scene.

               INT. THE TABERNACLE

               In the central area with the Ark, Shliemann and the other 
               Nazis wait impatiently, eyeing the Ark with some discomfort. 
               Belloq is not visible, because at the moment he is -

               In the folds of the Tabernacle, the silk of the tents 
               undulating around him. The light is even stranger, the scene 
               almost dreamlike. With the help of the Tall Captain, Belloq 
               lets an extraordinary, gold-embroidered, ceremonial robe 
               fall over his head and onto his body. Belloq looks 
               transported, possessed. The Tall Captain unlatches a wooden 
               case and takes from it a sturdy ivory rod about 5 feet long, 
               elaborately engraved. Belloq takes it from him, turns and 
               slips back through the silk. The Tall Captain stays in the 
               folds.

               Back in the central area, Shliemann and the other Nazis are 
               taken aback by Belloq's appearance in the robe. They exchange 
               looks. From one knot of men there is muttering about "Juden" 
               and such, but when Belloq turns a fiery gaze on them there 
               is immediate silence. Shliemann looks uncertain in this 
               presence.

               Belloq approaches the Ark. He stops a few feet from it and 
               begins murmuring an invocation in Hebrew. After a few moments 
               of this he advances a step and is about to place the ivory 
               rod in a notch under the lid of the Ark itself. The end of 
               the rod is an inch from the notch when -

               Indy steps into the Tabernacle. On his shoulder is a bazooka 
               and it is aimed directly at the Ark.

                                     INDY
                         Hold it.
                              (the Nazi react)
                         One move from anybody and I blow 
                         that box back to Moses.

               Shliemann makes it clear to the other Nazis that Indy is to 
               be obeyed.

                                     BELLOQ
                         Jones, your persistence surprises 
                         even me. You are going to give 
                         mercenaries a bad name.

                                     INDY
                         What about you? Talked to God yet?
                              (Belloq's eyes flash)
                         Where's the girl?

                                     SHLIEMANN
                         Doctor Jones, surely you don't think 
                         you can escape from this base.

                                     INDY
                         That depends on how reasonable we're 
                         all willing to be. All I want is the 
                         girl. We'll keep possession of the 
                         Ark only till we've got safe transport 
                         to England. Then it's all yours.

                                     SHLIEMANN
                         If we refuse?

                                     INDY
                         Then the Ark and some of us are going 
                         up in a big bang. I don't think Hitler 
                         would like that a bit. Now I don't 
                         want to talk about this anymore. 
                         Show me that girl in five seconds or -

               The Tall Captain flies out of the silk and takes Indy down 
               by the neck. The bazooka clatters across the cement floor as 
               two other Nazis help subdue Indy. The three Nazis take Indy's 
               pistol from his holster and raise him roughly in their grasp.

                                     SHLIEMANN
                         Jones, this is the second time I 
                         have seen you looking very foolish.

                                     INDY
                         It's a bad habit. I'm trying to break 
                         it.

               Shliemann draws his Luger.

                                     SHLIEMANN
                         I'll help you. This time I'll kill 
                         you myself.

               Shliemann raises the pistol.

                                     BELLOQ
                         No! Not in the presence of the Ark! 
                         Take him outside.

               Shliemann eyes Belloq, then the Ark. He lowers the pistol, 
               motions for the Nazis to take Indy out ahead of him. They 
               stop a moment only when Belloq speaks.

                                     BELLOQ
                         Indiana Jones, I salute you. I am 
                         even a little sorry you will miss 
                         this moment.

                                     INDY
                         Thanks. If you talk to Him, tell Him 
                         I'm on my way up.

               Shliemann motions them out and follows. Belloq turns back to 
               the Ark, raising the ivory rod.

               INT. COMMAND CENTER

               Shliemann, the Tall Captain, Indy and the two Nazis holding 
               him emerge from the Tabernacle. Shliemann points to a nearby 
               wall and the group starts that way with Shliemann and the 
               Tall Captain slightly ahead.

               INT. THE TABERNACLE

               Belloq has the ivory rod inserted in the notch under the lid 
               of the Ark. He utters a short phrase in Hebrew and begins to 
               press down on his end of the rod. The lid of the Ark begins 
               to lift. It's difficult work. Belloq puts his whole weight 
               into one big press on his end and the lid opens two feet.

               Inside the Ark of the Covenant is a preview of the end of 
               the world. A light so bright, a power so fearsome, a charge 
               so jolting, that there is nothing in our world to compare to 
               it. It's as though this magnificent golden box has been 
               gathering electric energy for three thousand years, waiting 
               for just this crack of the lid to release it all in one fast, 
               cleansing explosion of pure force.

               Blinding arcs of light shoot out across the Tabernacle 
               instantly killing all the Nazis inside and turning the white 
               silk to flame. But it is Belloq in his obsession who takes 
               the full blast. His whole body seems lit by a million volt 
               current and, for a moment, his complete form is white, then 
               blue, then maybe green, but it is hard to tell because our 
               eyes are blinded now too. Two aspects of this ghastly, 
               beautiful display are somehow communicated in the chaos, 
               although the communication is subliminal. First, that Belloq, 
               in the instant of his destruction, has experienced some kind 
               of sublime, transcendental knowledge. If a death's-head can 
               smile and look satisfied, that is how Belloq's incandescent 
               face would be described. Secondly, this event is accompanied 
               by a sound like no other. A sound so intense and so odd and 
               so haunting that the suggestible among us might imagine it 
               were the whisper of God.

               INT. COMMAND CENTER

               Chaos. Shliemann and the Tall Captain have been temporarily 
               blinded by the light from the Tabernacle. Indy makes short 
               work of his two escorts. He bashes their heads together. 
               When only one goes down at this, Indy uses the handle of his 
               bullwhip, which has appeared instantly in his hand, to put 
               the second one down.

               Shliemann, hand on his eyes, aims his Luger blindly at the 
               scuffle. Indy pushes the Tall Captain at Shliemann, who fires 
               on impact, killing the Tall Captain. Indy knocks out 
               Shliemann.

               Behind Indy, the brilliant light and weird noise of the Ark 
               have suddenly ceased, but the Tabernacle is ablaze and the 
               fire has quickly spread to stacks of supplies on either side. 
               Smoke is already starting to fill the cavern. Nazis are 
               running around, yelling for firefighting water. A burning 
               crate at the side of the Tabernacle is pushed over, only to 
               knock over a drum of heavy black oil. A river of flame shoots 
               across the cement.

               Indy grabs a rifle with bayonet from the prostrate body of 
               one of his former escorts and runs back into the flaming 
               Tabernacle.

               INT. THE TABERNACLE

               Indy jumps through the flames into what is now a tent of 
               fire. He looks around at the dead bodies, then at the Ark. 
               The lid has slammed down shut again and the Ark shines gold 
               in the flames. Before it, where Belloq once stood, is a pile 
               of ash and charred debris. Indy registers this, then continues 
               to scan the scene.

                                     INDY
                         Marion! Marion, can you hear me?

               Suddenly, Indy looks as -

               The far side of the Tabernacle burns completely away, 
               revealing Marion, tied spread-eagle between two upright posts. 
               Her nightgown is now in tatters, black with soot. She is 
               gagged, but her eyes are screaming, focused on the flaming 
               river of black oil which is about to engulf her feet.

               Indy rushes toward her, unaware of a uniformed Nazi who has 
               appeared from the flames. Marion looks up to see Indy and 
               the Nazi leveling his submachine gun at Indy. She motions 
               desperately with her eyes. Indy dives and rolls through the 
               flames just as the Nazi opens fire. From the floor, Indy 
               blasts the Nazi.

               The river of burning oil is only a foot from Marion.

               Indy jumps up and runs toward the bound Marion, his bayonet 
               aimed directly at her. Her wide eyes flash between the flames 
               and the shining blade. Expertly, Indy slashes down both sides 
               at Marion, cutting all four bindings. Marion falls backwards, 
               away from the flames, but before she hits the ground, Indy 
               is there, catching her in his arms.

               They embrace. They kiss. They break.

                                     INDY
                         Hi.

                                     MARION
                         Oh, Indy! Thank god you're here.

                                     INDY
                         Glad I could make it.

               Indy rises, pulling her up with him. The Tabernacle is burning 
               away so fast that soon Indy and Marion will be completely 
               exposed. Indy rushes over and grabs the submachine gun and a 
               Luger from the dead Nazi.

                                     INDY
                         Let's get out of here.

                                     MARION
                         What about the Ark?

               Indy stops, startled by her spunky attitude. He's considering 
               their changes.

                                     INDY
                         Are you game?

                                     MARION
                         Hell yes! We've made it this far.

                                     INDY
                              (grins at her)
                         Okay. Let's do it.

               They approach the altar through the dying flames, Indy 
               slinging the submachine gun over his back. The long carrying 
               poles are still in place.

                                     INDY
                         Whatever you do, don't touch it. 
                         Let's put it on the floor.

               Marion nods. Each taking an end with the poles, they lift 
               the Ark from the altar and lower it to the floor. Marion 
               grunts under the weight. Indy registers this, hands her the 
               submachine gun. He pulls out his whip, motions her back, and 
               sweeps the whip tightly around the body of the Ark. The whip 
               wraps snugly around the plaiting and Indy ties it off. The 
               Ark is now harnessed to the whip handle. Indy gives it an 
               experimental pull and the Ark slides across the smooth cement. 
               Indy indicates the direction of the second train tunnel.

                                     INDY
                         We'll go down that side. Shoot anyone 
                         who looks at us crosseyed.

               INT. COMMAND CENTER

               Two huge stacks of goods are ablaze and the Nazis are having 
               trouble getting water to them. The Nazis main concern at 
               this point is an enormous, neat stack of wooden cartridge 
               boxes which are piled down the wall from one of the already 
               blazing, and now teetering, stacks of general goods. Nervous 
               Nazis are moving the heavy cartridge boxes as fast as they 
               can, but it's slow work and the threatening fire is close.

               Indy and Marion make their way along the side of the center 
               court, Indy grimacing with the strain of pulling the Ark. 
               One Nazi stops directly in front of them, looking at them 
               queerly. Indy knocks him out with the butt of his Luger just 
               as Marion is about to fire.

               Out in the court, Shliemann has regained his eyesight. Now 
               he crouches, scanning the scene desperately for Indy. He 
               looks into the remains of the Tabernacle and spots the empty 
               altar. Beyond it, the unoccupied posts where Marion was bound.

               At the entrance to the second train tunnel, Indy and Marion 
               struggle to lift the Ark into a mine car. Marion has the 
               submachine gun slung over her back. The Ark drops heavily 
               into the bottom of the car. The noise attracts the attention 
               of five water-carrying Nazis. They see what's going on and 
               reach for their side-arms. Indy grabs Marion, pulls her in 
               front of him - as though to use her as a shield - and flips 
               the submachine gun, still on her back, toward the Nazis.

               He opens fire, turning Marion's body so he can mow all five 
               down.

               Shliemann spins around and looks at the tunnel entrance. He 
               points at Indy and Marion, who have just hopped into the 
               mine car with the Ark.

                                     SHLIEMANN
                         Stop them! Kill them!

               A dozen Nazis spin and look at the mine car. Marion is just 
               leveling the submachine gun. Indy pushes forward the throttle 
               and the mine car moves toward the tunnel, picking up speed. 
               As the Nazis raise their guns to fire, Marion and Indy both 
               open up, peppering the area with lead. As the mine car is 
               about to disappear into the tunnel -

                                     INDY
                              (to Marion)
                         Get down!

               As the car disappears, bullets pock the entrance of the 
               tunnel. Shliemann runs up with three Nazis. They jump into 
               the next mine car and take off, disappearing into the tunnel.

               Over at the burning stack of goods, some terrified fire-
               fighters scurry away as the burning pile of general goods 
               falls over onto the stack of cartridge boxes. The wooden 
               boxes immediately start burning. Many of the Nazis just want 
               to get out of there, but a couple of disciplined OFFICERS 
               are trying to salvage the situation. They point to the far 
               side of the court, the walls are lines with oil and gas drums.

                                     OFFICER
                         We must cover the drums! Protect 
                         them from the bullets!

               INTERCUTTING INDY AND MARION WITH SHLIEMANN AND THE NAZIS

               We see a most extraordinary pursuit. This tunnel is of 
               identical design to the first, except more twisty. This early 
               section goes slightly uphill, as though headed for the summit 
               of a rollercoaster. The low cross beams and the higher 
               sections in between are causing the Nazis to alternately 
               stand and duck in their efforts to get a clear shot at the 
               lead car. One German times it wrong and gets whacked. Indy 
               in unhappy with the speed of his car and he's right, the 
               Nazis are moving faster and gaining. When both cars are in 
               the same high section, the Nazis blast away at them. The 
               noise is deafening, with barking guns, splintering rock, and 
               twanging ricochets contributing to the din. As Marion fires 
               a return volley low over the Ark, Indy kicks at the throttle, 
               convinced it is jammed.

               INT. COMMAND CENTER

               The Officers are directing the placement of every moveable 
               item in front of the oil drums. Desks, crates, chairs, food, 
               all are heaped in front of the fuel. All the workers cast 
               frequent nervous glances back at the burning cartridge boxes 
               across the court. Suddenly the worst begins to happen at the 
               cartridge boxes. Hundreds of thousands of live cartridges 
               begin exploding, flying around the court like shrapnel. Hot 
               lead begins to zing off the exposed fuel drums, leaving big 
               dents.

               INT. TRAIN TUNNEL - LONG STRAIGHTAWAY

               The car with Indy and Marion looks almost sluggish compared 
               to the pursuing Nazi car as they both make their way into an 
               usually long straightaway. Marion discards her empty 
               submachine gun as Indy kicks at his throttle and casts a 
               worried look back at Shliemann.

               Shliemann, sensing victory, smiles evilly and carefully takes 
               aim. Indy and Marion will be easy targets until they reach 
               that approaching low cross beam, which is the crest of the 
               rising tunnel.

               INT. COMMAND CENTER - CLOSE ON FUEL DRUM

               A fuel drum, already pocked by bullets is finally penetrated 
               by high velocity hot lead. It explodes in a ball of flame. 
               And then its neighbor. Then all is exploding flame.

               INT. TRAIN TUNNEL - LONG STRAIGHTAWAY

               Shliemann and his cohorts hear the explosions behind them 
               and look back that way.

               Indy kicks the throttle one more time and it goes! Their car 
               doubles its speed and shoots under the low cross beam at the 
               same instant as -

               A huge dragon of all-consuming fire shoots up the tunnel 
               behind the Nazis, catches their car and incinerates Shliemann 
               and his men. The tunnel collapses in this section, burying 
               the fried Nazis forever.

               INT. TRAIN TUNNEL

               Indy and Marion look back at the low cross beam as the last 
               tongue of flame makes it there and then is doused by falling 
               rock and dirt. They look at each other, then turn their 
               attention back to their own predicament. Their mine car is 
               going incredible fast as it moves into a downward section of 
               wildly twisting tunnel.

                                     MARION
                         Slow it down!

               Indy is already pulling the throttle. It moves easily. 
               Unfortunately, it is no longer attached to the motor. The 
               mine car is out of control. After several moments, far ahead, 
               appears a circle of bright daylight - the end of the tunnel! 
               It approaches at a frightening rate. Indy reaches out and 
               grasps Marion's hand. They exchange looks and then turn to 
               look ahead.

               THEIR POV

               We're taking this last stretch with them. It's a familiar 
               nightmare. It has to do with a rollercoaster that ends 
               suddenly and disastrously. The shocking brightness of sunlight 
               rushes up to engulf us, blinding us in its glare.

               EXT. THE ISLAND - END OF TRACKS, DOCK

               High up on the slope of the island, Indy and Marion's mine 
               car shoots out of the black tunnel and roars down toward a 
               little dock at the end of the tracks.

               A small Nazi transport launch, carefully disguised as a Greek 
               fishing boat, sits bobbing by the dock. The only human: a 
               Nazi Sentry dressed as a Greek peasant. He is perched on a 
               pile of seed bags which are stacked at the very end of the 
               train tracks. As the mine car barrels noisily down toward 
               him, he throws away some burlap to reveal a mounted machine 
               gun which he spins quickly around toward the approaching 
               mine car. He opens fire.

               In the out-of-control mine car, Indy pulls Marion down with 
               him. They are squashed into the corner trying to avoid contact 
               with the bouncing Ark. Bullets clang against the outside of 
               the car and whiz inches overhead. Indy and Marion are forced 
               into a tighter and tighter embrace of life.

               At the machine gun post, the Nazi Sentry has been firing 
               like crazy, but now there is terror in his eyes. He realizes 
               the car is not going to stop. He lacks faith in his 
               stronghold. Too late.

               The mine car smashes into the seed bag bunker. And right on 
               through. The Nazi Sentry, his machine gun and a dozen bursting 
               seed bags are slammed into the ocean in a wild, hurtling 
               mass. The mine car jumps, bounces and spins around, then 
               slides to a stop in a cloud of seed at the edge of the water.

               INT. COMMAND CENTER

               Fire. Everywhere. No sign of life. A large gaping doorway, 
               flames ringing it, blazing into the room beyond. Hanging by 
               one hinge there, its metal blasted and jagged, is a heavy 
               door with the signed lettering, in German, "DANGER - 
               MUNITIONS".

               The first explosion happens. It's a baby compared to what's 
               coming yet it rocks the earth. It's terrible. And then, almost 
               immediately, another. The long, irregular, ever larger chain 
               of explosions begins.

               EXT. THE ISLAND - VARIOUS SHOTS - DAY

               The island rumbles and shakes. From fissures and small natural 
               caves, dirt and rock shoot out like spraying water. Still 
               the explosion continue. A huge chunk of white cliff falls 
               away into the turbulent sea. Birds scream and soar, afraid 
               to land.

               Finally, we settle on a full shot of the island. We can 
               recognize that the small opening high on the slope from which 
               a cloud of smoke and dust is billowing is the end of the 
               mine tunnel. And there below it, quite small from this 
               distance is the dock. And the boat that looks like a Greek 
               fishing boat. There can be no mistake even from this far 
               away - the boat is chugging out to sea.

               INT. THE PENTAGON - DAY

               Indy, Brody, and Marion, looking very stylish, are seated in 
               Colonel Musgrove's huge office. Sun pours in a window, through 
               which Washington can be seen sparkling across the Potomac. 
               Everything is neat and clean and regular. Including the three 
               men who are arrayed around the office. Two we know - Col. 
               Musgrove and Maj. Eaton. The third is an unnamed Bureaucrat. 
               He hangs back, smiling and genial, his features obscured by 
               the glare of the window. He doesn't say anything, yet you 
               have a sense that the others defer to him in the matter at 
               hand. He is the essence of all that is Byzantine and 
               inscrutable in our scrubbed government machine.

               Indy and Brody are dissatisfied with the way the meeting has 
               gone. Marion, on the other hand, is very happy and eager to 
               get out of there. Eaton's manner is irritatingly cheery.

                         You've done your country a great 
                         service.

                                     EATON
                         And we trust you found the settlement 
                         satisfactory?

                                     MARION
                         Quite.

                                     EATON
                         Good, good.
                              (glances around at 
                              the others)
                         Then I guess that about does it.

                                     BRODY
                         When can we have the Ark?

               Eaton's glance flicks over to the mysterious Bureaucrat, 
               then back to Brody.

                                     EATON
                         I thought we answered that. It's 
                         someplace very safe -

                                     INDY
                              (heated)
                         That's a powerful force. Research 
                         should be done -

                                     EATON
                         Oh, it will be, Dr. Jones, I assure 
                         you. We have top men working on it 
                         right now.

                                     INDY
                         Who?

                                     EATON
                         Top men.

               Indy exchanges a look with Brody.

                                     INDY
                         We may be able to help.

                                     EATON
                         We appreciate that. And we won't 
                         hesitate to call on you.

                                     MUSGROVE
                              (dismissing them)
                         Thank you all. Thank you again.

               Indy looks them over coldly. He gets up, sullen.

               EXT. PENTAGON STEPS - DAY

               Indy, Brody and Marion emerge from the building. Brody bids 
               them farewell and moves off in another direction. Marion 
               clings to Indy's arm in an energetic, very feminine way, 
               scolding him.

                                     MARION
                         Well they aren't going to tell you, 
                         so why don't you just forget it. I'd 
                         think you'd had enough of that damn 
                         Ark. Just put your mind on something 
                         else.

               Indy stops, looking across the river, his mind occupied.

                                     INDY
                         Yeah, like what?

               Marion makes a face, then puts her arms around his neck and 
               plants a humdinger of a kiss on his mouth. It goes on a while. 
               Finally they break.

                                     INDY
                         It's not the Ark... but it'll have 
                         to do.

               They move down the steps, smiling.

               INT. GOVERNMENT WAREHOUSE

               The Ark of the Covenant sits in a wooden crate. A wooden lid 
               comes down and hides it from view. The lid is solidly nailed 
               to the crate as we read the stenciled message on top -

                                        TOP SECRET
                                   ARMY INTEL. #9906753
                                       DO NOT OPEN!

               The hammering is completed and hands shift the heavy crate 
               onto a dolly.

               THE END CREDITS ROLL AS WE SEE -

               A Little Old Government Warehouseman begins pushing the crated 
               Ark down as aisle. Soon we see that the aisle is formed by 
               huge stacks or crates. They come in many shapes and sizes, 
               but when it comes right down to it, they all look like the 
               one that holds the Ark. All have markings like the message 
               we've just seen. Pretty soon we're far enough and high enough 
               away from the Little Old Government Warehouseman to see that 
               this is one of the biggest rooms in the world. And it is 
               full. Crates and crates. All looking alike. All gathering 
               dust.

               And then we notice that the Little Old Government 
               Warehouseman, pushing his new crate ahead of him, has turned 
               into another aisle and disappeared from view.

                                                                  FADE OUT:

                                --------------

       FADE IN:

1.     INT.  "THE DRAGON" NIGHTCLUB - NIGHT                            1.

       A Chinese GONG SOUNDS and the glittering doors of an art Deco pa-
       poda slide open to reveal a mammoth silver stairway down which
       rows of beautiful women start descending   (BEGIN MAIN TITLES)

       The lovely ladies are a mix of races and they sing a strange,
       haunting melody -- one might think them a heavenly choir, if it
       weren't for their sexy, clinging lame gowns.

2.     INT.  CLUB ENTRANCE                                             2.

       From the ethereal beauties, we cut to a street urchin's dirty
       face: SHORT ROUND is a ten-year-old Chinese kis wearing a beat-
       up American baseball cap.

       Sneaking into the club, Short Round weaves past the fancy gowns
       and silk suits, heading toward the music in the main ballroom.

3.     INT.  THE BALLROOM                                              3.

       Short Round enters and stares across the smoky nightclub.  On the
       stage, he sees a giant paper-mache dragon laying curled around
       the pagoda.

       Now, the dragon's eyes light up, its nostrils exhale smoke and
       its enormous jaws open.  Out of the dragon's mouth walks the star
       of the stage show:

       WILLIE SCOTT, a dreamy beauty singing a sultry solo white the or-
       chestra wails the accompaniment.

       But Short Round's not here to ogle crooning dames.  He surveys
       the rich Chinese, American and European revelers.  Jewels flash
       and champagne flows.  Short Round finally spots a table of
       somber-looking Chinese men in suits.

       Short Round chews gum and stares at the men.  Then he turns to
       go.  WU HAN, a waiter with a scar across his cheek, watches Short
       Round leave.

4.     INT.  CLUB ENTRANCE                                            4.

       As Short Round hurries toward the exit, he bumps into a man in a
       tuxedo entering the club.  Short Round looks up at the man, but
       we don't see his face.

       Then Short Round is grabbed by the scruff of his neck and a door-
       man hustles him out the door, Short Round yelling insults all the
       way.

       A maitre d' apologizes to the man in the tuxedo and two hat-check
       girls smile at him familiarly as he continues into the ballroom.
       We notice something incongruous:  the man in the tuxedo is wear-
       ing work boots caked with mud.

5.     INT.  THE BALLROOM                                             5.

       The man in the tuxedo stops to watch Willie Scott singing sexily
       on the stage.  Then he looks around and sees the table of somber
       Chinese men that Short Round spotted earlier.

       As the man in the tuxedo walks toward the table, he removes a
       cigarette from a silver case.  He arrives at the table just as
       the chorus and orchestra reach a crescendo --

       And on the stage, a glistening, muscular slave swings a huge ham-
       mer toward an enormous brass gong --

       The man in the tuxedo leans to receive a light from a cigarette-
       girl and, as the GONG BOOMS, the match flares to reveal his face
       for the first time:

       It's INDIANA JONES.  Elegant in a tuxedo -- dressed to kill.  The
       TITLES END and over this a legend appears on the screen:

                                SHANGHAI - 1935

       At the table, the four Chinese man in suits stare coldly at Indi-
       ana.

                                   LAO
                       Dr. Jones.

                                   INDIANA
                       Lao She.

                                   LAO
                       Nee chin lie how ma?

       Lao's men laugh and assume that Indy doesn't understand his joke.

                                   INDIANA
                       Wah hung how, nee nah?  Wah hwey
                       hung jing chee jah loo nee kao
                       soo wah shu shu.

       LAO SHE looks angry and his men's smiles fade.

                                   LAO
                       You never told me you spoke my
                       language, Dr. Jones.

                                   INDIANA
                       I don't like to show off.

       Indiana takes a seat across the table from Shanghai's notorious
       crime-lord.  Lao is fifty, wealthy enough to now display some
       fat, but still muscular from his fight to the top of the garbage
       heap.

                                   LAO
                       For this special occasion, I
                       ordered champagne and caviar.

       Indiana looks at the pile of caviar on the plate in front of him
       -- and stubs his cigarette out in it.  The cigarette sizzles and
       Lao's smiles dies with it.

       There's applause as Wille Scott finishes her song.  At the
       table, Lao stares at Indiana with a strange intensity.

                                   LAO
                       So, it is true, Dr. Jones?  you
                       found Nurhachi?

                                   INDIANA
                       Sure, I found him.  Then last
                       night I had a little trouble.
                       Somebody tried to slit my throat.

       Indiana looks across the table at Lao's son, CHEN, who resembles
       a bulldog and snarls like one now.

                                   INDIANA (Cont'd)
                       It was dark, but I think one of
                       your sons tried to get Nurhachi
                       without paying for him.

       Indy stares pointedly at Chen's recently bandaged hand.  Chen
       mutters and stands angrily -- Lao barks a command in Chinese and
       Chen sits down again.

                                   LAO
                       You have insulted my son.

                                   INDIANA
                       Next time I'll cut off more than
                       his finger.

                                   LAO
                       Dr. Jones -- I want Nurhachi.

       Lao pulls a wad of cash out of his pocket and puts it on the
       table.  Indiana glances at it.

                                   INDIANA
                       As I recall the deal was consid-
                       erably more.

       Now a pretty hand slips onto Lao's shoulder and he looks up to
       see Willie Scott.  Lao kisses her hand.  Willie is unaware of the
       explosive mood at the table and she smiles flirtaciously at Indi-
       ana.

                                   WILLIE
                                   (to Lao)
                       Aren't you going to introduce
                       us?

                                   LAO
                       This is Willie Scott.
                             (watching Indy)
                       And this is Indiana Jones, the
                       famous archaeologist.

       Willie sits down between Lao and Indy.  She takes out a small
       mirror to check her make-up.

                                   LAO (Cont'd)
                       Dr. Jones found Nurhachi for me
                       and is about to deliver him --
                       now.

       Lao nods across the table and Indy sees KAO KAN, Lao's second
       son, open his coat and remove a silver-plated pistol.  Indiana
       looks worried.  Willie doesn't notice as she fixes her make-up
       and coyly teases Indiana.

                                   WILLIE
                       Well -- I thought archaeologists
                       were always funny little men
                       searching for their mummies --
                                  (yelping)
                       Aaahhh!

       She looks down terrified at the knife Indy is poking against her
       ribs.

                                   WILLE (Cont'd)
                       I was only kidding, can't you
                       take a joke -- ?
                                  (to Lao)
                       Lao, he's got a knife!

                                   INDIANA
                       Put the gun away, sonny.

       Kao Kan glances at his father.  Lao finally nods to his son and
       he slips the pistol back into his pocket.

                                   INDIANA
                       Now I suggest you pay me what you
                       promised -- or your girlfriend
                       here is going to be squealing a
                       new tune.

       The ritzy patrons at the tables nearby are unaware of the tawdry
       drama quietly unfolding at this table.

       Willie eyes the blade and whimpers.  She looks imploringly at Lao
       and he slowly reaches into his pocket.  He puts ten gold coins
       next to the cash on the table.

       Indy leans forward to look at the gold coins -- so intently that
       he fails to notice Kao Kan spilling some powder into Indy's cham-
       pagne glass!

                                   INDIANA
                       Try again Lao -- the deal was
                       more.

       The knife pokes Willie and she whimpers again.  Lao reaches into
       another pocket and brings out a folded piece of rice paper -- he
       opens it and a large diamond and ruby spill out onto the table.

                                   INDIANA (Cont'd)
                       Bingo...you see, Lao, with a
                       but of persuasion, even you can
                       be an honest fellow.

       Indy smiles and jabs the knife into the middle of the table.
       Then he lifts his champagne glass in a toast to Lao -- who
       watches expectantly as Indiana moves the glass toward his lips --

       Suddenly Willie stands angrily, jostling Indy's arm so that he
       doesn't drink his champagne.

                                   WILLIE
                       Look at this!  He put a hole
                       in my dress from Paris!

       Lao sees Indy put his champagne glass down and he snarls at Wil-
       lie --

                                   LAO
                       Sit down!

       Willie quickly obeys.  Lao forces a smile at Indy and lifts his
       glass to seal the deal --

                                   LAO (Cont'd)
                       To your health, Dr. Jones.

       Lao sips hs champagne and watches hopefully as Indy picks up his
       glass and this time Indy does drink the champagne. Then he
       reaches for the cash --

       But Chen grins and puts a silver snuff bottle next to the cash,
       gold and jewels -- he tips the little bottle over and some white
       powder spills out of it --

                                   INDIANA
                       What's that?

                                   LAO
                       A bonus, Dr. Jones.  That is
                       poison.  You just drank the
                       rest of it.

       Indiana examines his champagne glass and sees a residue at the
       bottom of it.  He swallows and feels sick, wondering it it's fear
       or the poison already taking effect.

                                   LAO (Cont'd)
                       There is an antidote for this
                       poison.  You give me Nurhachi --
                       I give you the antidote.

       Indiana is sweating.  Willie looks at him and sees Indy's hand
       shaking.

                                   LAO (Cont'd)
                       The poison works fast, Dr. Jones.
                       Where is Nurhachi?

       Indiana finally reaches into his pocket.  Next to the cash, gold,
       jewels and poison, Indiana sets down a beautiful small box.  Lao
       and his men stare hypnotically at the exquisite gold and enamel
       box.

                                   WILLIE
                                (nervously)
                       This Nurhachi's a very small guy.

       Nobody pays any attention to her as Lao reaches for the box.

                                   INDIANA
                       Inside are the remains of Nur-
                       hachi -- the first Emperor of the
                       Manchu Dynasty.

       Lao opens the box carefully and stares reverently at the grey
       powder inside.

                                   INDIANA (Cont'd)
                       Now what about the antidote,
                       Lao.

                                   LAO
                             (holding the box)
                       At last I have the ashes of my
                       sacred ancestor!

                                   WILLIE
                       So, what's the big deal?  Let
                       me see it --

       Qillie grabs Lao's arm and some of the precious ashes spill out
       of the gold box.  Stunned by this desecration of his ancestor,
       Lao grabs Willie by the wrist and twists her arm --

                                   LAO
                       You fool!

                                   WILLIE
                       Ow, you're hurting me, you miser-
                       able little hood!

                                   INDIANA
                       Let go of her, Lao.  And give me
                       the antidote.

       Lao just laughs evilly -- until a waiter moves up behind Lao and
       the crimelord suddenly stiffens.  He lets go of Willie's wrist
       and raises his hands off the table.  Chen stops collecting the
       money and jewels.

       Kao Kan tenses and Indy smiles at Wu Han, the Chinese waiter with
       the scar, who is standing behind Lao.  Wu Han has a towel over
       his hand  --  under it, he has a pistol pressed against Lao's
       spine.

                                   INDIANA (Cont'd)
                              (smiling at Wu Han)
                       I like the service here.

                                   WILLIE
                                  (puzzled)
                       Hey, he's not a waiter...

                                   INDIANA
                       No, Wu Han's an old friend I
                       brought along.
                                   (to Lao)
                       So, the game's not over. Put
                       the antidote on the table, Lao.

       Lao carefully reaches into his pocket and puts a small glass vial
       of liquid next to the cash, gold, jewels, poison and sacred box.
       Indy looks relieved as he reaches for the vial of antidote --
       then he hears a muffled report!  And another!

       Wu Han groans and sways.  Indy starts to stand but Chen immedi-
       ately turns the smoking pistol with the silencer that he used to
       kill Wu Han -- Indy sees it pointed at him now and he remains in
       his seat.

       Kao Kan stands and grabs Wu Han, easing the phoney waiter into
       the chair he just vacated.  The muffled shooting hasn't attracted
       any attention.  The nightclub activity continues an Indy speaks
       emotionally to his dying friend.

                                   INDIANA
                       Wu Han  --  listen to me  --  I'm
                       going to get you out of here.

       In pain, Wu Han looks at Indy and struggles to speak --

                                   WU HAN
                       Not this time, my friend...
                             (smiling bravely)
                       I followed you on many adventures --
                       but into the great Unknown Mystery,
                       I go first, Indy...

       Wu Han dies and slumps forward.  Indiana is shattered by the
       death of his old friend.

                                   LAO
                       Don't be sad, Dr. Jones -- you
                       will soon join him.

       Indy's gaze shifts from his dead friend to Lao's sneering face.
       Then Indy sees the murderous Chen giggling perversely.  Indy's
       anger is compounded by the poison burning in his gut and his vis-
       ion of Chen's ugly face blurs into a double image --

       Indy stands up unsteadily.  Chen assumes he's about to keel over
       from the poison -- but Indy suddenly turns and grabs a real wai-
       ter at another table.  The waiter holds a long skewer of roasted
       pigeons that he's just set afire --

       Indy grabs the skewer of pigeons flambee and hurls is across the
       table!  Chen fires and misses -- and screams as the skewer stabs
       into his chest and the burning pigeons flame in front of his hor-
       rified face!

       This the other tables definitely notice.  There are screams and
       all hell breaks loose.  Indiana shoves past Willie and reaches
       for the vial on the table --

                                   INDIANA
                       The antidote -- !

       But he's grabbed from behind by Kao Kan.  Indy elbows the punk,
       reaches back and grabs his head -- and somersaults Kao Kan onto
       the table!

       As nubmer two son crashes into the table, the impact sends the
       Emperor Nurhachi's ashes billowing into Lao's stricken face!

       Indiana yells as he sees the vial of antidote rolling across the
       table -- and falling!

       Indiana dives and catches the antidote just before it hits the
       floor -- then Indy's hand is brutally stomped on by one of Lao's
       henchmen and the vial rolls away.

       Indiana angrily raises his head, smashing it up into the hench-
       man's groin -- the man howls like a banshee and hobbles away.
       
       Meanwhile, Willie watches Lao grabbing for cash from the table.
       Willie lunges past the pigeon-skewered Chen to snatch the jewels,
       but unfortunately Kao Kan knocks them off the table as he leaps
       to attack Indy.

       Indiana scrambles on his hands and knees after the rolling vial.
       People keep kicking it -- he almost has it when Willie runs into
       him, trips and lands on her back.

                                   INDIANA
                       Look out, damn it, I need that
                       antidote!

                                   WILLIE
                       Who cares?  Where's that diamond!

       Gunfire explodes and they both scramble in different directions.
       Indy dives through the fleeing nightclub patrons and slides be-
       hind a water-spewing fountain.  Water kicks up as Indy is shot at
       by Lao and his henchmen.

       Indy sees the vial of antidote kicked again and it spins across
       the marble floor -- feeling the poison, Indy shakes his head
       groddily and splashes water on his face.

       Meanwhile, Willie is chasing her diamond, shoving through the
       panicked crowd.  She spots the diamond!  Another elegantly
       dresses soman is bending to pick it up --

                                   WILLIE
                              (acidly polite)
                       Excuse me, but I believe that's
                       my diamond!

       Willie smiles and suddenly kicks the woman in the butt!  Willie
       reaches to get the diamond but not before the other woman tackles
       her.

       Behind the fountain, Indiana makes a break -- he runs and dives
       on top of a serving cart.  The wheeled cart hurtles toward an un-
       suspecting gunman, crashes into him from behind and sends him
       flying head first into a row of ice buckets.

       Nearby, Willie slugs the other lady in the jaw and grabs for the
       elusive diamond just as the ice buckets showers ice across the
       floor -- which camouflages the diamond!

                                   WILLIE
                       Aw nuts!

       Searching desperately for the jewel, Willie sees the vial of
       antidote spinning across the floor --as it slides by, she grabs
       it.

                                   INDIANA (O.S.)
                       Hey,doll!  Don't move!

       She sees Indy speeding by atop the serving cart.  Lao and his
       gunmen rush out to block the way.  Indy rolls off the cart and
       slides behind a potted palm as Lao's men open fire again.

                                   INDIANA (Cont'd)
                           (shouting to Willie)
                       Hey, don't go away!  I need that!

       Willie smiles meanly as she slips the vial down the front of her
       dress, thumbs her nose at Indiana and walks away.

                                   INDIANA (Cont'd)
                       If I wasn't dying, I'd kill her...

       Hiding behind the palm tree, Indiana looks around and spots a gi-
       ant statue at the side of the stage.  Indy makes a break for it.

       As the gunmen open fire, Indy springs onto a chair -- jumps onto
       a table -- and leaps onto the stage.  He grabs the golden broad-
       sword from the Chinese warrior statue!

       As bullets smash into the statue, Indiana hides behind it.  Then
       he jumps out and swings the large sword toward the enormous brass
       gong.

       The crimson cord holding the gong is SLASHED!  Indy slings the
       sword at his assailants and gives the three-meter-high gong a
       helpful shove --

       The giant gong rolls and echoes as it crashes down the marble
       steps.  Indiana ducks behind it as it gains momentum and rolls
       across the dance floor.

       Using the gong as an enormous shield, Indy evades the gunfire ex-
       ploding -- bullets ricochet off the rolling brass gong as Indy
       runs behind it.

       Ahead, Willie hurries toward an exit -- she hears something and
       turns -- her eyes go wide as she sees the mammoth gong bearing
       down on her!

       Willie yells as Indiana grabs her arm and pulls her behind the
       gong with him --

       Lao watches amazed as he and his gunmen dodge tables trying to
       get better firing positions -- and more henchmen come into the
       club now and start firing machine guns!

       As bullets clang against the gong, Indiana and Willie run behind
       it.  Willie hollers as they head directly for a towering, floor-
       to-ceiling window!

       Indiana grabs Willie around the waist and, after the huge gong
       crashes through the stained-glass window, they both fly after it!

6.     EXT.  "THE DRAGON" NIGHTCLUB - NIGHT                           6.

       In a shower of sparkling glass, the enormous gong sails out and
       crashes down a sloping green-tiled roof.  Indiana Jones and Wil-
       lie Scott hurtle into the night air after it!

       The gong rolls down the roof and they hit the tiles behind it,
       Indiana holding onto Willie as they roll one-over-the-other
       toward the edge -- Willie screams as they fall into thin air!

       Their entwined bodies plummet three stories:  ripping through a
       third-floor awning, crashing through an old man's mattress on a
       second-floor balcony --

       Finally they smash through the convertible top of a parked Duesen-
       berg and fall into the back seat!

7.     INT.  THE DUESENBERG                                           7.

       Willie sits up wide-eyed, speechless and amazed to be alive.
       Then she sees an equally astonished Short Round looking at them
       from the front seat.

                                   SHORT ROUND
                       Wow!  Holy smoke!  Crash landing!

                                   INDIANA
                       Step on it, Short Round!

                                   SHORT ROUND
                       Okey doke, Indy!  Hold onto your
                       potatoes!

       The twelve-year-old Chinese kid turns his baseball cap bill-
       backwards and steps on the gas!  The tires squeal as the car
       roars off --

                                   WILLIE
                       For crying out loud, a kid's driv-
                       ing the car?!

                                   INDIANA
                       Relax, I've been giving him lessons.

8.     EXT.  THE NIGHTCLUB - NIGHT                                    8.

       The Duesenberg races past the entrace to the nightclub as Lao
       and his man rush out and jump into two black sedans.  The sedans
       screech off in pursuit of the Duesenberg.

9.     INT.  THE DUESENBERG                                           9.

       As Short Round eagerly swerves around a corner, Willie holds on
       for dear life.  Indiana suddenly puts his hand down the front of
       Willie's dress --

                                   WILLIE
                       Listen, we just met for crissake!
                       I'm not that kind of gril!

                                   INDIANA
                       Don't get your hopes up -- where's
                       the antidote?

       Indiana withdraws his hand, having finally found the vial.  He
       opens is quickly, tips the vial to his lips and grimaces as he
       swallows the stuff.

                                   WILLIE
                       You don't look very good.

                                   INDIANA
                       Poison never agrees with me.
                              (shouting forward)
                       Pull a right, Short Round, and
                       head for the Wang Poo bridge!

                                   SHORT ROUND
                       Check!  Gotcha!

       As the car accelerates, Indy peers out the back window at their
       pursuers.  Willie notices her reflection in the side window --

                                   WILLIE
                       Look at what you've done to me!
                       I'm a mess!  My lipstick's smeared,
                       I broke two nails, I've got an aw-
                       ful run in my stocking -- !

       Gunfire suddenly explodes, bullets whizz through the canvas top
       and the rear window shatters and sprays glass!  Willie ducks and
       cringes terrified in the corner --

                                   INDIANA
                       Somehow I think you've got bigger
                       problems.

       Indy grabs his shoulder bag and pulls a pistol out of it.  He
       pokes the gun through the broken window and starts firing back at
       their pursuers -- then he turns and looks ahead.

                                   INDIANA (Cont'd)
                       There, Shorty!  Through the
                       tunnel!

       Through the windows we see the car racing into a tunnel.  Lights
       from the pursuing cars flash through the rear window and gunfire
       echoes in the tunnel.

                                   WILLIE
                       What're we going to do?!  Where're
                       we going?!

                                   INDIANA
                       The airport...No, look out,
                       Short Round!  Left, left!

       Indy reaches over the front seat and helps Short Round navigate.

10.    EXT.  A SHANGHAI SQUARE - NIGHT                                10.

       The Duesenberg tears around the square, followed by Lao's two se-
       dans.  People on the street dive for cover -- coolies pulling
       rickshaws go into hyper-jov --lanterns spanning the street crash
       down and are dragged behind the Duesenberg.  Bullets exlode and
       amazed prostitutes watch the cars zoom past.

11.    INT.  THE DUESENBERG - NIGHT                                   11.

       The chaotic chase continues -- bullets whine past and the shred-
       ded convertible top whips in the wind.

                                   INDIANA
                                 (shouting)
                       You got the tickets, Short Round?

                                   SHORT ROUND
                       Sure, Indy -- three tickets!
                       You, me and Wu Han --

       Shorty throws an envelope back and Indy looks at the three
       tickets.

                                   INDIANA
                                   (sadly)
                       Wu Han's not coming, Shorty.

       Unaware of what happened at the club, Short Round thinks a mo-
       ment.

                                   SHORT ROUND
                       Don't worry, Indy.  Short Round
                       number one bodyguard now!

       Willie reaches for the extra ticket.

                                   WILLIE
                       I'll take the extra ticket.
                              (grabbing it
                                 from Indy)
                       Where's this plane going anyway?

                                   INDIANA
                       Siam.

                                   WILLIE
                       Siam?  But I'm not dressed for
                       Siam...

12.    EXT. COUNTRY HIGHWAY - NIGHT                                   12.

       Leaving behind the squalid port, the Duesenberg flies along the
       highway through the trees.  In a moment, Lao's two sedans race
       by.

13.    EXT.  NANG TAO AIRFIELD - NIGHT                                13.

       The Duesenberg swings around a curve and skids through gravel to-
       ward the airfield.  In the distance there is a small terminal but
       Short Round wheels the car toward the cargo area --

       A two-engine passenger plane is revving its motors and the last
       passengers are boarding.  The Duesenberg squeals to a stop and
       Indy jumps out with Willie and Short Round right on his heels.

       A contingent of airport Military Police move to bar their way
       until WEBER, a heavy-set Englishman, runs up pufffing and shout-
       ing.

                                   WEBER
                       No, no, they're all right!
                       Let them through please.

                                   INDIANA
                       Thanks, Weber.

                                   WEBER
                       Dr. Jones, this is positively the
                       last time our airline can hold a
                       plane for you.  Now you must hurry!

       While Short Round grabs a small bag out of the car, Weber and a
       stewardess take their tickets and rush them all toward the air-
       plane.

       Meanwhile, the two sedans skid to a stop and Lao and his son Kao
       Kan jumpsout with their henchmen.  The puzzled military police
       advance on them usspiciously  --

       Realizing he's outnumbered, Lao instructs his men to stay back
       and to put away their weapons.

14.    EXT.  THE AIRPLANE                                             14.

       Willie and Short Round charge up the ladder and onto the plane.
       Indy pauses at the top of the steps to give Lao a cocky farewell
       salute.  Indy boards the plane and the co-pilot slams the door.

15.    EXT.  THE AIRFIELD                                             15.

       The plane starts taxiing.  By the cars, Lao is buffeted by the
       prop wash as he angrily watches the plane roll away.  Behind Lao,
       his son, Kao Kan, stares at the plane taking off  -- a look on Kao
       Kan's face indicates that he hasn't given up yet...

       The plane lifts off the airfield, silhouetted against the clouds
       and the first light of dawn.

                                                               CUT TO:

16.    EXT.  THE DKY - MORNING                                        16.

       The sun flashes above the horizon and the plane banks through
       white billowing clouds at it heads west.

17.    INT.  THE PLANE                                                17.

       A door opens at the rear of the plane and Indiana Jones exits
       wearing more familiar attire:  a beat-up leather jacket over a
       khaki shirt and a snap-brim hat.  He passes a dozen passengers as
       he moves up the aisle carrying his rolled-up tuzedo.

       In the first row, Willie is busy fixing her make-up.  Shorty sits
       in the seat across the aisle from her.  Indy comes up and drops
       his tuxedo onto the floor.

       Willie sees him hook his coiled bullwhip over a coat-peg.

                                   WILLIE
                       So, what're you supposed to be,
                       a lion tamer?

                                   INDIANA
                       Since I was nice enough to let
                       you tag along, why don't you give
                       your mouth a rest?  Okay, doll?

       Indy pats her leg -- she removes his hand and reaches down and
       picks up his tuxedo coat.  She slips it on.

                                   WILLIE
                       I'm freezing.  What do you mean,
                       tag along?  From the minute you
                       walked into that nightclub, you
                       haven't been able to keep your
                       eyes off me.

                                   INDIANA
                       Oh yeah?

       He smiles and tips his hat down over his eyes to go to sleep...

18.    INT.  THE COCKPIT                                              18.

       At the same moment, the Chinese co-pilot tips his hat up off his
       eyes -- and looks scared to death!  He exclaims in Chinese --

                                   CO-PILOT (*subtitled*)
                       Good lord!

       He and the pilot see two biplanes materialize out of the clouds
       and dive directly toward them!  Suddenly, machine gunfire erupts!

                                   PILOT (*subtitled)
                       Dive for the clouds!  Dive!

19.    EXT.  THE SKY - DAY                                            19.

       The DC-3 banks into the clouds as the two biplanes attack.  In
       the back seat of the first biplane, we see Kao Kan watching the
       DC-3 like a hawk about to bring down a sparrow.

20.    INT.  THE COCKPIT                                              20.

       The biplanes swoop past both sides of the plane and bursts of
       gunfire rip along the fuselage.

                                   CO-PILOT (*subtitled)
                       They hit a fuel line!

                                   PILOT (*subtitled*)
                       Reduce speed -- get everyone out
                       of the plane!

21     INT.  THE PASSENGER CABIN                                      21.

       As the air battle rages, the passengers are tossed about and some
       start screaming.  Short Round peers out a window.

                                   SHORT ROUND
                       Lao send planes to kill Indy!

       Willie shakes Indy's arm but he continues snoring under his hat.

                                   WILLIE
                       Wake up!  It's the drug he drank
                       to stop the poison --

       The cockpit door bursts open and the Chinese co-pilot exits to
       make an announcement -- he smiles and speaks in CHINESE, then he
       smiles and speaks in FRENCH --

       Willie looks lost until the Chinese co-pilot smiles again and
       speaks in ENGLISH --

                                   CO-PILOT
                       Please to remain calm.  We start
                       passing out parachutes now --

       The co-pilot hurries toward the rear.  Willie looks petrified as
       a stewardess rushes up and hands her a parachute.

                                   WILLIE
                       You got to be kidding!  No!  No,
                       I can't!

       The pilot hurries out of the cockpit and grabs his parachute as
       he heads toward the back.

                                   WILLIE (Cont'd)
                       Wait -- who's flying the plane?!

       She opens the door to the cockpit --

                                   WILLIE (Cont'd)
                       Nobody's flying the plane ...

22.    EXT.  THE SKY - DAY                                            22.

       The DC-3 smokes through the clouds.  Passengers are bailing out
       -- parachutes billowing.  As one of the fighters swoops through
       the parachutes, Kao Kan searches the faces -- then he points at
       the DC-3.

                                   KAO KAN
                               (into the radio)
                       Jones!  Indiana Jones!

       The two planes roar off and start strafing the DC-3 again.

23.    INT.  THE PASSENGER CABIN                                      23.

       The co-pilot has a parachute on and is trying to get Short Round
       into one.

                                   CO-PILOT
                       Put it on!  What's wrong with
                       you?  You've got to jump!

                                   SHORT ROUND
                       No, can't leave Indy!

       Short Round suddenly butts the co-pilot in the stomach with his
       head.  The co-pilot yells and falls out the door.  Short Round
       sees the co-pilot's parachute billow.  Then Willie rushes up.

                                   WILLIE
                       Give me that parachute, I
                       changed my mind --

       She grabs the parachute and starts to fight Shorty over it--

                                   SHORT ROUND
                       No, this last one!  It's for Indy!

       They scuffle until the parachute skids across the floor.  Short
       Round jumps for it -- the parachute falls out the door and Short
       Round starts to fall out after it!

       Willie grabs him by the seat of his pants and hauls him back from
       the abyss!

24.    EXT.  THE SKY - DAY                                            24.

       The fighters peel off toward the DC-3 with their guns flaming in
       another attack.

25.    INT.  THE PASSENGER CABIN                                      25.

       Short Round tries to wake Indy again.  Finally, Shorty grabs
       Indy's bag, pulls his holster out of it and runs toward the back.

       Indy continues to sleep -- until bullets smash the window by his
       head and a fire extinguisher is hit and starts spraying into
       Indy's face.

       He finally awakens and jumps up.  He looks around is disbelief at
       the battle-torn, nearly-empty airplane.

                                   INDIANA
                                  (groggily)
                       We there yet?

       Indiana sees Shorty shooting his pistol out the side door as the
       planes swoop by again.  Out of ammo, Shorty throws the gun
       angrily at the passing plane.

       Indiana picks up his whip and attaches it to his belt as Willie
       runs over to him.

                                   WILLIE
                       There's nobody flying the plane!

26.    INT.  THE COCKPIT                                              26.

       The door flies open and Indy rushes in with Willie behind him.
       Indy appraises the situation quickly and jumps into the pilot's
       seat with total confidence --

                                   WILLIE (Cont'd)
                       You know how to fly?

       Indy surveys the control panels, the myraid of dials and switches --

                                   INDIANA
                       No.
                                  (hopefully)
                       Do you?

27.    INT.  THE PASSENGER CABIN                                      27.

       Willie runs screaming out of the cockpit, her last hope shatter-
       ed.  Shorty is pulling something out of the cargo compartment --
       he's found a machine gun and sets it up on a short tripod.

                                   SHORT ROUND
                       Come here, lady, hold this and
                       shut up please!

       He pulls Willie down to the floor and shoves her the ammunition
       belt that's draped toward the gun.  Then Shorty jumps behind the
       machine gun --

       As the first fighter appears off their side, Short Round blasts
       out the open door!  The machine gun explodes to life, chewing
       bullets, smoking and spitting shells at Willie --

       Willie hollers terrified by manages to feed the ammo belt as
       Short Round sights the blazing machine gun -- suddenly he shoops!

       Willie sees the fighter hit -- it smokes and veers away -- and
       then EXPLODES!

                                   SHORT ROUND
                       I get it!

                                   WILLIE
                       You got it!

       The second plane swoops down and Short Round blasts away.  This
       time as he swivels the gun, he misses and hits one of the DC-3's
       own engines and it explodes!

                                   SHORT ROUND
                       Oh oh -- big mistake!

28.    INT.  THE COCKPIT                                              28.

       Trying to figure out the controls, Indy looks up to see their en-
       gine explose into flames --

                                   INDIANA
                                  (angrily)
                       Short Round, what in the hell
                       are you doing?

       Suddenly the DC-3 emerges out of a cloud and Indy sees they are
       headed directly for a mountain!  He pulls back hard on the con-
       trols as a rocky peak looms lethally in front of them.

29.    EXT.  THE SKY - DAY                                            29.

       The DC-3 lifts at the last second and smashes some snow off the
       uppermost pinnacle as it clears the mountain by inches!

       Kao Kan's fighter is glued to the DC-3's tail and continues to
       strafe -- but the fighter pilot pulls up too late -- and the
       fighter explodes as it hits the peak of the mountain!

30.    INT.  THE PASSENGER CABIN                                      30.

       Indy rushes out of the smoking cockpit to find Willie and Short
       Round crawling out from under the debris that's fallen on them.
       Then Indy spots something in the wreckage --

       He pulls at some yellow canvas and Willie sees as sign: EMERGENCY
       LIFE RAFT.  Indy drags the folded canvas over to the open door.

                                   WILLIE
                       Are you crazy, a lift raft?!  We're
                       not sinking, we're crashing!

                                   INDIANA
                       Get over here, damn it!  Short Round,
                       come on, grab onto me tight!

       Willie sees Short Round rush over to Indiana and grab him around
       the waist from behind.  Willie finally jumps up and runs over --

                                   WILLIE
                       Wait for me!

       She throws her arms around Indy's neck so that she and Shorty are
       both hugging him from behind.  Indy clutches the folded lift raft
       in front of him and surveys the mountainside rushing close be-
       neath the skinking airplane --

       Finally, an instant before the plane will hit, Indy dives and
       pulls the inflation cord!

31.    EXT.  THE SKY                                                  31.

       As the smoking DC-3 screams out of control toward the mountain,
       skimming the rocky snow-covered slopes, we see the lift raft
       spilling out the open door --

       The raft pops into its full shape, acting now as a spoiler, soar-
       ing against the rushing wind and finally crashing and bouncing
       against the snowy mountainside.

       In the distance, we see the DC-3 finally kiss the earth and ex-
       plode in a cloud of flame against a rocky escarpment -- metal and
       earth mushrooming in a million directions!

32.    EXT.  THE MOUNTAINSIDE                                         32.

       As the raft rockets down the snow, Indiana clutches the front and
       Willie and Short Round hold on for dear life on either side of
       him.

       The raft plummets down the mountain, crossing the timber-line and
       entering a forest.  Bouncing over a snow-hidden log, the raft
       shoots directly for a tree --

       Indiana pulls on the perimeter rope, rolls on his side and man-
       ages to swerve the raft so it caroms offthe snow-drifted side of
       the tree trunk.

       Continuing its downhill run, the raft smashes across a small
       steam, sending silvery water spraying.

       As the raft skids below the snow-level, it starts bouncing over
       rocky ground and its three passengers' teeth start chattering.

33.    EXT.  A BLUFF                                                  33.

       The yellow raft crashes through a tangle of bushes and then plum-
       mets toward a bluff!  The raft goes airborne over a small bluff
       and lands with a splash in a slow-moving river.

34.    EXT.  THE RIVER                                                34.

       The life raft drifts down the river and Indy looks around and
       smiles cockily at Willie and Short Round --

       Their faces don't show gratitude, but horror -- Indy hears some-
       thing and turns to see:

35.    EXT.  WHITE WATER RAPIDS                                       35.

       The raft is heading directly toward a surging stretch of treach-
       erous rapids.  Indiana looks less cocky as he and Willie and
       Short Round hold on again for dear life!

       The raft plunges into the roaring torrent, bouncing over rock-
       swollen waves, twisting and spinning through narrow gaps.  The
       three helpless passengers are drenched in the thundering cascades
       of white water.

       Willie is hallering, Short Round hangs on wide-eyed and even Indy
       looks terrified as the raft crashes down the rapids.  Finally,
       after one heart-stopping bounce, the raft seems to slow.

36.    EXT.  RIVER CLEARING                                           36.

       The raft drifts out of the main part of the river and glides to-
       ward a clearing.  Its three soaked and bedraggled passengers lie
       motionless in the bottom.

       Indy's hand drags alongside the raft, his fingers leaving a trail
       in the almost still water.  Battered and exhausted, but always
       Indy's "bodyguard", Shorty looks over at him worriedly --

                                   SHORT ROUND
                       Indy?

                                   INDIANA
                       Okay, Shorty.

       Indy looks over at Willie who is moaning.

                                   INDIANA (Cont'd)
                       You all right?

                                   WILLIE
                       No... I'm not cut out for the
                       kind of life you lead.
                                  (moaning)
                       Oh no...I ripped my dress.  Where
                       are we anyway?

       The raft floats to a gentle stop -- we see it nudge against a
       pair of dark feet.  Indy squints up into the sun and sees some-
       thing.

                                   INDIANA
                       India...

                                   WILLIE
                       Holy cow -- India?  How do you
                       know we're in --

       She rolls over and yelps as she looks up at the bizarre, painted
       face of a SHAMAN.  Silhoutted against the blazing sun, the skin-
       ny little old man in a loincoloth stares down at them in the raft.

       An eerie wind rises and howls.  The old man places his palms to-
       gether and moves his hands up to touch his forehead.  Willie and
       Short Round watch mystified as Indiana returns the old shaman's
       silent greeting.

                                                               CUT TO:

37.    EXT.  THE MAYAPORE HILLS - DAY                                 37.

       Indya and Short Round follow the shaman and four peasants down a
       gutted path through barren rolling hills.  Willie is out of her
       milieu, stumbling along this forlorn landscape in high heels,
       tuxedo jacket and disheveled lame gown.

       She hears the old shaman talking to Indy and catches up with them
       to find out what's going on.

                                   WILLIE
                                (to Indiana)
                       What'd he say?

                                   INDIANA
                       He told me they knew I was coming
                       here.

                                   WILLIE
                       What do you mean -- how?

                                   INDIANA
                       The old man saw it in a dream.

                                   WILLIE
                       Dream -- nightmare is more like it.

                                   INDIANA
                       He said that's whey they were at
                       river -- they were waiting for
                       the plane to fall down.

       He looks at her bewildered face and smiles faintly.  As they
       walk, a hot wind swirls dust around them,  a wind slowly ravaging
       what soil is left in this terribly blighted region.

                                                               CUT TO:

38.    EXT.  MAYAPORE - DAY                                           38.

       At the base of the hills, Mayapore village does nothing to re-
       lieve the awful sense of devastation.  A desolate road runs
       through the village, along which groups of ptiifully poor vil-
       lagers stare at the strangers being brought in.

       Hopeless women lift buckets from a dry well -- finding only sand.
       Skinny miserable dogs skulk between the decrepit village huts,
       eyed by the patient vultures lurling in scraggly trees.

       Indiana notices the wretched peasants staring at Short Round,
       some of them pointing at him, a few haggard women shedding tears
       down their wrinkled faces as the little Chinese boy passes.

       There is no sign of children in the village and Short Round grows
       frightened by the odd attention.  He moves closer to Indy as they
       pass the devastated population.

                                                               CUT TO:

39.    RXT.  MAYAPORE VILLAGE - AFTER SUNSET                          39.

       Black clouds clot across the blood-red sky as darkness falls.
       Indiana, Willie and Short Round sit tensely on a shabby rug.
       Above their heads, there is a thatched roof, but there are no
       walls.

       The dying sunset silhouettes them and the half-dozen elders seat-
       ed in the dirt around them.  A grey-haired man, the village
       CHIEFTAIN, gives quiet commands to the women who scuttle in and
       set wooden plates in front of the three visitors.  No plates are
       places in front of the elders.

                                   WILLIE
                               (quietly to Indy)
                       I hope this means we're going to
                       get some dinner.

       Indiana sees the painted shaman, who sits next to the chieftain,
       watching Willie.  The women bring in a bowl from which they scoop
       tiny portions of grey gruel onto three plates.

       To this the women add a few grains of yellowed rice and a with-
       ered ,molding piece of fruit.  Willie looks aghast at the unappe-
       tizing combination.

                                   WILLIE
                                  (quietly)
                       God, I am starving, but I can't
                       eat this...
                                   INDIANA
                       That's more food than these people
                       eat in a week.
                                  (pointedly) 
                       They're starving, too...

       Willie looks around at the emaciated faces and feels like crawl-
       ing into a hole.

                                   WILLIE
                       I'm sorry, I -- here, please.

       She picks up her plate and gently hands it back to the women.
       The chieftain finally speaks to them --

                                   CHIEFTAIN
                       You will rest here before you go
                       on.

                                   INDIANA
                       We'd appreciate that.  This was an
                       unexpected detour.  We'll have to go
                       to Delhi now and find a flight west.

                                   SHORT ROUND
                                   (smiling)
                       Indy is taking me to America.

       All eyes are on Short Round.  Puzzled by this strange attention,
       Shorty's smile fades nervously.

                                   INDIANA
                       I'm a professor.  I have to re-
                       turn to the university.  Can you
                       give us a guide to take us to Delhi?

       The chieftain indicates a young villager sitting near them.

                                   CHIEFTAIN
                       Sanju will guide you.

                                   INDIANA
                       Thank you.

       The old shaman speaks now for the first time.

                                   SHAMAN
                       On the way to Delhi, you will
                       stop at Pankot.

                                   INDIANA
                                  (puzzled)
                       Pankot isn't on the way to Delhi.

                                   SHAMAN
                       You will go to palace there.

                                   INDIANA
                       Hasn't the Pankot palace been de-
                       serted since the Mutiny of 1857?

                                   SHAMAN
                                  (darkly)
                       No. Now there is new Maharajah --
                       and palace is powerful again.

       The shaman looks around at his unfortunate people.

                                   SHAMAN (Cont'd)
                       It is Pankot Palace that kills my
                       village.

                                   INDIANA
                       I don't understand.  What's hap-
                       pened here?

                                   SHAMAN
                       The evil starts in Pankot.  Then
                       like monsoon, it moves darkness
                       over all country.

                                   INDIANA
                       What evil?

                                   SHAMAN
                       They came from Palace and took
                       sivalinga from out village.

       Willie looks over at Indiana --

                                   WILLIE
                       Took what?

                                   INDIANA
                       It's a sacred stone in a shine
                       that's supposed to protect a
                       village.

                                   SHAMAN
                       It is why Krishna brought you here.

                                   INDIANA
                               (politely firm)
                       Nobody brought us here.  Our plane
                       crashed.  We were shot down by --

                                   SHAMAN
                              (interrupting)
                       No.  We pray to Krishna to help us
                       find the stone.  It was Krishna who
                       made you fall from sky -- so you can
                       got to Pankot Palace.  To find siva-
                       linga -- and bring back to us.

       Indy's about to object -- then he looks at the sad chieftain, the
       elders and peasants who are watching him helplessly.  And he sees
       again the dark steady eyes of the old shaman.

                                                               CUT TO:

40.    EXT.  MAYAPORE VILLAGE - NIGHT                                 40.

       Torches falre eerily and dogs howl as the peasants accompany the
       shaman, elders and three visitors out ot the edge of the dark
       village.  Short Round walks beside Indy.

                                   SHORT ROUND
                       Indy, they make out plane crash?
                       To get you here?

                                   INDIANA
                       It's just superstition, Shorty.
                       Like a ghost story.

       Short Round looks plenty scared as they all stop walking.  The
       shaman motions and the men with torches circle around a pile of
       rocks to illuminate them.  The shaman makes a gesture of devotion
       to the primitive shrine and Indy speaks to the village chieftain.

                                   CHIEFTAIN
                       Yes.

       Indiana seems skeptical as he kneels to study the shrine.  On top
       of the pile of rocks, there is a carved niche.  The niche is
       empty but an indentation indicates the conical shape of the stone
       that was stolen.

                                   INDIANA
                       Was the stone very smooth?
                                 (he sees the
                                 chieftain nod)
                       It was probably brought here from
                       a sacred river.

                                   SHAMAN
                              (joining Indy and
                               the chieftain)
                       Long ago -- before my father's
                       father.

                                   INDIANA
                       And it had three lines painted
                       across it?
                                  (seeing the
                                   shaman nod)
                       The lines represent the three
                       levels of the universe.  I've seen
                       stones like the one you lost.

       Indy stands slowly.  Willie is beside him looking at the shrine.

                                   WILLIE
                       I don't understand how losing one
                       rock could destroy this village.
                             (whispering to Indy)
                       Is it really powerful?

       Indy gives a doubtful smile.  He turns again to the old shaman.

                                   INDIANA
                       But why would the Maharajah take
                       this sacred stone?

                                   SHAMAN
                       They say we must pray to their
                       evil god.  We say we will not.

       The old shaman looks off and fights the tears in his eyes as he
       starts speaking in Hindi.

                                   INDIANA
                                 (translating)
                       He says that when the sacred stone
                       was taken the village wells dried
                       up first and then the river stopped.

       Indy turns and asks the shaman a question in Hindi.  The shaman
       answers in Hindi.

                                   INDIANA
                                   (translating)
                       He says their crops dies and then
                       the animals died.

       The shaman walks to the edge of the torchlight and looks out into
       the darkness as he continues speaking emotionally in Hindi --

                                   INDIANA
                                   (translating)
                       And then they took their children.

                                   WILLIE
                       Their children?

       She looks at Short Round and finally understands the sorrowful
       faces always watching him.  Indy asks another question in Hindi
       and the shaman continues his story --

                                   INDIANA
                                   (translating)
                       He says one night there was a fire
                       in the fields.  The men went to
                       fight it.  When they came back,
                       they heard the women crying in the
                       darkness.  And the children were
                       gone.

       The shaman walks slowly toward Indiana.

                                   SHAMAN
                       You will find them when you find
                       sivlalinga.

                                   INDIANA
                       I'm sorry, I don't know how I can
                       help you here.

       The shaman and the chieftain stare and Indiana, refusing to accept
       that.

                                   INDIANA (Cont'd)
                       The English authorities who con-
                       trol this area are the only ones
                       who can help you.

                                   CHIEFTAIN
                       They do not listen.

                                   INDIANA
                       I have friends in Delhi and I will
                       make sure they investigate this...

                                   SHAMAN
                       No, you will got to Pankot...

       The old man speaks again in his own tongue and Indy looks dis-
       turbed.

                                   WILLIE
                       What'd he say now?

                                   INDIANA
                       It was destined that I came here --
                       and the future cannot be changed...

       Indy looks ath the shaman and the torchlight reflected in his
       eyes.

                                                               CUT TO:

41.    EXT.  MAYAPORE - NIGHT                                         41.

       Suddenly we're rushing headlong down a dark dirt path seen from
       the POV of somebody running in terror.  We hear heavy breathing
       -- above we see the scraggly trees blowing against the full moon
       as an eerie wind rises and howls.  We continue crashing through
       the dying fields tward the dark village...

42.    INT.  INDIANA'S HUT - NIGHT                                    42.

       The wind swirls into the hut and Indiana's eyes open.  He lies
       still a moment and then sits up slowly.  He sees Short Round
       sleeping nearby.

       Sensing something strange, Indy gets to his feet.  He steps
       around Short Round and goes to the door of the hut.

43.    EXT.  THE HUT - NIGHT                                          43.

       Indy walks against the rising wind and looks around.  The village
       is asleep and seems deserted.  Then he turns and sees something.

       We follow small bare feet stumbling through the dust...

       Indy sees an emaciated child in rag running out of the darkness.
       Indiana moves forward and the child runs toward him.  Indy grabs
       the little boy as he falls into his arms.

                                                               CUT TO:

44.    INT.  THE SHAMAN'S HUT - NIGHT                                 44.

       A few minutes later, the little boy is lying unconscious on a
       blanket.  Elders crouch around him.  Indy is kneeling and watches
       the shaman wet the boy's forehead with a rag and drip water onto
       his lips.

       The little boy's eyes open and he begins to revive.  Shrot Round
       And Willie watch from a corner as the little boy looks at all the
       faces peering down at him.

       The little boy's arm moves and he reaches out to Indy rather than
       any of the others.  Indy takes his small hand and sees that the
       boy's fingers are cut and bruised -- his fingers open and drop
       something into Indy's hand.

       The little boy tries to whisper.  Indy has to lean close to hear
       as the little boy's lips move again --

                                   LITTLE BOY
                       Sankara...

       A mother rushes into the hut now and kneels and hugs her little
       boy.  His skinny arms go around her as they are reunited.  Indy
       stands slowly and looks at what the little boy gave him --

       It is a small tattered piece of cloth:  an old fragment of a mini-
       ature painting.  Indiana looks at it with an expression of recog-
       nition and apprehension...

                                   INDIANA
                       Sankara...

45.    EXT.  THE VILLAGE - MORNING                                    45.

       The camera follows Indiana -- he's walking fast and determinded-
       ly.  Villagers trot alongside of him, trying to keep up with is
       pace as he questions thm in Hindi.

       Indy approaches two large elephants and sees their guide Sajnu
       trying to politely drag Willie toward one of them.

                                   INDIANA
                       Damn it , Willie, get on -- we've
                       got to move out!

       Willie's head comes up over the back of the elephant as she's
       helped from below -- there is a look of sheer terror on her face.

                                   WILLIE
                       Whoa!  Easy now -- nice elephant...

       Waiting by the second elephant, Short Round sees Indy coming and
       runs up to him --

                                   SHORT ROUND
                       I ride with you, Indy?

                                   INDIANA
                       Nope, you got a little surprise
                       over there, Shorty.

       Short Round runs around the big elephant and sees a baby elephant
       being brought out.  He can't believe his luck --

                                   SHORT ROUND
                       Oh boy!

       Meanwhile Sajnu goads Willie's elephant over.  The villagers look
       grief stricken and many are crying as they watch the three stran-
       gers' departure.

                                   WILLIE
                               (to Short Round)
                       This is the first time anybody
                       ever cried when I left.

                                   SHORT ROUND
                       They don't cry about you.  They
                       cry about the elephants leaving.

                                   WILLIE
                       Figures...

                                   SHORT ROUND
                       They got no food to feed them.  So
                       they taking the elephants away to
                       sell them.

       Indy lumbers over on his elephant.

                                   INDIANA
                       All right, let's go.  I want to get
                       to Pankot before tomorrow night.

       She looks at Indiana as he rides past.

                                   WILLIE
                       Pankot?!  I thought we were going
                       to Delhi!  Hey, wait a minute!
                                (looking at
                                 the villagers)
                       Can't somebody take me to Delhi?!
                       I don't want to go to Pankot!

       Sajnu guides her elephant and Willie lurches forward --

                                   WILLIE (Cont'd)
                                  (yelling) 
                       Indiana!  Damn it!  Why'd you
                       change your mind?  What did that
                       kid tell you last night?!

       Indy ignores her hollering.  The elephants move off through the
       crowds of pitiful villagers.  Indy sees the elders, chieftain and
       the old shaman who brings his hands up to his forehead as Indy
       rides past.

                                                               CUT TO:

46.    EXT.  THE COUNTRYSIDE - DAY                                    46.

       The elephants move across the desolate countryside toward the
       distant hills.

47.    EXT.  THE TRAIL                                                47.

       Indiana rides the lead elephant.  Sajnu passes on foot guiding
       Willie's elephant.  With the tuxedo jacket wrapped around her
       waist, Willie is dabbing perfume behind her ears.

                                   WILLIE
                             (to her elephant)
                       I think you need this more than
                       me.

       Willie leans forward and puts perfume behind the elephant's ears.
       Grimacing at the animal's smell she simply dumps the rest of the
       perfume on the elephant's back.

       Willie yelps when the elephant's trunk comes back, sniffs the
       foriegn fragrance and suddenly trumpets in disgust.

                                   WILLIE (Cont'd)
                       What're you complaining about,
                       this is expensive stuff!

                                                               CUT TO:

48.    EXT.  LOWER JUNGLES - DAY                                      48.

       From a cliff, we see the elephants below passing into the lower
       jungles.

       Spotting something on an overhanging tree branck, Short Round
       stands up precariously on the baby elephant's back.  He pulls a
       vine from the tree as they pass under it.  Plopping down onto the
       baby elephant's back, he picks the wild fruit from the vine --

                                   SHORT ROUND
                       Here you go, lunch time!

       The baby elephant's trunk comes back and takes the fruit.  Shorty
       looks up in the sky.

                                   SHORT ROUND (Cont'd)
                       Indy, look!

       Indiana and Willie look up and see hundreds of enormous winged
       creatures flapping across the afternoon sky.

                                   WILLIE
                       Those are very big bird.

       Sajnu says something and Indiana nods.

                                   INDIANA
                       Those aren't birds -- those are
                       giant bats.

       Willie shudders as she watches the bats.

                                                               CUT TO:

49.    EXT.  THE HILLS - AFTERNOON                                    49.

       An enormous sun silhouettes the three elephants trekking west-
       ward.

                                                               CUT TO:

50.    EXT.  A RIVER - LATER AFTERNOON                                50.

       The three elephants stand sucking up river water with their
       trunks.  Seated on the huge beasts, Willie, Short Round and Indi-
       ana watch the thirsty animals.

                                   WILLIE
                       They must be pretty dumb to drink
                       that awful-looking water.

       In response, Willie's elephant calmly lifts its trunk and sprays
       her in the face.  Short Round and Indy laugh as Willie sits
       soaked and shocked.

                                   INDIANA
                       I think maybe we'll camp here.

                                                               CUT TO:

51.    EXT.  THE RIVER - SUNSET                                       51.

       A plume of water sprays.  The three elephants submerge in a deep,
       wide spot in the river.  Indy wades in the current with his shirt
       off.  He and the guide splash water on the weary animals.

       Short Round laughs and plays with the baby elephant.  Wrapped in
       its trunk, he's swung in the air and lands on the elephant's
       back.  Shorty makes a swan dive back into the water and the baby
       elephant gives him a shower when he surfaces.

52.    EXT.  UPRIVER                                                  52.

       Thirty yards upstream, birds and monkeys chatter in a tree.  In
       the shady river beneath, Willie surfaces cooly and wipes hair
       from her eyes.  She hums contendedly.

       Indiana wanders up the riverbank in his dripping trousers.  He
       notices Willie's wet clothes spread over a tree limb hanging low
       over the water and then he sees Willie paddling around.

                                   INDIANA
                       Hey, Willie -- I think you better
                       get out now.

                                   WILLIE
                       Stark naked?  You wish... If you're
                       trying to seduce me, Dr. Jones,
                       this is a very primitive approach.

                                   INDIANA
                       Me seduce you?  Honey, you're the
                       one who took your clothes off.
                                  (shrugging)
                       I just came over to remind you
                       that you never know what else
                       might be in the water.

                                   WILLIE
                       Somehow I feel safer in here.

       As Indy turns and starts off, Willie reaches up to the tree
       branch above her head and grabs her underwear.  At this moment we
       notice something awful:

       A BOA CONSTRICTOR is moving out along the branch, the enormous
       snake slithering over Willie's clothes.

       Willie watches Indiana walk away as she reaches up for her dress
       -- her hands feel something strange -- not the dress and not the
       tree limb --

       Willie looks up and sees that she's pulling on a snake! She
       SCREAMS as the boa constrictor falls off the t-ee on top of her!

       Indy hears the scream and hears Willie calling to him.  He runs
       back toward the river.  Stopping on the riverbank, he sees Willie
       backing away in the water -- Indiana's already starting to pull
       his boots off --

                                   WILLIE
                       Indy!  Help me!

                                   INDIANA
                       Don't worry, I'm coming in!  What
                       is it?

                                   WILLIE
                       A snake!

       Suddenly Indiana freezes and a strange look corsses his face --

                                   INDIANA
                       A what...?

                                   WILLIE
                       A SNAKE!!

       He finally sees the boa constrictor thrashing in the water close
       to Willie.  He leaves his boots on.

                                   WILLIE (Cont'd)
                       Hurry, help me out of here!
                       What're you waiting for?!

                                   INDIANA
                       Uh, listen -- Willie -- I got a
                       better idea.

                                   WILLIE
                       What?!

                                   INDIANA
                       First of all -- don't panic!

       Willie suddenly screams as the boa constrictor wraps around her
       arm --

                                   WILLIE
                       It's got me !  Indy, help me!

       Indy runs along the riverbank, trying to get closer to her, but
       not about to jump into the river (due to his aversion to snakes
       -- see Episode One:  "Raiders of the Lost Ark").

                                   INDIANA
                       Don't let it pull you deeper!

                                   WILLIE
                       It's pulling me deeper!

                                   INDIANA
                       Don't let it curl around you!

                                   WILLIE
                       It's curling around me!  Damn it,
                       stop talking and do something!

       The snake is wrapping around her body and neck -- her head is
       barely above water --

       On the riverbank, Indy reaches down and grabs a piece of wood.
       But as he watches the repulsive reptile, he starts to sweat and
       his fear and loathing overpower him --

                                   WILLIE (Cont'd)
                       What's wrong?!  Indy please help
                       me!

       Indy groans and bolsters his courage -- he takes two steps into
       the water -- but the complex is to strong and he can't go any
       further.  He drops the piece of wood...

                                   INDIANA
                       Listen, Willie.  Do exactly what
                       I tell you now.

                                   WILLIE
                       What?!

                                   INDIANA
                       Can you move your arm?

                                   WILLIE
                       Just one arm!

                                   INDIANA
                       Okay, I want you to lift your hand --
                       and pet the snake.

                                   WILLIE
                       PET IT??!!

                                   INDIANA
                       Yes, stroke it right along the
                       maxillary and precaudal verte-
                       brae.

                                   WILLIE
                       THE WHAT?!

                                   INDIANA
                       Pet it on the head!  Go on, pet
                       it!

       In the water, Willie is whimpering as she lifts her hand and
       starts petting the snake  coiling around her pale body.

                                   WILLIE
                       Oh -- my -- god -- it's going to
                       crush me!

                                   INDIANA
                       Keep stroking it!

       Willie keeps rubbing her hand along the snakes head and back and
       it slowly stops thrashing in the water.

                                   INDIANA (Cont'd)
                       What's happening?

                                   WILLIE
                       It's starting to let go!

                                   INDIANA
                       That's good  -- you're doing fine.

       Grimacing as she stares at the ugly serpent's head, Willie keeps
       stroking it.

                                   WILLIE
                       It's letting fo.  I think it's --
                       I think it's going to sleep!

       Indiana looks relieved.  He sees the snake starting to drift away
       from Willie and she starts paddling back to shore, collecting her
       floating clothes along the way.

       Holding her dripping dress against herself, she walks out of the
       water toward Indy who smiles at her weakly.

                                   INDIANA
                       See -- I got you out...

       She slows and hauls off and punches him in the mouth.  Indy holds
       his jaw as she walks away infuriates.

                                   WILLIE
                       Thanks for nothing!  I hate snakes!

                                   INDIANA
                                  (looking at
                                   the water)
                       I know the feeling...

                                                               CUT TO:

53.    EXT.  THE CAMPSITE - NIGHT                                     53.

       By firelight, we see Sajnu feeding the big elephants while Short
       Round feeds and talks to the baby elephant --

                                   SHORT ROUND
                       You come to America with me, and
                       we can get job in the circus --
                       you like that?

       The baby elephant trumpets affirmitively.

       A ways off, Willie stands wrapped in a blanket watching Shorty
       and the elephant as she dries her hair by a campfire.  Now Indy
       comes up and drops an armload of wood for yet another fire.

                                   WILLIE
                       Where'd you find your little body-
                       guard?

                                   INDIANA
                       I met Short Round when he tried
                       to pick my pocket.

       Indiana kneels and arranges the wood.

                                   INDIANA (Cont'd)
                       Shorty's family was killed when
                       they bombed Shanghai.  He was
                       living on the streets.

                                   WILLIE
                                  (smiling)
                       He'll be okay.  He's a good kid.

       Indy strikes a match and lights the new fire.

                                   WILLIE (Cont'd)
                       All these fires -- you expecting
                       more snakes, Dr. Jones?

       She smiles snidely and continues drying her hair.

                                   INDIANA
                       By the way, how'd you end up in
                       Shanghai?

                                   WILLIE
                       Well, when my nightclub career was
                       run over by the Depression, some
                       pinhead convinced me that "a girl
                       could go places in the Orient..."
                       So, look where I got.

       Indy picks up a blanket and spreads it on the ground.

                                   INDIANA
                       What about the future?

                                   WILLIE
                       Oh, that's easy -- I'm going to
                       latch onto a good-looking, in-
                       credibly rich prince.

       Indy lies down on the blanket.

                                   INDIANA
                       I'd like to find one of those
                       myself.

                                   WILLIE
                           (raising an eyebrow)
                       Oh really?

                                   INDIANA
                       Yeah, but he's got to be dead and
                       buried for a couple of thousand years.
                                  (smiling)
                       Fortune and glory...

                                   WILLIE
                       Is that what you're hoping to find
                       at this palace, Dr. Jones?

                                   INDIANA
                       Maybe...

       Indy reaches into his pocket and removes the old piece of cloth.

                                   WILLIE
                       What's that?

       She walks over to where he's lying down and sits on a boulder.
       He hands her the cloth and she looks at it by the firelight.

                                   INDIANA
                       Something that kid gave me last
                       night.  It's a piece of an old
                       manuscript.

       Willie sees a crude drawing in reds, blue and gold.

                                   INDIANA (Cont'd)
                       The drawing shows a priest named
                       Sankara who lived centuries ago.

                                   WILLIE
                       What does the writing say?

                                   INDIANA
                       It's Sanskrit.  It tells the story
                       of Sankara climbing Mt. Kalisa
                       where he met the Hindu god Shiva.

                                   WILLIE
                               (examining it)
                       That's Shiva?  What's he giving
                       the Priest?

                                   INDIANA
                       Legend says he told Sankara to go
                       forth and combat evil.  To do that
                       he gave him five sacred stones that
                       had magical powers.

                                   WILLIE
                               (looking at Indy)
                       You mean magical like the rock that
                       was stolen from that village?

       Indy looks at her meaningfully.

                                   INDIANA
                       It could be.

       Willie seems frightened.  She hands him the piece of cloth and
       stands up.

                                   WILLIE
                                   (quietly)
                       Fortune and glory...sweet dreams,
                       Dr. Jones.

       She picks up a blanket and starts off.

                                   INDIANA
                       I think you should sleep closer.
                                (seeing her sus-
                                 picious look)
                       I meant for safety.

                                   WILLIE
                                  (smiling)
                       I'd be safer sleeping with
                       that snake.

       She steps over to a tree by the fire where her clothes are dry-
       ing.  Indy watches her pull her dried clothes from the lower
       branches.

       She reaches up to remove another piece of her clothing -- it's
       stuck to the tree and she looks up and yanks it.  Suddenly the
       piece of clothing moves!

       Two enormous winds open and the hideous face of a GIANT BAT
       screeches and hisses at Willie!  She screams hysterically as the
       bat flaps against her, biting and scratching at her before it fi-
       nally takes off.

       The bat flies off into the darkness and Indy chuckles as he
       watches Willie shanking as she backs slowly toward the fire --

                                   WILLIE
                       Did you see it?!  It was one
                       of those bats!
                                   (staring into
                                    the darkness)
                       God, what else is out there...?!

       She quickly picks up her blanket and lays it out very close to
       Indy.

                                   INDIANA
                       Couldn't keep away, huh?

                                   WILLIE
                       Just try and control yourself.

       Indiana watches her lie down and wrap herself in her blanket.
       then he rolls over and tips his hat down over his eyes to get
       some well-deserved shut-eye.

       In a moment, however, we see something grotesque and snake-like
       slide into frame and move towards Indy -- finally, we realize
       it's an elephant's trunk.  The trunk nudges Indy's shoulder.

                                   INDIANA
                              (without looking)
                       Still scared?  Okay, Willie, you
                       can get closer if you want...

       The elephant's trunk moves closer and nuzzles Indy's neck.

                                   INDIANA
                       Honey, I knew you'd be the first
                       one to give in...

       Now, we see that Short Round is guiding the baby elephant's trunk
       with a prod.  Willie watches, stifling a laugh as the elephant's
       trunk sniffs Indiana's ear --

                                   INDIANA (Cont'd)
                       You're going to start something
                       I'm going to have to finish.
                                  (moaning)
                       Okay, doll, you asked for it.

       Indiana rolls over, lifts his hat and hollers!  He nearly jumps
       out of his pants as he stares into the elephant's trunk.  Willie
       and Short Round dissolve into laughter.

                                                               CUT TO:

54.    EXT.  THE JUNGLE - DAY                                         54.

       Tall, vine-covered trees sway in the wind.  Beneath them, the el-
       ephants plough through the dense tropical forest.  The sounds of
       the teeming jungle multiply as Short Round surveys the distant
       hills.

                                   SHORT ROUND
                       Indy, look!

                                   INDIANA
                       That's it.  Pankot Palace.

       Willie looks off at the resplendent while Moghul-style palace ri-
       sing in the distance above the jungle.

                                                               CUT TO:

55.    EXT.  A JUNGLE CLEARING - LATER                                55.

       Their Mayapore guide walks toward the camera and suddenly looks
       frightened.  He barks commands and the elephants stop.  Indiana
       jumps down an joins the fearful guide.

       They stare at a small statue of a malevolent goddess with eight
       arms.  Around the goddess's neck, a carved necklace displays
       small human heads -- her eight hands hold other heads by their
       hair.

       Indiana moves closer to the statue as the terrified guide backs
       away.  Indy is fascinated by the ritual objects adorning it:
       leaves, dead birds, rodents and turtles.  Indiana grimaces as he
       lifts a necklace of real pierced human fingers...

                                   WILLIE (O.S.)
                       Why are we stopping here?

       Indiana goes back and joins the scared, jabbering guide who is
       helping Willie down from the elephant.  Short Round jumps down.

                                   SHORT ROUND
                       What you look at, Indy?

                                   INDIANA
                       Just a statue.

                                   WILLIE
                       What's the guide talking about?
                       He hasn't said a word the whole
                       trip.

       Indy listens to the agitated guide and then speaks a few words in
       Hindi back to him.  They watch the distressed guide trun the ele-
       phants and start away with them as fast as possible.

                                   WILLIE
                       He's afraid of something.

                                   INDIANA
                       He said he couldn't take us any
                       farther.  He has to go sell the
                       elephants.

                                   WILLIE
                       You mean we have to walk the rest
                       of the way?

       Willie moans and follows Indy.  Short Round watches the elephants
       trudging away.  The little elephant turns and looks back.  Short
       Round quickly wipes a tear from his face.

                                                               CUT TO:

56.    EXT.  A PALACE APPROACH - AFTERNOON                            56.

       Indiana and Short Round hike up a rock-paved road beside a high
       wall.  Exhausted, carrying her high heels, Willie trudges along
       behind them.

                                   WILLIE
                       -- shot at, fallen out of a plane,
                       nearly drowned, squashed by a snake,
                       attacked by a bat -- I smell like
                       an elephant!
                                 (yelling)
                       I tell you I'm not going to make it!

       Indiana finally stops.  He walks back to Willie, suddenly picks
       her us in his arms and starts carrying her the remaining way.
       Willie is surprised and puzzled.

                                   INDIANA
                       Any more complaints?

                                   WILLIE
                              (smiling faintly)
                       Yeah, I wish you'd thought of this
                       sooner...

       She doesn't seem to mind being carried by Indy.  He arrives at
       the entrance to the palace and puts her down -- she stands close
       to him and he gently smoothes the collar of her dress.

                                   INDIANA
                       It doesn't feel like there's been
                       any permanent damage.

       She smiles at him again and then turns around -- and whistles as
       she sees Pankot Palace:  a sprawling, monumental mixture of Mo-
       ghul and Rajput styles, the palace is an extravaganza of Princely
       architecture.

57.    EXT.  A BRIDGE                                                 57.

       The three travelers start across a marble bridge toward the main
       entrance.  Lined along the bridge, palace guards stand with
       lances.

       As the threesome passes, the first Rajput guard snaps noisily to
       attention and Willie jumps.  As Willie continues across the
       bridge, the other guards snap to attention in sequence and she
       grins, enjoying the attention.

58.    INT.  THE OUTER COURTYARD                                      58.

       Short Round and Willie follow Indiana through a dark archway into
       a glittering courtyard.  The palace seems deserted and forebod-
       ing.

                                   INDIANA
                       Hello?...(hello?)...(hello?)

       Indy's voice echoes off the marble facades -- three enormous Raj-
       put guards with curved swords in their sashes appear silently at
       opposite sides of the courtyard.

                                   WILLIE
                               (frightened)
                       Hi...(hi)...(hi)...

       Then, a tall severe-looking Indian in an English suit material-
       izes out of the shadows and comes forward slowly.  CHATTAR LAL
       appraises the intruders suspiciously:

       He sees a whoozy beauty in a weary evening gown;  a dirty Chinese
       kid with a baseball cap; a rugged-looking American carrying a
       bullwhip...

                                   CHATTAR LAL
                       I would say you look rather lost.
                                  (disdainfullt)
                       But then I cannot imagine where
                       in the world the three of you
                       would look at home...

                                   INDIANA
                                (smiling evenly)
                       Lost?  No, we're not lost.  We're
                       on our way to Delhi.  This is Miss
                       Scott -- and Mr. Round.  My name's
                       Indiana Jones.

                                   CHATTAR LAL
                                  (surprised)
                       Dr. Jones?  The eminent archae-
                       ologist?

                                   WILLIE
                       Hard to believe, isn't it...?

                                   CHATTAR LAL
                       I remember first hearing your name
                       when I was studying at Oxford.  I
                       Am Chattar Lal, Prime Minister for
                       His Highness the Maharajah of Pankot.

       He bows and Willie sort of curtsies.

                                   CHATTAR LAL (Cont'd)
                       Welcome to Pankot Palace.

59.    INT.  PANKOT PALACE - AFTERNOON                                59.

       They walk along the marble halls, past dazzling walls inlaid with
       pieces of mirror and semi-precious stones.  Fountains spray in
       ivory countyards and they gaze in awe at the ornate splendour.

       As Willie walks with Shorty she appraises the chronolgoical
       portraits of the Pankot Prices that line the hall.  Dissipated 
       faces, elegant faces, evil faces -- she reacts to them.

                                   WILLIE
                               (to Short Round)
                       How'd you like to run into him in
                       a dark alley...that one's kind of
                       cute...I could see myself married
                       to a prince like that...

       Ahead of them Chattar Lal  walks with Indy and questions him
       suspiciously --

                                   CHATTAR LAL
                       The plane crash and your journey
                       here sound -- most incredible.

                                   WILLIE
                       You should have been there...

                                   INDIANA
                       We'd appreciate it if the Mahara-
                       jah would let us stay tonight.
                       We'll be on out way in the morn-
                       ing.

                                   CHATTAR LAL
                       I am only his humble servant, but
                       the Maharajah usually listens to
                       my advice.

                                   WILLIE
                       Is that him?

       They've come to the last in the row of Princes portraits.  Wil-
       lie stops and looks up disappointedly at a picture of an aged,
       immensely corpulent Rajput prince.

                                   WILLIE (Cont'd)
                                (politely)
                       He's not exactly what we call
                       "a spring chicken".

                                   CHATTAR LAL
                       No, no, that is Uhmed Singh, the
                       present Maharajah's late father.

                                   WILLIE
                       Oh -- good.  And maybe the pres-
                       ent Marahajah is a little younger?
                       And thinner?

       Two female servants approach silently and bow.

                                   CHATTAR LAL
                       They will escort you to your rooms
                       now.  You will be provided with
                       fresh clothes.  Tonight you will
                       be dining with His Highness.

                                   WILLIE
                       Dinner?  And with a prince?!  My
                       luck is changing.  But look at
                       me -- my god, I've to to get
                       ready!

       She hurried off with one of the servants toward her room.  Chat-
       tar Lal smiles cooly at Indiana --

                                   CHATTAR LAL
                       Eight o'clock in the Pleasure
                       Pavilion.

                                                               CUT TO:

60.    EXT.  THE PLEASURE PALIVION - NIGHT                            60.

       An extraordinary gold dome rises in the middle of the eleaborate
       gardens.  The Pleasure Pavilion is ablaze with torch lights,
       flickering candles and exotic music.

       Indiana comes out of the palace with Short Round.  Indy has on a
       tweed jacket and a nectie -- his university professor's outfit.
       Short Round has been cleaned up, but still sports his baseball
       cap.

       Willie joins them, looking stunning is a silk Western-styled
       gown.  She's also been loaned some Moghul jewelry which sparkles
       on her neck and arms.

                                   INDIANA
                       You look like a princess.

       Willie's flattered by the first nice thing Indy's said to her.

                                   WILLIE
                       It's sort of like being in heaven.

       They cross the garden toward the pavilion and Willie's eyes are
       like a kid's at Christmas.

61.    INT.  THE PLEASURE PAVILION                                    61.

       As they enter, Indiana gives a half-dressed dancing girl the
       once-over as she spins to the music of drums and "vinhas".

                                   INDIANA
                                  (smiling)
                       I've always had a weakness for
                       folk dancing.

                                   WILLIE
                                  (snidely)
                       She might get away with that act
                       here, but she'd never make it in
                       a real nightclub.

       They walk among the rich court ministers and Indian merchants.
       Chattar Lal approaches with a British cavalry captain in unifrom.

                                   CHATTAR LAL
                       We are fortunate tonight to have
                       some many unexpected guests.  his
                       is Captain Phillip Blumburtt.

       Blumburtt bows to Willie and Indiana.

                                   CHATTAR LAL (Cont'd)
                       Captain Blumburtt and his troops
                       are here to check up on the
                       "natives".

                                   CAPT. BLUMBURTT
                                  (politely)
                       Just a routine inspection tour.

                                   CHATTAR LAL
                       The British worry so about their
                       Emprie -- it makes us feel like
                       well-cared-for children.

                                   WILLIE
                       Listen, Mr. Lal, what do you call
                       the Maharajah's  wife?

                                   CHATTAR LAL
                       His Highness has not yet taken a
                       wife.

                                   WILLIE
                                  (happily)
                       No?  Well, I guess he just hasn't
                       met the right woman...

       As Willie chatters on with the Prime Minister, Indiana wanders
       off.  He moves to a wall where bronze statues and strange devo-
       tional objects are displayed.

                                   CAPT. BLUMBURTT
                                  (joining Indy)
                       Interested in local curios?

                                   INDIANA
                       No.  But I am interested in the
                       occult.  And this is a krtya.

       Indiana picks up a small clay figurine and examines it.

                                   CAPT. BLUMBURTT
                                   (grimacing)
                       Charming.

                                   INDIANA
                       It's like the voodoo dolls of West
                       Africa.  The kryta represents your
                       enemy -- and gives you complete
                       power over him.

                                   CAPT. BLUMBURTT
                       That God all that mumbo jumbo
                       rubbish is disappearing.

                                   INDIANA
                       You think so?

                                   CAPT. BLUMBURTT
                       Of course.  Admittedly, it's taken
                       time.  Britian's controlled India
                       for almost two hundred eyars now.

       Indiana smiles at the somewhat pompous bureaucrat.

                                   INDIANA
                       You're hanging on better here
                       than you did in America.

                                   CAPT. BLUMBURTT
                                  (smiling sourly)
                       This is a different situation, Dr.
                       Jones.  These people are like
                       children.  We have to lead them
                       slowly into the twentieth century.

       Indiana puts the doll down and looks over at Chattar Lal and
       Willie.

                                   INDIANA
                       The Prime Minister doesn't seem
                       that naive.

                                   CAPT. BLUMBURTT
                       No, he's a very shrewd old boy.
                       Power behind the throne and all
                       that.  He actually runs this whole
                       province.

       Indy and the Prime Minister exchange distant looks as Willie
       comes back over to Indiana.  She talks to him conspiratorially --

                                   WILLIE
                       I think this Maharajah is swim-
                       ming in money.  Maybe coming here
                       wasn't such a bad idea.

       Blumburtt finds these Americans quite suspect and seems relieved
       when he hears a drum.

                                   CAPT. BLUMBURTT
                       I believe we're being called to
                       dinner.

                                   WILLIE
                       Finally!

       As the drum beats the assembled guests move toward a long, low
       table surrounded by colorful pillows.  Short Round follows with a
       little monkey he's found perched on his arm.

       As everyone stands around the table, Chattar Lal makes an an-
       nouncement in Hindi and then in English --

                                   CHATTAR LAL
                       His Supremem Highness, guardian of
                       Rajput tradition -- the Maharajah
                       of Pankot -- Zalim Singh.

       All eyes are on two solid silver doors which open -- and through
       which now walks the MAHARAJAH ZALIM SINGH.  Everyone is bowing,
       including Indiana and Willie, who looks amazed --

                                   WILLIE
                       That's the Maharajah -- that kid?!

                                   INDIANA
                       Maybe he likes older women.

       Indeed, Zalim Singh is only thirteen.  Outfitted in silver and
       gold brocade, festooned with enormous jewels, the litlle Mahara-
       jah gazes imperiously at the bowing crowd -- and then glares at
       Short Round.

       Indy sees Short Round chewing gum, staring antagonistically at
       the Maharajah.  Indy pushes SHort Round into a bowing position.

       The Maharajah finally sits down on golden pillows.  He nods and
       his guests take their seats.  Indiana sees Willie's dreams of
       queendom have vanished.

                                   INDIANA
                       Cheer up, you lost your prince,
                       but dinner's on the way.

                                   WILLIE
                       I've never been so hungry in my
                       life...

       Servants appear with silver platters of steaming food.  They
       place a platter in front of Willie and she stares at it in amaze-
       ment:

       It's a whole raosted boar, replete with a decorative arrow pierc-
       ing its bloated stomach and tiny broiled baby bores placed around
       it as if they were suckling on their well-cooked mother.

                                   WILLIE
                                 (grimacing)
                       My god, sort of grusome, isn't
                       it...?

       Seeing the meat being served, Indiana looks across the table at
       Blumburtt who seems equally puzzled.  Meanwhile, the little Maha-
       rajah whispers to his Prime Minsiter.  Then Chattar Lal speaks to
       the table --

                                   CHATTAR LAL
                       His Highness wants me to welcome
                       his visitors.  Especially the
                       renowned Dr. Jones from America.

       Indy bows slightly toward the Maharajah.

                                   INDIANA
                       We are honored to be here.

       Servants put down another platter.  Willie stares at an enormous
       steaming boa constrictor on the platter.  With a flash of a
       knife, a servant slits the huge snake and exposes a mass of
       squirming, live baby eels inside...

                                   WILLIE
                       Suddenly I'm not so hungry...

       Meanwhile, Indiana is chatting poleitely with the Prime Minister.

                                   INDIANA
                       I had a question, Mr. Prime Mini-
                       ster.  I was examining some of the
                       Maharajah's artifacts.

                                   CHATTAR LAL
                       A very fine collection of very old
                       pieces, don't you think?

                                   INDIANA
                       Yes, very fine.  But not all of the
                       pieces look old.  Some were carved
                       recently and look like images used
                       by the Thuggees to worship the god-
                       des Kali.

       At the emntion of the Thuggees, the Indians at the table quiet,
       as it a taboo has been broken.  Chattar Lal glares at Indiana.

                                   CHATTAR LAL
                       Dr. Jones, you know very well that
                       the Thuggee cult has been dead for
                       nearly a century.

                                   CAPT. BLUMBURTT
                       Of course.  The Thuggees were an
                       obscenity that worshipped Kali
                       with human sacrifices.  The Brit-
                       ish Army wiped them out about the
                       time of the Mutiny of 1857.

       Short Round avoids the dinner by feeding it to his little monkey
       as he listens to the scary conversation.

       The talk is bad enough, but Willie finds the food unbelievable!
       A servant leans overher shoulder and places a six-inch long BUG
       on her plate!

       Willie whimpers quietly as she watches the fat merchant next to
       her lift one of the black, shiny baked-beetles -- and crack it in
       two!  The man proceeds to enthusiastically suck the gooey innards
       out.

                                   MERCHANT
                              (looking at Willie)
                       But you're not eating!

                                   WILLIE
                                  (weakly)
                       I uh -- had bugs for lunch.

       Meanwhile, Indiana continues to politely needle Chattar Lal.

                                   INDIANA
                       I suppose stories of the Thuggees
                       die hard.

                                   CHATTAR LAL
                       There are no stories anymore.

                                   INDIANA
                       Well, I don't know... we came here
                       from a small village and the peas-
                       ants there told us that the Pankot
                       Palace was growing powerful again
                       -- becuase of some ancient evil.

       Indiana smiles and shrugs.

                                   CHATTAR LAL
                                  (sneeringly)
                       Their stories are just fear and
                       folklore.

                                   INDIANA
                                   (cooly) 
                       Maybe.. but how do you explain
                       The Thuggee shrine I saw right
                       below the palace?

       Indy catches a glance between the little Maharajah and the prime
       minister, who answers slowly --

                                   CHATTAR LAL
                       The local peasants are just as
                       superstitious.  You're very ob-
                       servant, Dr. Jones.  But you're
                       beginning to worry Capt. Blum-
                       burtt.

       Blumburtt's phlegmatic attitude has changed to curiosity.

                                   CAPT. BLUMBURTT
                       I'm not worried, Prime Minister,
                       just interested.

       During their conversation, Willie listens to beetles SNAPPING and
       she watches revolted as the other dinner guests suck the gooey
       insides out of the bugs.

                                   WILLIE
                             (to Short Round)
                       Give me your hat...

                                   SHORT ROUND
                       What for?

                                   WILLIE
                       I'm going to puke in it...

       Meanwhile, Indy continues ingenously with Chattar Lal.

                                   INDIANA
                       You know the villagers also
                       claimed that this palace stole
                       something from them.

                                   CHATTAR LAL
                       Dr. Jones, it our country a guest
                       does not usually insult his host.

                                   INDIANA
                       Sorry, I thought we were just talking
                       about folklore.

                                   CAPT. BLUMBURTT
                           (trying to make peace)
                       I'm sure it's nothing.  Just ru-
                       mors.
                                  (but interested)
                       What was it they claimed was
                       stolen?

                                   INDIANA
                       Something magical.  A sacred rock.

                                   CHATTAR LAL
                                 (condescendingly)
                       There, you see, Captain.  A rock!

                                   INDIANA
                       When they lost this rock their
                       fields and animals dies.  They
                       also said their children were
                       taken from them.

                                   CHATTAR LAL
                       I think that's enough  of this
                       nonsense, Dr. Jones...

       Indiana smiles faintly at Chattar Lal's anger.  Across the table,
       Willie looks pale and motions to the waiter.

                                   WILLIE
                       So you have something, you know,
                       simple -- like soup or something?

       The servant goes off and returns with a covered bowl.  He uncov-
       ers it and Willie looks at a soup with a dozen eyeballs floating
       in it.

                                   MERCHANT
                       Looks delicious!

                                   WILLIE
                       I wanna go home...

       Willie whimpers and tears start down her cheeks.

                                   INDIANA
                               (to Chattar Lal)
                       I was dubious muself at first.
                       Then something connected -- the
                       village's rock and the old legend
                       of the Sankara Stones...

                                   CHATTAR LAL
                            (controlling himself)
                       Dr. Jones, we are all vulnerable
                       to vicious rumors.  I seem to re-
                       member that in Honduras you were
                       accused of being a grave robber
                       rather than a scientist.

                                   INDIANA
                                 (shrugging)
                       The newspapers exaggerated the
                       incident

                                   CHATTAR LAL
                       And didn't the Sultan of Madagas-
                       car threaten to cut your head off
                       if you ever returned to his coun-
                       try?

                                   INDIANA
                       That was a misunderstanding.

                                   CHATTAR LAL
                                   (smiling)
                       Exactly what we have here, Dr.
                       Jones.

                                   MAHARAJAH
                       I have heard the terrible stories
                       of the evil Thuggee cult...

       When the little Marahajah speaks it surprises everyone and there
       is silence.

                                   MAHARAJAH (Cont'd)
                       I thought the stories were told
                       to frighten children.  Later, I
                       learned that the Thuggee cult was
                       once real and did unspeakable
                       things.

       The Marahajah looks at Indiana.

                                   MAHARAJAH (Cont'd)
                       I am ashamed of what happened here
                       so many years ago.  We keep these
                       objects -- to remind us that this
                       will never again happen in my
                       kingdom!

                                   INDIANA
                              (after a moment)
                       I'm sorry if I've offended you.

       Now, more trays are whisked in by servants.

                                   MERCHANT
                       Ah, dessert!

       Short Round's monkey suddenly screeches and takes off.  Willie
       closed here eyes in dread - but curiosity gets the best of her
       and she looks -- it's worse than she could imagine:

       Plates full of small, dead monkey heads!  (*Production note: be-
       cause of his extremely sensitive nature, the director has reque-
       ted that these monkey heads be simulated).

       The tops of the monkey's skulls have been cut off and sit loose
       like little covers.  Willie watches in utter dismay as the Maha-
       rajah and his guests remove the skull-tops and start dipping
       spoons into what's inside --

                                   MERCHANT (Cont'd)
                       Chilled monkey brains!

       Willie keels over, crashing backwards in a dead faint!

                                                               CUT TO:

62.    INT.  A PALACE HALL - LATER                                    62.

       Women servants help a woobly-kneed Willie toward her room.

63.    EXT.  THE PELASURE GARDEN - NIGHT                              63.

       Hundreds of lanters illuminate the garden where after dinner
       drinks are served, cigars lighted and hookah pipes puffed on.

       Indiana comes out of the pavilion into the garden with Capt.
       Blumburtt and they talk quietly.

                                   CAPT. BLUMBURTT
                       Rather bizarre menu, woundn't you
                       say?

                                   INDIANA
                       Even if they were trying to scare
                       us away, a devout Hindu would
                       never touch meat.
                                (looking around)
                       Makes you wonder what these people
                       are...

       Now, the little Maharajah comes over with his retinue and he
       reaches for Indy's whip which Short Round is carrying.

                                   MAHARAJAH
                       I have seen this thing.  What is
                       it, Dr. Jones?

                                   SHORT ROUND
                       Hey, nobody touches Indy's whip!

       Short Round grabs for it, but Indiana restrains him.

                                   INDIANA
                       We're guests here, Shorty.

       The Maharajah glares are Short Round and five the whip to Indy.

                                   MAHARAJAH
                       You will show me how it works
                       please.

       Indy bows to the little prince and smiles ironically --

                                   INDIANA
                       You wish is my command, your
                       Highness.

       While Short Round watches angrily, Indiana walks across the gar-
       den and unfurls the whip.  Indy sees a servant lighting a candle.

       Suddenly the whip flies and CRACKS like a pistol shot.  The
       candle disappears!  Indiana whirls and CRACKS the whip again,
       snagging a flower out of a dancing girl's hair.

       The Maharajah reacts like any kid -- he shoops happily.

                                   MAHARAJAH
                       That is wonderful!  Please teach
                       me how!

       Short Round sulks as he listens to Indiana instructing the Maha-
       rajah on how to hold the whip.  As the young prince practises the
       grip, Indy notices Chattar Lal slip behind a fountain to talk to
       a dark figure in robes who appears.

       Indiana sees Chattar Lal bow to the dark figure -- and Indy
       catches a glimpse of the stranger's pale face and dark hollow
       eyes.  Then the robled apparition seems to disappear.

       Meanwhile everyone watches respectfully as the Maharajah unfurls
       the whip for his first attempt.  He flings the whip but it flies
       back and snaps  -- biting his own  cheek.

       There's a stunned silence -- then Short Round laughs  at the
       little prince who is holding his wounded cheek.  The incensed Ma-
       rahajah suddenly flashes the whip as Short Round.

       Short Round grabs the end of it and pulls hard -- the whip is
       tugged taut between the two hostile boys.  As they draw near each
       other, Short Round sees something weird:

       The little Maharajah's eyes begin glowing yelloe and he hisses
       softly in a strange voice.  Nobody else sees or hears the bizarre
       transformation...

       Indiana finally intercedes -- he grabs Short Round by the neck.

                                   INDIANA
                       Okay, Short Round, let go of it.

       Short Round lets go and Indy gently takes the whip back from the
       little prince.

                                   INDIANA (Cont'd)
                       The Turks say that a whip can be
                       an enemy even to its owner.  If
                       you get some rope, it'll be easier
                       to learn with, your Highness.
                       Now, I think we'll say goodnight.

       The Maharajah and Short Round stare hostiley at each other as
       Indy recoils his whip.

                                                               CUT TO:

64.    INT.  A PALACE HALL - NIGHT                                    64.

       Short Round walks beside Indiana down the shadowy hall toward
       their room.  Short Round has Indy's whip curled around his shoul-
       der.  The little fellow yawns and shakes his head.

                                   SHORT ROUND
                       That little Maharajah think he
                       big stuff.

                                   INDIANA
                       You don't like him do you?

                                   SHORT ROUND
                       Next time I flatten him!  Did you
                       see his eyes?

                                   INDIANA
                       No.

                                   SHORT ROUND
                       Indy, they glow like fire and get
                       real crazy!  Then he talk in this
                       real scary voice!

       Indy tousles Short Round's hair.

                                   INDIANA
                       He was afraid of you.  He knows a
                       tough  guy when he sees one.

                                   SHORT ROUND
                                  (not so shure)
                       Yeah, that's what happened...

       They reach their room and Short Round opens the door.

                                   INDIANA
                       I better see how Willie is.

       Short Round shakes his head scornfully as Indy crosses the hall
       and knocks on another door.  After a moment, the door opens and
       Willie is standing there in a tempting nightgown.

                                   INDIANA
                       I brought you something.

       He holds up something wrapped in a piece of silk.

                                   WILLIE
                                (disgusted)
                       Not leftovers?

                                   INDIANA
                       No -- real food.

       Willie opens the bundle suspiciously -- then her hace lights up
       as she examines the breads and fruits inside.

                                   WILLIE
                       Oh, it is real food...it's
                       beautiful.

       She bites happily into a piece of fruit -- its juice runs down
       her chin and Indy wipes it off gently with his hand.  The mouth
       deliberately seductive and Willie is not displeased.

                                   WILLIE (Cont'd)
                       You're nice.  Listen, I'm taking
                       applications -- how'd you like to
                       be my palace slave?

                                   INDIANA
                                  (smiling)
                       Wearing your jewels to be, prin-
                       cess?

       Indy touches her necklace -- then his hand caresses her neck and
       ear.  She shivers slightly and speaks softly.

                                   WILLIE
                       Yeah -- and nothing else.
                                  (smiling)
                       That shock you?

                                   INDIANA
                              (shaking his head)
                       I'm a scientist.  I like doing
                       research on certain "nocturnal
                       activities" --

       She smiles and puts a grape to his lips.  He opens his mouth
       takes it and chews it.

                                   WILLIE
                       You mean like love rituals...

       He swallows the grape and they move toward each other slowly to
       kiss, revealing the passion that's simmering.

                                   INDIANA
                       And mating customs...

       They kiss again more heatedly.

                                   WILLIE
                       Primitive sexual practices?

                                   INDIANA
                       You're taling to an authority
                       in that area.

       They kiss again hungrily --

                                   WILLIE
                       You're dying to come into my room,
                       aren't you?

                                   INDIANA
                       You want me so bad, why don't you
                       invite me?

                                   WILLIE
                       Too proud to admit you're crazy
                       about me, Dr. Jones?

                                   INDIANA
                       I think you're too used to get-
                       ting you own way, Willie...

       They kiss yet again -- and Indy breaks it off, just to show he's
       still in control.  He backs away toward his room.

                                   WILLIE
                              (watching him)
                       We'll see who gives in first --
                       I'll leave my door open.

                                   INDIANA
                       Don't catch cold.

                                   WILLIE
                       Dr. Jones -- ?

       Indy stops by his door and sees Willie smiling as she holds up
       five fingers --

                                   WILLIE (Cont'd)
                       Five minutes... you'll be back
                       over here in five minutes...

                                   INDIANA
                       You're dreaming, Willie.  You want
                       to make it real, just knock on my
                       door.

       He winks.  She waves.  But neither one will surrender first.
       Willie does into her room, leaving the door ajar.  Indy opens his
       door.

65.    INT.  INDIANA'S SUITE                                          65.

       Indy comes in and closes the door -- leaving it open a crack.  He
       stands and listens, waiting for her to come over.

66.    INT.  WILLIE'S SUITE                                           66.

       Willie stands likewise by her door, waiting to hear Indy come
       back over.

67.    INT.  INDIANA'S SUITE                                           67.

       Indiana shrugs and walks over to a couch and starts taking off
       his tweed jacket and necktie --

                                   INDIANA
                       Five minutes... fat chance.

68.    INT.  WILLIE SUIT                                              68.

       Willie moves around her lavish suite, turning down lights, creating
       a romantic effect, checking herself in a mirror --

                                   WILLIE
                                (confidently)
                       Five minutes, Dr. Jones...

69.    INT.  INDIANA'S SUITE                                          69.

       Indy undresses in the magnificently decorated room:  wall paint-
       ings show palace scenes and landscapes; life-size figures
       dance and there are full-scale portraits or Rajput princes and
       prancing horses.  But Indy's more concerned with lust than with
       art.

                                   INDIANA
                                 (muttering)
                       ...want me to be her palace slave!

       He picks up his whip and smiles, considering using it on her.
       Then he just grubles and tosses the bullwhip onto the couch.

70.    INT.  WILLIE'S SUITE                                           70.

       Lying in bed in a seductive pose, Willie waits for Indy to show
       up and she starts to look worried.  She grabs a clock and shakes
       it to see if it's working.  She taps her fingers irritably won-
       dering in her charm has failed...

71.    INT.  INDIANA'S SUITE                                          71.

       We see another clock ticking.  Looking annoyed, Indy tosses a
       boot at it and the clock falls on its face, setting of the
       alarm.

       On the chaise lounge in front of Indy's bed, Short Round moves
       groggily and sees Indy turning off the alarm.

                                   SHORT ROUND
                                  (half asleep)
                       Get to sleep Indy -- I stay up
                       and keep eye on things...

                                   INDIANA
                       Okay, Shorty ... see you in the
                       morning...I'm going to have a
                       little -- word with Willie.

       Indy finally shakes his head and gives in to his animal
       instincts.  He buttons his shirt, puts his boots back on and
       grabs his leather jacket.

       As he puts on his jacket he walks past the life-sized paintings of
       armed gaurds standing in silent vigil.  Suddenly we see something
       frightening behind him:  one of the wall paintings sees to come
       to life!

       A large figure in robes and a turban looms out from the wall and
       lifts a silk cord -- the figure wraps the cord suddenly around
       Indiana's neck!

       The huge assassin stands behind Indy, twisting the cord even
       tighter around his neck.  As Indy attempts to break free he
       sees the assassin's face is a mirror -- and a strange yellow
       light glowing in the killer's eyes.

72.    INT.  WILLIE'S SUITE                                           72.

       Willie's finally had enough waiting and she gets out of beg petu-
       lantly.

                                   WILLIE
                       He's not coming...I can't be-
                       lieve it...

       She walks across the room and opens the door.  She looks out
       the empty hall -- and her resolve starts to weaken --

                                   WILLIE (Cont'd)
                       Well...
                               (bracing herself)
                       No!  I'm not going over there...

       She comes back into her room and kicks the door closed.

                                   WILLIE (Cont'd)
                       Sleep tight, Dr. Jones!
                               (suddenly melancholy)
                       I could've been your greatest ad-
                       venture...

73.    INT.  INDIANA'S SUITE                                          73.

       Indy shoves the assassin backwards, ramming the big man into the
       wall.  The assassin maintains his deathgrip -- while on the
       chaise, Short Round sleeps through it all!

       Gasping futilely for air, Indy sinks slowly to his knees  - his
       eyes bulge and he stares at the tiny, smiling skulls at the ends
       of the death-cord wrapped around the assassin's fists.

       Indiana sinks lower and then feels something -- desperately he
       grabs a brass pot on the floor by the handle and swings it with
       his last strength, smashing it up into the assassin's head with
       a skull-crushing clang!

       The assassin is stunned and Indiana curls forward pulling him
       into a somersault and sening him flying over his back.  The ass-
       assin crashes on his sping next to the chaise.  Short Round still
       doesn't wake up.

       Indiana rips the cord from around his neck and gasps for breath.
       He sees the assassin pulling a knife.  Indiana dives as the knife
       flies through the air and slams into the wall.

       Indiana grabs his whip, rolls and lands on his feet.  As the ass-
       assin tries to retreat, Indy unleashes his whip -- it CRACKS and
       wraps around the killer's neck.

       The big man struggles, pulling on the whip, trying to release it
       from his throat -- and Indiana holds fast, watching the killer
       gasping for air now as his face turns red.

       Suddenly the assassin does a full-blown backward sommersault
       which rips the whip out of Indy's hand.  The assassin has an in-
       stant to grin victoriously --

       Until he sees that the whip handle is arching toward the ceiling
       where is gets caught on the revolving fan!  The surprised assass-
       in it tugged upwards -- and the whip twists around the ceiling
       fan like fishing-line around a fishing-reel--

       And like a doomed flounder, the assassin is slowly reeled up and
       dragged toward the ceiling, his toes lifting off the floor.
       The assassin screams as he is hanged!  His legs twitch in
       his death throes -- and below him, Short Round finally wakes up.

       Always Indiana's protector, Shorty instictively leaps off the
       couch and draws a small dagger --

                                   SHORT ROUND
                       Don't worry, Indy!  Where are
                       they?!

       Short Round spins a 360 , then looks up and does a double-take
       seeing the dead assassin twisting slowly around the ceiling fan.
       Indy takes Short Rund by the shoulders and turns him away from
       the grisly sight.

                                   INDIANA
                       It's okay, it's over -- go turn
                       off the fan.

       Short goes over and turns off the fan -- the assassin's body
       drops and Indy recoils his whip.  Suddenly they hear a hideous
       scream -- Willie!

74.    INT.  WILLIE'S SUITE                                           74.

       In a tight close-up:  Willie screams again.  She's lying in bed
       looking down at something --

       Moving up her shapely leg, a green and black, monstrous-looking
       insect crawls onto her stomach and Willie stops breather.  Immo-
       bilized by fear, Willie watches in silent agony as the hideous
       insect climbs slowly up her breast and slithers toward her neck.

       Across the suite, the doors burst open and Indiana rushes in.
       Shorty is behind him, carrying Indy's whip.  Indiana leaps on a
       stools and slides up to the bed to save WIllie --

       Then he spots the giant insect crawling on her and decides to
       have some fun.

                                   INDIANA
                       This a cheap trick to get me over
                       here?

       Willie speaks with desperate, fearful precision --

                                   WILLIE
                       No -- don't you see -- crawling --

                                   INDIANA
                       What -- the bug?

       Willie is petrified and shaking.

                                   WILLIE
                       Get -- the -- bug -- off!

                                   INDIANA
                       Gee, I wouldn't want to touch an
                       ugly critter like that!

                                   SHORT ROUND
                                   (grinning)
                       Uh uh -- me neither!

       Willie looks at the man-of-action like he's insane.  Then she
       feels the bug crawling onto her cheek --

                                   WILLIE
                       Oh no -- oh no!!

                                   INDIANA
                               (studying the bug)
                       You know, Willie, I'll bet he's
                       mad because they were eating his
                       friends for dinner.

                                   WILLIE
                       Please -- oh please, I'm going to
                       die!  Get it off!

       Indiana shrugs and leans over and casually swats the horrible bug
       off her face.  He and Short Round watch the insect skid across
       the floor -- and suddenly disappear as if by magic!

       Puzzled, they wander toward the wall, leaving Willie behind,
       bathed in sweat, staring at the ceiling --

                                   WILLIE
                       What did I do to deserve this
                       trip?!

       Kneeling by the wall, Short Round examines the baseboard --

                                   SHORT ROUND
                       It went under.  Hey, I feel
                       wind, Indy.

       Indiana knocks on the wall and considers the hollow sound.  He
       moves back and looks at the whole wall.  Behind him, Willie moves
       past --

                                   WILLIE
                       I'm packing!  I'm getting out of
                       here right now tonight!

       She dashes behind a screen to start getting dressed.  Meanwhile
       Indy feels the marble walls.  He moves to a niche in which there
       is a small statue of Ganesha, the friendly elephant god.

       Indiana lifts the statue -- and a panel in the wall opens slow-
       ly.  Short Round looks amazed.  Indy watches the light fall
       across the far wall of a tunnel as the door opens slowly.

       Indy peers into the tunnel at an old wall painting.  Spiderly San-
       skrit calligraphy runs under a flanking illustration of a prince
       bowing before a god.

                                   INDIANA
                       *(He reads aloud an inscription
                       in Sanskrit).

                                   SHORT ROUND
                       What does it mean, Indy?

                                   INDIANA
                                 (translating)
                       "Follow in the footsteps of
                       Shiva.  Do not betray his truth."

       Indy takes out the piece of cloth the boy gave him in Mayapore,
       the similarities are striking.  It is also a picture of Shiva
       Sankara.

                                   INDIANA
                       *(He repeats aloud the inscrip-
                       tion also written on the cloth)

       Over behind the screen, Willie's getting into some silk pants with
       an Indian-style brocade bodice top --

                                   WILLIE
                       I don't care if I have to walk to
                       Delhi, I'm -- hey!

       She notices Indy and Short Round bending to enter the dark tunnel
       behind the wall.

                                   WILLIE (Cont'd)
                       Wait a minute!  What're you --
                       where're you going?!

       Indy pokes his head back into the room --

                                   INDIANA
                       Lock your door and don't leave
                       until we get back.

       He disappears behind the wall and Willie looks worried.

75.    INT.  A PALACE TUNNEL - NIGHT                                  75.

       Indy and Short Round enter the secret passage and move forward
       slowly into the inky darkness.

                                   SHORT ROUND
                       I don't think we suppose to be in
                       here, Indy...

       They creep slowly down the dark tunnel.  It grows smaller and Indy
       ducks his head.

                                   SHORT ROUND (Cont'd)
                       I step on something.

       Their footsteps crunch on the tunnel floor.

                                   INDIANA
                       You're right, there's something
                       all over the floor...

       Even Short Round has to duck and Indy finally kneels to his
       hands and knees.

                                   INDIANA (Cont'd)
                       We'll have to crawl.

       As they crawl, their hands and knees continue to crunch on what-
       ever it is littering the ground.

                                   SHORT ROUND
                       Indy, the floor -- there is some-
                       thing alive!

       Indiana gets a match out of his pocket.  He snaps it with his
       thumb and the match flares -- a hideous insectarium: a living
       collection of the world's ugliest antropods, hexapods and arch-
       nids.

                                   SHORT ROUND
                       Holy smoke -- I'm scared, Indy!

       Indiana turns and sees something else --

                                   INDIANA
                       There's a chamber here.  Come on --

       Indy finds an oil lamp on the wall and lights it.  Short Round
       happily scampers into the chamber and Indy follows him.  Suddenly
       the door slides shut -- trapping them inside!

76.    INT.  THE CHAMBER                                              76.

       Indiana lights a match and finds another oil lamp.  He and Short
       Round look for a way to open the door that closed behind them,
       but they have no luck.

                                   INDIANA
                       Damn!

       Then they hear Willie's voice echoing down the short tunnel.

                                   WILLIE (O.S.)
                       Hey -- where are you?!

77.    INT.  WILLIE'S SUITE                                           77.

       Back in the suite, Willie stands by the entrance to the secret
       passage, peering into the dark tunnel --

                                   WILLIE (Cont'd)
                       Indiana Jones?!  Are you in there?!

78.    INT.  THE CHAMBER                                              78.

       Indy mutters irritably to himself --

                                   INDIANA
                       Yes, we're in here...

       He looks everywhere for something to open the door.  Short
       Round spots a loose brick and moves it --

                                   SHORT ROUND
                       Indy, I found a --

       Suddenly they hear a rumble and Indy turns to see the opposite
       wall moving -- the spikes start appearing!  Their lethal points
       protrude from the wall as it starts closing in toward Indy and
       Short Round.

                                   SHORT ROUND (Cont'd)
                       Indy -- !

       Shorty points up and Indiana sees more spikes descending from the
       ceiling!  Indy turns toward the door and shouts --

                                   INDIANA
                       Uh -- Willie?!
                                   (louder)
                       Willie, you better get down here!

79.    INT.  WILLIE'S SUITE                                           79.

       Willie listens and looks scared --

                                   WILLIE
                                (shouting back)
                       What?!

                                   INDIANA (O.S.)
                       Willie, come here!  Hurry up,
                       we're in trouble!!

                                   SHORT ROUND (O.S.)
                       Willie, help!!

       Willie is frightened, confused and jumping around --

80.    INT.  THE SPIKE CHAMBER                                        80.

       The deadly spikes inch slowly toward them from the wall and ceil-
       ing.  They start pounding on the door and shout --

                                   INDIANA
                       Willie, damn it!  Get down here,
                       NOW

81.    INT.  WILLIE'S SUITE                                           81.

       Willie finds the courage to finally whimper and step into the
       dark passage --

                                   WILLIE
                       Oh hell -- I bet I get all dirty
                       again!

82.    INT.  THE TUNNEL                                               82.

       Willie starts down the dark tunnel toward the chamber.

                                   INDIANA (O.S.)
                       WILLIE?!

                                   WILLIE
                       I'm coming, what's the rush?!
                       Ohh!  What's that?!  There's
                       stuff all over the floor!  I
                       can't see a thing!

83.    INT.  THE SPIKE CHAMBER                                        83.

       They hear her coming and Indy watches nervously as the spikes
       draw even closer --

                                   INDIANA
                       Move, Willie!  Faster!

84.    INT.  THE TUNNEL                                               84.

       Willie crawls and crunches on the littered floor --

                                   WILLIE
                       It's all wet and icky!  Aaahh --
                       things are moving!!

       She sees the low lamp by the door to the chamber.

                                   SHORT ROUND (O.S.)
                       Please, Willie!

       She grabs the lamp and turns it up so it burns brighter.  She
       looks around -- and SCREAMS!!  She sees the sickening, swarming
       mass of glistening insects crawling toward her, attracted by the
       light --

                                   WILLIE
                               (hysterical)
                       There's bugs!  Bugs all over!
                       Help!  Help me!

                                   INDIANA (O.S.)
                       Willie, open the door!  GET US
                       OUT OF HERE!

       Willie pounds on the door --

                                   WILLIE
                       OPEN THE DOOR!  LET ME IN!!

85.    INT.  THE SPIKE ROOM                                           85.

       The spikes close in --

                                   INDIANA
                       GET US OUT!  Willie, shut up and
                       listen!  There's got to be a ful-
                       crum release!  Look around!

                                   WILLIE (O.S.)
                       A what?!

86.    INT.  THE TUNNEL                                               86.

       Willie whines and frantically searches the wall.  Insects are
       crawling and jumping on her and she kicks at them!

                                   INDIANA (O.S.)
                       A fulcrum release lever!

                                   WILLIE
                       I can't find any lever!  Help me
                       Indy!

87.    INT.  THE SPIKE CHAMBER                                        87.

       Indiana and Short Round are backed against the wall and the
       spikes are a foot away and moving in --

                                   INDIANA
                       Look around, Willie!  There's got to
                       be a liever hidden somewhere!  Come
                       on, you can do it!

88.    INT.  THE TUNNEL                                               88.

       Insects drop onto Willie from the ceiling and fly at her as she
       flattens against the wall.  Then her elbow hits something -- a
       loose stone.  She claws at it and it falls out of the wall
       leaving a hole.

                                   WILLIE
                       There's a hole!  I found a square
                       hole!

                                   INDIANA (O.S.)
                       That's it -- the release lever --
                       look inside!

                                   WILLIE
                       I am -- it looks horrible!

       The hole is revolting :  covered with squirming insects, it also
       oozes some kind of glistening mucus.

                                   INDIANA (O.S.)
                       Reach inside!

       Willie moves her hand toward the nauseating hole then pulls back.

                                   WILLIE
                       I can't, Indy!  I can't!

89.    INT.  THE SPIKE TUNNEL                                         89.

       Indiana turns his head sideways and sucks in his breath, but the
       deadly spikes are poking into his leater jacket now --

                                   INDIANA
                       The lever!  Willie, do it!  NOW!

90.    INT.  THE TUNNEL                                               90.

       Willie screams and jams her hand into the gross hole --

                                   WILLIE
                       Oh God, it's soft -- it's moving!

                                   INDIANA (O.S.)
                       Willie!

91.    INT.  THE SPIKE CHAMBER                                        91.

       Short Round is frightened to death and crying --

                                   SHORT ROUND
                       Willie, help us!  Hurry!

92.    INT.  THE TUNNEL                                               92.

       She hears Short Round crying and twists her hand in the disgust-
       ing hole.  Suddenly the door springs open!  Willie pulls her hand
       out and stares in horror -- her hand and arm are covered with
       greenish slimey mung!

93.    INT.  THE SPIKE CHAMBER                                        93.

       The spikes suddenly retract, disappearing into the wall and clos-
       ing.  Indy pulls Willie inside the chamber and the door slams
       shut again.  Willie dances around, yelling about the hideous slime
       on her arm.

                                   WILLIE
                       Get is off me -- get it off!

       Indy helps her wipe it off.  Willie falls back against the door.

                                   WILLIE (Cont'd)
                       You left me out there!  What in
                       the hell were you doing in here?!
                       I want to leave this place right
                       now!!

       She sees the same lever that Short Round pulled earlier and grabs
       for it.  Indiana dives and manages to stop her from activating
       the spikes agian.

                                   INDIANA
                       Not that one!  We had enought of
                       that one, thank you...

       He looks around and spots a small rock protruding from the wall.
       Cautiously, praying htat it won't activate another booby trap,
       Indy pushes the rock.

       A large door opens on the other side of the chamber -- a soft
       wind howls past outside the chamber.

94.    INT.  THE WIND TUNNEL                                          94.

       Indiana, Short Round and Willie exit the spike chamber and head
       down a larger tunnel through which a roaring wind intermittantly
       blows, howling eerily like a note of gloomy music.

       Indiana follows a curve in the tunnel and they see light approaching.
       The wind holws another dramatic note which gales past them as
       they reach the mouth of the tunnel.

       Indiana is joined by Willie and Short Round.  They all stop in
       astonishment at the sight below them:

95.    INT.  THE TEMPLE OF DEATH                                      95.

       As the camera pulls back,  the mouth of the wind tunnel in which
       they are standing becomes just a small hole overlooking the stag-
       gering vastness of the incredible TEMPLE OF DEATH.

       The colossal subterranean temple has been carved out of a solid
       mass of rock.  A vaulting cathedral-like ceiling is supported by
       rows of carved stone columns.

       Balconies overlook the temple floor.  Pillared halls leading to
       dark side chambers.  Moving out of these chambers, hundreds of
       faithful worshippers chant as they enter the temple.

       Mammoth stone statues of elephants, lions and demi-gods (half/man,
       half/animal monstrosities) loom above the swelling crowds or wor-
       shippers.

       As the wind howls out of the tunnel high above the temple, the
       worshippers chant in response to the strange tunnel music.

96.    INT.  THE TUNNEL                                               96.

       The moaning wind rushes past Indiana, Willie and Short Round as
       they watch the mystery cult below bowing toward an enormous altar
       at the far end of the temple.

       This altar is a platform jutting out from the stone wall of the
       cavern.  Separating the worshippers from this altar is a wide
       crevasse out of which wisps of smoke rise occasionally.

97.    INT.  THE ALTAR                                                97.

       On the other side of the crevasse, evil-looking priests
       materialize out of clouds of swirling smoke.  The priests carry
       smoke-billowing urns to a giant stone statue.

       Now, we see the hideous protectress of the temple, the obscenely
       malevolent ombect of the cult's devotion:  the bloodthirsty god-
       dess KALI!

       The red-eyed priests bow at the base of the statue and gaze
       reverently at their KALI MA.  Skulls surround her stone feet
       carved serpents twist up her legs, while around her waist there
       is a guresome belt of human hands.

       Naked to the hips, Kali's hair falls about her four arms.  In her
       hand, she holds a sword, in the second the severed head of a
       giant.With her other hands she encourages her worshipers, who
       are chanting louder and louder!

       Kali's face is loathsome:  her earrings are two corpses.  Her
       evil tongue extends out of her twisted mouth and what looks like
       read blood flows over her long fangs and down her naked breasts.

98.    INT.  THE WIND TUNNEL                                          98.

       Watching from the high opening, Willie looks disgusted.

                                   WILLIE
                       What is it...?

                                   INDIANA
                       It's a Thuggee ceremony.  They're
                       whorshipping Kali, the goddess of
                       Death and Destruction.

99.    INT.  THE TEMPLE OF DEATH                                      99.

       A huge drum sounds three times and the chanting stops.  The
       silence is chilling as another robed figure appears out of the
       some on the altar.

       This is MOLA RAM, the High Priest of the Thugge cult.  Mola
       Ram's red-rimmed eyes glare from the sunken sockets in his
       sinister face.  Here is a man who looks as vile and diabolic
       as the unholy goddess rising behind him.

       Up in the wind tunnel, Indy stares down at the High Priest and
       realizes that is was Mola Ram he saw conferring with Chattar Lal
       in the palace garden.

       As the drum booms three times more, Mola Ram lifts one arm
       up from his emaciated body and suddenly there is a scream!

       All heads turn toward an unfortunate, struggling Indian begin
       dragged out by priests.  The man's face and body are wildly
       painted.  He screams again as he's tied onto a square iron frame
       laying atop a large flat stone.

       Mola Ram steps forward to the stretched-out victim and the Indian
       looks up into the High Priest's grotesque face --

       Suddenly Mola Ram's hand shoots out toward the man's chest -- and
       pierces it!  The High Priests hand sinks into the victim's
       writing body and rips out his living heart!

100.   INT. THE WIND TUNNEL                                           100.

       Willie covers her mouth --

                                   WILLIE
                       Oh my God!  He ripped out his --
                       he killed him!

                                   INDIANA
                       No...the heart's still beating!

101.   INT.  THE ALTAR                                                101.

       Indeed, the bloody heart is still beating in Mola Ram's hand!
       He lifts the heart into the air and the worhippers begin the chant.

                                   THE MULTITUDE
                       Jai ma Kali, jai ma Kali!

       Stranger still, the sacrificial victim is still alive -- there is
       no evidence of a gash on his chest, only a reddish mark  The
       priests add chains to the iron frame and carry the victim over
       toward a hoist hanging over the crevasse.

       The man thrashes about helplessly on the iron frame as it is up
       ended and then lowered with the victim hanging face down --

       As the sacrificial victim looks down into the crevasse below --
       he screams -- and we see the molten lava bubbling crimson at the
       bottom of the chasm!

102.   INT.  THE WIND TUNNEL                                          102.

       Willie closes her eyes but Indy and Short Round watch horrified
       as the iron frame is lowered -- and the bloody heart continues to
       beat in Mola Ram's hand -- and the molten lava burns and flickers
       as the screaming victim is lowered deeper into the crevasse.

103.   INT.  THE TEMPLE                                               103.

       The weird paint on the victim's face starts to smoke and sizzle --
       the man's skin blisters as he's lowered within feet of the
       lava.  His flesh smokes and he screams one last time as his body
       bursts into flame.

       The iron frame sinks and submerges into the boiling fiery lava.

104.   INT.  THE ALTAR                                                104.

       Above the crevasse, Mola Ram continues to hold the heart in
       his hand -- the heart is smoking and bursts into flames - and
       disappears!

105.   INT.  THE TEMPLE                                               105.

       The iron frame is raised out of the lava -- the metal glows
       like a branding iron, but there is no trace of the sacrificed
       victim.

106.   INT.  THE WIND TUNNEL                                          106.

       As the wind howls again, Willie and Short Round look sickened and
       appalled by the ceremony.  Even Indy seems shaken by what they
       are witnessing.

                                   THE MULTITUDE
                       Jai ma Kali,  jai ma Kali!

       Moal Ram raises both hands and his voice echoes strange incanta-
       tions.  Behind him, three priests carry cloth-wrapped objects to-
       ward the altar.

108.   INT.  THE WIND TUNNEL                                          108.

       Willie is crying and her voice is shoking as she turns awa from
       the hideous ritual --

                                   WILLIE
                       Let's go!  Let's get out of here!

                                   INDIANA
                       Quiet!

109.   INT.  THE ALTAR                                                109.

       The priests reverently unwrap three conical pieces of
       crystallized quartz.  The place the three stones below the sta-
       tue of Kali and slowly the smoke around the altar swirls --

       The smoke is drawn to the three stones and they actually start in-
       haling the piraling smoke.  The smoke disappears into the stones
       and the air clears.  Then the three stones start to glow a
       haunting incandescent white.

110.   INT.  THE WIND TUNNEL                                          110.

       Short Round looks scared.  Willie is still crying -- Indy waits,
       horrified but fascinated.

                                   INDIANA
                       The village knew their rock was
                       magic -- but they didn't know it
                       was one of the lost Sankara Stones...

                                   SHORT ROUND
                       Why they glow like that?

                                   INDIANA
                       Legend says that when the stones
                       are brought together the diamonds
                       inside of them will glow.

       Willie wipes her eyes and becomes more interested --

                                   WILLIE
                       Diamonds...?

111.   INT.  THE ALTAR                                                111.

       The Sankara Stones shimmer brightly, and inside the crystallized
       quartz, the enormous sparkling diamonds of legend are now re-
       vealed.

       Mola Ram stands facing Kali with his arms outstretched and
       kneels and bows and then walks off the altar and disappears.

112.   INT.  THE WIND TUNNEL                                          112.

       Indiana sees the woshippers below start to leave the temple.  He
       looks at Willie and Short Round.

                                   INDIANA
                       Okay -- now listen -- you wait here
                       and keep quiet.  Shorty, keep an
                       eye on her.

       Short Round nods and hands Indy his bullwhip and shoulder bag.
       Willie sees Indiana peering down at the sheer drop below the
       mouth of the wind tunnel.

                                   WILLIE
                       Wait -- what're you doing?

                                   INDIANA
                       I'm going down.

                                   WILLIE
                       Down?  Down there?!  Are you
                       crazy --!

                                   INDIANA
                       I'm not leaving without those
                       stones.

                                   WILLIE
                       You're gonna get killed chasing
                       after your damn fortune and
                       glory!

                                   INDIANA
                                (looking at her)
                       Maybe...someday.
                                 (smiling)
                       Not today.

                                   SHORT ROUND
                       I keep my eye peeled, Indy.

       Indiana nods and looks down at the now empty temple.  Then he
       slips down from the mouth of the wind tunnel.

113.   INT.  THE TEMPLE WALL                                          113.

       Indiana skillfully clumbs down an enormous tmeple column -- find-
       ing footholds on stone cobras, carved lions and the stone breasts
       of dancing girls.  Slowly, he makes his way down and swings across
       a balcony.

114.   INT.  THE BALCONY                                              114.

       Indiana walks quietly along the balcony overlooking the temple.
       He stops -- between him and the altar is the crevasse with the
       lava bubbling fire at the bottom.

       Indiana looks across the gulf and sees another column near the
       altar at the top of which stone elephants are perched.  Indy
       curls his whip and suddenly lets it fly --

       The whip cracks and its end wraps tightly around the tusk of one
       of the stone elephants.  From the balcony, Indy tugs the whip
       taut, takes a breath and runs --

115.   INT.  THE CREVASSE                                             115.

       Indiana leaps and swings out on the whip, arching down and up,
       over the chasm of fiery lava in a spectacular curving jump!

116.   INT.  THE LATAR                                                116.

       Indy lands on his feet and turns to release the whip.  Short
       Round waves to Indy that the coast is clear.  Indy snaps the whip
       -- it releases from the elephant tusk and drops.

       Recurling the whip, Indy attaches it to his belt and moves to-
       ward the towering statue of Kali.  The three Sankara stones start
       to glow and Indiana approaches them cautiously.

       Reaching the stones, Indy's face is lighted by them.  He notices
       that one of them (sthe stone from Mayapore village) has strange
       lines painted across it.

       Suspiciously, Indy touches the stone, but it doesn't burn.  He
       lifts it carefully and peers into it.  The enormous diamond
       sparkles inside.  He places the stone in his shoulder bag and
       reaches for the others.

117.   INT.  THE WIND TUNNEL                                          117.

       Short Round and Willie watch apprehensively as Indiana bags the
       three stones.

118.   INT.  THE ALTAR                                                118.

       Indiana backs away and looks up at the horrific statue of Kali.
       It seems to be watching him.  He turns and is about to go when he
       hears something --

       It sounds like a voice and Indy is afraid to turn -- could it be
       Kali?  The he hears other noises echoing and turns slowly.  Real-
       alizing the sounds are coming from behind the altar, Indy moves
       around it toward the back.

119.   INT.  THE WIND TUNNEL                                          119.

       Short Round and Willie are mystified as they see Indiana dissap-
       pear behind the altar.

                                   WILLIE
                       Oh hell, where's he going?

       Short Round looks worried.  Then the wind rushes past them quickly
       and howls its somber musical note.  However, the wind sounds dif-
       ferent this time, its tone quavering slightly.

       Short Round is puzzled and looks around.  He  feeezes when he sees
       two shadowy figures coming down the tunnel toward them -- the
       bodies causing the tone of the wind to shift eerily --

       Willie notices Short Round pulling a dagger from his belt -

                                   WILLIE
                       What're you -- ?

       Suddenly she turns and screams as two huge Thuggee guards rush
       at them!  One grabs at Short Round but the kid slashes the
       guard's hand with his dagger.

       Willie tries to get past the other guard, but he snatches her by
       the arm and pulls her toward him -- from her training at the Col-
       lege of Hard Knocks, Willie successfully knees the big man in the
       balls.

                                   WILLIE (Cont'd)
                       Keep your paws off, letch!

       The man groans and sinks to his knees.  Willie sees that Short
       Round is in trouble.  She runs over, leaps onto the back of the
       other guard and starts ripping his hair out.

       Short Round picks up his fallen dagger.  The big guard lurches
       backwards and smashes Willie into the rocky wall of the tunnel.
       Willie falls to the floor.

       Short Round approaches, holding the man at bay with his dagger.
       Willie turns as the other guard, the one she kneed, crawls toward
       her -- Willie scoops up some dirt and throws it.  The man claws
       at his eyes and Willie jumps up.

                                   SHORT ROUND
                       Run Willie!

       Willie starts to run and Short Round backs away, keeping the
       guard at a distance with his dagger.  Suddenly the guard cries out
       in Hindi and dives at Short Round.

       Panicking, Shorty tries to run after Willie -- but he's tripped.
       The guard has Short Round by the foot and drags him back.  Willie
       looks around and stops running.  She sees Short Round is caught.

                                   SHORT ROUND (Cont'd)
                       No!  Run!  Go get help!

       Willie hesitates, then runs down the tunnel.  Meanwhile, a mam-
       moth hand clutches Short Round's throat -- the giant guard lifts
       Shorty completely off the ground and the kid looks terrified and
       helpless as he dangles in the air...

120.   INT.  CHAMBER BEHIND ALTAR                                     120.

       Indiana enters the dark chamber behind the altar.  The only il-
       lumination is the back-light streaming around the silhouetted
       statue of Kali.

       Indy slowly crosses a narrow stone bridge and moves toward a cy-
       lindrical shaft of light rising up from what appears to be an
       enormous hole.

       Indy hears voices and the clink of metal against rock as he con-
       tinues forward.  The ground is dark in front of the large hole.
       He edges toward the precipice and the light rising up illuminates
       the look of shock on his face as he peers down into Hell...

121.   INT.  THE THUGGEE MINES                                        121.

       Indy looks into a deep pit around which concentric paths leads off
       into numerous narrow tunnels.  Crawling out of these burrows,
       scrawny children drag sacks of dirt and rock.  Other hollow-eyed
       children pull these sacks to mine cars waiting on rails.

       Straining to lift the rocks into the mine cars, several of the
       children slip and fall.  Bare-chested Thuggee guards shout at the
       enslaves children and kick those who've fallen.

       For these children there would seem to be only one hope -- death
       -- an end to their travail.

       Indiana edges around the hole, looking into the ghastly mine and
       feeling as if he's discovered an inferno of misery as grotesque
       as Dante's.

       Indy shifts the bag of stones on his shoulder.  He hesitates and
       considers his choice:  he has the Sankara Stones and can leave
       with them now...

       But Indy hears the pleading cries of one child and peers down to
       see a burly Thuggee guard beating the pitiful little slave.  Indy
       gets angrier and angrier as he watches.

       He finally steps over the grabs a boulder.  He lifts it and
       flings it down into the mine --

122.   INT.  THE MINE                                                 122.

       We see Indiana above and the boulder hurtling down -- it crashes
       onto the head of the Thuggee guard who hits the ground like a
       sack of cement!

12.    INT.  THE CHAMBER                                              123.

       Indy sees the startled slave children looking up at him in shock.
       He smiles victoriously at the Thuggees below who've run over to
       see what happened.

       Indy's smile seems to fade as his anger turns to surprise as he
       feels something unnerving:

       Dirt is crumbling away from the rim of the hole, a small
       landslide starting beneath his feet.  Suddenly the floor gives
       way and Indy slips!

       The entire rim of the hole shears off and Indy topples with it
       and plunges down into the mine toward the assembled guards who
       scatter -- Indy yells as he falls and it echoes...

                                                               CUT TO:

124.   INT.  A CELL - NIGHT                                           124.

       Indiana's yell continues to echo -- his head jerks suddenly --
       Indy jolts awake as if coming out of a nightmare, awakened by his
       own reverberating shout.

       Indy is lying on the rocky floor of a dark cave/cell.  He lifts
       his hands and discovers that they are chained.  In the murky
       light, he sees Short Round sitting in chains across the cell.

                                   SHORT ROUND
                       Indy -- you knocked out when you
                       fall.  You okay?

       Indiana nods groggily.  He sees a young slave worker in rags sit-
       ting near Short Round.  Through the iron bars of the cell, Indy
       sees the children slaving in the mine tunnels.

                                   SHORT ROUND
                              (indicating the kid)
                       This is Nainsukh -- from the vil-
                       lage.  They bring him here to dig
                       in the mines.

                                   INDIANA
                       Why?

                                   NAINSUKH
                       Children are small -- we can work
                       in tunnels.  Now I am too old.

                                   SHORT ROUND
                       What they do to you now?

                                   NAINSUKH
                       I pray to Shiva -- let me die.
                       But I do not.  Now -- now the
                       evil of Kali take me.

                                   SHORT ROUND
                       How?

                                   NAINSUKH
                       They will make me drink blood of
                       Kali.  Then I fall into black
                       sleep of Kali Ma...

                                   INDIANA
                       What is that?

                                   NAINSUKH
                       I become like them.  I be  alive --
                       nut like in nightmare.  You drink
                       the blood, you not wake up from
                       nightmare of Kali Ma.

       There's a noise and they see two guards and a priest outside the
       cell.  Nainsukh cowers in the darkness at the back of the cell,
       like a trapped animal awaiting the inevitable.

                                                               CUT TO:

125.   INT.  A MINE TUNNEL - NIGHT                                    125.

       Indiana and Short Round are pushed down a tunnel by guards.  They
       are stopped at a door and shoved inside.

126.   INT.  MOLA RAM'S CHAMBER                                       126.

       Indiana and Short Round stumble into the chamber.  It is a terri-
       fying gallery of occult yantras, ritualistic statues and grisly
       icons of the evil Thuggee sect.

       Grotesque statues of Kali's baleful minions line the walls.  In a
       corner, there is another statue of Kali herself, draped with
       flowers, necklaces of real human skills and slithering belts of
       live snakes.

       Fresh blood has been splashed over the statue and at its base are
       the three Sankara Stones recovered from Indiana.  Mola Ram sits
       in a yoga position near the statue of Kali.

       Mola Ram opens his eyes and he sees Indiana and Short Round
       standing in chains before him.

                                   MOLA RAM
                       You were caught trying to steal
                       the Sankara Stones.

                                   INDIANA
                                 (shrugging)
                       Nobody's perfect.  The way I
                       heard it, you stole one of them
                       from a small village.

       Mola Ram stands and gazes transfixed at the stones glowing on the
       altar.

                                   MOLA RAM
                       There were five stones in the
                       beginning.  Over the centuries
                       they were dispersed by wars,
                       sold off by thieves like you...

                                   INDIANA
                       Two are still missing.

                                   MOLA RAM
                       No.  They are here -- somewhere.
                       A century ago when the British
                       raided this temple and butchered
                       my people, a loyal priest his the
                       last two stones down here in the
                       catacombs.

                                   INDIANA
                       That's what you've got these chil-
                       dren -- these slaves digging for?

                                   MOLA RAM
                       They dig for the gems to support
                       our cause.  They also search for
                       the last two stones.  Soon we will
                       have all five Sankara Stones and
                       the Thuggees will be all powerful!

                                   INDIANA
                       Nobody can say you don't have a
                       vivid imagination.

                                   MOLA RAM
                       You do not believe me?  You will,
                       Dr. Jones.  You will become a true
                       believer.

       The door opens and Mola Ram bows slightly as the little Maharajah
       enters.  Indy looks surprised and Short Round tenses.

                                   MOLA RAM (Cont'd)
                       Your Highness will witness the
                       thief's conversion.

       Mola Ram nods and two guards grab Indy.  They drag him struggling
       to a rock and chain him to it.  Short Round scuffles as he's
       pulled aside to watch.

       Remembering the High Priest's earlier open-heart surgery, Indi-
       ana looks worried as Mola Ram approaches him --

                                   MAHARAJAH
                       You will not suffer.  I recently
                       became of age and tasted the blood
                       of Kali.

       Now the young initiate comes forward and Indiana looks startled --
       it's Nainsukh.  He is wearing robes and his eyes are glowing
       strangely.  Nainsukh hands Mola Ram a hollow human skull full of
       blood!

       The guards hold Indiana's head back and force his mouth open.
       Mola Ram tips the skull and blood spills out of its death-
       grinning jaws and flows into Indiana's mouth.  Indy gags --

       Suddenly he spits the blood, spraying Mola Ram and the little
       Maharajah.  Looking at his blood-splattered clothes, the Mahara-
       jah is furious.

                                   MOLA RAM
                       Hold him!

       The little prince's eyes glow angrily and he hisses at Indy --

                                   MAHARAJAH
                       You will learn to obey because
                       you are powerless!

       The little Maharajah pulls a small krtya from his robes -- Indy
       sees that the doll has been crudely fashioned to resemble him.

                                   MAHARAJAH (Cont'd)
                       I control you now!

       The Maharajah turns and sticks the doll into a flaming urn.  In-
       diana suddenly cries out and twists in pain as he is burned!  The
       little prince smiles evilly and puts the doll back into his
       robes.

       Then he goes over to where Indy's whip and bag have been laid.
       He grabs the bullwhip.

                                   MAHARAJAH (Cont'd)
                       You told me that a whip could be
                       an enemy to its owner.  We shall
                       see!  Turn him over!

       As the guards turn Indy face down, they rip off his jacket and
       chain his ahnds to the rock.  The Maharajah uncurls the whip -- he
       notices Short Round smiling snidely --

       Suddenly the Maharajah cracks the whip -- it lashes out and cuts
       into Short Round's shoulder.  Blood appears and Short Round looks
       stunned by the lash and by the fact the Marahajah knows who to
       use the whip.

                                   MAHARAJAH (Cont'd)
                       As Dr. Jones suggested, I have
                       been practicing.

       The little Maharajah whirls and lashes the whip again.  Indiana
       jerks as the bullwhip rips through his shirt and tears open his
       flesh.  The Maharajah lashes again and again -- blood spurts
       across Indy's tattered shirt.

       As the whipping continues- Short Round jumps as if he is also be-
       ing beaten.  His eyes fill with tears as he watches Indy suffer.

       Finally, the little Maharajah lets the whip fall limp.  As the
       Maharajah approaches Indy, Short Round lunges as him angrily but
       the guards restrain him.

       Indiana groans as he's turned over.  Blood trickles from his
       mouth and he stares up hatefully at Mola Ram.

                                   MOLA RAM
                       The British in India will be
                       slaughtered.  Then we will over-
                       run the Moslems and force their
                       "Allah" to bow to Kali.

       Mola Ram is once again given the human skull by a priest and he
       lifts it toward Indy's face --

                                   MOLA RAM (Cont'd)
                       And then the Hebrew God will fall
                       and finally the Christian God will
                       be cast down and forgotten.

       Indy's head is held back and Mola Ram spills the blood -- it
       flows out of the mouth of the skull into Indy's mouth.

                                   MOLA RAM (Cont'd)
                       Soon Kali Ma will rule the world!

       Indy's eyes look horrified as the blood flows from the skull down
       his choking throat -- some of the blood spills and falls to the
       floor --

       We see the very earth trembling as the evil spreads -- a fissure
       appears beneath Indy's feet and a small line of crimson lava
       oozes out and smiles evilly across the floor...

                                                               CUT TO:

127.   INT.  WILLIE'S SUITE - NIGHT                                   127.

       Diaphanous curtains billow silently into the moonlighted room.
       Two exotic birds sit on a golden perch, their eyes clicking
       watchfully.  Suddenly the brids shriek and flap away --

       Willie stumbles through the secret door and falls into the room.
       Insects cover her and she shimpers as she knocks them off.  She
       manages to stagger to her feet and she heads for the door.

128.   INT.  THE PALACE - NIGHT                                       128.

       Willie rushes out of her room and runs through the deserted pal-
       ace looking for help.  She flies down the moonlit corridors, past
       the huge wall paintings.

       She stops by a courtyard and calls out desperately, but there is
       no one around.  She backs away down a hallway and then jumps --
       seeing something in a mirror:  a face looms behind her and she
       screams!

       Willie whirls and sees Chattar Lal, the Prime Minister, approach-
       ing her.

                                   WILLIE
                       Oh my God, you scared me!  Listen,
                       you've got to help.  We found this
                       tunnel --

       Captain Blumburtt comes around a corner and interrupts --

                                   CAPT. BLUMBURTT
                                   (to Chattar Lal)
                       Jones isn't in his room.  Miss
                       Scott -- my troops are leaving at
                       dawn if you want us to escort you
                       to Delhi --

                                   WILLIE
                       No -- you can't go!  Something aw-
                       ful's happened.  They've got Short
                       Round and I think Indy's been --

                                   CAPT. BLUMBURTT
                       What?

                                   WILLIE
                       We found a tennel that leads to a
                       temple below the palace!  Please,
                       come with me, I'll show you!

       The two men exchange dubious looks.  Willie grabs Blumburtt by
       the arm and they start down the hall.

                                   CHATTAR LAL
                       Miss Scott, you're not making any
                       sense.

                                   WILLIE
                       I'm afraid they'll kill them!  We
                       saw horrible things down there --
                       they had a human sacrifice and they
                       ripped a man's heart out!

                                   CAPT. BLUMBURTT
                       Who?

                                   WILLIE
                       It's some kind of cult!  And they've
                       got the sacred stones that Indy was
                       searching for.

                                   CHATTAR LAL
                       I sense the fumes of opium in all
                       this.  Prehaps Miss Scott picked
                       up the habit in Shanghai.

                                   WILLIE
                       What're you talking about -- I'm
                       not a dope fiend!  I saw it!  I'll
                       show you!

129.   INT.  WILLIE'S SUITE                                           129.

       She leads them into her suite.  Willie points to the dark opening
       in the wall.  Blumburtt picks up an oil lamp and holds it toward
       the opening -- suddenly he jumps back as Indiana emerges!

                                   INDIANA
                              (smiling faintly)
                       What're we playing, hid and seek?

       They're all startled.  Willie looks relieved and rushes over to
       Indy and puts her arms around him.

                                   WILLIE
                       Oh, Indy, you got away!  Tell them
                       what happened, they won't believe
                       me --

       He puts his arms around her and feels her trembling from fear and
       anger.  He walks her to the bed and helps her sit down --

                                   INDIANA
                       It's okay.  You're all right now.

                                   WILLIE
                       They think I'm insane.  Tell them
                       I'm not, Indy.  Please -- help me ...

       The awful events have taken their toll and Willie covers her face
       and cries like a scared kid.  Indy gets her to lie down on the
       bed.  He sits beside her and smiles and touches her hair --

                                   INDIANA
                       Hey, I thought you were supposed
                       to be a real tropper.  Willie?

       He wipes the tears from her face and she holds his hand --

                                   WILLIE
                                 (quietly)
                       What?

                                   INDIANA
                       You've got to go to sleep now.

                                   WILLIE
                                  (softly)
                       I want to go home...

                                   INDIANA
                       I don't blame you... this hasn't
                       been what you'd call a fun vaca-
                       tion...

       She smiles a little despite herself and he touches her cheek.
       He eyes are already closing and he stands up.

       A servant is entering the suite to take care of Willie.  She cov-
       sers her with a blanket and start dropping the mosquito netting
       as Indy walks off toward the verandah with Blumburtt and Chattar
       Lal.

130.   EXT.  THE VERANDAH - DAWN                                      130.

       The first light is breaking over the mountain peaks.  Coming out
       onto the verandah, Indy and the other two men see the cavalry
       troops breaking camp below and readying their horses and trucks.

                                   INDIANA
                       I've spent by life crawling around
                       in caves and tunnels -- I shouldn't
                       have let somebody like Willie go
                       in there with me.

                                   CAPT. BLUMBURTT
                       Miss Scott panicked?

                                   INDIANA
                       When she saw the insects she passed
                       out cold.  I carried her back to
                       her room.  She was sleeping when I
                       re-entered the tunnel to look
                       around.

                                   CHATTAR LAL
                       As she slept, she undoubtedly had
                       nightmares.

       Indiana looks at him and nods.

                                   INDIANA
                       Then she must have run out of the
                       room and you found her.

                                   CAPT. BLUMBURTT
                       Did you discover anything in that
                       tunnel, Dr. Jones?

       Indiana stares into the rising sun.

                                   INDIANA
                       Nothing.  Just a dead end.  That
                       tunnel's been deserted for years.

       A sergeant-major shouts up to Blumburtt that the troops are
       ready.

                                   CAPT. BLUMBURTT
                       Well, Mr. Prime Minister, my re-
                       port will duly note that we
                       found nothing unusual here in
                       Pankot.

                                   CHATTAR LAL
                       I'm sure that will please the
                       Maharajah, Captain.

                                   CAPT. BLUMBURTT
                                   (to Indiana)
                       As I said before, we'd be happy to
                       escort you to Delhi.

                                   INDIANA
                       Thanks, but I don't think Willie is
                       ready to travel yet.

                                                               CUT TO:

131.   EXT.  THE PALACE ROAD - MORNING                                131.

       Dust swirls as the British cavalry moves off with their Highland
       Pipers at the head playing a military bagpipe tune.  Capt. Blum-
       burtt comes out of the palace and gets into an open car.

       Blumburtt's car moves off behind the cavalry and then the supply
       trucks follow.

132.   INT.  WILLIE'S SUITE                                           132.

       The whine of the bagpipes is eerily muted in the dark room.
       Through the gently swaying mosquito netting, we see Willie asleep
       on the bed.

       Then through her side of the gauzy netting, we see the door
       opening across the room.  Indiana enters quietly and moves toward
       the bed, his eyes fixed on Willie's sleeping body.

       Indy sits down on the bed slowly.  Willie turns in her sleep and
       opens her eyes.  Through the mosquito netting she sees Indy sit-
       ting with his back to her.

                                   WILLIE
                       Indy?  Did you walk to them?

                                   INDIANA
                       Yes.

                                   WILLIE
                       So now they believe me.

                                   INDIANA
                       Yes, they believe you.

       Indiana speaks in a strange monotone.

                                   WILLIE
                       Then they'll send the soldiers
                       down into the temple...

       Willie looks at Indiana's back and continues quietly.

                                   WILLIE (Cont'd)
                       I was scared to death last night
                       when I thought they were going to
                       kill you.

                                   INDIANA
                       No... they won't kill me.

                                   WILLIE
                                (smiling faintly)
                       You know you've been nothing but
                       trouble since I hooked up with
                       you -- but I have to admit I'd
                       miss you if I lost you...

       Now Indiana starts to turn slowly.

                                   INDIANA
                       You won't lose me, Willie...

       She sees him turn and his face slowly comes toward the mosquito
       netting -- his face pushes into the netting and Willie looks
       stunned as Indy's mouth opens --

       He starts hissing grotesquely, smoke billows out of his mouth and
       the mosquito netting BURNS OPEN to expose his terrifying face
       moving toward Willie --

       She is forzen with fear and unable to utter a sound as Indy's
       malevolent face looms at her -- and then she notices his eyes --
       his eyes glowing a hellish luminscent yellow!

       Willie SCREAMS!!

       She suddenly bolts from the bed and tries to run -- Indiana goes
       into a rage, ripping the mosquito netting from the bed as he fol-
       lows her.

                                   INDIANA
                       No!  I've found it -- you can't --
                       Kali knows!

       Willie tries the door but it's locked.  She sees Indiana moving
       toward her ranting incoherently as he smashes a vase out of his
       way --

                                   INDIANA
                       -- been too many lies -- there's no
                       god's heaven -- just -- the horror!
                       I've seen it -- life preying on
                       life!

       Willie cowers in a corner, horrified by the transformation she
       sees in Indiana.  Shouting and pacing Indy holds his head against
       the pain of his terrible thoughts --

                                   INDIANA
                       -- rivers -- destroying mountains --
                       a comet in space -- exploding!
                                 (holding his head)  
                       Aaahh! -- the screams -- pitiful
                       people -- their pain -- the hate --
                       and greed -- always greed!

       The light throws his shadow over Willie -- a giant shadow float-
       ing back and forth over her as she cries in the corner, unable to
       fight the evil devouring Indiana.

                                   INDIANA
                       -- but I've found -- Kali's touch!
                       Death -- no more lies -- the death
                       I've been searching for!
                                  (shouting)
                       Quit crying!  She can hear you --
                       Kali knows fear -- don't you under-
                       stand -- Kali is freedom!

       Indiana stops pacing and Willie freezes in terror.  Now a bizarre
       yellow light wipes across the room.  Indiana turns and watches
       silently as two Thuggee guards emerge from a secret doorway
       that's opened --

       The shadows of the Thuggee guards loom over Willie and she
       SCREAMS again!

                                                               CUT TO:

133.   INT.  THE TEMPLE OF DEATH - DAY                                133.

       A sea of frightening faces once again intones the horrible sacri-
       ficial chant.  Among the shorshippers, the little Maharajah sits
       on a riased platform.  Like the other believers, he stares across
       the crevasse at the altar of Kali Ma.

       The wailing wind howls out of the high tunnel and the terrifying
       chanting reaches a fever pitch.

134.   INT.  THE TMEPLE ALTAR                                         134.

       And once again the three sacred Sankara Stones glow magically.
       Mola Ram materializes evilly amidst the swirling smoke and he
       begins chanting in Sanskrit.

       Beside the altar, half-clad female acolytes pass in front of the
       robed priests -- with their fingers the women paint two white
       lines across the priests' foreheads.

       An acolyte moves in front of Chattar Lal -- the Prime Minister is
       now dressed in robes.  As the devotional markings are painted on
       his forehead, Chattar Lal translates the High Priest's speech to
       Indiana who stands next to him.

                                   CHATTAR LAL
                       Mola Ram is telling the faithful
                       of out victory.  He says the
                       British have left the palace,
                       which proves Kali Ma's new power.

                                   INDIANA
                       Yes, I understand.

       Indiana bows his head to receive the mystical markings.  He lis-
       tens to Mola Ram's rantings -- Indy's eyes are ominously vacant
       as he stares up at the hideous statue of Kali.

135.   INT.  MINE TUNNELS - DAY                                       135.

       Beneath the temple, down in the bowels of the mountain, the piti-
       ful children dig at the earth with their fingers.  A FAT GUARD
       slouches down the tunnel, flogging malingerers with a aleather
       strap.

       Short Round sweats next to the others, clawing at the rocks,
       doomed to work with them now in their search for the last wo
       Sankara Stones.

       The leather strap suddenly flays Short Round's back and he barely
       manages not to scream out in pain.  The fat guard passes -- Short
       Round and the other kids pull a large rock which suddenly comes
       loose out of the wall -- !

       They fall back and see they've exposed a vein of molten lava!
       Hearing their shouts, the fat guard returns -- yelling at their
       stupidity, he whips them and shoves them aside brutally.

       Short Round see the fat guard's eyes glowing fiercely in anger.
       Suddenly the fissure shoots out steam and spews some molten lava
       over the guard's legs.

       The guard screams and falls to the ground, thrashing about, try-
       ing to kick the searing lava off his smoking flesh.

       As the other kids cower, Short Round's humane instincts cause him
       to jump forward to help the guard who moments earlier was beating
       him --

       Short Round tosses dirt on the guard's legs and grabs a gunny
       sack and starts rubbing the lava off.  Shorty notices something
       strange:

       The guard's eyes, which were glowing yellow before, are now dim-
       ming and returning to normal.  The moaning guard looks at Shorty
       thankfully and then looks around as if waking from a nightmare --

                                   SHORT ROUND
                              (to another slave kid)
                       His eyes -- they go out.

       Other guards appear and lift the guard -- suddenly he starts
       struggling against the guards not wanting to return to the night-
       mare of Kali --

                                   FAT GUARD
                            (as he's dragged away)
                       No!  NO!

                                   SHORT ROUND
                       The pain -- the pain makes him wake up!
                                  (thinking quickly)
                       Indy!  I can make Indy wake up!

       But the other guards push and beat the children back to work.
       Short Round is shoved against a wall and groans -- he reaches over
       and grabs a large rock, lifting it defiantly --

       But rather than heaving it at the guard, Short Round smashes the
       rock down on the leg chains binding him to the other children.
       Shorty beats at the chain with the rock, determined to escape.

                                   SHORT ROUND
                       Indy!

136.   INT.  THE TEMPLE OF DEATH                                      136.

       The wind moans and joins Mola Ram's voice echoing maniacally over
       the multitude gathered in the enormous temple.  On his throne,
       the little Maharajah listens transfixed.

137.   INT.  THE ALTAR                                                137.

       Chattar Lal watches Indiana staring hypnotically at the High
       Priest as he speaks --

                                   CHATTAR LAL
                       You understand what he tells us?

                                   INDIANA
                       Kali Ma protects us now and for-
                       ever, and we must pledge our
                       devotion by worshipping her with
                       an offering of flesh and blood!

       Suddenly htere is a heart-rending scream of terror and the
       priests draf forward the next sacrificial victim --

       Indiana's glowing eyes watch emotionlessly as Willie is brought
       out. Dressed in a Rajput maiden's outfit, Willie has been jewel-
       ed and draped with flowers -- a strange contrast as she struggles
       desperately.

                                   CHATTAR LAL
                       Your friend has seen and she has
                       heard -- now she will not talk.

       As Willie is dragged past she sees Indy and calls to him --

                                   WILLIE
                       Indy!  Help me!  Indy?!

       Willie is shocked seeing that Indiana remains impassive and un-
       caring as she's dragged to her death.

                                   CHATTAR LAL
                                   (to Indy)
                       This will prove your devotion to
                       Kali.

       Indiana looks away from Willie's terrified face and stares up
       adoringly at the monstrous statue of his goddess Kali.

138.   INT.  THE MINE                                                 138.

       In the dark tunnel, a rock smashes down onto a chain -- and
       breaks it!  Short Round is exhausted.  He looks around furtively
       and sees a guard approaching.
       
       Short Round takes a chance -- he dives and rolls across the
       tunnel.  He ducks behind a mine car full of rocks being pushed
       out by two chained children.

       The guard lumbers past unsuspectingly as Short Round makes his
       escape using the moving mine car as cover.

139.   INT.  THE ALTAR                                                139.

       Up in the temple, Willie continues to struggle as her legs are
       strapped to the iron sacrifical frame.  Chattar Lal grabs her
       hand and ties it down.  Willie's free hand reaches out imploring-
       ly toward Indiana --

                                   WILLIE
                                (hoarsely)
                       Please, God, don't let them do
                       this to me -- help me, Indy!

       He reaches out slowly and Willie grabs his hand tightly.  Indy
       looks into her eyes and then stares at her hand -- and slowly
       lifts it and starts tying it to the iron frame.

                                   WILLIE (Cont'd)
                       No -- no!

       Willie cries is disbelief as Indiana calmly betrays her.

140.   INT.  THE MINES BELOW                                          140.

       Short Round races up a tunnel and then flattens himself behind a
       corner.  He peers anxiously into a large carven and sees two
       guards walking away.

       When the coast is clear, Short Round darts across the cavern to a
       long wooden ladder tilted up against a wall.  Short Round looks
       up the high ladder and sees a kid with a sack of rocks descending
       from a burrow-hole half-way up the wall.

       The exhausted kid nearly collapses at the bottom -- then jumps
       seeing Short Round.  Shorty motions for him to keep quiet.
       Amaxed, the kid watches Short Round scramble up the ladder.
       Shorty continues until he is high above the floor.

       Dirty faces stare out of the high burrow as Short Round stops
       climbing.  The kids are astonished as Short Round suddenly grunts
       and kicks the ladder away from the wall!

       The high ladder falls in an arc and what seem like sure suicide
       slowly resembles a mini-Indiana Junes stunt as Short Round swings
       to the other side of the falling ladder --

       Short Round holds on for dear life as the ladder crashes against
       the opposite cavern wall -- giving Short Round access to the
       roof-hole that leads up to the temple!

       Short Round scurries up the ladder and pulls himself up into the
       chamber behind the altar.  He looks at the light flaring around
       the statue of Kali --

                                   SHORT ROUND
                       Indy -- !

141.   INT.  THE TEMPLE OF DEATH                                      141.

       Chains clank and gears grind as the sacrificial frame is raised
       over the crevasse.  Stretched out on it, Willie looks horrified
       as she hangs suspended face down above the boiling lava!

       The frame and victim descend slowly into the crevasse and the
       crowd around the little Maharajah changs louder.

142.   INT.  THE REAR CHAMBER                                         142.

       Short Round dashes across the dark chamber behind the altar.  He
       peers out and sees Willie disappearing into the crewasse!  He
       sees Indiana watching impassively --

                                   SHORT ROUND
                       No -- Indy -- wake up!

       Then Shorty sees a flaming torch hanging on a wall bracket and he
       has an idea.

143.   INT.  THE ALTAR                                                143.

       Short Round suddenly darts out onto the altar and Mola Ram sees
       him and yells.  Several priests grab for Shorty.  He eludes the
       first priest, smashes the second in the stomach with his head,
       and runs like a little quarterback toward the fiery torch --

       Short Round snatches the torch from the wall and charges toward
       Indiana.  Seeing him coming, Indy's eyes start glowing yellow and
       when Short Round runs up to him, Indiana suddenly swings and
       backhands the little guy brutally across the face!

       The torch flies out of Shorty's hand as he's knocked against at
       wall by Indy's vicious blow -- Short Round wipes a little blood
       from his chin and stares at his hero in wounded disbelief.

       Chattar Lal watches approvingly -- a priest moves toward Shorty.
       Chattar Lal looks back toward the crevasse --

       Willie hangs on the lowering frame, heat waves rising up now to
       scald her skin and she chokes as the sulphuric air burns her
       lungs!

       Meanwhile Short Round is crawling backwards across the floor with
       a look of terror on his face -- Indiana stalks him, hissing,
       snarling, his eyes lgowing --

       Short Round springs to his feet and tries to run -- Indy grabs
       him and pulls him -- Shorty's hand grabs for another wall torch
       and just manages to yank it free!

       Indiana spins Short Round and clutches his throat.  As Indy
       strangles him, Short Round struggles and finally jams the torch
       into Indy's side.  The fiery torch burns Indy, smoking as it
       sears his flesh, and he yells in pain.

                                   SHORT ROUND
                       Wake up!  It's just a nightmare,
                       Indy!  Wake up, please Indy!

       Indiana writhes in pain and Short Round sees the evil yellow glow
       in Indy's eyes getting dimmer and finally going out.  Now it
       seems like theold Indiana staring at him --

                                   SHORT ROUND (Cont'd)
                       Indy, you back?

       Suddenly a priest grabs Short Round and pulls him off Indiana.

                                   INDIANA
                       No!  Give him to me!

       Short Round is firghtened as Indy grabs him from the priest.
       Indy lifts Short Round into the air --

                                   SHORT ROUND
                       No, Indy, no!

       He sets Short Round down on the brink of the crevasse an inch
       from doom.  Shorty looks down at the lava and is terrified.
       Indiana finally flahses him a quick smile and winks!

       Then Indiana whirls and punches the priest in the face!  Short
       Round cheers, realizing that Indiana is back.

                                   SHORT ROUND (Cont'd)
                       We got to help Willie!

       Indiana springs into action, stopping another priest with a quick
       punch in the stomach.  Then he rushes over to the crankwheel and
       pulley platform.  Indy jumps onto it, yanking one priest off who
       spills onto the floor.

       A second priest, who works the controls lowering the sacrificial
       frame, sees Indy and releases the crankwheel --

       Down in the crevasse, Willie screams as the iron frame suddenly
       plummets toward the fulminating lava!

       On the platform, the priest lunges at Indiana -- Indy uses the
       man's own momentum to throw him over his head.  Indy then dives
       for the crankwheel and manages to stop it --

       Down in the crevasse, the fram jolts to a stop only yards above
       the spumes of fiery lava.  The heat is so intense now that Wil-
       lie's clothes start smoking and she passes out...
       On the platform above, Indiana cranks furiously, raising the sa-
       crificial frame.

144.   INT.  THE TEMPLE                                               144.

       The chanting stops at the Kali worshippers notice the battle on
       the altar.  The little Maharajah looks concerned and leaves,
       shoving through the crowd behind his bodyguards.

145.   INT.  THE ALTAR                                                145.

       Mola Ram shouts at his priests and another one of them runs to-
       ward Indy on the platform.  Short Round dives and tackles the
       priest.

       Chattar Lal finally leaps onto the crankwheel platform and Indy
       sees him pull a dagger.  He slashes at Indiana and Indy has to
       let go of the crankwheel -- the gears scream and the chains
       screech!

       Below in the crevasse, the iron frame plunges again toward the
       crimson lava!

       On the platform, Indy hears the frame lowering and looks pan-
       icked.  Chattar Lal slahses again with the dagger -- keeping Indy
       away from the cogwheel mechanism --

       Indy suddenly kicks the dagger from Chattar Lal's hand slugs him
       in the stomach and dives toward the cogwheel mechanism.  He grabs
       a iron rod and throws it into the gears --

       the gears mangle the iron rod but finally grind to a stop.  Indi-
       ana grabs the crankwheel and starts winding it up furiously.

       Meanwhile, Short Round jumps onto the platform with Indy and
       grabs a long wrench.  He starts swinging the wrench, keeping the
       last priests off the platfrom.

       The sacrificial frame finally rises up into view and Indiana
       grabs it and swings it over onto the platform.  He looks at Wil-
       lie anxiously as he releases her bindings --

       Willie moans and moves her head.  Indy pulls her off the frame
       and she starts coughing.  Gasping for breath, Willie ervives as
       fresh air flows into her lungs.

       Finally Willie opens her eyes and she sees Indiana.  Then she
       notices something else and manages to cry out hoarsely --

                                   WILLIE
                       Look out -- !

       Chattar Lal grabs a pistol from an unconscious guard and Indiana
       whirls to see him pointing it -- Indy kicks the gun from his hand
       and suddenly Chattar Lal starts shouting in a terrifying voice --

       Chattar Lal's eyes glow as he lunges suicidally at Indiana, at-
       tempting to take Indy with him as he dives from the platform!

       Crashing into Indy, Chattar Lal knocks both of them back onto the
       sacrificial frame which swings out over the crevasse --

       Indy manages to dive off the frame just in time.  He grabs hold
       of the platform as the crankwheel screams and the frame falls!

       Looking up from the depths of the crevasse, we see the frame with
       Chattar Lal on it plummeting downward into the sulphurous smoke!
       The frame finally crashes, splashing into the molten lava.

       Chattar Lal's body explodes inot flame friefly -- his flesh is
       broiled off in an instant -- we glimpse a skeleton momentarily --
       and then all is consumed and obliterated by the blazing lava.

      scramble over to Short Round who jumps off the platform and they
       follow him across the altar.

       Indy sees Mola Ram quickly collecting the sacred Sankara Stones.
       Indiana rushes over and spins Mola Ram around --

       He slugs the High Priest in the face and Mola Ram keels over
       backwards against the statue of Kali.  Short Round helps stuff
       the Sankara Stones into Indiana's shoulder bag.

146.   INT.  THE REAR CHAMBER                                         146.

       Short Round, Willie and Indiana rush across the chamber behind
       the altar.  They run over to the ladder and start climbing down
       into the mines.

147.   INT.  THE MINES

       Willie follows Short Round.  Indiana jumps down last and pulls
       the ladder away, letting it crash to the floor so they won't be
       followed.

       They draw the attention of the slave children working in the tun-
       nels around the cavern.  But it's the sight of the approaching
       guard that worries Indy --

                                   INDIANA
                       Come on, quick!

       They duck into one of the tunnels.  As they hide, Indy watches
       the guard passing.

                                   WILLIE
                       What're we going to do?

       Indiana looks around at the silent, frightened children who've
       stopped working in the tunnel and his anger darkens --

                                   INDIANA
                       We're going to get them out
                       of here -- !

       Then he looks at the bag holding the Sankara Stones and grows
       still more determined --

                                   INDIANA (Cont'd)
                       And then we're going to get these
                       out of here -- !
                                  (seething)
                       And somehow I'm going to see this
                       place destroyed.

148.   INT.  THE CAVERN - MOMENTS LATER                               148.

       A gaurd passing hears a voice and stops --

                                   INDIANA (O.S.)
                       Ah, sir?  Excuse me --

       The guard turns and looks amazed to see Indy smiling at him from
       the mouth of the tunnel.

                                   INDIANA (Cont'd)
                       Listen, I'm from the union and I'd
                       like to talk about the working
                       conditions here.  Could you step
                       inside a minute?

       Indy smiles again and disappears into the tunnel.  In astonished
       rage, the guard draws his sword and goes after Indy into the tun-
       nel -- there's a pause and then we hear the guard yell!

149.   INT.  THE TUNNEL                                               149.

       Willie flattens against the wall as Indiana catapaults the big
       guard past her back into the mine where he's set upon bu a horde
       of rebellious slave children.

       The kids swarm over the guard like jackalas and we see Short Round
       pull a key from the struggling guard's robe.

                                                               CUT TO:

150.   MONTAGE - THE MINES                                            150.

       A key is twisted and the chains are pulled from kids' legs...

       Elsewhere, more chains are unlocked and rattle free.  Liberated
       kids spill out of the tunnels...

       A guard is tripped and attacked by a horde of ex-slaves...

       In another location, kids wrap captured guards in layers of
       chains...

       High up on a ledge, a fleeing gaurd skids to a stop when he sees
       kids charging at him.  He sees more kids rushing from behind him.
       The guard scrams as he dives off the ledge...

                                                        (END MONTAGE)

151.   INT.  BEHIND THE ALTAR - DAY                                   151.

       Freed children scramble up numerous ladders to escape the mines
       below.  They follow the mass of children moving toward the front
       altar.

152.   INT.  THE ALTAR                                                152.

       On the altar, under the statue of Kali, Willie and Short Round
       are helping Indy and some of the bigger children rip down a
       long wooden panel decorated with hideous Kali figures.

       The childrens' escape is blocked by the chasm separating the
       altar from the deserted sorshippers' area of the temple.  The
       swelling crowds of children push and teeter dangerously on the
       edge of the fire pit.

       Indiana and the others carry the wooden panel through the crowd
       toward the chasm.  They stand it up and when Indy gives thw word
       they drop it --

       The panel crashes across the chasm forming a plank across which
       the children now begin running to safety.

153.   INT.  BEHIND THE ALTAR                                         153.

     The last of the children scramble up the ladders and run toward
       the front of the altar.

154.   INT.  THE ALTAR                                                154.

       The childrens' bare feet stomp across the wooden plank -- below
       them the lava of the fire pit bubbles and shows outbursts of
       flame.

       Indy stares at the plank and sees that it's starting to smoke
       from the intese heat rising up.

       On the far side of the plank, the children safely across scatter
       through the deserted temple toward freedom.

       Willie and Short Round help the last kids out onto the plank --
       Indy sees one child's foot break though the smoldering wood --
       the kid in front pulls the child to safety.

       Willie and Short Round start to go out onto the plank but Indy
       shouts at them --

                                   INDIANA
                       No, wait!

       He runs over and pulls them aside -- he steps out onto the plank
       and takes a few steps to test it -- suddenly the plank bursts
       into flame in the middle.

       Indy takes one more step -- and then the plank breaks!  Indy
       dives back to the ledge of the altar and Willie and Short Round
       grab him and pull him up and the wooden plank plummets into the
       fiery chasm.

                                   WILLIE
                       What're we going to do?!

                                   INDIANA
                       There's got to be another way out.

                                                               CUT TO:

155.   INT.  A TUNNEL                                                 155.

       Indiana, Willie and Short Round run through the deserted mine
       tunnels.  They hear a rumbling noise and Indy leads them down a
       side tunnel.  They stop and peer into a quarry.

156.   INT.  THE QUARRY CAVERN                                        156.

       A large cavern is the depository for the mine cars rolling in
       with loads of rock.  Emaciated children (still unaware of the re-
       volt and the other childrens' escape) break their backs shoving
       the heavily-loaded mine cars.

       Thuggee guards supervise the deadening work, while others oper-
       ate the pulley-and-hoist system used to drag  the cars up the
       sloped dump ramp.

       Behind this operation, a thunderous waterfall cascades into a
       huge cistern.  From there, chutes deply the rushing water to
       power the large conveyor belt below it.

       As the cars rise up the ramp, they tip and spill rocks onto the
       conveyor belt which carries them toward an awesome stone cylinder
       that rolls relentlessly , crushing the rocks into sand.

       From the side tunnel, Indiana watches the noisy operation.

                                   INDIANA
                       Those empty cars have got to go
                       out of the mines.

       Willie and Short Round watch the children push the empty mine
       cars.  The cars gain momentum and roll away down two dark tun-
       nels.

                                   INDIANA (Cont'd)
                       Come on, let's see if we can
                       catch a ride...

       Tey duck out of the tunnel and run for cover behind a slag heap.
       Loaded mine cars roaring down from the mines hurtle past them and
       crash to a stop against the cars in front.

                                   INDIANA (Cont'd)
                       Okay, Shorty -- go!

       He pushes Short Round who darts out after a mine car roars past
       and dodges across the tracks before the next one descends.  Indy
       pushes Willie  into  position and holds her ready --

                                   WILLIE
                       I can't!

                                   INDIANA
                       Go!

       After another car crashes past, Indy shoves her.  Willie runs out
       -- her shoe gets stuck and she freezes in the tracks!  Willie
       sees a rock-filled car blasting down out of a tunnel directly
       toward her!

       Indiana dives, knocking Willie safely to the ground on the other
       side of the tracks -- the heavy car hurtles past and crashes into
       the cars in front.

       Indy pulls Willie behind a massive wooden post holding up the
       dump ramp and they hide from a passing gaurd.

                                   INDIANA
                       We've got to get across to the
                       empty cars.  Wait here until I
                       signal you.

       They watch him run and hurdle a pile of lumber, bound up three
       steps and duck behind a tool shack on the platform.  Indy reaches
       out and grabs one of the passing slave children.

       They see Indy put his hand over the kid's mouth and whisper to
       him.  He releases the kid who sneaks away, alerting the other
       children who start making their escapes into side tunnels.

       Now Indy motions to Short Rounds and Willie to follow.  As they
       start to move out they freeze dead in their tracks and Indy
       motions again angrily --

                                   INDIANA
                       Come on!

       Willie and Short Round see a guard coming up the steps on the
       other side of the platform.  As the man rises he gets taller and
       taller -- until they see it's a Thuggee giant coming up behind
       Indiana.

                                   INDIANA (Cont'd)
                       Come one, what's wrong?

                                   SHORT ROUND
                       Behind you!

       Indiana turns and looks into the bare chest of the seven-foot
       tall guard.  Indy has to look up to see the man's mean-looking
       face.

                                   INDIANA
                       I see the problem...

       Indiana suddenly punches the giant in the stomach -- the giant
       does not flinch, he just belches rudely.

       Indiana growls and winds up to take a killer swing -- he steps
       back, cocks his arm -- and suddenly turns and runs away.

       No dummy, Indy dashes over and picks up a piece of wood.  The
       giant starts toward him.  Indy drops the wood and looks around
       for a much larger piece of wood.

       As the giant stalks toward him, Indiana raises the large piece of
       lumber -- Indy suddenly groans, drops the wood and clutches his
       stomach.  Willie and Short Round looks startled --

                                   WILLIE
                       What happened?

       Short Round shakes his head.  They see Indy recover from the
       spasm as the giant rushes him.  Indy jumps aside, landing on a
       loaded mine car that is passing by.

       The car is being dragged up the dump ramp and the giant jumps out
       onto it after Indiana.  Indy quickly grabs a rock and, as the
       giant rushes him, Indy smashes the rock against the big man's
       skull!

       Unfortunately, it's the rock that shatters and not the skull.
       Indy dives to the other end of the mine car and lifts a large
       boulder.

       Suddenly Indy drops the boulder and grabs him arm, feeling a
       shooting pain again.  Then he yells as he feels yet another stab-
       bing pain in his left leg.

                                   WILLIE
                       What's wrong with him?

       Shorty is convused and worried -- and then he sees something!  He
       looks up and there on a rock-cut balcony over the cavern is the
       little Maharajah!

       The little prince clutches the clay krtya doll that represents
       Indy.  He jabs it in the leg with a long sapphire-tipped turban
       pin.

       On the mine car, Indy yells and grabs his right leg, which
       collapses beneath him.  Short Round takes off.  He dashes under
       the platform toward a bucket-chain carrying spent water back up
       to the cistern.

       Short Round leaps over the pool of water and grabs onto a bucket.
       He rises up on this make-shift elevator toward the rock balcony
       and the malicious little Maharajah.

       Meanwhile, Indy is on the brink of unconsciousness as the giant's
       massive hands throttle his neck.  Indy's head hangs over the end
       of the mine car and suddenly his eyes widen --

       The car with Indy and the giant reaches the peak of the dump ramp
       and its upended -- spilling both of them and a shower of rocks
       down the conveyor belt!

       Down below, Willie dodges wooden pillars and weaves around
       quarry equipment, trying to follow Indy's battle with the giant.
       She trips and swears angrily --

       Willie pushes and empty mine car out of her way -- an empty mine
       car!  She runs back and starts shoving the mine car along the
       rails toward the conveyor belt.

                                   WILLIE
                       I got one!  Indy, I got one!

       Near the waterfall, Short Round ascends on the rising bucket
       chain.  Up on the balcony, the little Maharajah chuckles evilly as
       he watches Indiana on the conveyor belt --

       The Maharajah lifts the clay doll and viciously jabs the pin in
       the back of it!

       On te conveyor, Indiana gets to his feet and then yells as a
       stabbing pain lacerates his back!  He falls and writhed helpless-
       ly as the giant staggers up the rocky conveyor belt toward him.

       Willie shoves the mine car forward.  She sees Indy's desperate
       situation as he's pulled along the conveyor toward the rock
       crusher!

                                   WILLIE
                       Indy, look out!

       She looks up and sees Short Round leap from the bucket-chain onto
       the balcony.  The little Maharajah's eyes glow fiendishly as he
       lifts the clay doll -- and jabs the pin into the doll's face.

       On the conveyor belt, Indy yells agonizingly and clutches his
       stabbed face!  Behind him, rocks explode as they're crushed and
       pulverized by the mammoth roller.

       In front of Indy, the Thuggee giant grabs a pick-axe as the con-
       veyor slides past a tool bin.  The giant approaches Indy with it.

       Short Round dashes across the balcny and tackles the Maharajah.
       They fall and fight like mortal enemies.  Short Round sees the
       little Maharajah's eyes glowing as he punches him in the face.

       Only a few feet away from the rock-smashing roller, Indy is still
       on his back on the conveyor belt, thrashing in pain, feeling the
       Maharajah's pin piercing his face.  The giant raises the pick-axe
       above his head and it about to split Indiana in two!

       On the balcony, the Maharajah drops the doll and Short Round
       dives for it -- he grabs the clay doll and pulls out the pin!

       On the conveyor belt, Indiana is suddenly released from the
       and looks up to see the giant swinging the pick-axe.  Indy rolls
       aside at the last minute!

       The pick-axe cleaves into the conveyor belt and the giant lurches
       forward -- Indy gives him a helpful kick, sending the giant
       flying toward the rock-crusher as Indy jumps off the conveyor
       belt!

       Seeing the huge roller looming in front of him, the giant crawls
       desperately against the movement of the conveyor belt -- but he
       gets snagged!

       The sash around his waist gets caught under the rolling cursher
       and he's dragged back under it feet first.  The Thuggee giant
       screams hideously as his body is rolled over and squashed by the
       enormous stone wheel!

       On the balcony, Short Round is jabbing the pin into the squirming
       little Maharajah.  The little pricne's eyes still glow yellow as
       he hollers --

                                   SHORT ROUND
                       How you like bing pin cushion,
                       Mr. Rajah-ha-ha?

       The little prince rolls on the ground and tries to fight off
       Short Round who keeps jabbing him -- suddenly the Maharajah
       swings and the pin is accidentally rammed clear through his hand!

       Shorty sees the pin sticking through both sides of the kid's
       hand.  The Maharajah stares at his pierced hand, gasping in
       astonishment.

       Short Round notices the yellow glow dying out of the Maharajah's
       eyes -- just as Indy's eyes cleared after he was released from
       Kali's trance.

                                   MAHARAJAH
                       Please -- pull it out!

       Short Round yanks the pin out of the little prince's hand.  The
       Maharajah looks like he's jsut awakened from a bag dream.

                                   SHORT ROUND
                       It was the black sleep of Kali...

                                   MAHARAJAH
                       They made me do evil things...
                       may lord Krishna forgive me.

       Meanwhile, Indy runs along the catwalk above the conveyor belt.
       He jumps and grabs onto a cross-bard -- he kicks out with his feet
       and knocks a quarry guard off the catwalk.

       The guard flies through the air and topples into the sand pit
       where he thrashes around blindly under the sand falling from the
       crusher.

       Across the cavern, Willie shoves the rolling mine car toward the
       balcony.

                                   WILLIE
                       Get down here, Shorty!  I got us
                       a ride!

       Willie shirls as another quarry guard rushes toward her.  She
       yanks the iron brake-handle off the mine car and holds it threat-
       eningly like a baseball bat --

                                   WILLIE (Cont'd)
                       Come on, let's see hoe hand your
                       head is!

       Up on the rock balcony, Short Round lowers himself over the edge.
       The little Maharajah grabs his arm --

                                   MAHARAJAH
                       Please -- listen -- to go out
                       you must take the left tunnel.

       Shorty looks at him and he knows he's telling the truth.

                                   SHORT ROUND
                       Thanks pal.

                                   MAHARAJAH
                       I'm going to try to find the
                       English soldiers.

                                   SHORT ROUND
                       Good luck.

       Short Round slips over the edge and slides down a wet stalactite
       to the floor of the cavern.

       There he finds Willie swinging the brake-handle and smashing the
       guard in the gut.  The man doubles in pain -- Willie kicks his
       putt and he splashes into the pool of water.

                                   WILLIE
                       I don't appreciate being cooked
                       like a french fry!

                                   SHORT ROUND
                       Willie, come on!

       Willie starts pushing the empty mine car with Short Round.

                                   SHORT ROUND (Cont'd)
                       You do pretty good for a girl!

       Across the quarry, Mola Ram and six temple guards run out onto a
       high platform next to the waterfall.  Mola Ram sees Willie and
       Short Round pushing the mine cat.

       Mola Ram shouts to his men -- two of them pull pistols and open
       fire!

       Bullets ricochet off the mine car and Short Round shoves Willie
       to the far side of the car where they both take cover.

       Meanwhile, up on a catwalk, a guard slices a sword through the
       air and Indiana ducks!  The sword slashes into a wooden railing
       and the guard tries frantically to pull it out --

       Indiana slams kis knee up into the guard's stomach and then
       smashes his fist down on his neck -- the man collapses.  Indy
       hears more gunfire.

       Indiana rushes along the catwalk toward the platform above.  He
       edges against the wall below the platform, staying out of sight
       as he unfurls his whip.

       One of Mola Ram's guards fires again from the high platform and
       Indiana lashes the whip -- the whip wraps around the gunman's
       arm and Indy yanks on it --

       The gunman topples through the air and crashes down onto the cat-
       walk.  Indy grabs the gun.  He kicks the guard off the catwalk
       and the man falls into the waterfall pool.

       As the other guards fire down at him, Indiana dodges along the
       catwalk and fires back at them.  A bullet explodes near Mola Ram
       and he ducks back --

       Meanwhile, Short Round and Willie have the mine car rolling and
       they jump into it --

                                   SHORT ROUND
                       Indy!  Hurry!

       Indiana spots the rolling mine car racing across the quarry.  Indy
       takes off and runs along the catwalk -- bullets explode around
       him, splintering wood.  Indy reaches the end of the catwalk --

       Suddenly he dives into the air and catches hold of a block and
       tacke!  Indy skids along the pulley system, sliding down a cable
       toward the mine car in which Short Round and Willie are riding.

       Bullets whiz past as Indiana sails in the air above the speeding
       mine car - when they are in sync, Indy lets go and drops into the
       mine car next to Willie and Short Round!

       Mola Ram rushes forward and watches the speeding mine car rolling
       down the track toward the tunnels --

                                   MOLA RAM
                       They've stolen the Sankara
                       Stones -- they must be stopped!

       In the speeding  mine car, Indy sees the tracks separating in two
       directions -- one back into the quarry, the other toward two tun-
       nels that lead out of the mines.

       Indiana lifts a shovel from the floor of the car and swings it
       just in time -- he hits a switch which CLANGS as they speed by
       and the car is shunted tipsy-turvy onto the track toward the two
       tunnels.

       Willie hangs on as the car tears down the track toward the tunnel
       on the right -- and Short Round looks worried --

                                   SHORT ROUND
                       No, Indy, it's left tunnel.

       But it's too late and they all hold on as the mine car shoots
       donw into the darkness of the echoing tunnel.

157.   INT.  THE TUNNEL                                               157.

       The wind rushes past Indiana as the car descends into the tunnel
       and picks up speed.  Willie hangs on with Short Round -- the mine
       car roars around a curve and flies fater along the rails.

158.   INT.  THE QUARRY                                               158.

       Back in the quarry, Mola Ram supervises the guards as they shove
       empty cars toward the tunnel.  Carrying long Khyber rifles, they
       jump aboard the cars.  The first one rolls into the dark tunnel
       and the second car speeds after it.

159.   INT.  THE TUNNEL ENTRANCE                                      159.

       The two Thuggee cars shoot past, descending into the darkness in
       pursuit of the infidels who stole the Sankara Stones.

160.   INT.  THE TUNNEL                                               160.

       The mine car hurtles past.  Indy sits in front, pulling back on
       the brake-lever to control their speed and keep them from careen-
       ing off the tracks.

       Expecting trouble, Short Round peers over the back end of the
       car.  Willie ducks low, watching the heavy beams flashing danger-
       ously close above their heads.

       Then Willie's eyes go wide and she groans in terror like a girl
       on a roller coaster as the mine car suddenly plunges downward,
       taking their stomachs with it.

       A gunshot rings out and Short Round sees the first Thuggee car
       appear around a curve behind them.  Mola Ram's gunmen start
       blasting.  Bullets ricochet off the mine car and Indy yells back
       to Short Round.

                                   INDIANA
                       Come here and take the brake!

       Short ROund scurries forward and grabs the brake from Indy.

                                   INDIANA (Cont'd)
                       Slow on the curves or we'll fly
                       off the tracks!

                                   SHORT ROUND
                       Read you loud and clear, Indy!

       Short Round grins as he holds the brake -- Willie realized that
       this is Shorty's idea of a good time!

161.   INT.  THE CAVERN                                               161.

       Up in the quarry, gunmen push a third car toward the tunnel, but
       Mola Ram stops them.  He shouts and they turn and look instead
       toward the waterfall and huge cistern....

162.   INT.  THE TUNNEL                                               162.

       Indiana is crouched in the back of the zooming mine bar blasting
       away with the pistol he captured in the quarry.

       A gunman in the car behind returns his fire, the explosions
       lighting up the tunnle walls.

       Indy aims and fires again -- the gunman is hit and knocked back
       in the car.  Another guard with a Khyber rifle moves up to the
       front and starts firing.

       Meanwhile, as the car goes into a hard turn, Short Round rides
       the brake -- beneath the car we see the brake-pad scraping on the
       metal wheel.

       The tunnel gets lower and Indy has to duck under each beam flying
       over and can only pop up to fire between the low beams.

       The rifleman in the car behind is relading.  Then he lifts his
       rifle -- Indy pops up simultaneously and shoots!

       The gunman is hit, his rifle flies up and his head smashes
       against the beam hurtling above!  Screaming horribly, the gunman
       is knocked from the speeding car like a broken doll.

163.   INT.  THE CAVERN                                               163.

       Up in the quarry, Mola Ram's men swing sledge hammers, bashing
       away at the rock supports under the huge water-filled cistern.

164.   INT.  THE TUNNEL                                               164.

       Indiana runs out of bullets.  He sees the car behind getting
       closer.  He tosses the pistol and hits a Thuggee in the head.
       Another Thuggee retrieves Indy's pistol and starts reloading it.

       Suddenly Indy is being shot at by his own gun and he yells to
       Short Round
                                   INDIANA
                       Let up on the brake!

                                   SHORT ROUND
                       What?!

       Indy shoves past Willie and takes the brake level from Shorty.

                                   INDIANA
                       Let her go!  Our only chance is
                       outrunning them!

                                   WILLIE
                       What above the curves?!

       Short Round looks scared as Indy released the brake and the car
       hurtles toward a curve.  They grab the sides of the car as it tips
       precariously.  Behind them, the curve throws the gunmen from side
       to side in the car following.

                                   SHORT ROUND
                       Indy, look out!

       A sharper curve looms ahead and Indy shoves the brake completely
       off!

                                   WILLIE
                       What're you doing?!  We're going
                       too fast!!

       Willie closes her eyes as they rocket toward the curve.  In the
       car behind, the Thugge guard at the brake also shoves the brake
       off -- and looks extremely worried.

       Indy's car hits the curve and the centrifugal force lifts the in-
       side wheels off the rails!

                                   INDIANA
                       Get over on the other side!

       Willie and Short Round jumps over to his side as the car whips
       around the curve!  Indy looks back and sees the car pursuing them
       is also taking the curve at full speed --

       Suddenly the Thuggee car swereves dangerously, the weight shifts
       too much to the outside -- and the car derails!

       The car bounces off the tracks and flies through the air into a
       siding where is CRASHES against a stone wall in an EXPLOSION of
       rock and metal!

       Pieces of debris pommel the drive of the second Thuggee car and
       he quickly grabs for the brake to slow down and avoid the same
       fate!

       In the lead car, Indy smiles smugly as Willie opens her eyes.

                                   INDIANA
                       One down, one to go!

165.   INT.  THE CAVERN ABOVE                                         165.

       Mola Ram's guards continue to bash away with sledge hammers at
       the rock supports under the mammoth cistern.  One of the supports
       starts to crumble --

       From above, we see the cistern list to one side and water laps
       dangerously over the edge as the huge tank creaks and sawsy.

166.   INT.  THE TUNNEL                                               166.

       Indiana and Short Round heft a railroad tie out of th bottom of
       the car and Willie watches them lift it onto the back --

       As gunfire continues to explode from the car behind them, Indiana
       and Short ROund shove the railroad tie off the back of the car --

       The wooden railroad tie falls and bounces back across the tracks.
       The gunmen in the car behind spit it and yell in panic --

       Indy and Willie watch the car behind crash into the railroad tie
       -- but the tie just skids, catches and bounces up and out of the
       way like a huge tumbling matchstick!

                                   WILLIE
                       Anymore ideas...?

                                   INDIANA
                       Yeah -- this time you're gonna
                       help!

167.   INT.  THE CAVERN                                               167.

       The sledgehammers continue -- until two of the rock supports give
       way!  There are shouts as the guards run for cover.

       Mola Ram stands on a platform watching the huge cistern slowly
       keel over -- the noise is incredible as the colossal tank crashes
       to the ground!

       Suddenly a half-million gallons of water explode across the cav-
       cern and surge in a tidal wave toward the tunnels!

168.   INT.  THE TUNNEL                                               168.

       The walls of the tunnel flash past and curves appear suddenly out
       of the darkness as the hair-raising chase continues --

       Short Round and Willie struggle to help Indy lift a large boulder
       from the bottom of the speeding mine car.

       The cars descend again into a stretch of much lower tunnel where
       the beams flash past inches above them.  Indy judges the beams --

                                   INDIANA
                       Okay  -- one -- two -- NOW!

       All three of them groan as they raise the boulder and shove it
       off the back of the car -- ducking instantly to avoid being de-
       capitated by the next beam!

       Looking back, they see the gunmen pop up between the beams -- and
       they see the looks of terror on the gunmen's faces as they see
       the boulder in front of them!

       The Thuggee car hits the boulder and upends!  The guards scream
       horribly as the car tumbles end over end, slamming against the
       tunnel walls, getting ripped to shreds so that finally only
       pieces of metal, wheels and debris fly like a meteorite shower
       down the tunnel!

       Willie whoops for joy and hugs Indy who smiles modestly --

                                   INDIANA
                       Okay, Shorty, hit the brakes!

       Short Round dives for the front of the car and ahppily pulls the
       brake lever -- it doesn't work!  Short Round yanks on it harder
       -- the brake level suddenly breaks off!

                                   SHORT ROUND
                       Indy!!

       Indy sees Short Round holding up the broken brake lever!  Indy
       crawls quickly toward Shorty while Willie holds on for dear life!

       Completely out of control, the car hurtles down a decline into a
       section where the tunnel if larger again --

       Indiana bends over the front of the car and looks underneath.  He
       sees the brake tension hanging loose from the brake-pad.  Indiana
       pulls himself back up and looks at Willie and Short Round.

                                   INDIANA
                       Grab onto me -- I'm going to try
                       and slow us down from underneath!

       Willie looks terrified but helps Short Round grab onto Indy's arm
       and the back of his jacket.  He skips over the front of the car
       and swings a leg underneath --

       Indy is inches above the rails and the rocky ground blurring be-
       neath the car as he tries to kick at the brake-pad.  His feet
       fall and he bumps along, dragged dangerously for a moment --

       Indy manages to find a foothold on the undercarriage of the car.
       As they hold onto him, Indy kicks again and his foot hits the
       brake-pad.  He shoves it and slowly the pad closes against the
       spinning wheel...

                                   WILLIE
                       Oh no!

       Willie and Short Round look up and see that the tunnel is ending
       ahead and the track dead-ends into a stone wall!

                                   INDIANA
                       What's wrong?

       He looks around -- and sees the car rocketing directly toward the
       stone wall!

       Indy's foot starts kicking in high-gear underneath the car -- he
       slams at the brake-pad with all his strength -- the pad screeches
       against the spinning wheeel and starts sparking!

       The car seems to slow as it shoots toward the end of the tunnel.
       Indy groans and pushes hard against the smoking brake-pad.

       The car slows more and more until it runs down the last few yards
       to the dead-end and rolls gently to a stop, just nudgeing Indy's
       back against the wall....

                                   INDIANA
                       Ouch...

       Willie looks faint as Indiana gets to his feet and Shorty jumps
       out of the car.  They help Willie out and she stands shakily --

                                   WILLIE
                       I'm okay -- I'm fine -- I love to
                       flirt with death...

       Indiana sees that the tunnel ahead continues without any more
       tracks.  Then they hear something --

       A strange rumbling sound echoing down the tunnel from behind
       them.  The walls seem to reverberate.  Looking worried, they
       start walking away down the tunnel.

       They walk faster as the noise behind them becomes louder and they
       keep glancing over their shoulders --

                                   WILLIE
                       What's that?...Indy?!

       Indiana isn't sure and he pulls Willie by the arm and all three of
       them start jogging.

       The rumbling behind them sounds increasingly ominous and finally
       they start running full tilt.  They rush down the tunnel and the
       awful noise becomes defening!  Willie looks around again and
       slows suddenly --

       Willie stops dead in her tracks -- paralyzed -- awestruck --
       DOOMED!

       Willie sees a monster wall of water (released from the quarry) as
       it thunders around a curver -- a mammoth tidal wave crashing spec-
       tacularly against the opposite tunnel wall!

       A veritable "tsunami" caroming off the tunnel wall and spewing
       furiously forward like a hydrous Juggernaut!

                                   WILLIE
                                 (frozen in
                                  her tracks)
                       Oh... shit...

       Indiana and Short Round notice that Willie's sloed and they stop
       running -- they also see the cataclysm of water crashing down the
       tunnel toward them.

       Indy runs back and grabs Willie.  All three of them take off,
       running faster than they've ever run in their lives!

       The tidal wave smashes forward, booming behind them and Indiana
       realizes quickly that they're going to lose this race.  Suddenly
       he sees a small side-tunnel in a bend ahead --

                                   INDIANA
                       There!  Dive!

       They lunge toward the hole and Short Round dives in it first.
       Indiana shoves Willie into the hole and jumps in after her just
       as the colossal tidal wave explodes  past!

169.   INT.  THE CHUTE                                                169.

       The small tunnel drops precipitously and they slide down, shower-
       ed by the small side-current of water that's broken off from the
       main force.

170.   INT.  A LARGE TUNNEL                                           170.

       They rolls and tumble out of the small chute into a larger tunnel.
       The roar of the tidal wave sounds distant and receding as they
       catch their breath.

                                   INDIANA
                       Lucky I found a short cut.  Look,
                       there's a light at the end of the
                       tunnel...

       Suddenly an EXPLOSION!  They turn and see the thundering tidal
       wave crashing around a curve and cascading down the tunnel behind
       them again!

                                   WILLIE
                       Some short cut!

       They all holler in unison and start running like bats out of hell
       toward the daylight.  The towering wall of water surges relent-
       lessley after them --

       The tidal wave looms up to annihilate them as they race to the
       mouth of the tunnel -- and Willie SCREAMS!  Indy grabs her and
       all three of the flail their arms to keep from losing their bal-
       ance!

171.   EXT.  THE TUNNEL EXIT - DAY                                    171.

       The tunnel exits midway up a cliff and the three totter precari-
       ously on the brink looking down at a 300 foot sheer drop to
       a gorge below!

       Indiana swings Willie onto a narrow ledge on one side and pushes
       Short Round after her -- he jumps himself to the other side just
       as the tidal wave crashes past them!

       The water bursts out of the tunnel -- the gusher spews forth from
       the cliffside into the air as if Hoover Dam just broke lose!

       Short Round and Willie balance on the narrow ledge on one side of
       the geyser -- Indy is perches on the ledge on the other side of
       the incredible eruption of water.

       Willie gets vertigo looking down into the gorge where the water
       crashes at the bottom.  There crocodiles are disturbed and
       slither angrily.

       Indy looks up and sees a rope bridge swinging about twenty feet
       above Willie and Short Round.  Indy shouts across the blasting
       water --

                                   INDIANA
                       Willie -- the bridge!  Climb up
                       to the bridge!

       Willie looks frightened.

                                   SHORT ROUND
                       Nothing to it -- follow me!

       He edges along the narrow ledge toward the bridge and Willie
       follows him.  Once under the bridge, they start climbing up the
       rocks to it.

       Meanwhile, Indiana is scaling the cliff face to get over the
       water geyser to the other side.  He grabs at scrub brush and
       finds a few perilous footholds as he makes his way to the bridge.

172.   EXT.  THE ROPE BRIDGE                                          172.

       Willie and Short Round pull themselves up at the end of the
       bridge.  Behind them a dark tunnel runs back into the mines.
       What's in front of them is hardly more reassuring --

       The rope bridge across the gorge is a century old and defintely
       wasn't built by army engineers.  Laying across the two bottom
       rope-spans, worm-eaten and moldy boards offer risky footings.

       Vertical side ropes connect the bottom rope-spans to the two up-
       per ropes that constitute the dangerous hand-railings.

       Short Round steps tentatively out onto the bridge.  It holds him
       and he turns and smiles at Willie --

                                   SHORT ROUND
                       Easy like pie!  Kid's stuff!

       Suddenly the board under him breaks! Willie grabs Short Round
       before he falls into the abyss!  Looking pale and less cocky,
       Short Round starts out again and Willie follows his carefully.

       They continue stepping across the bridge cautiously, a feat made
       more difficult by the bridge's constant swaying and the hear-
       stopping up and down movement.

       Behind them, Indy finally pulls himself up from under the bridge.
       He stands up and sees Willie and Short Round halfway across
       already.  Then he hears something and turns quickly -- he takes
       his whip out and ducks to the side of the tunnel as two Thuggee
       guards rush out.

       Indy cracks the whip, catching the first guard around the neck --
       the guard spills forward and trips the second guard.  The first
       man tries to stand but Indiana kicks him in the head.

       The second guard gets to his feet and seings his sword -- Indy
       ducks, slams him in the stomach and dives for the first guard's
       sword.  He grabs it and rolls aside quickly as the second gaurd
       attempts to slice him in two!

       Indy gets to his feet and immediately finds himself about to en-
       gage in a sword duel with the enraged Thuggee guard.  Indy looks
       at the unfamiliar sword, hefts it, and tries to quickly decide
       the best way to use it --

       Suddenly the guard shouts and charges.  Indy decides shouting
       must be the "de rigueur" technique and shouts back loudly -- the
       two swords CLANG and spark as the duel erupts.

       Indy flails and feints and the Thuggee guard lunges and slashes.
       Indy finally gains the upper hand and dispatches the Thuggee
       guard who slumps defeated into the dirt.

       Keeping the sword, Indy starts out onto the bridge, walking as
       quickly as possible across the rickety span.  He hears shouting
       ahead and looks worried then temple guards appear at the far end
       of the bridge.

       The guards suprise Willie and Shorty as they finally get across
       the bridge.  Struggling   futilely with the guards, Willie shouts
       at Indiana --

                                   WILLIE
                       Indy -- looks out behind you!

       Indy sees more Thuggee guards rushing out of the tunnel behind
       him.  He turns and sees two of the tmeple guards who captured
       Willie and Short Round coming across the bridge in front of him.

       Indy stands helpless in the middle of the swaying bridge with
       guards approaching from both sides, and nothing but heaven above
       and the rocky gorge hundreds of feet below!

       A wind comes up and the High Priest, Mola Ram, appears on the far
       end of the bridge.  He stands with the guards who hold Willie and
       Short Round.

       The wind whips around Indy and he staggers unsteadily on the
       swaying bridge as he watches Mola Ram --

                                   INDIANA
                       Let my friends go!

       Mola Ram shouts in Hindi and the guards start to move toward Indy
       from both sides of the bridge.

                                   INDIANA (Cont'd)
                       That's far enough!

                                   MOLA RAM
                       You are in no position to give
                       orders, Dr. Jones.

       Indiana indicates the bag over his shoulder --

                                   INDIANA
                       You want the stones, let them go
                       and call off your guards!

       Mola Ram motions and the guards move farther out on both sides of
       the bridge -- suddenly Indiana swings the sword and it cuts into
       one of the bottom rope-spans!

       The rope is half-severed and frays slowly under the tension!

                                   MOLA RAM
                       Impressive, Dr. Jones. But I
                       don't believe you would kill
                       yourself!

       Mola Ram motions again the his guards (looking more nervous now)
       step farther out onto the bridge, mvoing closer to Indy from both
       sides.

       Indy swings the sword again, cutting into the other rope-span!
       It, too, is now partially severed and frays slowly.  The bridge
       jolts and Indy and the guards sway precariously!

       Suddenly Mola Ram shoves Short Round out onto the bridge.  The
       High Priest draws a dagger and pushes Willie onto the swaying
       span, holding the knife behind them both.

                                   MOLA RAM (Cont'd)
                       Your friends will die with you!

       In different times this would be called a Mexican stand-off
       Indiana looks at the guards in front and behind him.  He sees
       Willie and Short Round out on the bridge now with Mola Ram at
       their backs.

                                   INDIANA
                       Then I guess we're all going to
                       take a big dive!

       Indy and Short Round's eyes meet -- and the kid realizes that his
       hero isn't kidding.  Willie looks at Shout Round anxiously -- she
       notices that Shorty is surreptitiously wrapping his foot around a
       rope support.

       Petrified, Willie also secretly wraps her foot around a rope and
       does likewise with her arm --

                                   MOLA RAM
                       Give me the stones!

                                   INDIANA
                       Mola Ram -- you're about to meet
                       Kali -- in Hell!

       Indiana swings the sword with all his might -- it whooshes
       through the air and slashes clear through the top and bottom
       ropes --!

       Immediately Mola Ram's guards start to flee in panic -- too late!
       Indiana swings the sword again and the two ropes on the other
       side are severed --

       The rope bridge is sheared in two!  It breaks in the middle and
       both halves fall apart!  The guards scream horribly in the air as
       they plunge down into the rocky gorge!

       Willie and Short Round cling to their established footholds and
       fall with the bridge toward the wall of the gorge.  Mola Ram
       spills forward, clutching desperately at the ropes and slats --

       Below them, Indiana has latched onto a rope and swings with the
       bridge as it hits the gorge wall and hangs vertically now, dang-
       ling from its moorings at the top.

       There's an instant of suspended animation as all who remain alive
       realize they are alive.  Short Round and Willie cling near the
       top of the now vertical bridge.

       Below them, Mola Ram clutches onto one of the main ropes while
       directly above him the last of his guards holds on for dear life.

       Short Round and Willie struggle upwards, clutching ropes and
       stepping on slats.  Finally, Short Round heaves himself up onto
       solid ground and turns to help Willie up.

       Meanwhile, dangling below on the bridge, Indy reaches up and
       grabs Mola Ram's leg.  The High Priest kicks and tries to break
       Indy's grip.  He kicks again and smashes Indy in the face.

       Indy won't let go.  Suddenly the High Priest reaches up and grabs
       his own Thuggee guard and yanks his down by the front of his
       shirt --

       Mola Ram shoves the luckless guard down onto Indy, trying to
       dislodge him by sacrificing the screaming Thuggee.  Indy manages
       to hang on.  The Thuggee is less fortunate and falls screaming to
       his death.

       Then Mola Ram looks across the gorge and yells.  Indy sees a dozen
       of the last Thuggee guards streaming out of the tunnel -- only
       to be stranded on the far side of the now bridgeless gorge.

       Indy starts climbing up after Mola Ram again.  He grabs at the
       back of Mola Ram's robe and pull him down.  Slipping, Mola Ram
       turns and it's Indy's chance to punch Mola Ram in the face.

       Mola Ram's eyes are glowing yellow and he's shouting incoherent-
       ly.  He grabs the strap of Indy's shoulder bag and stamps on In-
       dy's hand -- Indy falls!

       Indiana slips downward, scrambling to catch hols of something --
       meanwhile, Mola Ram now has the bag with the Sankara Stones.

       Indy finally stops his downward slide and dangles dangerously
       near the bottom of the bridge.

       Across the gorge, the Thuggee guards run up a path to a small
       gove of trees growing on a plateau above the gorge.  The guards
       have bows and arrows and take firing positions --

       At the top of the bridge, Mola Ram keeps climbing until rocks
       start poundinghim from above -- Willie and Short Round pely him
       with rocks which he tries to block with his arm.

       Indiana starts to climb again, using all his strength.  He
       reaches for a wooden slat -- suddenly a flaming arrow smashes
       into the wood!

       Indy turns in amazement and sees more flaming arrows rocketing
       across the chasm directy for him!

       Across the gorge, by the grove of trees, a Thuggee priest yells
       orders to the archers who continue to launch the flaming arrows.

       Indiana crawls up as the bridge starts to burn from the continu-
       ing bursts of fiery arrows.  At the top, Mola Ram reaches up des-
       perately for a hand old -- Willie smashes his hand with a rock!

       The High Priest yells in pain and slips down to where Indy slugs
       him again in the face!  They struggle as the fire burns up from
       beneath them.

       On the cliff above the fallen bridge, Willie watches the fire
       rising toward Indy and Mola Ram as they fight.  Short Round turns
       and sees something --

                                   SHORT ROUND
                       Willie, look!

       They see horses galloping through a narrow pass -- the British
       cavalry is returning.  Captain Blumburtt and the first troops draw
       up their forses and dismount quickly.

       A fussilade of flaming arrows force the British to take cover --
       they quickly start firing back at the Thuggees with rifles.

       As the battle above the gorge continues, Indy and Mola Ram fight
       below on the dangling bridge --

       Indiana sees the High Priest's eyes begin glowing and he hisses
       insanely.  Mola Ram's hand thrusts out toward Indiana's chest and
       Indy yells in pain --

       Indy looks down and writhes terrified as he sees Mola Ram's hand
       starting to enter his chest (as it entered the victim's chest
       during the temple sacrifice)!

       Mola Ram's finger are inching into Indy's body --  Indy clutches
       at Mola Ram's piercing hand, trying to keep the deadly fingers
       away from his heart.

       Slowly, Indy is able to push Mola Ram's hand away and his fingers
       withdraw from Indy's chest.  Indiana suddenly slugs the High
       Priest in the face and grabs for the bag of Sankara Stones --

                                   MOLA RAM
                       No, the stones are mine!

                                   INDIANA
                       You're betrayed Shiva. *(He re-
                       peats in Sanskrit Sankara's warn-
                       ing)

       As Indy pronounces the magical words, the bag begins glowing and
       starts to burn Mola Ram as he clutches it -- the stones begin to
       spill out of the bag and the High Priest grabs from them.

                                   INDIANA (Cont'd)
                       *(He repeats Sankara's warning
                        in Sanskrit)

       The blazing stones sear Mola Ram's flesh and he screams in pain.
       The light suddenly dies in his eyes and for one instant he looks
       at Indy as if awakened from a nightmare --

       Mola Ram loses his balance and Indy grabs for the stones.  He
       manages to clutch only one of them as Mola Ram screams and falls!

       Indy sees the stone in his hand suddenly cool.  He watches Mola
       Ram plummeting downward into the chasm and finally crashing into
       the jagged rocks at the bottom.

       The irritated crocodiles are disturbed once more -- but soon wel-
       come the meal that just dropped in.  Jaws flash and teeth rip at
       the High Priest's likeless corpse.

       And Indy's bag with the Sankara Stones sinks into the murkly cur-
       rent and disappears down the river ...

173.   EXT.  THE CLIFF                                                173.

       Indiana crawls up the burning bridge and Willie and Short Round
       reach for him at the top.  They pull him up onto the cliff and
       they all look around exhausted --

       Across the gorge, more British troops emerge from the mine tun-
       nels to subdue the remaining Thuggee guards on that side.

       Finally the little Maharajah comes out of the dark mine tunnel.
       He sees Short Round across the gorge -- and bows to thank him for
       his help.  On the other side, Short Round waves his cap, saluting
       him back.

       Willie stands at the edge of the gorge looking down into the riv-
       er far below.

                                   WILLIE
                       I guess Mola Ram got what he
                       wanted.

                                   INDIANA
                       Not quite.

       She sees Indy reach into his pocket.  He pulls something out
       slowly -- as she watches he reveals a crystal stone --

                                   INDIANA (Cont'd)
                       The last Sankara Stone.

       Short Round watches Willie take it carefully from Indiana.  She
       gazes at it and looks delighted --

                                   WILLIE
                       And the diamond hidden inside...

       Willie holds the stone up to the sun and it sparkles and flashes

                                                               CUT TO

174.   EXT.  THE MAYAPORE HILLS - DAY                                 174.

       The sun flares and silhouettes three figures coming over a
       hilltop.  Behinf them we see more smaller silhouettes appearing
       over the rise.

       Indiana, Willie and Short Round walk back down the dirt road into
       Mayapore -- followed by a multitude of children returning to
       their homeland.

       Willie looks at the changed landscape and seems astonished:  the
       barren countryside has been reborn.  They see streams flowing
       beneath green trees, flowers blooming and peasants harvesting
       golden grain in the fields.

175.   EXT.  MAYAPORE VILLAGE                                         175.

       Indiana, Willie and Short Round lead the children down the
       village road.   Ahead they see villagers rebuilding their primi-
       tive dwellings.

       Now they hear shouts of joy from the peasants.  The children
       returning home start running to meet their parents who are rush-
       ing out to greet them.

       There is laughter and tears as families are reunited.  Indiana
       sees the old shaman approaching with the chieftain and the
       village elders.

       The shaman touches his fingers to his forehead and bows.  The
       three travelers return his greeting and the shaman is quite moved
       as he speaks to Indiana --

                                   SHAMAN
                       We know you are coming back --
                                (indicating the
                                 countryside)
                       -- when life returns to our village.

                                   WILLIE
                       It's a real miracle.

                                   SHAMAN
                       Now you see the magic of the
                       "rock" you bring back.

       The old shaman smiles wisely at Indiana.  Indy takes the stone
       out of his bag and unwraps it.

                                   INDIANA
                       Yes, I've seen its power

       Willie watches the shaman take it reverently and bow to them.
       The shaman joins the elders and they walk to the village's small
       sacred mound.  Indy and Willie stay back.  They see him kneel and
       replace the stone in its niche.

                                   INDIANA
                       The last Sankara Stone.

                                   WILLIE
                       And they don't even know what
                       it really is.

                                   INDIANA
                                (smiling at her)
                       Well, you didn't get your prince,
                       and there goes your diamond.

                                   WILLIE
                       You didn't do so well yourself.
                       Finding that stone could've got-
                       ten you all the fortune and
                       glory you were talking about.

                                   INDIANA
                       It's still a long way to Delhi.
                       Who knows what might happen.

       She looks at him like he's crazy.

                                   WILLIE
                       Oh no, I'm finding a native guide
                       who knows the way.  No more de- 
                       tours for me, thank you Dr. Jones.

       She turns and starts walking away continuing to complain --

                                   WILLIE (Cont'd)
                       If you think I'm going to Delhi
                       or anyplace else with you, after
                       all the trouble you've gotten me
                       into...

       Suddenly the bullwhip CRACKS and wraps around her waist.  Star-
       tled Willie looks angry as Indiana reels her in, pulling her to-
       ward him and into his arms.  But when he finally kisses her, she
       doesn't seem to mind at all...

       Short Round shakes his head, but looks sort of pleased.  When he
       turns away, his face lights up!

       Short Round runs toward the sunset, toward the three elephants
       being brought back to the village.  The baby elephant starts
       walking faster, as if he recognizes Short Round running out to
       meet him...




                                   THE END

                                                                        FIRST DRAFT
                                                                        2/10/95







        UNDERWATER - CLOSE-UP: A brightly colored FLY, attached to a dangling,
        fishing line. A large SALMON swims to the fly. The salmon EXAMINES the
        fly, deciding whether or not to bite.

        CAMERA PANS UPWARD, tracking the line and moving OUT OF THE WATER. We
        PASS the crooked boards of a small ROWBOAT and continue to PAN UPWARD.
        A MAN reclines in the boat. NAPPING. His hands gently grip a WOODEN
        FISHING POLE. He is handsomely dressed in SPORTSMAN'S trousers and a
        blazer. His green, tweed fishing hat is lowered OVER HIS FACE. Its
        brim is filled with various types of TACKLE and BAIT.

        It is DUSK. A warm, SUMMER evening. The boat rests on a calm lake,
        surrounded by MOORS. Thick night FOG has begun to settle over the
        entire area.

        TITLE: SCOTLAND. 1937.

        Suddenly, the man's fishing line becomes TAUT. The wooden pole
        BUCKLES. The man STIRS. He SITS UP, moving the hat from his face.
        CAMERA DOLLIES FORWARD, into a CLOSE UP of the man. It is INDIANA
        JONES. His face ANXIOUS... HOPEFUL... Indy begins to REEL in his
        catch.

        A VOICE interrupts. In the DISTANCE.

                                        MACGOWAN (O.S.)
                        Doctor Jones!... Doctor Jones !...

        Indy TURNS to the direction of the sound, still STRUGGLING with the
        line.

        INDIANA'S POV

        Countless ORANGE FLAMES sparkle across the moors. The TORCHES are
        being carried by several members of a small village. The VILLAGERS are
        gathered behind a group of SIX POLICEMEN. The policemen are headed by
        INSPECTOR ANGUS MACGOWAN, a plump, balding fellow, with a veiny,
        bulbous nose, beady green eyes and a thick, curled red moustache.
        MacGowan SHOUTS to Indy.

                                        MACGOWAN
                        We need your assistance!

                                        INDIANA
                                (struggling with the
                                fishing line)
                        C'mon, Mac... It's the first bite
                        I've had all week...

                                        MACGOWAN
                        Please... It's very importantl...

        Indiana STRUGGLES a bit longer with the line. But his conscience
        prevails and Indy DROPS the fishing pole. With a GRUMBLE, he ROWS back
        to shore.

        THE MOORS - SEVERAL MINUTES LATER

        NIGHT has fallen. It is very DARK. A RELUCTANT Indiana has joined the
        Inspector and the other Policemen. They LEAD the townspeople along the
        foggy moors. Slowly, carefully, the villagers SEARCH... CREEPING...
        their faces tense, many unable to hide their FEAR. A summer wind sends
        an eeire HOWL whistling through the night air. Blue MOONLIGHT bathes
        the moors, creating stark, frightening shadows.

        An expression of ANGER and ANNOYANCE cover Indiana's face. He GRUMBLES
        to MacGowan.

                                        INDIANA
                        Do you value our friendship, Mac?

                                        MACGOWAN
                        More than me' nightly pint.

                                        INDIANA
                        Then this better not be some wild
                        goose chase...

                                        MACGOWAN
                        T'ain't wild geese we're after,
                        Doctor Jones. You got me' word on
                        that...
                                (sincere)
                        ...and a MacGowan's word is truer
                        than an angel's kiss!

        There is a sudden SCREAM! One of the villagers STUMBLES UPON
        something. Everyone GATHERS around the villager.

        A CORPSE lies before them. The body has a somewhat rubbery appearance,
        as if all of its bones had been BROKEN. The man's pale, greenish face
        is FROZEN in a hideous grimace. Indiana and MacGowan STARE in shock.
        The villagers WHISPER among themselves.

                                        YOUNG MAN
                        Scotty Ferguson.

                                        OLD WOMAN
                        He's the eighth.

                                        MAN
                        Just like the others...all his bones
                        busted...crushed...

                                        OLD MAN
                        Whatever's killin' people around
                        here ain't human.

                                        WOMAN
                                (pointing OFFSCREEN)
                        It's there! Again!

        The woman SHOOTS FORWARD. The police and the townspeople are right
        BEHIND her. A curious Indiana FOLLOWS.

        The woman stops in a CLEARING. She is POINTING ahead. The villagers
        SURROUND her. They STARE ahead, in the direction where the woman
        points. Nearly a mile in the distance, WE SEE

        AN ANCIENT SCOTTISH CASTLE.

        An enormous, 16th CENTURY stone structure. Tall, forboding towers,
        lined with menacing GARGOYLES, pierce the night sky. The castle
        appears DESERTED. Its interior is completely DARK, save for a small,
        flickering CANDLELIGHT. It burns from the castle's UPSTAIRS WINDOW.

        Indiana gives a QUESTIONING look to MacGowan. The Inpector points to
        the castle's upstairs window.

                                        MACGOWAN
                        That light...only burns after a
                        murder's been committed.

                                        INDIANA
                                (nods, turning toward
                                the castle)
                        Let's go.

        The villagers STEP BACK. Eyes wide with FEAR. Murmers of 'Ain't goin'
        in there', 'Nor I', 'Got me a wife and kids', are heard from the
        TERRIFIED villagers. Indiana TURNS to MacGowan. Even the usually
        sturdy Inspector is TREMBLING. But MacGowan turns to his men, FORCING
        himself to be strong.

                                        MACGOWAN
                        Well... Ahmmmm...that is what we're
                        here for...eh, men?...ah...
                                (points to men)
                        Hennesey... Galbraith...
                        Bottomley... You're comin' with us.

        As each man is called, the color LEAVES his face. The chosen policemen
        RELUCTANTLY join the Inspector and Indiana, as they begin walking
        TOWARD the castle. The remaining villagers and policemen STAY BEHIND.
        WAITING. The elderly woman KISSES the crucifix that hangs from her
        neck. She STARES at the departing men.

                                        ELDERLY WOMAN
                        May God help them.

                                                                        CUT TO:

        THE CASTLE DOORS.

        Two enormous wooden doors, covered with intricate CARVINGS of demons,
        serpents and gargoyles, adorn the castle entrance. Indiana and the
        police STAND before the doors. Indy GLANCES to the upstairs window.
        The candle still FLICKERS.

        A long, wooden bar, carved into the shape of a SERPENT, is fastened
        through the metal door latches. It BLOCKS the castle entrance. Indy
        and the Policemen GRAB HOLD of the bar. It is extremely HEAVY. Using
        all of their strength, they manage to slide the bar OUT of the door
        latches. It hits the ground with a THUD, rolling down the castle
        stairs.

        Indiana CLUTCHES the rusty, metal door handles. He PULLS. HARD. The
        doors CREAK. GROAN. And slowly OPEN. A thick CLOUD OF DUST explodes
        from inside of the castle. It BLOWS OUT all of the torches.

        Behind the open doors, there is only TOTAL DARKNESS. Indiana ENTERS,
        holding the flashlight before him. The Policemen exchange FRIGHTENED
        glances. Inspector MacGowan SHOVES them through the open doors.

        INT. CASTLE

        Indy's flashlight BEAM glazes over the castle's interior. It is a
        STONE PALACE. FILLED with elaborate, antique furnishings, macabre
        sculptures and oil paintings. The place is bathed in DUST. Thick
        COBWEBS fill each corner. It is extremely COLD. The men's breaths are
        VISIBLE. Hennesey RUBS his folded arms.

                                        HENNESEY
                        It's deathly cold in 'ere. How could
                        a human bein' survive?...

        Hearing this, the other Policemen exchange TERRIFIED glances. Indiana
        shines his flashlight to a TWISTING, STONE STAIRCASE. The staircase
        spirals upward along a far wall, leading to the SECOND FLOOR. A FAINT
        GLIMMER of light emanates from the top of the stairs. Indiana moves
        FORWARD. The Policemen FOLLOW.

        Indiana ASCENDS the stairs. SLOWLY. SILENTLY. Toward the LIGHT.
        MacGowan and the others are directly BEHIND Indy. As he makes his way
        to the top, Indiana examines the bizarre OIL PAINTINGS that line the
        wall. There are various PORTRAITS and LANDSCAPES, depicting everything
        from MILITARY BATTLES to SUNDAY PICNICS. But the unsettling quality of
        the pictures, is that they each feature the same white haired, ELDERLY
        MAN. Indy COMMENTS to Mac.

                                        INDIANA
                        This guy's got one hell of an ego.

                                        MACGOWAN
                        Baron Seamus Seagrove III. Some say
                        'e walks the moors every midnight...
                        others claim e's been dead for
                        years...

        Indy arrives at the TOP OF THE STAIRS. His hand rests on a SCULPTURE
        that is part of the bannister. The sculpture is a bust of BARON
        SEAGROVE. Indiana makes his way to the first doorway, where the LIGHT
        emanates. The door is WIDE OPEN. A THICK COBWEB covers the entrance.
        Indy WIPES away the web, and ENTERS the room. The Policemen DRAW their
        pistols. They FOLLOW.

        INT. ROOM

        A BEDROOM. Deserted, except for a few pieces of elaborate, ancient
        FURNITURE and a large CANOPY BED. Everything in the room is CAKED with
        dust and cobwebs...save for the burning CANDLE. It RESTS on the
        windowsill, in a sparkling, sterling silver holder. It bathes the room
        in ORANGE LIGHT.

        Indiana walks TOWARD the candle. Arm outstreched, he prepares to LIFT
        it. The Policeman WATCH. SHIVERING. SILENT. Tightly gripping their
        PISTOLS. Indy's fingers are INCHES from the candlestick. SUDDENLY...

        There is a LOUD WHOOSH! The candle GOES OUT! Indiana DROPS his
        flashlight. There is TOTAL DARKNESS. We hear the distant, MANICAL
        LAUGH of a man. It ECHOES through the castle. Indy retrieves the
        flashlight, clicking it back ON. The candle has DISAPPEARED! The laugh
        has SOBSIDED.

        MacGowan LOOKS at his men. A TROOBLED look covers the Inspector's
        face. MacGowan's eyes DART about the room. Hennesy is GONE!

                                        MACGOWAN
                        Hennesey?... Hennesey?...

                                        GALBRAITH
                                (panic)
                        'E was standin' right 'ere! Just a
                        second ago... Standin' right beside
                        me!...

        THE SOOND OF A BELL! A thick, dull RINGING! In the DISTANCE! It sends
        a CHILL through the men. Indiana DARTS out of the room. FOLLOWING the
        sound. The Policemen are right BEHIND HIM.

        INT. CASTLE

        Indy and the Police HURRY down the stairs. The ringing bell CONTINUES.
        MacGowan is CALLING for Hennesey. Indy DASHES to a door along the far
        wall. He OPENS it. It leads into a DARK BASEMENT. The sound of the
        ringing bell echoes from INSIDE. Indiana ENTERS, motioning for the
        others to FOLLOW.

        INT. BASEMENT

        A decrepit, narrow, wooden STAIRWAY leads into the basement. Indy
        holds tightly to his FLASHLIGHT. The Policemen are CLUSTERED behind
        him, taking each step with extreme caution. The boards CREAK and GROAN
        with their every move.

        MacGowan LEANS to his side, calling for Hennesey. MacGowan's weight
        causes the rotted bannister to SNAP IN TWO! He LOSES his footing!
        FALLING off the side of the stairs! Indiana's arm SHOOTS OUT! GRABBING
        HOLD of MacGowan's collar. Indy PULLS MacGowan back to SAFETY.
        MacGowan CATCHES his breath. SHAKING.

                                        MACGOWAN
                        Thanks for catchin' me.

                                        INDIANA
                        I'd rather be catchin' trout.

        They CONTINUE down the stairs, arrivifig at the bottom. It is a large,
        MUSTY STONE BASEMENT. The slimy walls are covered with a GREEN MOSS.
        There are several DOORS along the basement wall. The sound of the
        ringing bell is much LOUDER down here.

        Indiana moves to the FIRST DOOR. He REACHES for the handle. The
        Policemen DRAW their pistols. Indy OPENS the door. A LARGE OBJECT
        SHOOTS OUT FROM INSIDE! Rolling TOWARD the men! The policemen FIRE
        their guns. SEVERAL SHOTS ring out. The object comes to a STOP. A DEEP
        RED LIQUID pours out onto the floor. Indy DIPS his finger into the
        liquid. He TASTES.

                                        INDIANA
                        Interesting blood type...

        The Policemen STARE. WIDE EYED. Indy SMILES.

                                        INDIANA
                        Cabernet sauvignon. 1897.

        Indy's flashlight beam shines ahead, ILLUMINATING the 'mysterious
        object', a WINE BARREL. And inside the room, is a deserted WINE
        CELLAR. Suddenly, a LOUD CREAK echoes through the basement. Galbraith
        CRIES OUT.

                                        GALBRAITH
                                (pointing OFF SCREEN)
                        Look!

        Everyone TURNS. A large STONE DOOR, built into the wall, slowly OPENS.
        Indy and the police stare in AMAZEMENT. The door STOPS. Wide OPEN. A
        FLICKERING LIGHT glimmers from inside. Indiana WALKS to the opening.
        He PEERS into the opening. The Police stay a FEW STEPS behind.

        BEHIND THE DOOR

        A FAMILY CRYPT. Stone COFFINS, with glass covered tops, line the crypt
        walls. Macabre, ghastly RELIGIOUS STATUES decorate the room. Countless
        DEATH MASKS cover the ceiling, all carved with that same frighteningly
        familiar face... BARON SEAGROVE!

        CAMERA DOLLIES to the far corner of the crypt. It STOPS on a CLOSE-UP
        of the CANDLESTICK! The EXACT candle from upstairs! Still BURNING! It
        rests on one of the coffin's GLASS TOPS.

        A TREMBLING MacGowan steps back, away from the crypt. Be BLURTS an
        order to his men.

                                        MACGOWAN
                        Galbraith... You come with me! We'll
                        search for Hennesey... Out here!
                        Bottomley... You go with Doctor
                        Jones...
                                (finger shaking, points
                                to inside of crypt)
                        In there.

        MacGowan and Galbraith nearly fall over each other as they SCRAMBLE
        away from the crypt. The two DASH OFF into another section of the
        basement. Indy SHAKES his head. He ENTERS the crypt. A reluctant and
        very frightened Bottomley FOLLOWS.

        INT. CRYPT

        Indy's flashlight beam dances across the glass COFFIN TOPS. Decayed
        CORPSES smile from inside, their hands tightly clutching crucifixes.
        Bottomley is HORRIFIED by the sights. Indiana continues AHEAD. He
        PASSES the burning candle, moving further into the darkness of the
        crypt. The shivering Bottomley stays directly BEHIND Indy. With their
        every step, the bell's ringing grows LOUDER... LOUDER...

        Indiana and Bottomley arrive in a circular CHAMBER, located at the far
        end of the crypt. Here, the ringing bell is nearly DEAFENING. The
        sound echoes from ABOVE. We are on the floor of the BELL TOWER.
        Indiana SHINES his flashlight UPWARD. The beam stops on a RINGING BELL
        that hangs SEVERAL FEET in the air. Inside of the bell, dangling by
        his feet, is the DEAD BODY of

        HENNESEY! He has REPLACED THE BELL CLAPPER! His body SWINGS back and
        forth. It SLAMS into the sides of the bell. Causing the DULL RINGING.

        Bottomley SCREAMS. Indiana GRABS Bottomley's arm.

                                        INDIANA
                        Let's get outta' here.

        Indy and Bottomley TURN to the crypt door. It begins to CLOSE! The two
        men DASH FORWARD. The door CONTINUES to close. Indy and Bottomley are
        only INCHES away...when the door SLAMS SHUT! They PUSH and KICK at the
        door. NO GOOD. It WON'T BUDGE. A PANICKED Bottomley calls for help.

                                        BOTTOMLEY
                        Inspector MacGowan! Galbraith! Open
                        the door!

        Using his flashlight, Indy SCANS the door, looking for a CRACK,
        another way OUT. Indy NUDGES Bottomley.

                                        INDIANA
                                (motioning to candle)
                        I need more light.

        Bottomley HURRIES to the candle. He REACHES OUT. There is a LOUD
        WHOOSH! The candle flame GOES OUT! Followed by TOTAL DARKNESS! Indy
        TURNS from the door.

                                        INDIANA
                        Bottomley?...

        NO answer. Indy SHINES his flashlight toward the area. The candle is
        GONE. There is NO SIGN of Bottomley. Indiana takes a STEP FORWARD.

                                        INDIANA
                        Bottomley?...

        AGAIN, no answer. Indy SWEEPS the flashlight beam across the room. It
        PASSES one of the coffins...then SHOOTS BACK! Indy is met with a
        SHOCKING SIGHT!

        BOTTOMLEY LIES INSIDE THE COFFIN! DEAD! His face twisted in a GHOULISH
        SMILE. All of his bones BROKEN. His hands are wrapped around a
        CRUCIFIX. Indy STARES in horror. There is a SOUND. FOOTSTEPS. There is
        SOMEONE ELSE in here. Indy's flashlight beam DARTS around the crypt.
        There is NO SIGN of anyone.

                                        INDIANA
                        Who is it?... Who's there?...

        The same crazed LAUGH of a man echoes through the crypt. A CHILLED
        Indy TURNS BACK to the door. He is startled to find the crypt door
        COVERED WITH A THICK SHEET OF ICE!

        Indy REACHES OUT. He TOUCHES the sparkling, green ice. He SNAPS back
        his hand. His fingers are BURNT.

        INT. BASEMENT

        MacGowan and Galbraith are OUTSIDE of the crypt door. They PULL at the
        door's metal handles. Trying to OPEN IT. But the door WON'T MOVE.
        MacGowan CALLS through the door.

                                        MACGOWAN
                        Doctor Jones! Try to push!

        INT. CRYPT

        Indy ANSWERS, taking a STEP BACK.

                                        INDIANA
                        Can't! There's some kinda' hot ice
                        coverin' the...

        Indiana suddenly FALLS! The floor has DISAPPEARED FROM BENEATH HIM!

        Indy manages to GRAB HOLD of a stone coffin. His fingers tightly GRIP
        the coffin's edge. Indiana LOOKS DOWN. Beneath him, is a SEVERAL
        HUNDRED FOOT DROP INTO TOTAL DARKNESS!

        Indy tries to PULL HIMSELF UP. The coffin's ancient stone begins to
        CRUMBLE. Large chunks and pieces FALL from Indy's grasp. He is LOSING
        HIS GRIP.

        Seconds before he plummets into the abyss, Indiana REACHES inside of
        the coffin. He clutches onto a CORPSE'S ARM! Using the arm, Indy
        SWINGS DOWNWARD.

        INT. ABYSS

        At the precise moment, Indiana RELEASES the dead arm. He LANDS on a
        ROCKY LEDGE. Located only a few feet BELOW the open crypt floor. Indy
        STANDS on the ledge. SAFE. He SMILES. RELIEVED. Suddenly, the ledge
        SNAPS!

        Indiana FALLS! His body DROPS hundreds of feet into the blackness. A
        MOMENT passes. Then... WE HEAR A SPLASH!

        BOTTOM OF THE HOLE!

        A POOL OF WATER! Surrounded by rocky, cavernous WALLS. Indiana's hat
        FLOATS on the water's surface. Indy POPS OUT of the water, bobbing up
        beside the hat. Indy REACHES for the hat. Suddenly, a FISH flaps out
        of the water. The fish GOBBLES UP one of the hat's live baits and
        disappears back underwater. Indy SMIRKS.

                                        INDIANA
                        NOW they bite!

        Indy attempts to PULL himself out of the water. There is a LOUD SOUND.
        Grinding METAL. Rattling CHAINS. Indy's eyes DART to his side.

        TWO HORIZONTAL METAL GATES EJECT FROM THE CAVERN WALLS! They SHOOT
        across the water! Like LIGHTNING! They're headed TOWARD each other...
        and Indy's HEAD!

        Indy DIVES underwater. THE GATES SNAP SHUT! Less than an INCH above
        the water's surface! Indy ATTEMPTS to resurface. The closed gate STOPS
        HIM. He CLUTCHES the grating, trying to MOVE the gate. It's TOO
        STRONG! Indy STRUGGLES for air. NO GOOD. There isn't enough SPACE.
        He's going to DROWN!

        UNDERWATER

        In desperation, Indy SWIMS downward. Looking for an ALTERNATE ESCAPE.
        But there is NO BOTTOM in sight. Indy's eyes BULGE. His face loses
        COLOR. Only a few precious SECONDS OF LIFE remain...when suddenly, he
        SPOTS SOMETHING. A SMALL TUNNEL. Built into the CAVERN WALL. Indiana
        hurriedly SWIMS to the tunnel. He BOLTS inside.

        A WATER FOUNTAIN. A large, THREE TIERED stone structure. Instead of
        the familiar carvings of angels and beautiful maidens, this fountain
        is surrounded with water spewing DEMONS, GARGOYLES and hellish BEASTS.
        CAMERA DOLLIES TO A LARGE METAL DRAIN, located inside of the
        fountain's base. The drain cover begins to TURN. Suddenly FLIPPING
        OPEN! Indiana CRAWLS out of the opening. He GULPS at the air. COLOR
        returns to his face. LIFE returns to his body. Indy RISES to his feet.
        He finds himself STANDING in the fountain.

        INDY'S POV

        He is inside of a BANQUET ROOM. The sprawling room is beautifully
        DECORATED in Victorian dignity. The room is IMMACULATE. Not one SPECK
        of dust. Two Medieval SUITS OF ARMOR adorn one wall. A gargantuan
        crystal CHANDELIER hangs above a long, mahogany BANQUET TABLE.

        At the far end of the table, sits a shriveled, white haired ELDERLY
        MAN. It is BARON SEAMUS SEAGROVE III, the fellow whose likeness
        appeared in every piece of artwork. Baron Seagrove is CALMLY eating
        his dinner. A bloated ROASTED PIG rests on a silver platter before
        him. The same candle we saw burning in the upstairs room and the
        family crypt, now RESTS on the table. Directly BESIDE the Baron.

        Two powerful, muscular MASTIFFS are tied to Baron Seagrove's chair.
        Teeth BARED. Eyes AELAZE. The hounds FIGHT for a scrap of meat.

        Indiana stares in BEWILDERMENT at the new surroundings. He STEPS OUT
        of the fountain. Baron Seagrove seems UNAWARE of Indy's presense.
        Indiana WALKS TOWARD the Baron.

                                        INDIANA
                        Excuse me, sir...? Hello...?

        Baron Seagrove DOES NOT look up from his plate. Indy moves CLOSER. He
        speaks LOUDER.

                                        INDIANA
                        Canyou hear me?...

        CLOSE-UP: BENEATH THE TABLE

        Baron seagrove's hand nonchalantly UNTIES the Mastiff's bindings.

        INDIANA

        still WALKS toward the table. The Baron continues to IGNORE him. Indy
        is ANNOYED.

                                        INDIANA
                        Listen, pal... There are two dead
                        Policemen upstairs and...

        The Mastiffs LEAP forward. COMING at Indiana. He tries to GET AWAY.
        TOO SLOW. The hounds are UPON HIM. TEARING. CLAWING. BITING. They DRAG
        Indy to the floor.

        Baron Seagrove continues to ENJOY his dinner, seemingly OBLIVIOUS to
        the scene before him.

        Indiana FIGHTS for his life. The VICIOUS dogs tear at his clothing and
        skin. Indy SPOTS something. On the wall ABOVE. Hanging amidst a
        display of stuffed animal heads, is a HUNTER'S TRUMPET. Indy STRUGGLES
        to his knees. Trying to REACH for the horn. But the dogs are still
        BITING. CLAWING. WEAKENING Indiana.

        Indy's fingers are INCHES from the horn. The Mastiffs' sharp claws RIP
        at his arm. But Indy manages to SNATCH the trumpet. He quickly moves
        the horn to his LIPS. He BLOWS. HARD. A HIGH, PIERCING NOTE fills the
        air. The dogs respond to the SOUND. They HALT. STOPPING their attack.
        For a MOMENT.

        Tattered and bruised, Indiana LEAPS to his feet. He DROPS the horn. He
        RUNS.

        The Mastiffs come to their SENSES. They DART after Indy. Mouths
        FOAMING.

        Baron Seagrove continues to DINE, still IGNORING the action.

        Indy runs to a VELVET CURTAIN. He GRABS HOLD of a long, thick rope
        that is attached to the curtain. Indiana TEARS the curtain from the
        wall. A large STAINED GLASS WINDOW is behind the curtain.

        The FIRST MASTIFF leaps at Indy. Indiana quickly DRAPES the curtain
        OVER the hound. Indy ties a large KNOT in the open curtain end. The
        dog is TRAPPED.

        Indy TURNS. The SECOND MASTIFF is only a FEW FEET AWAY. BARRELLING
        toward Indy. Indiana HOPS to the window ledge. He OPENS the window.
        The Mastiff LEAPS UPWARD! Indiana JUMPS OUT OF THE WINDOW! The dog
        FOLLOWS Indy, also JUMPING OUT OF THE WINDOW!

        EXT. WINDOW

        The Mastiff FALLS. Flying hundreds of feet into the ROCKY WATERS
        BELOW. The hound's vicious howl FADES. CAMERA PANS from the water and
        STOPS ON INDIANA JONES! Indy has OUTSMARTED the Mastiff. Be HANGS onto
        the swinging WINDOW FRAME. SAFE. He LEAPS back inside the room.

        INT. BANQUET ROOM

        Baron Seagrove pours himself a glass of WINE. A very ANGRY Indiana
        walks toward the Baron.

                                        INDIANA
                        Chow time's over, mister. You better
                        start talkin'.

        The Baron still IGNORES Indiana.

                                        INDIANA
                        There's a lot of strange things
                        happening around here...

        A SUIT OF ARMOR, located a few feet behind Indy, suddenly TWITCHES.
        Its arm LOWERS. Its head slowly TURNS.

        Indiana still walks TOWARD the Baron, who is only concerned with
        spreading butter on his bread. Indy SHOUTS.

                                        INDIANA
                        ...and I want some answers! Do you
                        hear me?
                                (louder)
                        I want some answers! Now!

        There is a LOUD CREAK OF METAL. A huge, sharp BATTLE AXE SHOOTS INTO
        FRAME! SWINGING toward Indy's head! Indiana SPINS. The axe is only
        INCHES from his face. Indy LEAPS BACK. WHOOSH! The axe SLICES through
        the air. JUST MISSING Indy. The shaken Indiana is SHOCKED to see

        A GLISTENING, BLACK SUIT OF ARMOR! The black knight is nearly SEVEN
        FEET TALL! It has COME TO LIFE and is walking TOWARD Indy. The black
        knight is WILDLY swinging the battle axe. Indiana continues to STEP
        BACK... BACK... Unbeknownst to Indy, his steps are leading him toward

        ANOTHER SUIT OF ARMOR! Also over seven feet tall, this armor is made
        of a SILVERY, WHITE METAL! As Indy moves CLOSER, the WHITE KNIGHT
        OPENS ITS ARMS! When Indy is within reach, the white knight LOCKS its
        powerful arms around Indy's chest! Indiana TRIES to break free. NO
        GOOD. The white knight's grip is TOO TIGHT. Indy is TRAPPED!

        The black knight still COMES TOWARD Indiana. Its frenzied axe SWINGS
        back and forth. Indy still STRUGGLES with the white knight's bone
        crunching grip.

        The black knight is only a FEW FEET from Indy. Its deadly axe blade
        INCHES from Indy's face. Indiana MOVES FAST. He JERKS his body
        forward. This FLIPS the white knight off its feet! OVER Indy's head.
        The white knight FLIES INTO the black knight. CRASH! This sends both
        knights FALLING to the floor.

        Indiana SHOOTS to his feet. The two knights LEAP to their feet. They
        CHASE Indy. The black knight armed with his AXE, the white knight
        armed with a long, sharp SWORD!

        Baron Seagrove SPOONS another helping of boiled potatoes onto his
        plate.

        Indy snatches a SHIELD and SWORD from a nearby wall display. Ready to
        FIGHT. The knights are UPON HIM. Indiana battles BOTH knights. He
        DEFENDS the bludgeoning battle axe with his shield, and SWORDFIGHTS
        the other knight! THRASH! CLANG! The sound of HEAVY METAL fills the
        room!

        Indy's sword STRIKES the white knight's thick chest. The sword SNAPS
        IN TWO. In the confusion, Indy's shield is KNOCKED from his hand by
        the powerful battle axe. Indy is DEFENSLESS.

        The two metal giants RAISE their weapons. HIGH. AIMING for Indy's
        head. The two knights SWING! Indy DIVES to the floor! The knights
        CAN'T STOP their weapons in time... CRUNCH! They deliver a HARD BLOW
        to each other! The woozy knights WOBBLE and SPIN. In a momentary DAZE.
        Indiana JUMPS to his feet.

        The BLACK KNIGHT hisses. FURIOUS. He DASHES after Indiana. The WHITE
        KNIGHT is still REELING from the blow.

        Seeing the black knight in HOT PURSUIT, Indy searches for a WEAPON. He
        spots the curtain's long, thick ROPE. LYING on the floor.

        The black knight is nearly UPON Indy. AXE RAISED! Indiana GRABS the
        rope. He SPINS. FACING the knight. Indy SNAPS HIS WRIST! A LOUD CRACK!
        The rope SHOOTS FORWARD! Not unlike Indiana's familiar WHIP!

        The rope WRAPS itself around the black knight's neck. Indy JERKS the
        whip forward. HARD. This sends the knight FLYING THROUGH THE AIR! The
        knight crashes into the stone FOONTAIN! Several of the fountain's
        sculptures SHATTER into pieces. The dazed, dented black knight
        ATTEMPTS to stand...but LOSES his footing. The knight FALLS backward.
        Into the fountain's WIDE DRAIN OPENING! Its HEAVY ARMOR causes the
        knight to SINK. DISAPPEARING into the hole. Into the POOL OF WATER.

        Indy CATCHES HIS BREATH. The white knight's SWORD SWINGS INTO FRAME!
        SLICING through Indiana's jacket! Indy JUMPS BACK. The vicious white
        knight COMES toward him.

        Indiana TURNS to run. Finding himself at the BANQUET TABLE. Face to
        face with the ROASTED PIG. A few feet away, Baron Seagrove CONTINUES
        to dine. The white knight raises his sword ABOVE Indy. WHOOSH! The
        sword begins to swing DOWN! Indiana DUCKS and DODGES the deadly blows.
        Instead of carving Indiana, the knight's sword manages to SLICE
        perfect sections of the roasted pig. The satisfied Baron HELPS HIMSELF
        to a freshly carved slice of pork.

        Indiana LEAPS onto the table top. Trying to ESCAPE the living suit of
        armor. But the white knight CLIMBS up onto the table. FOLLOWING Indy.

        The sword slashing knight PURSUES Indy along the table top. Indy
        GLANCES upward. To the heavy CHANDELIER. Indy SMILES. A PLAN. He
        continues to STEP BACKWARD. Leading the knight DIRECTLY BELOW the
        chandelier.

        At the precise moment, Indy picks up a STERLING SILVER PLATE from the
        table top. Indy WHISKS the plate in the air. Toward the ROPE that
        holds the chandelier. The spinning plate SEVERS the rope. The
        chandelier FLIES DOWNWARDl! CRASHING ON TOP of the white knight! The
        knight lies BENEATH the chandelier. MOTIONLESS. The sword DROPS from
        its lifeless hand. Onto the TABLE TOP.

        Indy takes the knight's SWORD. Eyes on FIRE, sword OUTSTRETCHED,
        Indiana WALKS across the table top. HEADED for Baron Seagrove.

        The Baron prepares to take ANOTHER BITE of his food. THE SWORD SHOOTS
        INTO FRAME! The tip of the blade RESTS upon Baron Seagrove's rubbery
        throat. Indiana SNARLS.

                                        INDIANA
                        Haven't you had enough?

        Baron Seagrove finally LOOKS at Indiana. The Baron LOWERS his fork.
        His face twists into an EERIE GRIN. He begins LAUGHING. It's the SAME
        MANIACAL LAUGH we heard earlier. Indy responds by BLOWING OUT the
        flame of the mysterious candle.

        The room's door BURSTS OPEN! INSPECTOR MACGOWAN and GALBRAITH dash
        inside. They HURRY to Baron Seagrove. Their PISTOLS aimed at him.
        Galbraith HANDCUFFS the Baron. MacGowan looks at the BRUISED, BLOODIED
        and TATTERED Indiana Jones.

                                        MACGOWAN
                        Now you can get back to your
                        fishing, Doctor Jones.

                                        INDIANA
                        No chance, Mac. My plane leaves in
                        the morning. Vacation's over. Gotta'
                        get back to school.

                                        MACGOWAN
                                (shakes his head)
                        'Tis a shame to go home empty
                        handed...
                                (smiles, an idea)
                        Tell ya' what, my friend... I fancy
                        me'self quite the fisherman...
                        Tomorrow, I'll go out and catch you
                        a real beauty, eh?...

                                        INDIANA
                                (sarcastic smirk)
                        Right. Send it to me airmail.

                                        MACGOWAN
                                (incredulous)
                        Doctor Jones! A MacGowan's word is
                        truer than...

                                        INDIANA
                        Yeah, yeah...an angel's kiss. I
                        know.

        They EXIT the room.

        EXT. CASTLE

        The villagers SURROUND the castle. Their BRIGHT TORCHES are raised
        high in the air. Baron Seagrove is LED out of the castle by Indiana
        and the Police. The crowd begins to WHISPER. ANXIOUS. EXCITED. As the
        Baron is led to the POLICE VEHICLE, he turns and LOOKS at Indy. The
        Baron speaks in a TREMBLING, RASPY voice. His eyes are WILD.

                                        BARON SEAGROVE
                        No...jail...can...hold...me.

        A CHILL rushes through Indiana. The Baron turns, CONTINUING to the
        Police wagon. One of the villagers SHOUTS.

                                        VILLAGER
                        'E's done it! Indiana Jones has
                        captured the killer!

        The crowd CHEERS. Indiana gives a HUMBLE NOD and WAVE. MacGowan SHAKES
        Indy's hand. Indy glances to the POLICE VEHICLE.

        INDY'S POV

        Baron Seagrove CLIMBS into the back compartment of the police vehicle.
        Galbraith CLOSES the vehicle doors. The Baron is still VISIBLE through
        the vehicle's windows. He LIGHTS a cigarette. It appears that the
        MATCH FLAME SHINES THROUGH THE BARON'S BODY! It's as if he were a
        GHOST!

        Indiana TURNS to the others. Eyes WIDE. SHOCKED. But it is obvious
        that NO ONE else has SEEN the apparition. MacGowan notices the PALE
        expression on Indy's face.

                                        MACGOWAN
                        What is it, man? You look as if
                        you've seen a screamin' banshee!

        Indy POINTS back to the police vehicle. But it has already DEPARTED.
        It drives over a far hill, DISAPPEARING INTO THE NIGHT. Indy SIGHS,
        turning back to MacGowan.

                                        INDIANA
                        Ah... It was nothing, Mac. Nothing
                        at all.

        CAMERA DOLLIES INTO INDIANA'S TROUBLED, UNCERTAIN FACE. THE BARON'S
        LAUGH FILLS THE SOUND TRACK.

                                                                        SLOW DISSOLVE:

        EXT. MARSHALL UNIVERSITY - A FEW DAYS LATER

        Early AFTERNOON. A RAINY Spring day. Students RUN to the University
        doors, protecting themselves with textbooks.

        INT. INDIANA JONES' OFFICE

        Rain SPLATTERS the window of this cramped, CLUTTERED room. Crooked
        stacks of dog eared TEXTBOOKS and PAPERS nearly reach the ceiling. The
        spindly bookshelves are stuffed with various ARCHEOLOGICAL RELICS and
        INSTRUMENTS: animal and bird skeletons, fossils, primitive statues,
        etc. Sitting at a small wooden desk, amidst a mountain of TERM PAPERS,
        is INDIANA JONES. Indy is WEARING a brown three piece suit and
        circular, wire rimmed glasses. In one hand, he holds a STUDENT SEAT
        ASSIGNMENT CARD, as he hurriedly READS through the term papers. He
        furiously GRADES each paper.

        To make matters worse; the office is CROWDED WITH STUDENTS, with
        countless others POURING out into the hallway. All of the students are
        ANXIOUS to get inside. They are BADGERING, COMPLAINING and MOANING at
        Indy.

                                        TEDDY
                        Doctor Jones... I took your class
                        instead of all the others!... I
                        coulda' had Professor Needles...
                        Professor Eisenschmidt...
                        Professor...

                                        ANGELA
                        You promised. You said you'd have
                        'em graded by yesterday.

                                        VIRGIL
                        My paper finished yet? Name's
                        "Virgil Vektor". That's VIRGIL.
                                (spelling it out)
                        Capital V... I... R...

                                        JULIA
                        My parents paid good money to send
                        me here. You know how much they
                        shelled out for your class?

                                        CHARLES
                        He doesn't care about us. He only
                        wants fame and fortune. We're just a
                        buncha' peons to him.

                                        VIRGIL
                        VEKTOR. Capital V... E... K...

        Indiana continues to grade the papers, trying to IGNORE the verbal
        assault. BETSY TUFFET pushes her way to the front. Betsy is Indy's
        STUDENT ASSISTANT. She is 21 YEARS OLD, with thick, luxurious black
        hair, bright brown eyes and a small framed, athletic body. Betsy is a
        TOUGH. BRASH. A BROOKLYN kid. She moves CLOSE to Indy, her hair
        brushing his cheek. Indiana is very TENSE, continuously working on the
        term papers.

                                        BETSY
                        Hello, Ind --
                                (giggle)
                        Doctor Jones.

                                        INDIANA
                        Not now, Betsy.

                                        BETSY
                        LOOK at all of those papers!

                                        INDIANA
                        Please, I...

                                        BETSY
                        Want me to come by later? Help you
                        grade?

                                        INDIANA
                        Help me grade. Yeah. Sure.

                                        BETSY
                        Goodbye, Ind --
                                (giggles)
                        Doctor Jones!

        She EXITS. Indy SIGHS. Again, the obnoxious student SHOUTS.

                                        VIRGIL
                        Didja' get the name? VIRGIL! Capital
                        V... I... R...

        PROFESSOR THAD PRIESTLY enters, pushing Virgil aside. Priestly is a
        young, wisecracking, greasy haired AQUAINTANCE of Indy's. He SHOVES a
        photograph BENEATH Indy's nose.

                                        PRIESTLY
                        Moby Dick.

                                        INDIANA
                        Huh?...

                                        PRIESTLY
                                (points to photo)
                        That's what I named 'im. Captain
                        said it was the biggest fish he ever
                        saw.

        Indiana GLANCES to the photo. It is a picture of Prof. Priestly
        dressed in fisherman's outfit, standing on a pier, holding a GIANT
        FISH. Indy STEAMS. Priestly gives him a MANLY SLAP to the back.

                                        PRIESTLY
                        What about you, Jonesey? You were
                        over in Scotty-land for two weeks...
                        Didja' catch the big one?...

                                        INDIANA
                        Look, Priestly... I'm real busy...

        Indy is suddenly INTERRUPTED by a HARD SLAP to his face. He LOOKS UP.
        A beautiful, blonde student, REBECCA, stands over his desk. She
        SCREAMS. FURIOUS.

                                        REBECCA
                        Two-timing bastard!

        Indiana RUBS his jaw. STARTLED. Rebecca CONTINUES.

                                        REBECCA
                        How could you?!?... My own
                        Mother?!?... In my own bed?!?...
                                (slaps him again)
                        I've had it with you! It's over!

        Priestly HIDES his chuckle. Rebecca THROWS a shirt that obviously
        belongs to Indiana on the desk and STORMS out of the room. Indy shakes
        his head and CONTINUES working. The students are still HARASSING him.
        A LOUD VOICE ECHOES through the room.

                                        POSTMAN (O.S.)
                        Special Delivery! Dr. Indiana Jones!

        A burly POSTMAN stands in the doorway, holding a thick, enormous BROWN
        ENVELOPE. Indy MOTIONS to the postman. The Postman tries to MAKE his
        way through the crowd. Indiana goes back to his grading, but is
        suddenly INTERRUPTED BY A LOUD TAPPING NOISE. He LOOKS UP. DEAN CLAUDE
        COVENTRY, a stately, elderly gentleman, RAPS a steel ruler on
        Indiana's desk. The Dean is UPSET. Very SERIOUS.

                                        DEAN COVENTRY
                        Doctor Jones, I've had complaints
                        from several of the students --

        The Postman INTERRUPTS, dropping the heavy envelope onto Indy's desk.
        The Postman SHOVES a yellow paper in front of Indy.

                                        POSTMAN
                        Sign here.

        Indy SIGNS. Dean Coventry continues LECTURING.

                                        DEAN COVENTRY
                        They feel that you are ignoring
                        them, that you are distracted...

                                        INDIANA
                                (gives Postman the
                                signed paper)
                        Me?... Distracted?...

                                        POSTMAN
                                (staring at Indy's
                                signature, puzzled)
                        What's this? "B+"? That's how you
                        sign your name?

        Indy GRABS the paper. He's signed a "B+" on the LINE where his name is
        supposed to appear. Indy CROSSES out the grade and signs his name.
        Professor Coventry still LECTURES Indiana.

                                        DEAN COVENTRY
                        Marshall University is not the place
                        for sloppy behavior...

        At that moment, Indy OPENS the envelope! A LARGE AMOUNT OF WATER POURS
        OUT! SATURATING the papers on the desk! This is followed by an
        ENORMOUS DEAD TROUT! It FLOPS onto Indy's desk. The students exchange
        STARTLED and NAUSEOUS glances. Indiana removes a water logged NOTE
        from the envelope. It reads, "A MACGOWAN'S WORD IS TRUER THAN AN
        ANGEL'S KISS". Indiana uses a TISSUE to WIPE some of the water from
        his desk. Dean Coventry SHAKES A FINGER at Indy.

                                        DEAN COVENTRY
                        I have one final warning for you,
                        Doctor Jones --

        THE PHONE RINGS! INTERRUPTING the Dean! Indiana quickly ANSWERS the
        phone. A FUMING Dean Coventry impatiently waits to finish his threat.
        Indiana SPEAKS into the receiver.

                                        INDIANA
                        Yes... Oh, Hello, Marcus... Look,
                        can you hold on?...
                                (back to Dean)
                        You were saying, sir?

                                        DEAN COVENTRY
                        Either you begin concentrating on
                        your --

                                        INDIANA
                                (interrupted by phone)
                        Yes, Marcus... I'm still here...
                        Just hold on!
                                (back to Dean)
                        I'm very sorry, sir...

                                        DEAN COVENTRY
                                (boiling)
                        -- concentrating on your teaching
                        duties or --

                                        INDIANA
                                (into phone)
                        Damn it, Marcus! I'm standing here
                        with Dean... What?.. Just how
                        important?...
                                (listening, impatient)
                        It is, huh?... Okay. Five minutes.
                        Yeah. I'll be right over. But this
                        better be important, Marcus!

        Indiana HANGS UP. He gives an EMBARASSED look to the furious, red
        faced Dean.

                                        DEAN COVENTRY
                        You are on probation, Jones! Ten
                        days! If there is no improvement,
                        you will be dismissed!

        The Dean STORMS OUT of the room. Indiana GATHERS the wet papers. He
        begins to EXIT the room, EXPLAINING to the students as he makes his
        way through the crowd.

                                        INDIANA
                        I promise...by tomorrow...I'll have
                        all of these graded...and DRIED!

        Indiana continues making APOLOGIES and EXCUSES. The obnoxious student
        again SHOUTS at him.

                                        VIRGIL
                        VIRGIL VEKTOR! Capital V... I...
                        R...

                                        INDIANA
                                (hands him paper)
                        "F"!

        Virgil STARES at his paper, adorned with a large RED "F"! Indiana
        EXITS the room.

        INT. HISTORY MUSEUM - PREHISTORIC ROOM

        The large room is filled with skeletons, fossils and statues dating
        back to the DAWN OF MAN. Indiana, his arms cluttered with the soaking
        term papers, hurriedly enters the museum with MARCUS BRODY. Marcus is
        very ANXIOUS. EXCITED. He carries a l6MM METAL FILM CANNISTER beneath
        his arm. Indiana is very IMPATIENT. His eyes dart to a full sized
        skeleton of a TYRONOSAURUS REX.

                        This better be important, Marcus...
                        or the museum will soon be
                        displaying my bones. My teaching
                        career is in danger of extinction.

                                        MARCUS
                                (smiles)
                        You will not be disappointed,
                        Indiana.

                                                                        CUT TO:

        CLOSE-UP: AN ANCIENT PAINTING. The watercolor features an upright,
        wrinkled face SUN WU KUNG, the STONE MONKEY KING. But the monkey is
        NOT made of stone. He appears to be HALF HUMAN... HALF MONKEY. His
        face is WISE. His coal black eyes are PENETRATING. He wears a LION
        SKIN ROBE, and holds a tall, GOLDEN HOOPED STAFF. Sun Wu Kung stands
        amidst a garden of luscious, ripe PEACE TREES. He is surrounded by a
        HEAVENLY GLOW, a bright ray of light that emanates from an opening in
        the CLOUDS.

                                        MARCUS (O.S.)
                        ...Look familiar?

        CAMERA PULLS BACK. We are inside of the museum BOARD ROOM. Marcus
        holds the tattered painting before Indiana, who sits at a desk, still
        feverishly GRADING the wet term papers. After he finishes each paper,
        Indy PINS it to a nearby bulletin board for drying. He GLANCES to the
        painting of Sun Wu Kung.

                                        INDIANA
                        "Sun wu Kung, The Stone Monkey
                        King". Big deal. That was ten years
                        ago, Marcus.
                                (going back to papers,
                                wanting to change
                                subject)
                        Geez! This Heller kid's got the
                        worst grammar.

                                        MARCUS
                        Ten years or fifty years. It will
                        always be in your blood.

                                        INDIANA
                                (ignoring Marcus)
                        Don't believe this... He spells
                        "repeat" with two "E's".

                                        MARCUS
                        Think back, Indiana. Remember your
                        desire? Your passion?

                                        INDIANA
                                (still ignores Marcus)
                        Kid gets an "A" on content...a "D"
                        on form.

                                        MARCUS
                                (angry, slams his fist
                                on the desk)
                        Damn it, man! You can't bury those
                        feelings forever!

        Indiana finally LOOKS UP from the papers. He glances at Marcus, then
        LOOKS at the painting. CAMERA DOLLIES INTO Indiana's face. He becomes
        very SERIOUS. SOMBER. His eyes are EMPTY. Memories of FAILURE fill his
        head.

                                        INDIANA
                        Two years. Nearly two years of my
                        life...looking for the remains of
                        that Monkey...a piece of his
                        legendary Golden Hooped Rod...or
                        some sign of the Lost City.
                                (shakes his head)
                        Nine men perished on the journey.
                        Rest of us nearly died from
                        starvation or one of the many
                        horrible deseases we discovered...
                                (looks back to papers,
                                in a near whisper)
                        We still came back empty handed.

                                        MARCUS
                                (threading the
                                projector)
                        One mustn't give up so easily,
                        Indiana.

                                        INDIANA
                        Give up?!?... Marcus, we spent
                        thirteen months in China!...another
                        seven in India!...

                                        MARCUS
                        But none in Africa.

                                        INDIANA
                                (puzzled expression)
                        There was no proof...archeological
                        or anthropological...to indicate
                        that Sun Wu-Kung ever visited
                        Africa...

                                        MARCUS
                        Until now.

        Marcus TURNS OFF the room lights.

                                        INDIANA
                        Hey... My papers...

        Marcus STARTS the projector. A BLACK AND WHITE image flickers on the
        far wall. We see a PYGMY, standing in what appears to be a grassy
        area. The pygmy's name is TYKI. He is ADORABLE. A little Over FOUR
        FEET TALL, his body is TAUT, MUSCULAR. His long black hair is SHAGGY,
        his eyes are WIDE and BRIGHT. Almost CHILDLIKE. His face is CUTE.
        IMPISH. Covered with a very INQUISITIVE expression. Tyki's energy is
        BOUNDLESS. He cannot stop MOVING. Standing BESIDE Tyki, is

        DR. CLARE CLARKE. 32 years old. A tall, strikingly BEAUTIFUL woman.
        She is COMMUNICATING with Tyki in sign language.

                                        MARCUS
                        The woman is Dr. Clare Clarke. The
                        famous zoologist. She works in
                        Africa, studying animals in their
                        natural habitat.

                                        INDIANA
                        Very interesting, Marcus. Now if
                        you'll turn the lights back on --

                                        MARCUS
                                (continuing)
                        Three weeks ago, Dr. Clarke
                        discovered that cute little
                        fellow... "Tyki"...a pygmy of an
                        unusual race...unrelated to any
                        known African tribe...

                                        INDIANA
                                (bored)
                        Marcus. The lights.

                                        MARCUS
                        Dr. Clarke believes that Tyki comes
                        from the Lost Civilization of Sun
                        Wu-Kung.

        Indiana PAUSES. He STANDS, walking closer to the flickering image.
        Suddenly INTERESTED.

                                        INDIANA
                        What?... But how did Miss --

                                        MARCUS
                        "Doctor".

                                        INDIANA
                        "Doctor" Clake. How did she arrive
                        at such a preposterous hypothesis?

                                        MARCUS
                        The pygmy speaks in a language that
                        has no African origins...but bears a
                        strong resemblance to Chinese.

                                        INDIANA
                        Means nothing. The rivers of Africa
                        have been plagued by various
                        Oriental Pirates and Scavengers
                        since the 16th Century.
                                (turns from screen)
                        Not much evidence, Marcus.

                                        MARCUS
                        There's more. The pygmy was found
                        wearing an ornamental peach stone
                        around his neck...believed to come
                        from Sun Wu-Kung's legendary Garden
                        Of Immortal Peaches.

                                        INDIANA
                                (skeptical)
                        Marcus, there are countless
                        undiscovered African tribes...all
                        with various obscure beliefs and
                        practices...
                                (smirks)
                        One tribe may wear peach stones...
                        another may wear banana peels...

        Indiana WALKS back to his papers. Marcus PAUSES.

                                        MARCUS
                        There is one final bit of
                        evidence...

                                        INDIANA
                        Enlighten me.

                                        MARCUS
                        The pygmy is over 200 years old.

        Indiana ADJUSTS his spectacles. He STARES at the black and white
        image. The cute pygmy appears to be in his MID-TWENTIES. He walks to
        the CAMERA, STARING into the lens. Tyki examines the camera with
        CURIOSITY.

                                        INDIANA
                        That's impossible.

                                        MARCUS
                        Dr. Clarke has done a considerable
                        amount of testing on the pygmy's
                        clothing...his sandals...everything
                        was over 200 years old.

                                        INDIANA
                                (skeptical)
                        He's probably wearing his Great
                        Grandfather's stuff.

        CAMERA PANS BACK to the projected image. Tyki begins to UNSCREW the
        camera lens. The picture goes OUT OF FOCUS. The film RUNS OUT. Marcus
        TURNS OFF the projector and flips ON the overhead room lights. Indiana
        gives Marcus a PUZZLED look.

                                        INDIANA
                        What does all of this have to do
                        with me?

                                        MARCUS
                        Dr. Clarke wants to mount an
                        expedition to find the Lost City of
                        Sun Wu-Kung. She is quite familiar
                        with your reputation...she'd like
                        you to come along.

                                        INDIANA
                                (gathering his papers)
                        No chance.

                                        MARCUS
                        There will be money involved... The
                        museum is willing to fund the
                        expedition...

                                        INDIANA
                        Sorry, Marcus. I've burned this
                        bridge.

        Indiana TURNS and begins to WALK out of the room. Marcus CALLS him.

                                        MARCUS
                        Indiana...

        Indy TURNS. He WAVES the papers at Marcus.

                                        INDIANA
                        Marcus. Please. I've got to finish
                        these...

                                        MARCUS
                        You've got to finish something much
                        more important. You crossed the
                        threshold over a decade ago...and
                        it's been tearing at your insides
                        ever since.
                                (passionate)
                        My friend, if there is even one iota
                        of truth in Dr. Clarke's findings...
                        then you can lift the veil of
                        mystery that has surrounded this
                        Chinese legend for Centuries. You
                        may uncover the secrets to a Lost
                        Civilization...and possibly, to
                        man's never ending search for
                        immortality.

        Indiana STARES at the painting of Sun Wu Kung.

                                        MARCUS
                        Indiana... Can you afford to pass up
                        the single most important adventure
                        of your life?

        Indiana has NO ANSWER for Marcus. Indy PICKS up the painting. A
        THRILLING expression slowly covers Indiana's face. His eyes GLIMMER.
        Filled with a long, lost EXCITEMENT. The SOUND TRACK MUSIC SOARS!

                                                                        CUT TO:

        CLOSE UP: THE STACK OF TERM PAPERS

        The papers are slightly CRUMPLED. Still WET. A DROP OF WATER hits the
        papers. CAMERA PANS UPWARD. BETSY TUFFET, Indy's student assistant,
        sits at the desk, grading the papers. She is CRYING. Her falling TEARS
        soak the papers. We are INSIDE of Indiana's apartment. LATER that
        evening.

        INDIANA stands in the background. He is hurriedly PACKING his bags.
        His familiar GUN, HAT and WHIP lie on the bed, beside the suitcase.
        Indy NOTICES that Betsy is crying. He WALKS to Betsy. Indy puts his
        arm on Betsy's shoulder, attempting to COMFORT her. Betsy SNAPS at
        Indy.

                                        BETSY
                        You can't do this to me!

                                        INDIANA
                                (shaking tears off the
                                papers)
                        C'mon, Betsy. Relax. You're gettin'
                        'em all wet again.

                                        BETSY
                        You just can't go away...I mean...
                        Africa is so far away, and...well...
                                (heartfelt)
                        I love you, Indy.

                                        INDIANA
                        Thought we agreed this was s'posed
                        to be casual...

                                        BETSY
                        You call what happened last night
                        "casual".

                                        INDIANA
                        My dear...a momentary lapse into
                        passion does not a love affair make.

                                        BETSY
                                (very upset)
                        Momentary lapse! So that's all I am
                        to you!

        Betsy SHOOTS to her feet, walking OFF SCREEN.

                                        INDIANA
                        Betsy... Wait...

        Indiana SIGHS. His eye CATCHES one of the termpapers. He begins to
        READ, making a few CORRECTIONS.

        We see Betsy's HAND removes Indiana's WHIP from the bed.

        Indiana continues to CORRECT the papers. Suddenly, there is a CREAKING
        NOISE. Indy TURNS. His face goes WHITE. He runs OFF SCREEN.

        One end of Indiana's WHIP is attached to an OVERHEAD LAMP. CAMERA PANS
        DOWN the whip. The other end has been formed into a NOOSE around
        Betsy's neck. Sbe stands on a wooden CHAIR. She KICKS AWAY the chair.
        Suddenly GAGGING. Indiana GRABS Betsy in midair. He TAKES the noose
        from her neck and PLACES Betsy on the floor.

                                        INDIANA
                                (angry)
                        Whatsa' matter with you!... Tryin'
                        to ruin my whip!...

                                        BETSY
                        If I can't have you... I don't want
                        to live.

        Indiana TOSSES the whip into his suitcase. He pulls up the chair and
        forces Betsy to be SEATED. He pours her a tall glass of BOURBON.

                                        INDIANA
                        Drink this. You'll feel better.

        Indiana WALKS to his suitcase, continuing to pack. His BACK is to
        Betsy. She raises the GLASS to her lips. She PAUSES, reading a MESSAGE
        on the Bourbon bottle. It reads: DANGER! CONTENTS FLAMMABLE! Betsy
        BEAMS. An IDEA. She LIFTS the bottle over her head and begins to DOUSE
        her body with the liquid.

        Indiana is BUSY folding his clothing. Suddenly, we hear the FLICK OF A
        MATCHSTICK! Indy TURNS. He sees the bourbon covered Betsy preparing to
        LIGHT HER BODY ON FIRE! Indy DASHES forward. He BLOWS OUT the match,
        moments before it SPARKS Betsy's clothing. Indy SHAKES Betsy by the
        shoulders.

                                        INDIANA
                        C'mon, Betsy... Get a hold of
                        yourself. You're young. There are a
                        lot of other guys...

                                        BETSY
                        Not like you.

                                        INDIANA
                                (succumbing to his ego)
                        That's true...
                                (realizing his mistake)
                        But that's no reason to stop living!
                        Besides, I'm too old for you. By the
                        time you're seventy five, I'll be...
                                (calculates, the thought
                                of it makes him grimace)
                        Yeccchhh! I'll be disgusting.

        Indiana TURNS and finishes his packing. Betsy SIGHS. She notices an
        enormous, STONE AFRICAN URN. The 150 POUND antique sits atop a section
        of BOOKSHELVES.

        Meanwhile, Indiana makes certain that his gun is PACKED. He places the
        familiar HAT on his head and begins to CLOSE the suitcase.

        CLOSE UP: THE AFRICAN URN. It is WOBBLING. SHAKING. Moving CLOSER and
        CLOSER to the edge of the bookshelves. CAMERA PANS TO THE FLOOR. Betsy
        LIES here. Directly BELOW the trembling urn. Betsy SHAKES the
        bookshelves, causing the urn to TILT and SHIVER. The urn is nearly
        HALFWAY OFF of the edge. If it falls...the urn will CRUSH Betsy's
        head.

        Indiana STRUGGLES with closing his tightly packed suitcase.

        The urn FALLS! HEADED STRAIGHT for Betsy! Indiana SUDDENLY GRABS the
        urn. In MIDAIR. Inches before it STRIKES Betsy. Indiana RESTS the urn
        on the floor. He HELPS Betsy to her feet. Betsy WRAPS her arms tightly
        around Indiana.

                                        BETSY
                        Don't leave me, Indy!

        Indiana PICKS UP his suitcase and tries to WALK to the door. But
        Betsy's arms are still TIGHTLY WRAPPED around him. Finally, Indy
        STOPS. His eyes BURN through Betsy.

                                        INDIANA
                                (cruel)
                        Look... You're just a flighty kid.
                        Twenty minutes after I walk out this
                        door, you'll have a date with the
                        college Romeo. Two hours from now,
                        you'll be madly in love with him. By
                        tomorrow, you'll forget I ever
                        existed.

        Hurt, Betsy REMOVES her arms from Indiana. He gives her a QUICK KISS
        to the cheek and hurriedly EXITS. Betsy GLARES at the closed door. A
        TOUGH, ANGRY expression covers her face.

                                        BETSY
                        Never underestimate the
                        determination of a Brooklyn girl,
                        Doctor Jones. Never.

                                                                        DISSOLVE TO:

        LONG SHOT - AN OCEAN LINER

        The SILHOUETTE of the ship sails across the water. A beautiful ORANGE
        SKY fills the background.

        INDIANA JONES

        stands aboard the ship's DECK. It is a typical, 30's LUXURY Ocean
        liner, filled with vacationing TOURISTS. Indiana STARES into the
        sunrise. His face is a study in CONCENTRATION and INTENSITY. He
        anxiously AWAITS his adventure.

                                                                        DISSOLVE TO:

        MAP OF THE WORLD

        A MOVING RED LINE traces Indiana's journey across the ocean, toward
        AFRICA. The red line comes to a stop at MOZAMBIQUE.

        EXT. CENTRAL MOZAMBIQUE - BEIRA - A HOT, SUNNY AFTERNOON

        Chief PORT on the coast. Gateway to the ZAMBESI RIVER. SUPPLY SHIPS,
        SAILBOATS and RAFTS line the marina. The docks are crowded with
        various MERCHANTS and SAILORS, unloading their goods. Small SHOPS and
        RESTAURANTS clutter the waterfront. Behind them are rows of one story,
        low square HOMES. Tall, healthy PALM TREES surround the Area.

        An OCEAN LINER has anchored along the shore. Several PASSENGERS exit
        from the ship. INDIANA steps onto the ocean liner's exit ramp. He is
        UNSHAVEN, wearing his traditional LEATHER JACKET and HAT. Indy LOOKS
        AROUND, expecting to MEET someone.

        INDY'S POV - THE DOCK

        There is a a LOUD CAR HORN. Crowds of pedestrians LEAP out of the way.
        A rusted, yellow MODEL-T barrels along the rickety dock. The word
        "TAXI" is crudely painted on the car's trembling doors. The car's
        tires are WOBBLING. LOOSE. Thick, black SMOKE pours from the cracked
        EXHAUST PIPE. The ancient car RATTLES and GRINDS.

        Upon seeing the car, Indiana SMILES.

        At the foot of the ocean liner's ramp, the car SCREECHES TO A STOP!

        SCRAGGY BRIER

        Indiana's friend and guide, JUMPS out of the taxi. Scraggy is a rough,
        unkempt AFRICAN MAN. An elderly fellow, with the ENERGY and VITALITY
        of a youth. His snow white hair and beard are WILD. SPIKED. He wears
        TATTERED, DIRTY clothes that are many sizes too large for his SKINNY
        body. Homemade CROCODILE SANDALS flop on his feet.

        Scraggy suddenly breaks into a WILD GRIN. He SPOTS Indiana. Scraggy
        SHOOTS up the exit ramp, running through the crowd of people. Scraggy
        stops a FEW FEET in front of Indiana. Scraggy WAVES his arms before
        him, as if he were BLESSING Indiana. Following this, Scraggy LEAPS
        into Indy's arms. Indiana CRADLES Scraggy like a child. Speaking with
        a Portugese accent, Scraggy EXCLAIMS...

                                        SCRAGGY
                        Indy! At last we are reunited!
                                (looks to sky)
                        Oh, Keechingo, God Of Friendship...I
                        thank you for granting my wish!

        Indy RESTS Scraggy back onto the ramp. Scraggy MOVES to assist Indiana
        with his luggage. Before picking it up, Scraggy RAISES his arms over
        the baggage. Again, he BLESSES the suitcases. Scraggy then PICKS UP
        the bags. Indy CHUCKLES.

                                        INDIANA
                        I see you haven't changed, Scraggy.

                                        SCRAGGY
                        Mahootmek, God Of Goodness, say...
                        "Before body make contact with
                        foreign object...one must cast out
                        bad spirits, or -- "

                                        INDIANA
                        " -- or bad spirits will enter your
                        body!"

                                        SCRAGGY
                        Yes! You have excellent memory,
                        Indy.

                                        INDIANA
                        I should! Last time we saw each
                        other...you made me wear the same
                        clothes for 3 weeks straight.

                                        SCRAGGY
                        Never separate body from clothes, or
                        bad spirits will hide in pockets!

                                        INDIANA
                        In other words... If people never
                        changed clothes...there would be no
                        evil in the world.

                                        SCRAGGY
                        Exactly!

                                        INDIANA
                                (chuckles, puts his arm
                                around Scraggy)
                        I missed all a' your crazy
                        philosophies, Scraggy.

                                        SCRAGGY
                        They not so crazy, Indy.
                                (serious, eyes wide with
                                fear)
                        These days... There is much evil in
                        the air. I feel it. Everywhere.

        Indy and Scraggy CONTINUE to walk down the ramp, moving OFF SCREEN.
        CAMERA PANS TO A FEW FEET BEHIND THEM. CAMERA STOPS, as the SCREEN IS
        FILLED WITH A LARGE, BLAZING RED SWASTIKA! CAMERA PANS UPWARD. We see
        that this is the SLEEVE OF A GERMAN SOLDIER. CAMERA STOPS on the face
        of

        SGT. HELMUT GUTTERBUHG

        A thin, skeletal NAZI. He resembles the ANGEL OF DEATH. Gutterbuhg's
        face is NARROW and SUNKEN. His deep set eyes are a frightening LIGHT
        BLUE. His complexion is PALE. EMOTIONLESS. His hair is BLONDE.
        STRINGY. His right arm appears RIGID. It rests STIFFLY at his side.

        Gutterbuhg FOLLOWS Indy and Scraggy through the crowd. The Nazi
        REMOVES something from his pocket. It is a tiny, MECHANICAL ITEM. It
        resembles a COCKROACH. We see that it is a mini RADIO TRANSMITTER.
        Gutterbuhg WHISPERS into it.

                                        GUTTERBUHG
                                (German, English
                                subtitles)
                        Are we making contact?

        The mechanical roach's eyes BLINK RED. Gutterbuhg gives a CHILLING
        SMILE.

        Meanwhile, Indiana and Scraggy ARRIVE at the Taxi. Scraggy begins to
        SECURE Indy's baggage to the roof. Indy OPENS the rear door of the
        cab. He begins to CLIMB into the back seat. He is met with a SWIFT
        KICK TO THE STOMACH! He FALLS to the ground. The wind KNOCKED out of
        him. Scraggy RUNS to the open door, scolding the person INSIDE.

                                        SCRAGGY
                        Dr. Clarke! Why you kick Dr.
                        Jones?...

        DR. CLARE CLARKE

        STEPS OUT of the shadows of the car. We RECOGNIZE her from Marcus'
        film, but she is even MORE BEAUTIFUL in person. She is the SAME AGE as
        Indy. Her hair is BRIGHT RED. She removes her glasses, revealing
        sparkling GREEN EYES. She is very PRIM. Very PROPER. But extremely
        INTELLIGENT and QUICK WITTED. She is dressed in KHAKI SLACKS and
        SHIRT. She speaks in a slight BRITISH ACCENT. She hurriedly ASSISTS
        Indiana to his feet.

                                        CLARE
                        Dr. Jones! Forgive me.

                                        INDIANA
                        No sweat.

                                        CLARE
                        Thought I was being attacked by a
                        degenerate sailor.

                                        INDIANA
                        No. Just a degenerate archeologist.

                                        CLARE
                        Your appearance is deceiving.

                                        INDIANA
                        Likewise.

        They exchange a handshake and a SMILE. Immediately ATTRACTED to each
        other.

                                        PORTER (O.S.)
                        Indiana Jones! Calling passenger
                        Indiana Jones!

        Indiana TURNS. A ship PORTER walks through the crowd, pushing a LARGE
        BARREL on a dolly. Indy WAVES to the Porter. The Porter STOPS in front
        of him.

                                        PORTER
                        You left this aboard ship.

                                        INDIANA
                                (puzzled)
                        There must be some mistake... I
                        didn't --

        The Porter POINTS to a section of the barrel that reads: DELIVER TO:
        DR. INDIANA JONES.

                                        PORTER
                        That's you, ain't it?

                                        INDIANA
                        Well, yeah...but...

        The Porter DROPS the barrel in front of Indiana and hurriedly WALKS
        back to the ship.

        SGT. GUTTERBUHG continues to SPY on Indiana. The Nazi HIDES a few feet
        away. In a DARK alleyway.

        A puzzled Indiana begins to OPEN the barrel. Scraggy SHOUTS a warning.

                                        SCRAGGY
                        Indy! Remember Mahootmek, God Of
                        Goodness! "Before body make contact
                        with foreign object -- "

        Indiana IGNORES Scraggy and begins to PRY OPEN the barrel.

                                        SCRAGGY
                        "...you must cast out bad spirits!"

        Indiana still IGNORES Scraggy. He STRUGGLES with the barrel top,
        FLIRTING with Clare.

                                        INDIANA
                        May I call you "Clare"?

                                        CLARE
                        Please.

                                        INDIANA
                        Well, Clare... We've obviously got a
                        lot of notes to compare... Let's get
                        started tonight...over dinner.

                                        CLARE
                        I'd like that very much.

                                        INDIANA
                        Friend of mine owns a Cafe... He'll
                        get us a nice quiet table. No
                        disturbances. Just the two of us --

        At that moment, the barrel lid FLIES OFF! The inside if FILLED with
        old, brown BANANA PEELS. Suddenly, BETSY'S HEAD POKES THROUGH the
        peels! Indiana is SHOCKED. Scraggy SIGHS.

                                        SCRAGGY
                        I warn you, Indy! You must always
                        cast out bad spirits!

        A dirty, unkempt Betsy LEAPS OUT OF THE BARREL! She THROWS her arms
        around Indy.

                                        BETSY
                        My precious!

                                        CLARE
                                (puzzled, to Indy)
                        Your daughter?

                                        INDIANA
                        My assistant.

                                        BETSY
                        His girlfriend.

                                        CLARE
                                (revolted)
                        A child!

                                        INDIANA
                                (to Clare)
                        It's nothing. Really.
                                (to Betsy)
                        What the hell are you doing here'?

                                        BETSY
                        Proving my love for you.

                                        CLARE
                        How terribly sordid.

                                        INDIANA
                                (to Clare)
                        Puppy love. Schoolgirl crush. She'll
                        get over it.

                                        BETSY
                        Never. This proves that nothing can
                        come between us. Not an ocean. Not
                        two separate Continents.

                                        CLARE
                        Think I'm going to be ill.

                                        INDIANA
                                (puzzled, to Betsy)
                        How...I mean... How could you stay
                        alive?

                                        BETSY
                        Hey... I'm from Brooklyn.

                                        INDIANA
                        But we'ye been sailing for three
                        weeks!

                                        BETSY
                        Stowed away in the banana barrel.
                        Ate my way to the bottom.

                                        CLARE
                                (nauseous)
                        Charming.

                                        BETSY
                                (pointing to Clare)
                        Hey, Indy... Who's the babe?

                                        CLARE
                        Your intellectual and emotional
                        superior.

                                        BETSY
                        Yeah...well you're gettin' on my
                        nerves, Miss... Miss...

                                        CLARE
                                (extends her hand)
                        "Doctor" Clare Clarke.

                                        BETSY
                                (reluctantly shaking
                                Clare's hand)
                        Betsy Tuffet...

                                        CLARE
                        As in curds and whey?

                                        BETSY
                                (getting tough)
                        Listen, sister... You better stay
                        away from Indy...

                                        CLARE
                        My dear, he has no interest in me.
                        I've already celebrated my tenth
                        Birthday.

        Indiana SHOOTS Clare an angry glance. Indy removes a wad of BILLS from
        his pocket. He GIVES them to Betsy.

                                        INDIANA
                        Look, Betsy... Why don't you get
                        back on the boat... This time, as a
                        passenger.

                                        SCRAGGY
                        Too late, Indy.

        Scraggy points toward the OCEAN LINER. The boat is SEVERAL FEET from
        shore. It SAILS back out to sea. Indiana STEAMS.

                                        INDIANA
                        When's the next one out?

                                        SCRAGGY
                        Two weeks.

        Indiana GRUMBLES. An amused Dr. Clarke gets back into the car. Indy
        SHOVES Betsy inside. He is FURIOUS.

        Before Indiana gets into the car, GUTTERBUHG steps out from the
        alleyway. He TOSSES the tiny mechanical COCKROACH at Indiana. The
        roach ATTACHES itself to Indy's TROUSER LEG. The tiny transmittor is
        very LIGHT. Indiana can feel NOTHING. He gets INTO the car. Scraggy
        BLESSES the Taxi and gets into the driver's seat.

        Gutterbuhg WATCHES as the battered Model-T DRIVES OFF. The NAZI turns,
        walking in an opposite direction. The CAMERA FOLLOWS Gutterbuhg, as he
        enters a SEEDY WATERFRONT HOTEL.

        INT. HOTEL

        Gutterbuhg walks through the DIMLY LIT lobby, filled with dusty, tacky
        African furnishings. He turns a corner, into a NARROW, decrepid
        hallway. He STOPS at the last DOORWAY. Room 113. He OPENS the door
        with a key and ENTERS.

        INT. ROOM

        A SMALL, MUSTY Hotel room. It is furnished with a SINGLE BED, A SOFA,
        TWO CHAIRS and A FIRE PLACE. Two BIZARRE AFRICAN STATUES adorn the
        fireplace mantle. Gutterbuhg carefully LOCKS the room door. He walks
        to the FIREPLACE. He TILTS one of the African statues forward. There
        is a mechanical, CREAKING SOUND. Suddenly, the SOFA BEGINS TO MOVE. It
        SLIDES a few feet, revealing an OPENING BENEATH THE FLOOR. A STAIRCASE
        leads into the opening. Gutterbuhg DESCENDS the stairs.

        INT. OPENING

        Gutterbuhg enters a LARGE, BRIGHTLY LIT ROOM. We are inside of A
        SECRET NAZI HEADQUARTERS. The room is filled with various
        COMMUNICATIONS EQUIPMENT and RADIO TRANSMITTERS. SEVERAL NAZI SOLDIERS
        are seated before the equipment, monitoring various radio signals. An
        enormous GLASS PANEL covers one wall. THROUGH THE PANEL WE SEE

        TWO SPEEDBOATS. LONG. SLEEK. HIGH POWERED. MAHOGANY HULLED. Both
        speedboats are adorned with a SWASTIKA. They FLOAT in water, in an
        UNDERGROUND, MAN-MADE CHAMBER. Directly BESIDE the speedboats, parked
        on a STONE INCLINE, are

        TWO AUTOMOBILES. The cars are enormous, beautiful "WOODIES". Equipped
        with a RUNNING BOARD and WOOD PANELLED SIDES. The cars GLISTEN. BRAND
        NEW.

        Gutterbuhg turns to KLAUS, a hulking Nazi who stands in the corner.
        Pointing to Klaus' FEET, Gutterbuhg SHOUTS an order to Klaus. CAMERA
        PANS to Klaus' feet. The Nazi's BOOT IS UNTIED. A LONG STRING dangles
        on the floor. The embarassed Klaus KNEELS and sloppily RE-TIES his
        shoe.

        Gutterbuhg turns to a Nazi who sits at a RADIO RECEIVER. The Nazi
        wears HEADPHONES, LISTENING for a transmission. THE LONG, FRIGHTENING
        SHADOW OF A MAN overcomes Gutterbuhg. He TURNS. FEAR covers
        Gutterbuhg's face. The shadow RAISES its arm. HEIL HITLER! Gutterbuhg
        also RAISES his right arm. But a BIZARRE, MECHANICAL SQUEAK, is caused
        by the movement of his arm.

        LIEUTENANT WERNER VON MEPEISTO

        stands BEFORE Gutterbuhg. Mephisto is a NAZI nightmare. His face is
        THICK and BULLISH. His bulging eyes are a reddish BROWN, giving him
        the appearance of a DEMON from hell. He has NO FACIAL HAIR. NO
        eyebrows. NO eyelashes. Completely BALD. His body is THICK. MUSCULAR.
        He is over SIX FEET TALL. He GLARES down at Gutterbuhg.

                                        MEPHISTO
                                (German, English
                                subtitles)
                        Were you successful?

        Gutterbuhg gives a TIMID NOD. With trembling fingers, he reaches over
        and TURNS UP THE VOLUME of the radio transmission. The voices of
        Indiana, Betsy, Clare and Scraggy echo through a TINNY SPEAKER.
        Mephisto manages a pleased GRUNT.

                                        MEPHISTO
                                (German, English
                                subtitles)
                        Keep a record of everything that is
                        said.

        Gutterbuhg NUDGES the officer before him. The officer hurriedly begins
        to SCRAWL a manuscript of the radio transmission. Mephisto NODS.

                                        MEPHISTO
                                (German, English
                                subtitles)
                        Ever since our battle for the Lost
                        Ark... The feuhrer has been very
                        interested in the adventures of
                        Indiana Jones. Very interested.

                                                                        CUT TO:

        EXT. ZOOLOGICAL COMPOUND

        A miniature ZOO. The PEACEFUL compound is surrounded with small man
        made lakes and palm trees. There are countless METAL CAGES, filled
        with various ANIMALS. The TIGERS, LIONS, GORILLAS and other violent
        creatures, are kept BEHIND BARS. But the LLAMAS, GIRAFFES, DEER and
        various tame animals are FREE to roam the compound grounds.

        Indiana ENTERS with Clare, Betsy and Scraggy. The persistant Betsy is
        ANNOYING Indy. She attempts to SNUGGLE closer to him. Indiana PUSHES
        her away. Betsy TRIES to hold his hand. Indy SHAKES her loose. Scraggy
        WATCHES all of this, GIGGLING to himself.

        We hear SINGING. A high, pitched BEAUTIFUL VOICE. Clare walks to the
        far end of the compound, toward the SINGING. The others FOLLOW. Betsy
        walks by BONZO, A LARGE CHIMPANZEE. As Betsy PASSES, the chimp catches
        a FAMILIAR SMELL. Bonzo begins to FOLLOW Betsy.

        Clare OPENS the door of a large metal cage. Here, the singing is
        LOUDER. Clare ENTERS the cage. Indiana FOLLOWS. Scraggy BLESSES the
        cage, then enters. Betsy MOVES to go inside, but Bonzo's LARGE HAIRY
        HAND REACHES OUT and GRABS BETSY! PULLING the girl OFF SCREEN!

        INT. CAGE

        Filled with hand made wooden and bamboo FURNITURE. TYKI, the adorable
        PYGMY from Marcus' film, is INSIDE. Tyki is dressed only in a BELTED,
        leather loin cloth and SANDALS. He is perched on the floor, working on
        a large TAPESTRY. The tapestry depicts a colorful picture of CLOUDS.
        The buildings of a LARGE CITY are REFLECTED on the clouds. Tyki
        pleasantly SINGS as he does his work.

        Upon hearing the cage door OPEN, Tyki LOOKS UP. He SEES Clare. A
        JOYOUS SMILE covers his face. The pygmy RUNS to Clare, giving her a
        huge HUG and a KISS. Clare INTRODUCES Tyki to the others.

                                        CLARE
                        Tyki... This is Doctor Jones...

        Tyki EXTENDS his right hand. He SHAKES Indiana's hand. Indiana is
        CHARMED by the civilized display of friendship. Indy SMILES at Clare.

                                        INDIANA
                        He's a real gentleman.

                                        CLARE
                                (shrugs)
                        Just basic manners. What it takes
                        most men a lifetime to learn...
                        Tyki's accomplished in two weeks.
                                (introduces Scraggy)
                        This is our guide, Scraggy Brier...
                        and Miss Bets--

        Clare pauses, noticing that Betsy is MISSING. Clare suddenly breaks
        into a LAUGH! She points OFF SCREEN. Everyone TURNS.

        EXT. COMPOOND

        Bonzo is being extremely AFFECTIONATE toward Betsy. The chimpanzee
        PULLS and GRABS at Betsy. It is all VERY SIMILIAR to what Betsy has
        been doing to Indiana. Betsy WRESTLES with Bonzo, CALLING Indy for
        help.

        INT. CAGE

        Everyone CHUCKLES at Betsy's dillemma.

                                        CLARE
                        It appears that Bonzo is attracted
                        to Miss Tuffet's Derfume... Eau De
                        Banana Peel.

        Tyki has gone back to his ARTWORK. A FASCINATED Indiana looks over the
        pygmy's shoulder.

                                        INDIANA
                        Where did you find him?...

                                        CLARE
                        About ten miles from here. We were
                        on a photographic expedition...in
                        the thick of the jungle... I heard
                        sounds. Whimpering. Moaning. I took
                        a few steps, and found Tyki. He was
                        lying in a shallow swamp...semi
                        conscious...a high fever...nearly
                        dead from exhaustion. He had
                        obviously been travelling on foot
                        for many days, over countless
                        miles... So I brought him back to
                        the compound...nursed him back to
                        health...

        Indiana STARES at the pygmy. A skeptical look COVERS his face.

                                        INDIANA
                        Clare, I hate to quibble with your
                        anthropological abilities...

                                        CLARE
                        Quibble.

                                        INDIANA
                        ...but if this little fellow is over
                        200 years old... I mean... What
                        accounts for his youthful
                        appearance?...his vitality?...

        Clare OPENS a door at the rear of the cage. It LEADS into another
        room, directly behind the CAGE. Clare and Indiana ENTER. Scraggy STAYS
        behind. He EXCHANGES a friendly smile with Tyki. Meanwhile, in the
        BACKGROUND, we see BETSY and the CHIMPANZEE. They ROLL BY on the
        ground. Still WRESTLING.

        CLOSE UP: PEACE STONE.

        A FRUIT FLY crawls along the peach pit's surface.

                                        CLARE (O.S.)
                        Tyki was wearing this when I found
                        him.

        CAMERA PULLS BACK. We are in a SMALL, STERILE ROOM. The peach stone
        rests on a TABLE. Indiana and Clare STAND over the stone. Indy PICKS
        UP the stone, examining it. An annoying FRUIT FLY buzzes around Indy's
        head. CAMERA PANS DOWN to Indiana's trouser leg. The RADIO TRANSMITTOR
        is still attached to his pants. The tiny bug's eyes BLINK. RED.

                                                                        CUT TO:

        SGT. GUTTERBUHG.

        He stands inside of Nazi Headquarters, huddled over the RADIO. The
        VOICES of Indiana and Clare echo over the speaker. Gutterbuhg
        FURIOUSLY transcribes the conversation.

                                        CLARE (O.S.)
                        Dr. Jones, you are obviously
                        familiar with the legend of Sun Wu-
                        King's Garden of Immortal Peaches?...

                                        INDIANA (O.S.)
                        A bite from the fruit of that peach
                        tree would give a person eternal
                        life...make them forever young...

        The vicious Gutterbuhg SMILES. CAMERA PANS to his notebook. Gutterbuhg
        underlines the words "FOREVER YOUNG".

                                                                        CUT BACK TO:

        INDIANA

        STUDYING the peach pit. The fruit fly continues to BUZZ around
        Indiana's head.

                                        INDIANA
                        There's nothing unusual about this
                        ...nothing to indicate that it's
                        from Sun Wu Kung's garden...

        The fruit fly LANDS on Indiana's neck. Indy SMACKS the fly! KILLING
        it! A SHOCKED Clare RUNS to Indiana. She GRABS his hand and GENTLY
        removes what remains of the fruit fly. She GLARES at Indiana. FURIOUS.

                                        CLARE
                        This fruit fly had a normal life-
                        span of TWENTY FOUR HOURS.
                                (frustrated sigh)
                        As an experiment...the fly was put
                        in this room...alone...with only the
                        peach stone to sustain its
                        existence. The fly stayed alive for
                        THREE WEEKS.
                                (looks at dead fly)
                        Until now.

        She FLICKS the'fly against the wall. Indy gives an EMBARASSED SHRUG.

                                        INDIANA
                        Sorry.

        Indiana and Clare are suddenly INTERRUPTED by the sound of Scraggy and
        Tyki's LAUGHTER. This is followed by the two of them having a
        DISCUSSION! In Tyki's FOREIGN TONGUE! Clare and Indy exchange a
        SHOCKED GLANCE and DASH out of the room.

        INT. CAGE

        Scraggy and Tyki are having a CONVERSATION. Clare POINTS to Scraggy,
        giving a PUZZLED LOOK to Indiana.

                                        CLARE
                        He understands him?

                                        INDIANA
                                (nods)
                        Scraggy knows hundreds of
                        languages... He's the best guide in
                        Africa.
                                (turns to Scraggy)
                        Ask Tyki where he came from.

        Scraggy NODS and ASKS Tyki. Tyki ANSWERS and POINTS to the painting of
        the clouds. Scraggy TRANSLATES.

                                        SCRAGGY
                        He say... "I come from 'Land Of City
                        On Clouds'".

                                        INDIANA
                                (puzzled)
                        Huh?... What the hell's that s'posed
                        to mean?
                                (to Scraggy)
                        Can he take us there?

        Scraggy ASKS Tyki. Tyki ANSWERS. He and Scraggy LAUGH hysterically.
        Scraggy LOOKS at Indiana.

                                        SCRAGGY
                        He say if he could... He would go
                        back!

        Tyki OFFERS some more information to Scraggy. Scraggy TRANSLATES.

                                        SCRAGGY
                        He say "Pai Cho" may help you.

        Indiana's eyes WIDEN. STARTLED. AMAZED. Clare LOOKS at Indy. PUZZLED.

                                        CLARE
                        "Pai Cho"?

                                        INDIANA
                        The Sacres Proverbs and Writings of
                        Sun Wu Kung.
                                (anxious, looking at
                                Scraggy)
                        His disciples always carry the Pai
                        Cho with them...

        Scraggy ASKS Tyki. The pygmy NODS and REMOVES his belt. We see that
        the thick belt actually unravels into a CLOTH SCROLL. Tyki KISSES the
        scroll and GIVES it to Scraggy. Scraggy nervously OPENS the scroll. It
        is filled with countless ANCIENT CHINESE WRITINGS and PROVERBS.
        Indiana STARES over Scraggy's shoulder.

                                        INDIANA
                        Can you translate it?...

        Scraggy NODS. Indiana's eyes ANXIOUSLY scan the document. He is
        BREATHLESS. EXCITED. The SOUND TRACK MUSIC SOARS.

        Suddenly, BETSY AND THE CHIMPANZEE FALL INTO FRAME! ON TOP OF THE
        SCROLL! Bonzo STRADDLES Betsy, trying to move his lips TOWARD hers!
        She is SCREAMING!

                                        BETSY
                        Get...him...off...of...me...!

        Bonzo moves its lips to Betsy and gives her a BIG KISS! SMACK! Betsy
        GRIMACES. Finally, Clare begins to make BIZARRE MONKEY HAND MOTIONS
        and SOUNDS. Bonzo TURNS. He UNDERSTANDS Clare. She continues to
        COMMUNICATE with the chimp, until Bonzo turns and RUNS out of the
        cage! Indiana and Scraggy exchange an IMPRESSED GLANCE. Betsy WIPES
        the kiss from her lips.

                                                                        CUT TO:

        CLOSE UP: A FLASHING NEON SIGN.

        It reads: "DASHIELL'S AMERICAN BAR". It adorns the front of a stylish,
        Mozambique NIGHTCLUB.

        INT. DASHIELL'S BAR

        DIMLY lit. SMOKY. Filled with cloth covered TABLES and ornamental,
        AFRICAN furnishings. A 9 piece JAZZ BAND plays SWING TUNES. A few
        couples SWAY on the dance floor. The place is swarming with NAZIS.
        Many are SEATED at the bar. Others are scattered at various TABLES
        throughout the restaurant. Some stand in CORNERS. Lurking in the
        SHADOWS. They are all looking in one direction, watching one man...
        INDIANA JONES.

        Indy sits with Scraggy, Clare and Betsy, at a table near the REAR of
        the restaurant. They are eating DINNER. But Indy, Scraggy and Clare
        are more interested in the Stone Monkey SCROLLS. A very NERVOUS
        Scraggy TRANSLATES. Indiana, wearing his spectacles, takes pages and
        pages of NOTES. Searching for a CLUE. An INTERESTED Clare reads over
        Indiana's shoulder. Betsy tries to become INCLUDED in the discussion.
        But everyone IGNORES her. Scraggy continues to TRANSLATE.

                                        SCRAGGY
                        "Sun Wu Kung run like fire,
                        He journey to Many Monkey Land,
                        To build his final empire."

                                        BETSY
                        Who's Sun Wu-Kung?

                                        INDIANA
                                (ignoring Betsy, to
                                Scraggy)
                        Many Monkey Land... That's a
                        definite reference to Africa.

                                        BETSY
                        Africa?... He journeyed to
                        Africa?...

                                        CLARE
                                (also ignores Betsy, to
                                Indiana)
                        That confirms our suspicions that he
                        may have formed his Civilization
                        here...

                                        BETSY
                        What civilization?

                                        INDIANA
                                (angry, to Betsy)
                        Betsy. Keep your trap shut. This
                        doesn't concern you.

                                        BETSY
                                (insulted)
                        Fine. Terrific. Who cares about this
                        stuff anyway! We're in a nightclub.
                        We should be havin' fun.
                                (grabs Indiana's hand)
                        C'mon, Indy. Let's dance.

                                        INDIANA
                        Later.

                                        BETSY
                        What a buncha' stiffs!
                                (condescending, to
                                Clare)
                        Bet you can't dance.

                                        CLARE
                        Quite the contrary...I spent several
                        months studying dance.

                                        BETSY
                        Oh yeah? Whattayou' know?... The
                        Bunny Hop?... The Jitterbug?...

                                        CLARE
                                (shakes her head)
                        The Bondogea. The Kyebe Kyebe. The
                        Dungumaro.

                                        BETSY
                        Huh?

                                        CLARE
                        African Tribal dances.

                                        BETSY
                        Never heard of 'em.

                                        CLARE
                        Of course not. They're beyond the
                        spectrum of your microscopic world.

        Insulted, Betsy GOBBLES down her glass of wine and TURNS back to
        Indiana, who is still deeply CONCENTRATING on the scrolls.

        UNDER THE TABLE

        Betsy's FOOT reaches across the floor. It RESTS on Indy's leg. Betsy
        begins to RUB against Indiana's trouser leg. The red eyed MECHANICAL
        BUG is still attached to Indiana's trousers.

        INDIANA

        GLARES at Betsy. Clare REACHES for her cup of coffee. She NOTICES that
        the coffee cup trembles SLIGHTLY. Clare GLANCES beneath the table, and
        sees Betsy RUBBING Indy's leg. Clare is DISGUSTED.

        ABOVE the table, Clare shoots a scowl of DISAPPROVAL at Indy. A
        FLUSTERED Indy tries to explain...but is suddenly INTERRUPTED by a
        hand on his shoulder. It is DASHIELL, the suave, HANDSOME owner of the
        restaurant. Dashiell gives a CaARMING SMILE to everyone at the table.

                                        DASHIELL
                        Enjoying your dinners?...

        Everyone NODS, expressing their thanks. Dashiell LEANS close to
        Indiana and WHISPERS.

                                        DASHIELL
                        Watch yourself, sport. Most of the
                        talk here tonight is about you. And
                        it isn't good.

        Indiana's eyes DART around the room. He sees the VARIOUS NAZIS.
        WATCHING him. Indy gives a CONFIDENT SMILE. A WORRIED Dashiell
        continues WHISPERING to Indiana.

                                        DASHIELL
                        I don't know what you've done to the
                        Nazis. But they are certainly no
                        friends of yours.

                                                                        CUT TO:

        EXT. ZOOLOGICAL COMPOUND

        DARK. SILENT. Many of the animals are ASLEEP in their cages. A
        SECURITY GUARD keeps watch on the compound. He STANDS outside of the
        METAL GATES. There is a SUDDEN SOUND. The guard TURNS.

        THE FIGURES OF THREE MEN stand before him. In the SHADOWS. The NERVOUS
        Guard places a hand on his holster.

                                        GUARD
                        Who's there?...

        We hear a MECHANICAL CREAK. A MAN'S LEATHER GLOVED HAND extends from
        the shadows. The hand's FINGER is POINTED at the Security GUARD.

        CLOSE UP: VARIOUS ANIMALS

        The sound of RAPID MACHINE GUN FIRE echoes throughout the camp! CAMERA
        RECORDS the animal's SHOCKED REACTIONS!

        THE SECURITY GUARD

        lies on the GROUND. DEAD. His body riddled with BULLETS. The SHINY,
        BLACK BOOTS of the three men PASS his body. We notice that one of the
        boot's SHOELACES are untied.

        TYKI

        STARES into the dark night. FEAR covers his face. He is SEATED inside
        of his cage. A CANDLE flickers beside him. Tyki's hands REST on the
        beautiful tapestry. Tyki LISTENS. He hears FOOTSTEPS. COMING toward
        his cage. Tyki REACHES to his side. He grabs a STONE DAGGER.

        Suddenly, a LOOD GONSHOT! The SPLINTERED LOCK from Tyki's cage goes
        spinning across the floor. The cage door CREAKS OPEN.

        GUTTERBUHG stands in the doorway. TWO NAZI SOLDIERS, HELMUT and KLACE
        (who we met earlier), are beside him. Gutterbuhg SMILES. His stiff
        right arm EXTENDS from his side. His leather gloved INDEX FINGER is
        POINTING ahead.

        Tyki GROWLS at the Nazis. He STANDS. RAISING the stone dagger OVER HIS
        HEAD.

        Gutterbuhg's FINGER BEGINS TO RAPIDLY FIRE BULLETS! His MECHANICAL ARM
        is actually a A MACEINE GUN!

        The bullets TEAR through Tyki's tapestry. They make a crooked,
        tattered line through the BEAUTIFOL WORK. DESTROYING it. A terrified
        Tyki WATCHES.

        Gutterbuhg STOPS shooting. He REMOVES the empty cartridge from a SLOT
        in his mechanical arm, and REPLACES it with another. He points the
        DEADLY FINGER at Tyki. A trembling Tyki DROPS the dagger. The three
        NAZIS walk toward the helpless pygmy.

                                                                        CUT TO:

        INT. DASHIELL'S BAR

        Indiana, Scraggy and Clare CONTINUE to excitedly STUDY the map. A
        NEGLECTED Betsy POURS herself the last of the wine. She is very DRUNK,
        singing along with the band's version of Cole Porter's "Night and
        Day".

        BENEATH THE TABLE

        Betsy continues to RUB her FOOT against Indiana's leg.

        INDIANA

        tries to IGNORE Betsy's playing. Scraggy continues to TRANSLATE the
        scroll.

                                        SCRAGGY
                        "With his Golden Hooped Rod,
                        And its powerful lightning rays,
                        Sun Wu Kung build Water Curtain Cave,
                        Where he live for 500 days."

                                        CLARE
                        The Golden Hooped Rod?

                                        INDIANA
                        A heavenly staff with many different
                        powers...most notably, it had the
                        ability to transform itself into
                        hundreds of objects...
                                (staring)
                        It remains the most priceless
                        treasure of Sun Wu Kung's empire.

                                        CLARE
                        And what is the...the Water Curtain
                        Cave?

                                        INDIANA
                        Sun Wu Kung's legendary hideout...an
                        enormous secret cave, hidden behind
                        a running waterfall.

        Clare again REACHES for her coffee. The cup and saucer are still
        TREMBLING. Clare PEEKS under the table, and again SEES Betsy's foot
        RUBBING Indiana's leg. Clare gives a revolted GRUMBLE. Indiana
        EXCITEDLY explains Scraggy's translation.

                                        INDIANA
                        This proves that the Water Curtain
                        Cave exists in Africa...
                                (to Scraggy)
                        Does it mention anything about Sun
                        Wu Kung's travels?

                                        SCRAGGY
                                (reading scroll)
                        Only place called..."Twisted Snake
                        Water".

                                        INDIANA
                        The Zarnbesi River! It has a
                        reputation for its deadly water
                        snakes...

                                        CLARE
                        It would have been Sun Wu Kung's
                        logical path.

                                        INDIANA
                                (confident, anxious)
                        It will also be our logical path.

        Clare SMILES.

        BENEATH THE TABLE

        Betsy's foot CONTINUES to rub Indiana's leg. Finally Indy reaches
        down, trying to SLAP Betsy's foot away! But Indy's hand STUMBLES upon
        something else. The MECHANICAL BUG. Indy TRIES to remove the bug. But
        the tiny device WON'T BUDGE.

        ABOVE TABLE

        Indiana's hand is buried beneath the table, STRUGGLING to remove the
        bug. To Clare, it appears as if Indy is PLAYING with Betsy's foot.
        Clare gives an INCREDULOUS look to Indiana.

                                        CLARE
                        Please try to control that monstrous
                        libido of yours!

        Indiana finally REMOVES the mechanical bug. He LIFTS it above the
        table. EXAMINING it. Clare is about to ASK a question. Indy INDICATES
        for her to "Shhhh". He COVERS the bug and WHISPERS to the others.

                                        INDIANA
                        We have to get back to the compound.
                        Tyki may be in danger.

        Indiana, Clare and Scraggy HURRY from the table. A TIPSY Betsy
        Follows. Indiana passes the JAZZ BAND. He nonchalantly DROPS the
        mechanical bug into the trumpet player's HORN! The trumpet player
        hits a PIERCING HIGH NOTE!

                                                                        CUT T0:

        NAZI HEADQUARTERS

        The Nazi wearing the radio HEADPHONES emits a LOUD SCREAM! His
        eardrums BURSTING with the trumpet sound!

                                                                        CUT TO:

        INT. COMPOUND

        Gutterbuhg, Klaus and Helmut LEAD the bound and gagged Tyki OUT OF THE
        COMPOUND. They keep their LUGERS at his back. Suddenly, Klaus TRIPS
        over something. A FAWN. Klaus GROWLS. He SHOUTS a German order to
        Helmut, who GRABS a tight hold of the baby deer. Klaus AIMS his luger
        at the fawn's head. Gutterbuhg and Helmut exchange a chilling LAUGH.
        Tyki stares in HORROR. Klaus CLICKS the luger...ready to SHOOT...

        There is an earth shattering CRACK! A WHIP SHOOTS INTO FRAME! The whip
        WRAPS ITSELF around the luger! TEARING the gun OUT of Klaus' hand! The
        fawn breaks FREE and RUNS OFF. The Nazis exchange a SHOCKED glance.
        They TURN and SEE

        INDIANA JONES! He stands a FEW FEET away. Holding the WHIP. Indiana
        POINTS to Tyki, angrilly SHOUTING to the Nazis.

                                        INDIANA
                        Get your hands off him.

        Gutterbuhg LAUGES. He POINTS his finger at Indiana. Indy is PUZZLED.
        The finger begins to SHOOT! RAPID MACHINE GUN FIRE! Indy DIVES for
        cover.

        Holding Tyki CAPTIVE, the Nazis TURN and begin to RUN out of the
        compound. Indy gets to his FEET. He LIFTS his gun. Ready to SHOOT. But
        the Nazis are running behind SEVERAL ROWS OF CAGES, filled with
        ANIMALS. Indiana CAN'T SHOOT. He dashes back OUTSIDE.

        EXT. ZOOLOGICAL COMPOUND

        Located on the WATERFRONT. Countless rows of LONG, WOODEN DOCKS line
        the marina. The Nazis run to below a ROTTED, ANCIENT DOCK. Here, one
        of their SPEEDBOATS waits. Motor RUNNING. RUDOLPH, a pudgy Nazi, is at
        the wheel. The Nazis hurriedly CLIMB into the speedboat, PUSHING Tyki
        inside with them.

        Indy RUNS to Scraggy's Model-T. Scraggy SITS in the driver's seat.
        Betsy and Clare SIT in the rear. A drunk Betsy still sings "Night and
        Day". Indy leaps onto the SIDEBOARD. He SEES the Nazis ahead, CLIMBING
        into the speedboat. Indy motions for Scraggy to DRIVE. FAST. TOWARD
        the dock.

        The Nazi speedboat SHOOTS FORWARD. Moving BENEATH the dock.

        Scraggy's Model-T FOLLOWS ABOVE, along the SHAKY dock. Indiana RIDES
        the car's rusted sideboard. He SEES the speedboat below, through the
        WIDE OPENINGS in the dock's slated boards. Indy begins to SHOOT at the
        Nazis. Gutterbuhg raises his mechanical arm, FIRING SHOTS back at
        Indiana.

        Machine gun fire SPLINTERS the dock boards, SLICING through the
        Model-T. The side mirror is BLASTED to pieces. The floor beneath Betsy
        and Clare erupts with FLYING BULLETS. JUST MISSING the girls. Clare is
        HORRIFIED. Betsy laughs HYSTERICALLY.

        The Model-T is less than TWENTY FEET from the end of the dock. If they
        continue ahead, the car will PLUNGE SEVERAL FEET INTO THE WATER! But
        Scraggy doesn't take his FOOT from the gas.

        GUTTERBUHG smiles, seeing the vast ocean ahead. Knowing he's almost
        FREE.

        As he DODGES bullets, Indiana SEES the end of the dock ahead. He
        SHOUTS to Scraggy.

                                        INDIANA
                        When I tell you... Hit the brakes!

        Scraggy NODS. The end of the dock is only a FEW FEET ahead. Getting
        CLOSER... CLOSER... Clare COVERS her eyes. Between hiccups, Betsy
        laughingly SINGS. Indy LOOKS to the speedboat... BACK to the
        approaching dock edge... He PAUSES... WAITING for the right moment...
        He SCREAMS!

                                        INDIANA
                        Now, Scraggy!

        Scraggy's foot SLAMS ON THE BRAKES! The sudden jolt sends Indy FLYING
        INTO THE AIR!

        The speedboat SHOOTS OUT from beneath the dock! Indiana LANDS DIRECTLY
        ON TOP OF THE SPEEDBOAT! A SPECTACULAR STUNT!

        Helmut POINTS his gun at Indy. Indy reacts with a SWIFT KICK to
        Helmut's jaw. The Nazi HITS the deck. OUT COLD. Klaus COMES for Indy.
        They begin to FIGHT. An angry Gutterbuhg tries to SHOOT... But Indy
        and Klaus move TOO QUICKLY! Gutterbuhg CAN'T get a clear shot.

        The Model-T has COME TO A STOP. SAFE. Its front wheels TEETER over the
        dock's edge. Scraggy, Betsy and Clare GET OUT. Clare CATCHES her
        breath. Knees SHAKING. Betsy is still LAUGHING.

                                        BETSY
                        About time we had some fun!

        A WORRIED Scraggy sees Indiana, FIGHTING with the Nazis.

                                        SCRAGGY
                        Bad spirits have Indy! He in
                        trouble! Big trouble!

        Scraggy RUNS OFF SCREEN.

        The Nazi speedboat is HEADED TOWARD THE SIDE OF AN ENORMOUS OCEAN
        LINER! Gutterbuhg RADIOS for help. Indiana and Klaus continue to
        FIGHT. ROLLING along the deck. Exchanging PUNCHES. A bound Tyki
        watches with WIDE EYES. HELPLESS.

        The speedboat makes a sudden SHARP TURN. AVOIDING A COLLISION with the
        Ocean liner. Indiana and Klaus TUMBLE OFF, THE BOAT! INTO THE WATER!

        UNDERWATER

        Indiana and Klaus CONTINUE their battle. They wrestle only a few feet
        from the ship's large, SPINNING STEEL PROPELLERS. The propellers
        create a SUCTION FORCE. DRAWING Indy and Klaus CLOSER... CLOSER...
        toward a SPINNING DEATH.

        Indy and Klaus grab hold of a dangling, STEEL ANCHOR. PREVENTING their
        bodies from being sucked into the propellers. Klaus PULLS a
        switchblade from his pocket. He ATTACKS Indy's CLENCHED FINGERS with
        the knife. Indy begins to LOSE HIS GRIP. His body INCHES toward the
        propellers. Klaus RAISES the knife, to FINISH OFF Indiana...

        But Klaus' UNTIED SHOELACE dangles beside the propellers. The shoelace
        CATCHES a spinning blade. The SHOCKED Nazi is pulled INTO THE
        PROPELLERS!

        Indiana TURNS AWAY, holding TIGHTLY to the anchor. A BLOOD RED CLOUD
        surges through the surrounding water. Indiana CLIMBS the anchor to
        safety.

        ABOVE WATER

        Indiana SURFACES. Taking a GULP of air. Suddenly, the water in front
        of him erupts with MACHINE GUN FIRE. Indiana SEES

        GOTTERBUHG! He has PARKED the Nazi speedboat only a FEW FEET AWAY.
        Gutterbuhg SMILES, pointing his FINGER at the helpless Indiana. A
        SITTING DUCK. Gutterbuhg SMILES.

                                        GUTTERBUHG
                        Goodnight, Doctor Jones.

        There is a LOUD GUNSHOT! Gutterbuhg's mechanical arm is HIT BY A
        BULLET! Pieces of SPRING, METAL and SPROCKETS fly from the wound.
        Gutterbuhg TURNS. FURIOUS.

        DASHIELL, the nightclub owner, is a few feet away. He is driving a
        sleek SPEEDBOAT, its side adorned with the AMERICAN FLAG. Dashiell
        points a PISTOL at Gutterbuhg, ready to take ANOTHER SHOT...

        With a ROAR, The Nazi speedboat DRIVES AWAY! Toward a CLUSTER OF
        DOCKS! Indiana CLIMBS into Dashiell's speedboat.

                                        DASHIELL
                        Scraggy said you might be needing
                        some help, sport.

        Dashiell HITS the gas. TEARING after the Nazis.

        A FRENZIED, HIGH SPEED CHASE BEGINS! Through the DARKNESS. Beneath the
        ROWS OF DOCKS. The speedboats face countless OBSTACLES. They SWERVE
        around a virtual forest of wooden poles, which FLY BY AT BREAKNECK
        SPEED! The men DUCK and DODGE dangling FISH HOOKS and NETS. Many paths
        are BLOCKED by the wooden RAFTS and ROWBOATS. (NOTE: Because of the
        darkness, these obstacles APPEAR only when they are a FEW FEET AHEAD
        of the speedboats. This makes the chase completely SURPRISING and
        SCARY, causing a FUNHOUSE effect.)

        Throughout the chase, Indiana and the Nazis continue to exchange
        GUNFIRE. A frustrated Gutterbuhg CAN'T SHOOT. His mechanical-machine
        gun arm rendered USELESS by Dashiell's bullet. He continues to RADIO
        Nazi headquarters for help.

        Dashiell CATCHES UP with the Nazis. The two speedboats travel SIDE BY
        SIDE. Their edges SCRAPE together. SPARKS fly. The recovered Helmut
        AIMS his luger at Indiana... But Indy LEAPS toward the Nazi. The two
        FALL. ROLLING. TUMBLING. STRUGGLING for the gun. They fight BETWEEN
        the two speedboats. The crack below them slightly OPENING and CLOSING.

        Up ahead, an ENORMOUS STONE POLE appears. To AVOID a collision, the
        speedboats MUST SEPARATE. Dashiell SCREAMS.

                                        DASHIELL
                        Indy! Rollout!

        Indy FREES himself from Helmut and ROLLS back onto Dashiell's boat.
        Helmut LOOKS UP. He sees the stone pole AHEAD. COMING AT HIM. Helmut
        tries to MOVE...TOO LATE. The two boats SEPARATE. Helmut SMACKS into
        the pole! CRUSHED!

        Dashiell TURNS AWAY from the wheel, looking at Indiana.

                                        DASHIELL
                        You okay, sport?

        Indiana begins to answer...then sees SOMETHING. AHEAD. He SCREAMS.

                                        INDIANA
                        Dash!...

        Dashiell TURNS BACK. The speedboat is HEADED STRAIGHT FOR A SOLID
        WOODEN WALL! A sign on the wall reads: FUTTERMAN'S FISHING WAREHOUSE.

        The Nazi speedboat has already made a SHARP TURN, AVOIDING the
        warehouse. There's NO TIME for Dashiell to TURN. Indy HITS the deck.
        The speedboat ARCHES upward, at an ANGLE... CRASH! The speedboat
        BLASTS into the warehouse. Splintered wood SPLATTERS through the air.

        INT. WAREHOUSE

        Dashiell's speedboat BURSTS through another wall. The boat SKIDS
        across the warehouse floor. SCREECHING TO A STOP! A SHAKEN Dashiell
        gets out. Indy RUNS to the window.

        INDIANA'S POV

        The NAZI SPEEDBOAT shoots out of the docks, ESCAPING across the water.

        Indiana grabs his WHIP. He KICKS OPEN the warehouse window. He SNAPS
        his wrist. CRACK. The whip SHOOTS forward, ATTACHING ITSELF TO THE
        REAR OF THE NAZI SPEEDBOAT! Indy firmly GRIPS his end of the whip. The
        whip TIGHTENS. WHOOSH! Indiana is PULLED out of the window.

        Gutterbuhg exchanges a VICTORIOUS laugh with Rudolph, the speedboat
        driver, thinking they have LOST Indiana. A frightened Tyki LOOKS BACK.
        His eyes suddenly fill with HOPE. Gutterbuhg TURNS. His mouth DROPS
        OPEN.

        Indiana uses his WHIP to WATER SKI BEHIND THE NAZI SPEEDBOAT! A red
        faced Gutterbuhg SLAMS his fist on the dashboard. He removes a SHARP
        KNIFE. He hurriedly begins to SLICE through Indy's whip. Trying to
        BREAK THE CONNECTION.

        Indiana AIMS his pistol at Gutterbuhg. But suddenly, a SHOT WHIZZES by
        Indy's head. Followed by ANOTHER. And ANOTHER. COMING from behind.
        Indy TURNS. A SECOND NAZI SPEEDBOAT is in HOT PURSUIT! There are FIVE
        NAZIS inside. Armed with PISTOLS and RIFLES. All FIRING SHOTS at
        Indiana.

        Meanwhile, Gutterbuhg's knife continues to SLICE through Indy's whip.
        Only a FEW THREADS remain.

        Indiana performs some EXPERT WATER SKIING. SWERVING. SPINNING.
        JUMPING. All in an attempt to AVOID the flying bullets from behind.
        Suddenly, Indy's whip SNAPS! Indiana FALLS UNDERWATER! Directly IN THE
        PATH of the seccnd Nazi speedboat!

        Tyki HIDES his eyes. Gutterbuhg LAUGHS. It appears that Indiana has
        met a GRISLY DEATH.

        The Nazis in the second speedboat are DELIGHTED. SHAKING each other's
        hands. CAMERA PANS TO BELOW the speedboat. We move UNDERWATER. SOUND
        TRACK MUSIC SOARS! We see INDIANA. Very much ALIVE. He STRADDLES THE
        BOTTOM OF THE SPEEDING BOAT! HOLDING ON with all of his strength!
        Indiana CLIMBS toward the side of the speedboat, BATTLING the pressure
        of the rushing water.

        CAMERA FOLLOWS INDIANA, OUT OF THE WATER, AS HE CLIMBS ABOARD THE
        SECOND SPEEDBOAT. The four Nazis are LAUGHING. TALKING. Their backs
        turned to the APPROACHING Indiana. Moving like LIGHTNING, Indy GRABS
        one of the Nazis and TOSSES HIM OVERBOARD. With a SWIFT PUNCH to the
        stomach and jaw, Indy sends another Nazi INTO THE WATER. The other two
        Nazis TACKLE Indy. They FALL to the deck. FIGHTING.

        Gutterbuhg LOOKS BACK. SHOCKED that Indy is still alive. Gutterbuhg
        GROWLS. FRUSTRATED. His eyes suddenly LIGHT. He SPOTS something.
        AHEAD.

        TWO GARGANTUAN OCEAN LINERS

        are MOVING TOWARD EACH OTHER. Coming TOGETHER. There is an OPENING
        between the two ships, that continues to get SMALLER, as the ships
        move CLOSER.

        Gutterbuhg SMILES. An IDEA. He orders Rudolph to DRIVE THROUGH THE
        OPENING.

        In the second speedboat, the Nazis have OVERCOME Indiana. One Nazi
        PINS Indy down. The other removes a THICK METAL CHAIN from his neck. A
        RED SWASTIKA dangles from the chain. The Nazi WRAPS the chain around
        Indy's neck. He begins to STRANGLE Indiana.

        Gutterbuhg's speedboat MOVES TOWARD the ocean liners. The opening
        between the two ships continues to SHRINK. Getting SMALLER...and
        SMALLER...

        The second speedboat is DIRECTLY BEHIND Gutterbuhg. The Nazis are
        STRANGLING Indiana. The color begins to LEAVE Indy's face. He GASPS
        for air.

        The opening between the two Ocean liners continues to get SMALLER...
        Less than TEN FEET WIDE. Gutterbuhg's speedboat is only a FEW FEET
        AWAY.

        Through his fluttering eyes, Indiana SEES Gutterbuhg's speedboat
        headed for the ocean liners. Indiana is nearly UNCONSCIOUS. The
        giggling Nazis TIGHTEN the chain around his neck.

        With LESS THAN AN INCH to spare... Gutterbuhg's speedboat SQUEEZES
        between the two Ocean Liners!

        The second speedboat is only a FEW FEET from the Ocean Liners. But as
        the ships move CLOSER...the opening is nearly CLOSED. The driver CAN'T
        TURN AWAY. He's TOO CLOSE. He emits a SCREAM. The Nazis PAUSE from
        strangling Indiana. They TURN.

        Indy MOVES FAST. He DIVES overboard. INTO THE WATER.

        The speedboat HITS the opening. TOO SMALL. The speedboat is CRUSHED
        between the two Ocean Liners. The Nazis let out their FINAL SCREAMS.
        Followed by a fiery EXPLOSION! Flaming pieces of the wreckage are
        SPLATTERED through the night sky.

        GOTTERBUHG turns. His grinning, sadistic face LIT by the explosion.
        Tyki's eyes are filled with FEAR.

        SEVERAL FEET AWAY, Indiana Jones SURFACES. ALIVE. He SWIMS to the
        nearby shore and CLIMBS out of the water. He RUBS his reddened neck,
        catches his breath and LOOKS into the distance. Indy SEES Gutterbuhg's
        speedboat. TOO FAR to catch.

        GUTTERBUHG sees the SILHOUETTE of Indy, standing on the distant shore.
        Gutterbuhg orders the driver to move FASTER. The engine ROARS.
        Gutterbuhg LOOKS back at Indy. The Nazi emits a MANIACAL LAUGH that
        pierces the air.

        Indiana watches the speedboat ESCAPE into the night. His eyes fill
        with RAGE. VENGEANCE. Clare, Scraggy and a VERY DRUNK Betsy JOIN Indy
        on the shore. Betsy PUTS her arms around Indiana. She RESTS her head
        on his shoulder. She CLOSES her eyes and emits a DRUNKEN SIGH.

                                        BETSY
                        What a romantic night!

        An ANNOYED Indy pushes Betsy away. In a drunken stupor, Betsy moves to
        the next person, CLARE. Thinking she's still with Indiana, Betsy puts
        her arms AROUND Clare. A WORRIED Clare is TOO CONCERNED with the
        departing Nazi speedboat. Clare TURNS to Inqy.

                                        CLARE
                        Will they hurt Tyki?

                                        INDIANA
                                (shaking his head)
                        They know he's important to us.
                                (holds up ancient
                                scroll)
                        They'll use him to bargain for this.

        Eyes CLOSED, resting her head on Clare's shoulder, Betsy SIGHS.

                                        BETSY
                        Indy, you smell so good! So
                        masculine!

        Clare PUSHES Betsy away. Betsy SPINS and WRAPS HER ARMS around
        Scraggy. Clare watches the Nazi Speedboat DISAPPEAR into the night.

                                        CLARE
                        Will they be following us?

                                        INDIANA
                        Every step of the way.

        Betsy, still thinking she's SNUGGLING with Indiana, rubs her face
        against Scraggy's bristly beard.

                                        BETSY
                        Mmmm, Indy. I love it when you don't
                        shave. It's so sexy!

        Scraggy PUSHES Betsy away. She SPINS, this time putting her arms
        around a hanging FISHERMAN'S NET. Filled with FISH. Meanwhile, Scraggy
        LOOKS at Indiana and Clare.

                                        SCRAGGY
                        Pandoola, God of Purity, say...
                        "Always stay ten paces ahead of bad
                        spirit".

                                        INDIANA
                        Exactly. We can't let the Nazis get
                        to the City first. If they do,
                        they'll wipe out one of the greatest
                        archeological finds in History!

        Indiana turns and WALKS AWAY. Clare and Scraggy hurriedly FOLLOW.
        There's NO TIME to lose. The drunken Betsy continues to embrace the
        net of DEAD FISH. Betsy TURNS. Eyes CLOSED. She SMILES.

                                        BETSY
                        How 'bout a little goodnight kiss?

        Betsy KISSES the LIPS OF A DEAD FISH! She SMILES. IMPRESSED.

                                        BETSY
                        Mmmmm, Indy...you really know the
                        way to a girl's heart!

        Betsy OPENS her eyes. FACE TO FACE with the dead fish. Betsy SCREAMS
        and RUNS toward the departing Indiana, Clare and Scraggy!

        EXT. ZAMBESI RIVER - THE FOLLOWING DAY

        Early MORNING. The sparkling waters of the Zambesi are lined by thick
        JUNGLE. Sounds of screeching GIBBONS, exotic BIRDS, chattering
        INSECTS, and various other WILDLIFE echo from the jungle. BRIGHT RAYS
        of HOT sunlight sprinkle through the leaves of the towering palm
        trees.

        A 55 foot, tattered, wooden RIVER BOAT, the "ADOBO", travels along the
        Zambesi. The boat is filled with various crates and barrels of
        SUPPLIES. And there are several men, CREW MEMBERS, all natives of
        Mozambique. They are a MOTLEY crew, all armed with SWORDS and DAGGERS.
        They are DIRTY. TATTERED. UNKEMPT. The boat pulls a long, WOODEN RAFT
        behind it. Scraggy's MODEL-T is attached to the raft. One of the crew
        members, a YOUNG MAN, sits on the raft. He strums a BEATEN GUITAR,
        singing a FOLK SONG.

        INDIANA stands at the ship's steering wheel. Forehead COVERED with
        sweat. He GUIDES the ship along the twisting waters. CLARE exits from
        a cabin, carrying a stenographer's NOTEBOOK. She looks RADIANT. Her
        red hair SHIMMERS in the morning sun. Clare walks up BESIDE Indy. She
        CRINKLES her nose.

                                        CLARE
                        What is that awful aroma?

                                        INDIANA
                        Scraggy's takin' a shower.

        Indy points OFF SCREEN. Scraggy, fully clothed, STANDS here. He rubs a
        large, FRESH ONION over his FACE, ARMS and LEGS. SQUEEZING the onion
        JUICE over his body. Indiana EXPLAINS to a befuddled Clare.

                                        INDIANA
                        He believes that onions keep bad
                        spirits from entering his body.

                                        CLARE
                                (writing in her
                                notebook)
                        In all my years of anthropology...
                        I've never run across anyone or
                        anything quite like Scraggy.

                                        INDIANA
                                (chuckles)
                        He's a rare breed.
                                (turns, looks at Clare
                                for the first time)
                        You're looking very lovely.

                                        CLARE
                        You're looking very lecherous.

                                        INDIANA
                                (turns away, angry)
                        Just tryin' to be friendly.

                                        CLARE
                        Save it for the schoolgirls.

                                        INDIANA
                        Look, Clare... Betsy's just an
                        anxious archeology student...she
                        admires my work...
                                (egotistical shrug)
                        Who can blame her?...
                                (back to his point)
                        But it's just some kinda' hero
                        worship thing...

        There was never any romance.

                                        BETSY
                                (pops in from OFF
                                SCREEN, kisses Indiana)
                        I dreamed about our first night
                        together!

        Indy SIGHS. Clare DISGUSTINGLY shakes her head. She continues to
        scrawl more into her notebook. Indiana gives her a STARTLED look.

                                        INDIANA
                        You're writin' this down?...

                                        CLARE
                                (nods)
                        I'm keeping an accurate record of
                        our journey.

                                        INDIANA
                        What's that got to do with my
                        personal life?

                                        CLARE
                        Evidence. I plan on testifying at
                        your child molestation trial.

        Indiana SHAKES his head. STARING into the distance. He SIGHS.

                                        INDIANA
                        Why do I do this to myself?

        Holding her head in PAIN, Betsy turns to Clare.

                                        BETSY
                                (holds her head in pain,
                                to Clare)
                        Hey, lady...you're s'posed to be a
                        Doctor...you got any cures for a
                        hangover?...

                                        CLARE
                        The best I've heard was used by a
                        New Zealand Tribe...
                                (pauses, thinking)
                        One part crushed owl skull...two
                        parts rhino saliva...one part zebra
                        dandruff.

        Betsy's face becomes PALE. Indy INTERRUPTS.

                                        INDIANA
                        No, No... Get a cup of donkey sweat
                        ...two spoons of skunk hair...and
                        one pint of shredded lizard tongue.

        Betsy turns a light shade of GREEN. Scraggy ARGUES.

                                        SCRAGGY
                        I always use family cure! Two spoons
                        chopped leeches... Half cup horse
                        mucous...two quarts crocodile urine!

                                        BETSY
                                (ready to throw up)
                        Ex...cuse...me...!

        Betsy runs OFF SCREEN. The others exchange a SHRUG. Scraggy LOOKS at
        the river ahead.

                                        SCRAGGY
                        How far we travel, Indy?...

                                        INDIANA
                        Almost 20 miles.

                                        CLARE
                        Any sign of the Nazis?

                                        INDIANA
                                (shakes his head,
                                confident)
                        Long as we keep up this pace...
                        they'll have trouble tracking us.

        CAMERA PANS from the hopeful faces of Indiana, Scraggy and Clare, to
        the CABIN behind them. Here, a CREW MEMBER HIDES in the shadows. His
        face HIDDEN. He HOLDS a small radio receiver. He WHISPERS into the
        receiver. Speaking in perfect GERMAN.

                                                                        CUT TO:

        GUTTERBUBG.

        He is seated in NAZI HEADQUARTERS. He repairs his detached, MACHINE
        GUN ARM, which sits on the table before him. Behind Gutterbuhg, a
        GROUP OF NAZIS listen to the radio transmission of Scraggy's
        treacherous Crew Member, who discloses the LOCATION of the River Boat.
        The Nazis CHART out the boat's exact location on a large, WALL MAP.
        LIEUT. MEPHISTO supervises the project. Tyki, BOUND, GAGGED and
        BRUISED, watches from a corner. MEPHISTO looks at all the Nazis.

                                        MEPHISTO
                                (German, English
                                subtitles)
                        We must leave. Immediately.

                                                                        DISSOLVE TO:

        NIGHT IN THE JUNGLE.

        VARIOUS SHOTS of exotic animals. A creeping PANTHER. A sleeping WHITE
        BAT. A tense SCORPION. A family of CROCODILES.

        ABOARD SHIP

        Indiana, Scraggy, Clare and Betsy are GATHERED on the deck. Seated in
        a CIRCLE. They are surrounded by the CREW MEMBERS. Everyone eats their
        DINNER from tin cans. The surrounding lanterns cast an EERIE LIGHT on
        the area. The young crew member plays a soft, SPOOKY tune on his
        guitar. Betsy is RESTLESS. She GLARES at the guitar player.

                                        BETSY
                        Don't you know somethin' else?
                        Somethin' upbeat?...

        The guitar player IGNORES Betsy, continuing to play. Betsy SIGHS.
        UPSET. BORED.

                                        BETSY
                        It's so hot... Stuffy... Do we have
                        to stay on this stupid boat all
                        night?...

                                        INDIANA
                                (nods)
                        We have to keep moving.

                                        BETSY
                        Can we at least jump in the
                        water?... Go for a swim?...

                                        CLARE
                        There's an old legend about the
                        Zambesi... In ancient times,
                        criminals were given their choice of
                        execution...or swimming across the
                        Zambesi. Most chose execution.

                                        INDIANA
                        Clare's right. We'll be safer on the
                        boat.
                                (annoyed, to Betsy)
                        Now quit moanin' and eat your food.

        An angry Betsy TOSSES her tin can overboard. She STANDS. FURIOUS with
        Indiana.

                                        BETSY
                        You are so rude! I travel thousands
                        of miles just to be with you...and
                        everybody treats me like dirt!
                                (to Clare)
                        Nobody even talks to me without
                        making some condescending remark
                        they think I'm too stupid to
                        understand!
                                (very upset)
                        So maybe I don't know a lot about
                        weird tribal dances... I'm still
                        pretty good with anthropology and
                        archeology... Maybe I could even
                        help you out...if somebody gave me a
                        chance...clued me in to what it is
                        we're doin' here...
                                (to Indy)
                        'Cause whether you like it or not,
                        Indiana Jones... I'm part of this
                        expedition, too!

        Clare RAISES an eyebrow. IMPRESSED. Indiana says NOTHING. He can't
        ARGUE. Scraggy INTERJECTS.

                                        SCRAGGY
                                (motions to crew
                                members)
                        My friends also curious about where
                        we journey to, Indy.

        The crew members NOD. STARING at Indiana. Indiana turns to Clare. She
        SMILES.

                                        CLARE
                        Tell us all a bedtime story, Doctor
                        Jones.

        Indiana SIGHS. The crew member's GUITAR PLAYING COMBINES with the
        SOUND TRACK, backing up Indiana's story with an EERIE TUNE.

                                        INDIANA
                        Long ago...a place known as the
                        Flower Fruit Mountain, in the
                        Chinese province of Ao-Lai...was
                        struck by lightning. A Stone Monkey,
                        "Sun Wu-Kung", was born.

                                        SCRAGGY
                        This monkey?... He could walk?...
                        Talk?... Like human?...

                                        INDIANA
                        More than human. He was blessed with
                        countless heavenly powers... But it
                        wasn't enough. Sun Wu-Kung wanted to
                        learn the secret of Eternal Life...
                        of Immortality...
                                (pause)
                        Equipped with his Golden Hooped Rod
                        to protect him, Sun Wu Kung
                        travelled the world for many years
                        ...learning the secret philosophies
                        and teachings of Eternal Youth.
                        Eventually, he was granted entrance
                        to heaven...where the Jade Emperor
                        gave Sun Wu Kung the title of "Great
                        Sage of the Heavens"...and permitted
                        him to oversee the Garden of
                        Immortal Peaches.
                                (pause)
                        After several years, the stone
                        monkey returned to somewhere on
                        earth. Here, he ruled an empire...a
                        Civilization of Monkeys and humans
                        who had life spans of many hundred
                        years...
                                (shrugs)
                        The exact whereabouts of that Lost
                        City has been a mystery for hundreds
                        of years...until Doctor Clarke
                        discovered the pygmy.

        The crew members, Scraggy, Betsy and Clare, listen with FASCINATION.

                                        INDIANA
                        It's uncertain just how much of this
                        legend is based in reality...
                        Nevertheless, we're hoping to find
                        some sign of the Lost Civilization.

                                        BETSY
                        What about Sun Wu Kung?...

                                        INDIANA
                        Whatever he was...a stone idol...an
                        actual monkey...a human being...is
                        unknown. But he is one of the most
                        influentual religious figures in
                        History, and his remains are most
                        likely somewhere in the Lost City.

        Suddenly, they are INTERRUPTED BY A DISTANT SOUND. A LOW, RUMBLING
        SOUND. BIZARRE. UNEARTHLY. UNLIKE anything we've heard before. Indiana
        TURNS to Scraggy.

                                        INDIANA
                        Sound familiar?

                                        SCRAGGY
                                (shakes his head)
                        It is far, far away...many miles...

                                        BETSY
                                (frightened)
                        What is it?... Some kinda' weird
                        animal?...

                                        CLARE
                        No animal sounds like that.

                                        SCRAGGY
                        Could be "Banseebaba".

                                        CLARE
                        Banseebaba?

                                        SCRAGGY
                        Banseebaba is giant demon from hell.
                        He is 50 feet tall. Breathes fire.
                        Make sound like human never hear
                        before. He is made up of all evil in
                        the world!

                                        CLARE
                        Cheery thought.

        The sound suddenly STOPS. Everyone exchanges a FRIGHTENED, TERRIFIED
        GLANCE. Indiana STANDS.

                                        INDIANA
                        Whatever the hell it is... It went
                        to sleep for the night. Which is
                        what we should do.

                                                                        CUT TO:

        LATER THAT NIGHT - LONG SHOT - THE BOAT

        The boat sails along the RIVER. Beneath the MOONLIGHT. A lone CREW
        MEMBER stays awake. At the STEERING WHEEL. Other CREW MEMBERS sleep
        along the deck. Scraggy SLEEPS in a hanging cot.

        INDIANA

        is ASLEEP in his CABIN. Suddenly, the door SLOWLY CREAKS OPEN. A
        SHADOW appears on the cabin wall. COMING TOWARD Indiana. The shadow
        EXTENDS a hand. The hand GRABS Indy's blanket. Indy WAKES. He LEAPS
        out of bed and TACKLES the mysterious person. Indy FLIPS on the cabin
        lamp. The intruder is none other than...BETSY. Indiana PULLS Betsy to
        her feet. She gives a flirtatious SMILE.

                                        BETSY
                        Couldn't sleep. The heat. I'm in the
                        mood for passion.

                                        INDIANA
                        I'm in the mood for isolation.

        Indiana LEADS Betsy to the open door. He begins to PUSH her back
        outside. Betsy STOPS him.

                                        BETSY
                        I'm not leaving. Not till I get a
                        kiss.

                                        INDIANA
                        Betsy...

                                        BETSY
                                (serious)
                        One kiss. Or I'll scream. I swear.
                        I'll wake the whole boat.

        Indiana has NO CHOICE. He SIGHS.

                                        INDIANA
                        OKay. Just one.
                                (leans toward her,
                                pauses)
                        Keep your mouth closed.

        They KISS. Betsy WRAPS her arms around Indiana, turning it into a
        PASSIONATE KISS.

        At that moment, ACROSS THE HALL, Clare exits the bathroom, TOOTHBRUSH
        in hand. She SEES the kissing Indiana and Betty. Clare STARES. OPEN
        MOUTHED. SHOCKED. Indiana OPENS his eyes. He SEES Clare WATCHING HIM.
        An ANGRY Clare MARCHES into her room. She SLAMS the door. WE HEAR
        Clare LOCKING the door behind her, and moving a piece of furniture in
        front of the door. Indiana PUSHES Betsy away. ANGRY. He quickly CLOSES
        his door. Betsy WALKS back to her room. A huge, SATISFIED SMILE covers
        her face.

        THE FOLLOWING MORNING

        SUNRISE. PEACEFUL. CALM. Birds SING. The River Boat has travelled
        countless miles, into the heart of the ZAMBESI. A tired CREW MEMBER
        mans the boat's steering wheel. CAMERA PANS DOWN, moving along the
        side of the boat. WE STOP AT WATER LEVEL. A HAND SHOOTS OUT OF THE
        WATER. GRIPPING a rusted, sharp KNIFE. Followed by ANOTHER HAND. And
        ANOTHER. And ANOTHER. Until there are COUNTLESS HANDS, REACHING FOR
        THE SIDE OF THE RIVER BOAT. The hands GRAB HOLD of the boat. SEVERAL
        DARK FIGURES slowly RISE out of the water. Only the OUTLINES of their
        bodies are VISIBLE, backlit by the RISING SUN. The figures CLIMB UP
        the side of the boat. Carefully CREEPING. Moving SILENTLY.

        Indiana stands on the REAR DECK, shirt WRAPPED around his waist. He is
        SHAVING. CLARE sits a few feet away. WRITING in her journal. Indy
        GLANCES to her. CURIOUS.

                                        INDIANA
                        What's that you're writing?...

                                        CLARE
                        "The Erotic Adventures Of Indiana
                        Jones, Professor Of Perversity".

                                        INDIANA
                                (back to shaving)
                        Very funny.

        CAMERA PANS TO THE FRONT DECK. STOPPING on the DRIVER. He STARES
        ahead. STEERING the ship. SUDDENLY, A FIGURE APPEARS. BEHIND the
        driver. The figure GRABS the driver. AROUND THE NECK. Before the
        driver can SCREAM...the figure SLICES HIS THROAT.

        Scraggy WITNESSES this. Through an OPEN PORTHOLE. His face covered
        with SHOCK. FEAR.

        INT. LOWER CABIN - KITCHEN

        Betsy stands over a large SKILLET. She FRIES pancakes, LIFTING the
        first pancake, Betsy places it on a PLATE that rests beside her. Betsy
        TURNS to get another pancake. A HAND REACHES FROM OFF SCREEN. The hand
        GRABS the pancake from the plate. Betsy TURNS back. She sees the EMPTY
        PLATE. She is PUZZLED. CONFUSED. She SHRUGS, placing ANOTHER PANCAKE
        on the plate. She TURNS back to the skillet. Again, a hand GRABS the
        pancake. Betsy turns and again sees an EMPTY PLATE. She hears
        GIGGLING. BEHIND her. She turns and SEES

        AN ORIENTAL PIRATE. TALL. MUSCULAR. The Pirate TOWERS above Betsy. He
        is dressed in COLORFUL, TATTERED clothes. The pirate LAUGHS. His
        bloated mouth DRIBBLES with pancake crumbs. Betsy STEPS BACK.
        FRIGHTENED. The Pirate removes a DAGGER from his belt. Eyes filled
        with LECHERY, the Pirate moves toward Betsy. She GRABS the skillet.
        THROWING HOT OIL in the Pirate's face. He SCREAMS. Betsy DASHES OUT of
        the kitchen.

        INDIANA

        has nearly finished SHAVING. He tries to CONVINCE Clare of his
        innocence. She continues to WRITE. IGNORING him.

                                        INDIANA
                        You are blowing this Betsy thing all
                        out of proportion...

        Indiana LEANS down. He RINSES his face in a large BUCKET OF WATER. A
        DAGGER FLIES INTO FRAME! JUST MISSING Indiana. It STICKS into the
        wall. A FEW FEET ABOVE Indy's head. Clare WITNESSES this. SHOCKED.
        UNAWARE of the danger, Indiana RAISES his head out of the bucket. He
        still tries to REASON with Clare.

                                        INDIANA
                        It's not as if I have this sleazy
                        reputation...

        Clare is trying to INTERRUPT Indy, trying to POINT OUT the dagger. But
        before she can say a word, Indiana again LEANS into the water bucket.
        ANOTHER DAGGER SHOOTS INTO FRAME! INTO the wall. This time only INCHES
        above Indy's head. Indiana again RAISES his head.

                                        INDIANA
                        I am a respected...honored...
                        admired...

        Clare LEAPS FORWARD. She pushes Indy OUT OF THE WAY, moments before
        another DAGGER FLIES INTO FRAME! STICKING into the wall! Indy and
        Clare TURN.

        THREE PIRATES stand here. DIRTY. TOOTHLESS. UGLY. SWORDS EXTENDED,
        they MOVE toward Indiana and Clare. Indy's eyes DART to the water
        bucket table. His WHIP and PISTOL rest here. OUT OF REACH. Indy and
        Clare are TRAPPED. The Pirates move CLOSER...

        Suddenly, A LOUD SCREAM. The Pirates LOOK UP. SCRAGGY swings from a
        ROPE above. TOWARD the Pirates. Before the Pirates can react, Scraggy
        CRASHES into them. They TUMBLE to the deck. Scraggy SHOOTS to his
        feet. He tosses a spare SWORD to Indy. Scraggy and Indy begin to
        SWORDFIGBT the Pirates.

        Clare TURNS. DASHING around the corner. To SAFETY. A SUDDEN STOP. Her
        face is buried in the hairy, bare chest of KEZURE, an enormous, bear-
        like PIRATE KING. Kezure HASN'T BATHED in years. He is dressed in
        SEVERAL LAYERS of tattered, colorful clothing, GOLDEN JEWELRY, and
        ANIMAL SKINS. His STRINGY hair is long, tied in a PONYTAIL behind his
        head. A thick, long MOUSTACHE wraps around a large mouth, filled with
        crooked, GOLDEN TEETH. Clare SHRIEKS. Kezure GRABS her around the
        waist. He TOSSES Clare over his shoulder.

        The river boat is overcome with a mixture of ORIENTAL and BLACK
        Pirates. SOUND TRACK MUSIC SOARS! There is a HEATED BATTLE between the
        crew members and the Pirates. Fists FLYING. Swords CLASHING.

        Using her Brooklyn street smarts, Betsy FIGHTS like a pro. With a
        swift PUNCH and KICK, Betsy DEFEATS one Pirate. She takes his SWORD.
        ANOTHER Pirate comes for Betsy. She EDGES him on.

                                        BETSY
                        C'mon... You ain't so tough. You
                        wouldn't last ten minutes in
                        Brooklyn.

        The Pirate ATTACKS. He and Betsy begin a HEATED SWORDFIGHT.

        Indiana and Scraggy CONTINUE TO BATTLE the onslaught of sword slinging
        Pirates. Suddenly, Indy is interrupted by Clare's LOUD SCREAM! He
        TURNS.

        A PIRATE SHIP

        has APPEARED. BESIDE the river boat. The ship is ANCIENT. OMINOUS.
        COUNTLESS PIRATES are aboard the ship. Armed with GUNS, BOWS AND
        ARROWS and CANNONS.

        EXT. RIVER BOAT - TOP DECK

        KEZURE, the Pirate King, stands at the edge of the boat. He still
        HOLDS the screaming Clare over his shoulder. From the Pirate ship, the
        Pirates toss a GRAPNEL ROPE to Kezure. The Pirate King GRABS BOLD of
        the rope. Holding TIGHTLY to Clare, Kezure SWINGS from the river boat,
        to the Pirate Ship.

        INDIANA runs through the FIGHTING crew members and Pirates, in an
        effort to SAVE Clare. Suddenly, the SOUND OF CANNON FIRE! The river
        boat ROCKS! HIT by a CANNONBALL! Indy KEEPS his balance. SWORD in
        hand, he DIVES INTO THE WATER.

        Indiana SWIMS across the Zambesi. TOWARD the Pirate ship. The water
        surrounding Indy erupts with COUNTLESS SPRAYS OF BULLETS, CANNONBALLS
        and FLYING ARROWS.

        EXT. RIVER BOAT - TOP DECK

        The swordfighting crew members manage to keep the many Pirates AT BAY.
        Scraggy EXCHANGES swordplay with a Pirate. The sword is KNOCKED from
        Scraggy's hand. He is DEFENSELESS. The Pirate COMES in for the kill.
        He RAISES HIS SWORD...ready to PLUNGE it into Scraggy's heart... The
        Pirate suddenly PAUSES. A HORRIFIED look on his face. The end of a
        SWORD SHOOTS OUT OF THE PIRATE'S CHEST! A MOMENT PASSES...the sword
        SLIDES BACK INSIDE of the Pirate's chest. The Pirate FALLS to the
        deck. BETSY stands behind him. She holds the BLOODIED SWORD. Scraggy
        gives her a THANKFUL NOD.

        EXT. PIRATE SHIP

        Indiana has MADE IT ACROSS the Zambesi. He CLIMBS UP the side of the
        Pirate Ship. The Pirates begin to SHOOT at Indy. Indy is HIT. An
        ARROW. In the ARM. He dives to safety in a nearby CANNON COMPARTMENT.

        INT. CANNON COMPARTMENT

        Indy PULLS the arrow out of his arm. He is suddenly ATTACKED by the
        Pirate Gunner. The two begin to STRUGGLE. FIGHT. CAMERA PANS TO the
        rear of the cannon, moving to a CLOSE UP of the FUSE. The fuse is LIT.
        BURNING.

        Meanwhile, Indy and the Pirate fight DIRECTLY IN FRONT OF THE CANNON'S
        OPEN BARREL! Every few seconds, each of their heads MOVES IN FRONT of
        the opening. The fuse continues to BURN. Getting LOWER...LOWER...

        EXT. PIRATE SHIP - TOP DECK

        Clare has been TIED to a mast pole. Kezure STANDS in front of her. As
        his men BATTLE around him, Kezure leans forward. The drooling Pirate
        King sloppily KISSES Clare. Along her NECK. Clare is NAUSEOUS.

        INT. CANNON COMPARTMENT

        Indy and the Pirate continue to FIGHT. The cannon fuse SPARKS. BURNING
        toward the bottom. The Pirate pushes Indy's head INSIDE OF THE CANNON
        OPENING. The FUSE will BLOW at any second. At the last moment, Indiana
        OVERPOWERS the Pirate. Indy LEAPS to the floor. The Pirate FALLS
        FORWARD. FACE TO FACE WITH THE CANNON OPENING! BOOM! The cannon FIRES!
        Indy's shirt is SPLATTERED with blood. Indiana RUNS to a wooden
        staircase, hurrying up the stairs. To the TOP DECK.

        EXT. PIRATE SHIP - TOP DECK

        Kezure kisses the bare shoulder of the STRUGGLING, HELPLESS Clare.
        Indy EMERGES from the cannon compartment. Upon seeing the Pirate King
        ATTACK Clare, Indiana SHOUTS.

                                        INDIANA
                        You son of a bitch.

        Kezure TURNS. He emits a gravelly laugh and scratches his neck,
        curiously STUDYING Indiana. Indy EXTENDS his sword. The Pirate King
        removes a long, sharp GOLDEN SWORD. They begin to FIGHT. Moving ALONG
        the deck. A FAST PACED, HEATED swordfight.

        EXT. RIVER BOAT - TOP DECK

        A PIRATE has taken over the boat's WHEEL. He STEERS the river boat OFF
        THE REGULAR PATH. It SPEEDS toward the base of a LARGE, THRASHING
        WATERFALL. The Pirate ship moves ALONGSIDE of the river boat, also
        HEADED for the waterfall. SCRAGGY and BETSY sees the waterfall ahead.
        PANIC fills their eyes. They DASH to the steering wheel. Betsy
        DISTRACTS the Pirate. They begin to SWORDFIGHT. Scraggy TAKES the
        steering wheel. He attaempts to steer the ship AWAY from the
        waterfall.

        EXT. PIRATE SHIP - TOP DECK

        Indiana and the Pirate King have climbed to the top of the SHIP'S
        MAST. They battle AMIDST the tangled ropes. SWORDS CLASHING. As the
        two men fight, Indy notices that the Pirate ship is HEADED FOR THE
        WATERFALL. Indiana has a sudden REALIZATION. He sees Scraggy, trying
        to STEER THE RIVER BOAT IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION. Indy SCREAMS above
        the cannon fire.

                                        INDIANA
                                (still fighting)
                        Scraggy!... No!... Keep goin'
                        straight!... Full steam ahead!...

        SCRAGGY

        is CONFUSED by Indy's orders. He SCREAMS back to Indiana.

                                        SCRAGGY
                        What?... You crazy Indy?... We be
                        crushed!... We smash into rock
                        wall!...

        INDIANA

        still SWORDFIGHTING the Pirate King, SCREAMS to Scraggy.

                                        INDIANA
                        No!... Trust me!... Full steam
                        ahead!... Full steam ahead !...

        SCRAGGY

        BLESSES himself. His face is STRONG. CONFIDENT. He REVS the engine.
        FULL SPEED. He TIGHTLY CLUTCHES the wheel. AIMING the river boat
        toward the waterfall.

        INDIANA AND KEZURE

        SWING from sail to sail, continuing their SPECTACULAR swordfight.
        CLARE helplessly watches from the deck.

        THE RIVER BOAT AND THE PIRATE SHIP

        continue to move SIDE BY SIDE. Moving CLOSER...CLOSER...to the
        shattering waterfall.

        SCRAGGY

        continues to rev the RIVER BOAT'S engine. CHANTING various prayers
        under his breath. In the background, a FEISTY Betsy continues to
        swordfight.

        THE RIVER BOAT AND THE PIRATE SHIP

        PENETRATE the waterfall. The two boats are met with an exploding
        shower of POWERFUL WATER! Crew members and Pirates are TOSSED ABOUT
        the deck. Indiana and the Pirate King hold TIGHTLY to the sails, to
        AVOID being thrown into the waters below.

        EXT. RIVER BOAT

        The aged boat TOSSES. TILTS. SPINS. Nearly CAPSIZING. Boards CREAK and
        MOAN. Ready to BURST. But Scraggy holds TIGHTLY to the steering wheel.
        Keeping the boat AFLOAT.

        The powerful water sends Betsy SOMERSAULTING along the deck. She tries
        to GRAB HOLD of something...anything...that will PREVENT her from
        falling off the boat. Betsy finally CLUTCHES onto something. The ARM
        OF A DEAD PIRATE.

        THE RIVER BOAT AND THE PIRATE SHIP

        are IMMERSED into the waterfall. They DISAPPEAR behind the thrashing
        curtain of water.

        INT. BEHIND THE WATERFALL

        The Pirates' HIDDEN FORTRESS. An enormous, underground CAVERN.
        Hndreds of BURNING TORCHES cast a devilish glow. The grey rocks of the
        cavern walls stretch UPWARD. Filled with countless, tiny CAVES.
        Various stone artifacts and ancient untensils are SCATTERED throughout
        the cavern. There are several other PIRATES here. ARMED. Waiting for
        the RETURN of the Pirate Ship.

        The River Boat and Pirate Ship ENTER the cave. The rushing waterfall
        THRASHES behind them. The BATTERED and BRUISED River Boat comes to a
        ROUGH stop. SCREECHING along a far wall. The Pirate Ship sails to a
        SMOOTH STOP in the middle of the cavern. Armed with guns, knives and
        swords, the Pirates hurriedly SURROUND the intruding River Boat. They
        take Betsy, Scraggy and the crew members CAPTIVE.

        KEZURE leaps to the Pirate Ship's deck and quickly UNTIES Clare.
        Indiana ATTEMPTS to FOLLOW. He PAUSES. Quickly GRABBING A FEW STICKS
        OF DYNAMITE from the Pirate Ship deck. Kezure begins to LEAD Clare off
        of the ship. His sword at her THROAT. Indiana CALLS OUT.

                                        INDIANA
                        Wait...

        Kezure STOPS. He TURNS. Indy WALKS toward Kezure, stopping less than
        TEN FEET from the Pirate King and Clare. Indy's eyes BURN through
        Kezure.

                                        INDIANA
                        Free the girl...
                                (glances to his captive
                                friends)
                        ...and my friends...
                                (lights a match, moves
                                it toward TNT fuses)
                        ...or I blow your hideout here out
                        of the water!

        Kezure LAUGHS. Indiana LIGHTS the dynamite fuses. Kezure STOPS
        laughing...WORRIED for a moment... Then, the Pirate King breaks into a
        wide, DEFIANT SMILE.

                                        KEZURE
                        Good. We will all die.

        A STANDOFF. Indy DIDN'T EXPECT this. He is suddenly FRIGHTENED.
        PUZZLED. Betsy, Scraggy and Clare STARE at Indy. Waiting for his NEXT
        MOVE...as the dynamite fuse SLOWLY BURNS. Getting CLOSER...CLOSER...to
        the TNT. Kezure seems CALM. Perfectly WILLING TO DIE. Indy gets
        ANOTHER IDEA. He BLURTS it out to Kezure.

                                        INDIANA
                        We can take you to the Lost City of
                        Sun Wu Kung!

                                        KEZURE
                        Hah! Better men than you have tried
                        to find the Lost City... They have
                        all failed.
                                (cynical laugh)
                        You are a fool.

                                        INDIANA
                                (as the TNT fuse burns
                                LOWER...LOWER...)
                        No... You're the fool. You and your
                        friends are hiding out in Sun Wu
                        Kung's Water Curtain Cave...and you
                        don't even know it.

                                        KEZURE
                                (puzzled, looking
                                around)
                        Huh?...

        Scraggy and Betsy exchange a SHOCKED glance. Clare is also SURPRISED
        by the news. The TNT fuse nears the end...ready to BLOW AT ANY
        SECOND... Indiana removes the ANCIENT SCROLL from his pocket. He
        EXTENDS the scroll to Kezure.

                                        INDIANA
                        The Sacred Pai-Cho Scroll.

        Kezure GRABS the scroll. Attempting to READ it. Indy INTERRUPTS.

                                        INDIANA
                        Don't bother. Only WE can translate
                        it.

        Kezure EXAMINES the scroll. PUZZLED by the writing. Indiana and
        Scraggy exchange a HOPEFUL glanpe. Kezure PAUSES. THINKING. He MUMBLES
        to himself.

                                        KEZURE
                        The Lost City... Said to have
                        streets paved in gold...treasures
                        far greater than any mortal man
                        could imagine...

        Kezure PUSHES Clare away. TOWARD Indiana. Clare EMBRACES Indy, as he
        BLOWS OUT the dynamite fuse. Kezure GROWLS at Indy.

                                        KEZURE
                        Your pathetic lives will be spared.
                        For now.
                                (scratching his neck)
                        But everything we find in the Lost
                        City...belongs to ME.

                                        INDIANA
                        Fat chance, Sinbad. It's 50-50. Or
                        you've got no deal.

                                        KEZURE
                                (vicious smile)
                        It is my way. Or you've got no head.

                                                                        CUT TO:

        INT. WATER CURTAIN CAVE - THAT NIGHT

        A group of Pirates sit TOGETHER. DRUNK. They SING one of their ancient
        songs. The GUITAR strumming crew member accompanies them. Indiana and
        Scraggy sit around a BLAZING FIRE with Kezure and several other
        Pirates. Indy, wearing his spectacles, TRANSLATES the scrolls with
        Scraggy. Indiana is PUZZLED. TROUBLED. He LOOKS at Scraggy.

                                        INDIANA
                        Read that last proverb again...

                                        SCRAGGY
                                (reads translation)
                        "High tide drowns curiosity,
                        Low tide quenches thirst".

                                        INDIANA
                                (stands, looking at the
                                surroundings)
                        There's something here...something
                        that could help us...

        Meanwhile, Betsy and Clare work in ANOTHER SECTION of the cave. Clare
        is doing some ARCHEOLOGICAL WORK, studying the various artifacts and
        utensils. Betsy ASSISTS her. They are surrounded by LEERING, HUNGRY
        EYED PIRATES. The drunken Pirates DON'T take their eyes off of the
        girls. Betsy NOTICES. She POINTS it out to Clare.

                                        BETSY
                        Look at 'em. It's like they've never
                        seen a woman before.

                                        CLARE
                        To them... We're the ultimate women.

                                        BETSY
                        Kinda' flattering, isn't it?...
                        Being the girl of 200 guy's dreams?

        Clare and Betsy exchange a CHUCKLE.

        Meanwhile, Indiana, Scraggy and Kezure WALK through the cavern. Indy
        is LOOKING around. CURIOUS, he turns to Kezure.

                                        INDIANA
                        Is there an area... A place where
                        the tide changes?...

        Kezure leads Indiana and Scraggy into a DARK CORNER of the cavern. A
        large, smooth WALL stretches to the ceiling. The wall is filled with
        intricate CRACKS. At the base of the wall, water slowly POURS into the
        cavern. Kezure POINTS to the water.

                                        KEZURE
                        In a few hours...the water will be
                        lower...much lower...

                                        INDIANA
                        And the remainder of this wall will
                        be visible?....

        Kezure NODS. Indiana's eyes LIGHT. A REALIZATION. He excitedly TURNS
        to Kezure.

                                        INDIANA
                        We're gonna need light. A lot of
                        light. On this wall.

        Kezure NODS. Indiana EXCHANGES an anxious, hopeful glance with
        Scraggy.

                                                                        DISSOLVE TO:

        CLOSE UP - A SNORING PIRATE

        CAMERA PULLS BACK. All of the Pirates SLEEP. Their slumbering bodies
        LIE in various positions, throughout the cave. Indiana and Kezure are
        STILL AWAKE. The flickering orange light of the TORCHES illuminates
        the wall in front of them. They AWAIT the lowering tide. Scraggy,
        Betsy and Clare SLEEP on the ground beside them. Kezure POURS two
        glasses of whiskey from a STONE BOTTLE. He gives a GLASS to Indiana.
        Kezure TOASTS.

                                        KEZURE
                        To my good fortune.

        Kezure GOBBLES down the whiskey. Indiana RELUCTANTLY drinks. Kezure
        pours TWO more glasses. LAUGHING.

                                        KEZURE
                        You know... We are very much alike,
                        Doctor jones.

                                        INDIANA
                        I doubt that.

                                        KEZURE
                        We both share a remarkable talent
                        for killing.

                                        INDIANA
                        I've never gotten used to killing,
                        pal. I do it for survival.

                                        KEZURE
                        I do it for pleasure.

        Indiana DOWNS his whiskey. A LAUGHING Kezure does the same. Indiana
        NOTICES something. ON the wall. He JUMPS to his feet. CAMERA PANS TO
        THE WALL. The tide is VERY LOW. The entire wall is now VISIBLE. What
        were once simple CRACKS, have become the specific LINES OF A MAP. A
        group of ARROWS leads to an "X" at the BOTTOM CORNER OF THE MAP. A
        FASCINATED Kezure and Indiana STUDY the wall.

                                        INDIANA
                                (astounded)
                        This is incredible...this map was
                        obviously used by Sun Wu Kung's
                        disciples...if they were ever
                        lost...

                                        KEZURE
                        These drawings...they are of the
                        surrounding jungle...

                                        INDIANA
                                (points to "X")
                        Where is that?...

                                        KEZURE
                        It is located at the most South
                        Eastern part of the jungle...near
                        the mountains... There is a village
                        there. The Mongooboo Tribe.

                                        INDIANA
                        You know them?

                                        KEZURE
                        Very well. I traded with the chief
                        for many years.

                                        INDIANA
                                (anxious, excited)
                        Good. We'll leave in the morning.

        CAMERA PANS FROM Indiana and Kezure, to a DARK CAVE. A FEW FEET away.
        Standing inside, is the figure of the MYSTERIOUS CREW MEMBER. The
        TRAITOR. His face is HIDDEN in the shadows. Again, he RADIOS back to
        Nazis. He WHISPERS in German. CAMERA DOLLIES INTO A CLOSE UP of his
        RADIO MICROPHONE. A RED SWASTIKA adorns the microphone.

        EXT. JUNGLE PLAINS - THE FOLLOWING AFTERNOON

        Scraggy's decrepid MODEL-T TAXI putters across the flat, jungle
        terrain. The HOT SUN shines in the background. The car is completely
        PACKED with people. Ready to BURST. Scraggy DRIVES. Indiana, Clare and
        Betsy are CROWDED in the front seat. Kezure and four Pirates ride in
        the REAR COMPARTMENT. Everyone is UNCOMFORTABLE. CRAMPED. SWEATING.
        Two of Scraggy's crew members STRADDLE the sideboard. Three men sit on
        the ROOF, including the GUITAR PLAYER, who plays a delightful melody.
        Various rusted POTS, PANS and other UTENSILS dangle from the car. This
        creates a CHARMING, JINGLING sound.

        The taxi passes a HERD OF GIRAFFE. The beautiful animals stare in
        BEWILDERMENT at the passing taxi. Suddenly, there is a DISTANT SOUND.
        The same LOW, RUMBLING we heard earlier. The giraffes SCATTER. AFRAID
        of the unnatural sound.

        INT. TAXI

        The bizarre SOUND echoes through the taxi. Indy EXCHANGES a puzzled
        look with the others.

                                        INDIANA
                        That sound. Again.

                                        SCRAGGY
                                (listening)
                        Still far away...but getting closer.

        The sound STOPS. Indiana is BOTHERED. DISTURBED. Kezure LEANS forward.
        He points to a CLUSTERED AREA OF JUNGLE. Nearly a MILE in the
        distance.

                                        KEZURE
                        The village is there. Beyond the
                        thick of jungle.

        Scraggy NODS. He DRIVES toward the village. Suddenly, AN ARROW SHOOTS
        THROUGH THE WINDOW! JUST MISSING everyone. It SHATTERS the passenger
        window.

        A TRIBE OF NATIVE WARRIORS appear on the terrain. There are HUNDREDS.
        SCREAMING in high pitched squeals. Their bodies ADORNED with red and
        white PAINT. The angry warriors RUN TOWARD the taxi. FIRING ARROWS!

        On the Taxi roof, the men DIVE for cover. Arrows WHIZ by their heads.
        Inside, everyone ROLLS UP the windows. The taxi is attacked with a
        SHOWER OF ARROWS. Scraggy FLOORS the gas. The taxi keeps MOVING AHEAD.
        SPEEDING toward the jungle. Indiana GLARES at Kezure.

                                        INDIANA
                        Thought you said they knew you?...

        Kezure gives a PUZZLED SHRUG.

        The WARRIORS continue to CHASE the Taxi. Getting CLOSER. Firing more
        ARROWS. The taxi SPINS to a stop. Directly in front of a LARGE OPENING
        that leads into the jungle. Everyone POURS OUT of the Taxi. ARROWS fly
        by their heads. They DASH through the opening. Into the JUNGLE. The
        Warriors STOP. OUTSIDE of the opening. They DON'T ENTER. TURNING to
        each other, they begin to LAUGH. VICTORIOUS.

        INT. JUNGLE

        An almost PERFECT PATH has been cleared through the thick Jungle.
        Indiana and the others RUN through the path. Indy SUDDENLY PAUSES.
        MOTIONING for the others to STOP. A PUZZLED LOOK covers his face.

                                        INDIANA
                        Wait... Listen... They're not
                        following us...

        One of the Pirates CONTINUES TO MOVE FORWARD. His foot TRIPS A THIN
        STRING that stretches across the path. WHOOSH! A BOOBY TRAPPED PALM
        TREE SWINGS FORWARD! It SLAMS into the Pirate! Like a giant BASEBALL
        BAT! It sends the Pirate FLYING UPWARD. HIGH INTO THE AIR! His body is
        THROWN several feet into the jungle.

        Indiana exchanges a CAUTIOUS look with the others.

                                        INDIANA
                        Be careful where you step... We've
                        got to move slowly...very slowly...

        Indiana LEADS everyone. They CREEP through the path. Indy PAUSES.
        CAMERA PANS TO HIS WAIST. A SECTION OF VINE stretches across the path.
        ANOTHER booby trap. Indiana CRAWLS BENEATH THE VINE. He MOTIONS for
        the others to follow. One by one, they CAREFULLY CRAWL beneath the
        vine. The guitar player is LAST. He begins to CRAWL through. He NEARLY
        makes it, when...the top of his guitar HITS THE VINE! The vine SNAPS.
        There is a CREAKING SOUND.

        A GIANT, METAL TRAP, OVER FOUR FEET HIGH, SHOOTS UP FROM THE GROUND! A
        HUMAN TRAP! The GUITAR PLAYER DIVES TO SAFETY! The trap's SHARP METAL
        TEETH SNAP SHUT! The guitar is SNAPPED IN TWO!

        Soon, the path ERUPTS with countless ROWS OF TRAPS. They EJECT from
        the ground. SNAPPING SHUT. One AFTER the other. Everyone begins to
        RUN. The traps SNAP SHUT ONLY A FEW FEET BEHIND THEM! Everyone ROUNDS
        A CORNER... They COME UPON...

        AN ENORMOUS PIT! Over TEN FEET DEEP! Filled with countless layers of
        SCORPIONS! There is NOWHERE TO TURN. NOWHERE TO RUN. The METAL TRAPS
        continue to SHUT BEHIND THEM!

        Indiana removes his SWORD. He slices at A BAMBOO TREE. The traps
        CONTINUE TO SHUT BEHIND HIM. Getting CLOSER. CLOSER. Indiana gives A
        FINAL WHACK TO THE TREE. It FALLS. STRETCHING across the pool. Only A
        FEW FEET ABOVE the stinging scorpions. Indiana begins to CLIMB ACROSS.
        Moving HAND OVER HAND. Everyone hurriedly FOLLOWS. The bamboo tree
        CREAKS with their every movement. Their feet DANGLE only INCHES above
        the scorpions. The last Pirate GRABS HOLD of the bamboo tree, just as
        the FINAL METAL TRAP SHUTS! JUST MISSING HIM!

        As the last Pirate makes his way ACROSS the pit, he DROPS a small bag
        of GOLD COINS. The coins REST a few feet below. DIRECTLY ON TOP of the
        scorpions. The Pirate PAUSES. DECIDING whether to climb to safety or
        retrieve the coins. Everyone else has MADE IT across. The GREEDY
        Pirate wants his money. With his left hand, he HOLDS TIGHTLY to the
        bamboo tree. With the other, he REACHES for the coins. His fingers are
        INCHES from the ciins. But he LOSES his grip. He FALLS. INTO THE PIT.
        SURROUNDED by hundreds of scorpions. He STRUGGLES to get out.
        CLIMBING. SWIMMING. But he only manages to SINK. The Pirate's SCREAMS
        die, as his body is ENGULFED by the stinging scorpions.

        Indiana and the others CONTINUE AHEAD. Moving SLOWLY. CAREFULLY.
        Someone's foot STEPS ON A WOODEN TRIGGER. There is another CREAKING
        SOUND. Behind everyone, a large BAMBOO DOOR EJECTS FROM THE GROUND. It
        leads to an UNDERGROUND CAGE. The door CREAKS OPEN. THREE FEROCIOUS
        LIONS LEAP OUT! TEETH BARED. GROWLING. They COME FOR the humans.

        Everyone DASHES FORWARD. RUNNING. The lions are in HOT PURSUIT. FAST.
        The humans don't stand a CHANCE. Suddenly, Clare STOPS. She TURNS.
        FACING the charging lions. Indiana LOOKS BACK. SCREAMING.

                                        INDIANA
                        Clare! What are you...?!?

        The lions STOP. Inches from Clare. They SURROUND her. Ready to ATTACK.
        Indiana WATCHES. PUZZLED. Clare begins to make bizarre PURRING and
        COOING SOUNDS. The lions PAUSE. They RECOGNIZE the sounds. Clare
        CONTINUES. The lions begin to WARM UP to her. Clare KNEELS. She PETS
        the beasts. The lions SNUGGLE up to Clare. LICKING her face. Indiana
        and the others COME CLOSER. PUZZLED. Clare EXPLAINS.

                                        CLARE
                        I imitated the sound of a Lion
                        Mother calling her babies.

        Betsy is IMPRESSED. Indiana SMILES. RELIEVED.

                                        INDIANA
                        C'mon. Let's get outta' --

        Indy TURNS...FACE TO FACE with a grotesque SHRUNKEN HEAD! He STEPS
        BACK. The shrunken head is worn around the neck of a tall, muscular
        TRIBAL CHIEF. Leader of the WARRIORS. Countless NATIVES stand behind
        the chief. A look of ANGER...HATE...covers the Chief's face. Indiana
        gives a HOPEFUL glance to Kezure.

                                        INDIANA
                        Is this the Tribal Chief you told me
                        about?... Your friend?...

                                        KEZURE
                                (points to shrunken
                                head)
                        No. That is him.

        Indiana ROLLS his eyes. The warriors SURROUND everyone. ARROWS aimed.
        Ready to KILL. The Warriors lead everyone OUT of the path.

        EXT. MONGOOBO VILLAGE

        Several GRASS HUTS are scattered throughout this large village.
        Indiana and the others are LED into the village. They PASS the
        penetrating, unfriendly glares of the villagers. Kezure EXPLAINS to
        Indiana.

                                        KEZURE
                        This is a different tribe. New. They
                        have taken over the village.

                                        INDIANA
                        What happened to the other tribe?

        Kezure SHRUGS. Indiana TURNS to Scraggy.

                                        INDIANA
                        You recognize their language?

        PAGE 73 MISSING FROM HARD COPY

        Suddenly, a VOICE echoes from inside of the oven. The natives LISTEN.
        Again, the voice SHOUTS from inside. It's SCRAGGY. The natives
        RECOGNIZE the language. They quickly OPEN the oven door. Scraggy is
        SCREAMING in the tribe's tongue. The grille is PULLED out of the oven.
        The natives hurriedly UNTIE the slightly smoked Indiana, Kezure and
        Scraggy.

        Scraggy SHOOTS to his feet. FURIOUS. He begins to SHOUT at the tribal
        CHIEF. The Chief and the villagers are AWESTRUCK by Scraggy's words.
        The nervous Chief ORDERS Clare, Betsy and the others UNTIED. Scraggy
        WHISPERS to Indiana.

                                        SCRAGGY
                        I tell him we divine messengers of
                        Sun Wu-Kung. If he interfere with
                        our mission... Jade Emperor come
                        down from heavens and destroy his
                        village.

        Indy SMILES. Scraggy TURNS and again SHOUTS to the chief. The chief
        OBEYS Scraggy's every word. He LEADS Indy and Scraggy to another area
        of the village. Scraggy TRANSLATES for Indiana.

                                        SCRAGGY
                        I tell him we lose path to city... I
                        ask if he have something to help us.

        The chief leads Indy and Scraggy into a LARGE GRASS HUT.

        INT. GRASS HUT

        EMPTY, save for an elaborate MARBLE ALTAR. A dull MIRROR rests on the
        altar. The small mirror is surrounded by a crude, STONE FRAME. The
        chief PICKS up the mirror and GIVES it to Scraggy. The chief EXPLAINS.
        Scraggy GIVES the mirror to Indiana.

                                        SCRAGGY
                                (translating)
                        He say this will help us. And since
                        we are divine messengers...we will
                        know how to use it!

        Indiana SMIRKS. He EXAMINES the mirror. Totally CONFUSED by it.

                                                                        CUT TO:

        EXT. MONGOOBOO VILLAGE - DAWN

        The village SLEEPS. QUIET. PEACEFUL. Scraggy's Model-T is PARKED here.
        Several of the crew members and Pirates are SLEEPING in and around the
        car. KEZURE is sprawled on the car's roof. SNORING. It is obvious that
        they have CAMPED here for the evening.

        Suddenly, a SLIGHT TREMOR surges through the village. A soft
        VIBRATION. Cooking utensils RATTLE. Grass huts SHAKE.

        INT. GRASS HUT

        Indiana SLEEPS here. In a HAMMOCK. The vibration WAKES Indy. As he
        moves to climb out of the hammock, a FIGURE LEAPS ON TOP OF HIM!
        BETSY.

                                        BETSY
                        Indy. I'm frightened.

                                        INDIANA
                        I'm claustrophobic.

        Indiana attempts to PUSH Betsy out of the hammock. She RESISTS. They
        begin to WRESTLE. STRUGGLE. The hammock becomes TANGLED around their
        bodies.

        Clare WALKS BY the hut. She LOOKS inside. To her, it appears that Indy
        and Betsy are in the middle of a PASSIONATE love scene. She emits a
        SHOCKED GASP. Indiana SEES Clare. He CALLS OUT.

                                        INDIANA
                        Clare!... Wait!...

        But the startled Clare HURRIES AWAY. Indiana manages to ESCAPE Betsy
        and the tangled hammock. He LANDS on the floor. BREATHLESS.

        EXT. VILLAGE

        The vibrating INTENSIFIES. The ground begins to RUMBLE. The
        surrounding trees SHAKE. The villagers POUR out of their huts,
        gathering in the middle of town. FRIGHTENED. Indiana and Betsy JOIN
        Scraggy, Clare, Kezure and the others. Betsy is PUZZLED by the
        tremors.

                                        BETSY
                        An earthquake?

        The Tribal Chief STEPS FORWARD. He says ONE WORD in his language.
        Scraggy TRANSLATES for the others.

                                        SCRAGGY
                        Wildebeest.

                                                                        CUT TO:

        A HERD OF STAMPEDING WILDEBEEST

        Hundreds of the RAGING animals plow through the jungle. Moving FAST.
        They CRUSH everything in their path.

        EXT. MONGOOBOO VILLAGE

        The vibrating is LOUDER. HARDER. The villagers PANIC. They RUN AWAY.
        SCATTERING into the jungle. Indiana and his party are CLUSTERED
        together. Clare EXCLAIMS.

                                        CLARE
                        We have to get out... Or we'll be
                        crushed to death.

                                        INDIANA
                        Scraggy... How close?

        Scraggy puts his EAR to the trembling ground. He LISTENS.

                                        SCRAGGY
                        Two miles.

        Indy dashes to the Model-T SUPPLY RACK. He tosses SHOVELS to each of
        the group. He LOOKS around.

                                        INDIANA
                        Where's the softest ground?...

        Scraggy asks a PASSING VILLAGER. The villager SHOUTS some gibberish
        and continues running. Scraggy POINTS OFF SCREEN. Toward a COMMUNAL
        GRAVEYARD.

                                                                        CUT TO:

        THE WILDEBEEST.

        SNORTING. STOMPING. CARVING a wide path through the thick jungle.
        Small animals RUN for their lives. Bunnies DASH ahead of the herd.
        Monkeys SWING to other trees. The ANGRY Wildebeest continue ahead.

        EXT. VILLAGE

        Indiana and the others stand in the LARGE GRAVEYARD. SHOVELS in hand.
        They have DUG A LARGE HOLE. Pieces of DECAYED BODIES and SKELETONS
        protrude from the surrounding hole. Scraggy STARES at the ghastly
        sight. Eyes WIDE. FEARFUL. He begins to BABBLE. HYSTERICAL.

                                        SCRAGGY
                        Oh, no! Many dead spirits! Bad
                        spirits... We must stay away...

        Indy interrupts by PUSHING SCRAGGY INTO THE OPEN GRAVE. Scraggy falls
        into the ARMS OF A SKELETON. He SCREAMS.

                                                                        CUT TO:

        THE HERD OF WILDEBEEST

        BURSTING through a section of jungle. They arrive on the VAST JUNGLE
        PLAIN. Directly ahead of them, several feet in the distance, is the
        MONGOOBOO VILLAGE. The Wildebeest head STRAIGHT for the village.

        EXT. VILLAGE

        DESERTED. NO SIGN of human life. Everything TREMBLES with the force of
        a major earthquake. The wildebeest ARRIVE. DESTROYING the village.
        Grass Huts are FLATTENED. The enormous stone oven COLLAPSES. CRUMBLING
        to pieces. Scraggy's Model-T is OVERTURNED.

        With nothing left standing, the wildebeest MOVE ON. The village has
        been completely DEVASTATED. Surrounded with a heavy CLOUD OF DUST.
        CAMERA PANS TO THE GRAVEYARD. Grave markers and tombstones lie BROKEN
        and CRUSHED. Countless HOOFPRINTS cover the flat ground. The dust
        begins to SETTLE. The graveyard ground suddenly BUCKLES. MOVING. A
        HAND shoots out. Indiana CLIMBS OUT of the dirt. He is FOLLOWED by the
        others, who also CLIMB OUT from underground. Everyone is UNHURT. SAFE.
        PROTECTED by the ground above. A skeleton has ATTACHED itself to
        Betsy. REFUSING to let go.

        Scraggy, Indy and a few of the men RUN to the overturned Model-T Taxi.
        They GRAB hold of the car and TURN it back upright.

        Clare LOOKS at the devastated village. Betsy stands beside her,
        STRUGGLING TO ESCAPE from the clutches of the skeleton. Clare looks
        into the DISTANCE. Watching the DEPARTING Wildebeest. She is TROUBLED.
        WORRIED.

                                        CLARE
                        That's odd... Wildebeests will not
                        stampede unless provoked...

        Suddenly, the same LOW, RUMBLING SOUND from earlier, ECHOES through
        the area. But this time it is LOUD. Nearly DEAFENING. Scraggy LOOKS at
        Indy.

                                        SCRAGGY
                        This time, it is very close, Indy.
                        Very close!

        At that moment, directly behind Scraggy and Indy, the jungle ERUPTS!
        The trees SEPARATE. CRASHING to the ground. Making way for some GIANT
        BEHEMOTH. Scraggy and the others LEAP IN ONE DIRECTION. Indiana LEAPS
        IN ANOTHER.

        A GIANT TANK

        SHOOTS out of the jungle. A METAL MONSTROSITY. ONE of a kind. The tank
        is over TEN TIMES the size of a normal tank. Nearly 100 FEET LONG.
        Over 25 FEET HIGH. It is equipped with THREE LEVELS. On the TOP LEVEL,
        is the tank's swivelling GUN BARREL. ENORMOUS. The size of a CANNON.
        Two giant, BLAZING RED SWASTIKAS adorn both sides of the tank's SECOND
        LEVEL.

        The tank RUNS OVER Scraggy's Model-T. The car is FLATTENED. A THICK
        CLOUD OF DUST erupts from the ground.

        INT. TANK

        GUTTERBUHG is here. He views the outside action through a PERISCOPE.
        TWO NAZI GUNNERS are behind him. WAITING for orders to shoot. TYKI
        sits in the background. The confused pygmy is BOUND and GAGGED.

        OUTSIDE

        Scraggy, Clare, Betsy, Kezure and the others DASH across the plains.
        RUNNING AWAY from the pursuing tank. But Indiana is NOT with them.
        Scraggy, UNABLE TO SEE through the dust, calls out.

                                        SCRAGGY
                        Indy?... Indy?...

        Indiana is SEVERAL FEET AWAY. On the GROUND. ALONE. LOST in the thick
        of DUST. Suddenly, a DARK FIGURE appears. TOWERING over Indiana. The
        dust begins to CLEAR. Revealing a protruding WHITE HORN. More dust
        CLEARS. We see that the figure is a large, BLACK RHINOCEROS! Indy
        LEAPS to his feet. The rhino SNORTS. Indy turns to RUN. The rhino
        CHASES him!

        Meanwhile, with most of the dust CLEARED, the TANK CHASES INDY'S
        FRIENDS ACROSS THE JUNGLE PLAINS.

        INT. TANK

        Gutterbuhg LOOKS into the periscope. Indy's friends are in his SIGHTS.
        Gutterbuhg SCREAMS to the gunners.

                                        GUTTERBUHG
                                (German; English
                                subtitles)
                        Fire!

        OUTSIDE

        The tank's large barrel FIRES A SHOT at the running group. The blast
        FLIES OVER THEIR HEADS. JUST MISSING everyone. It BLASTS a row of palm
        trees to smithereens.

        INDIANA is still running from the rampaging rhino. Indy begins to RUN
        IN A CIRCLE. The angry rhino FOLLOWS him. The circle begins to
        TIGHTEN... Becoming SMALLER... SMALLER... Until Indy is nearly running
        ALONGSIDE of the rhino. At the exact moment, Indy GRABS HOLD of the
        rhino. He LEAPS onto the beast. With a bit of careful maneuvering,
        Indiana is RIDING THE RHINOCEROS!

        Scraggy, Betsy, Clare, Kezure and the others CONTINUE TO RUN. The tank
        is right BEHIND THEM. MOVING FAST. In HOT PURSUIT. The tank FIRES
        ANOTHER SHOT! It SPLATTERS the ground. BESIDE the group. Again, JUST
        MISSING everyone. The group TURNS. RUNNING in ANOTHER DIRECTION. The
        tank FOLLOWS.

        Indiana continues to ride the WILD, BUCKING rhino. He has NO CONTROL
        over the beast. The rhino spots SOMETHING. The TANK. From this angle,
        the tank, with its large protruding gun barrel, resembles a GIANT
        RHINOCEROS. Seeing this, the rhino turns and RUNS TOWARD the tank.
        HEAD ON. Indy holds TIGHTLY.

        Scraggy and the others PAUSE. They see the tank BEHIND THEM. They see
        the rhino AHEAD of them. The group makes QUICK TURN. To the RIGHT.
        They run toward a RAVINE.

        The tank is headed STRAIGHT for Indy and the rhino. Both moving at
        FULL SPEED.

        INT. TANK

        Through the periscope, Gutterbuhg SEES Indy and the rhino.

        INDIANA

        continues to RIDE the uncontrollable rhino. They are within THIRTY
        FEET of the oncoming tank.

        INT. TANK

        Gutterbuhg SCREAMS in German, ordering the Nazi Gunner to "Fire".

        EXT. PLAINS

        The tank FIRES. The blast is LOW. The ground in front of Indy and the
        rhino EXPLODES. A cloud of dust ERUPTS.

        INT. TANK

        Gutterbuhg LOOKS through the periscope. His view is BLOCKED by dust.

        EXT. PLAINS

        The tank is UPON Indy and the rhino. The rhino SCREECHES to a stop.
        FRIGHTENED by the blast. Indiana LEAPS ONTO THE TANK. GRIPPING the
        front section. HOLDING ON for dear life. Moments before he is crushed
        beneath the tank's giant treads, the RHINO TURNS and RUNS OFF.

        Scraggy, Betsy, Clare, Kezure and the others, have arrived at the foot
        of a tall, several branched TREE. Located at the side of the RAVINE.
        Over the ravine's edge, is a SEVERAL HUNDRED FOOT DROP onto jagged
        rocks. Scraggy begins to CLIMB the tree.

                                        SCRAGGY
                        Safest place from bad spirits...is
                        in branches of tree.

        The others SHRUG. They have NO CHOICE but to FOLLOW Scraggy up into
        the branches of the tree.

        Indiana CLIMBS along the side of the monstrous tank. He searches for a
        PASSAGEWAY inside of the tank.

        INT. TANK

        The Nazis are UNAWARE of Indy's presense on the tank. Gutterbuhg
        CONTINUES to look through the periscope. The dust begins to CLEAR. He
        FOCUSES his sights on Indy's friends. LOCATED several feet away. They
        CLIMB into the TREE. Gutterbuhg SMILES.

        EXT. TANK

        Indy CANNOT FIND a passageway into the tank. He SEES the GUN BARREL.
        OVERHEAD. It SWIVELS. AIMING toward the tree filled with Indy's
        friends. Indy GRABS one of the tank's LARGE HEADLIGHTS. He PULLS HARD.
        SNAPPING OFF the headlight. Indy LEAPS upward. He quickly STUFFS the
        headlight inside of the barrel opening.

        INT. TANK

        The tree of Indy's friends are in Gutterbuhg's SIGHTS. A PERFECT SHOT.
        Gutterbuhg SCREAMS in German, ordering the Nazi gunners to SHOOT. They
        FIRE. But the barrel BACKFIRES! EXPLODING in the face of the two Nazi
        gunners. It sends them FLYING against the wall. OUT COLD. The cabin
        fills with SMOKE. Only Gutterbuhg and Tyki REMAIN. A FURIOUS
        Gutterbuhg PICKS up the radio. He SCREAMS into the microphone.

                                        GUTTERBUHG
                                (German; English
                                subtitles)
                        Send help! We need assistance!

        Tyki HELPLESSLY watches in the background. Gutterbuhg LOOKS into the
        periscope. He SEES Indiana. ON the tank. Gutterbuhg hits a RED BUTTON.
        On the CONTROL PANEL.

        EXT. TANK

        COUNTLESS ROWS OF MACHINE GUNS eject from secret slots. All AROUND the
        tank's FIRST LEVEL. The machine guns begin to FIRE. RAPIDLY. WILDLY.
        Indiana DUCKS and DODGES the guns. He CLIMBS to the SECOND LEVEL. But
        the large SWASTIKAS begin to move. OPENING. They are actually HIDDEN
        DOORS. SECRET COMPARTMENTS. Several NAZI SOLDIERS exit the
        compartments. They COME FOR Indiana. He FIGHTS the onslaught of
        soldiers. PUNCHING. WRESTLING.

        The tank, without a driver, begins to wildly SPIN. Going in CIRCLES.

        From the tree, SCRAGGY sees Indy's dillemma. He SHOUTS to the others.

                                        SCRAGGY
                        Indy in trouble! We must help!

        Scraggy begins to CLIMB OUT of the tree. A GUN suddenly MOVES INTO
        FRAME. POINTED at Scraggy's head. Scraggy TURNS. One of his CREW
        MEMBERS holds the gun.

                                        CREW MEMBER
                                (German accent)
                        Don't move.
                                (to the others)
                        All of you. Stay where you are.

        Scraggy and the others FREEZE. Clare makes a REALIZATION. She GLARES
        at the Crew Member.

                                        CLARE
                        It was you. You're the reason the
                        Nazis found us.

        The crew member gives an evil SMILE.

        Indiana continues to FIGHT the Nazis, along the SECOND LEVEL of the
        frenzied tank. Indy has DEFEATED most of the soldiers. Only TWO NAZIS
        remain. They OVERCOME Indy. They push him DOWNWARD. Toward the tank's
        FIRST LEVEL. Toward the rows of FIRING MACHINE GUNS. Indiana STRUGGLES
        to break free. But the powerful Nazis push him CLOSER...CLOSER...to
        the machine guns.

        In the TREE, the crew member keeps his pistol AIMED at Scraggy's head.
        CAMERA PANS UPWARD. Kezure is PERCHED on the top branch. ABOVE
        Scraggy. At the right moment, Kezure LEAPS DOWN. ON TOP of the
        treacherous crew member. Kezure KNOCKS the gun from the crew member's
        hand. BLAM! The gun GOES OFF. A stray bullet STRIKES the tree trunk.
        Kezure PUNCHES the crew member, who LOSES HIS BALANCE and FALLS from
        the tree. Going OVER THE EDGE of the ravine. His body DROPS hundreds
        of feet. CRASHING to the rocks below.

        Kezure SMILES. VICTORIOUS. But the tree suddenly CREAKS. GROANS. A
        CRACK has formed around the trunk, where the bullet STRUCK. The tree
        begins to TILT. Slowly TEETERING over the ravine's edge. Everyone
        PANICS. Betsy SHOUTS.

                                        BETSY
                        Nobody move. Or we'll go over.

        Everyone FREEZES. Scared to DEATH. They TIGHTLY GRIP their branches.
        The tree SWAYS. SLOWLY.

        Indiana still FIGHTS the two Nazis. STRUGGLING to keep his body from
        the tank's deadly machine guns. Indy FLIPS one of the Nazis over his
        head. The Nazi falls DIRECTLY IN FRONT of an entire row of machine
        guns. His body does a GROTESQUE DANCE OF DEATH. RIDDLED with bullets.

        Indiana and the other Nazi exchange PUNCHES. Their bodies TUMBLE over
        the rear of the tank. They fall onto a SMALL LEDGE. Above the
        enormous, rotating TANK TREADS. Indy and the Nazi battle to push the
        other OFF THE LEDGE. Indiana PREVAILS. He pushes the Nazi ON TOP of
        the giant treads. The Nazi tries to CLIMB BACK...but his body is
        DRAGGED BENEATH THE TANK. CRUSHED.

        Indiana turns, seeing Gutterbuhg climb out of a SECRET HATCH. On the
        tank's TOP LEVEL. Gutterbuhg POINTS HIS FINGER at Indy. It rapidly
        FIRES BULLETS. Indy DODGES around the side of the tank. Bullets BOUNCE
        off the metal beside him.

        Meanwhile, Indy's friends sit BREATHLESSLY on the swaying tree.
        Everyone is SILENT. STILL. Kezure suddenly SNEEZES. The tree CREAKS.
        It WAVERS over the ravine's edge. Nearly GOING OVER. But it DOESN'T.
        Everyone CATCHES THEIR BREATH. The tree continues to TEETER.

        Gutterbuhg PURSUES Indiana. Playing CAT AND MOUSE along the top level
        of the tank. Indiana PEERS around a corner. Seeing Gutterbuhg AHEAD.
        Indy grabs hold of the large ROTATING GUN BARREL. Indy LIFTS his feet.
        He SWINGS FORWAFD. RIDING the gun barrel. He SPINS around the tank's
        side and comes up BEHIND the unsuspecting Gutterbuhg. Indy JUMPS the
        Nazi. They begin to FIGHT. Gutterbuhg tries to move his Mechanical arm
        INTO POSITION. To SHOOT Indy.

        The tank continues to LOSE CONTROL. It no longer SPINS in CIRCLES. It
        is headed STRAIGHT TOWARD the tree filled with Indy's friends.

        INT. TANK

        Tyki SITS inside. WATCHING through the periscope. HELPLESS.

        EXT. PLAINS

        Gutterbuhg and Indiana continue to FIGHT. Suddenly, there is a BUZZING
        SOUND. An AIRPLANE ENGINE. Indiana LOOKS TO THE SKY. A NAZI BIPLANE
        FLIES TOWARD HIM. The biplane DIVES. Moving LOWER. LOWER. Gutterbuhg
        ROLLS OUT OF THE WAY. Indy is TRAPPED. A SITTING DUCK. The biplane
        SWOOPS DOWN. Trying to HIT Indy. He DIVES onto the tank top. Lying
        FLAT. The plane flies DIRECTLY OVER Indy. JUST MISSING him by a FEW
        FEET.

        Meanwhile, the tank still DRIVES DIRECTLY TOWARD the swaying tree and
        ravine. Scraggy, Betsy, Clare, Kezure and the others remain FROZEN.
        STILL. WATCHING the tank come for them. They are FRIGHTENED. HELPLESS.

        Indy and Gutterbuhg have RESUMED their fighting. STANDING on the
        tank's top. The biplane LOOPS in the air. Coming back for ANOTHER
        SHOT. Gutterbuhg LEAPS out of its path. The plane HEADS STRAIGHT for
        Indy. He again DIVES to the tank's top. The biplane SWOOPS DOWN. This
        time AIMING LOWER. As it PASSES Indy, its wheels GRAZE his back. Indy
        CRIES OUT.

        The tank continues to SPEED TOWD the tree of trapped people. Getting
        CLOSER...CLOSER...

        His back ACHING, Indy struggles to keep Gutterbuhg's machine gun arm
        from shooting him. The biplane does another midair LOOP. It TURNS and
        HEADS straight for Indy. This time, the plane WON'T MISS. As the
        biplane gets CLOSE... Indy grabs a tight HOLD of Gutterbuhg's
        Mechanical arm. Indy RAISES the arm. AIMING at the biplane. Indy pulls
        the arm's TRIGGER. FIRING a round of shots. The rapid bullets STRIKE
        the plane's belly. The biplane LOSES CONTROL. Its engine COUGHS. DIES.
        The biplane SPINS. Flipping into a NOSEDIVE. Leaving a trail of BLACK
        SMOKE. The biplane HITS the ground. A FLAMING CRASH! SEVERAL FEET from
        the tank.

        Indiana OVERPOWERS Gutterbuhg. With TWO HARD PUNCHES, Indy FLOORS the
        Nazi. Gutterbuhg lies SPRAWLED on the tank's top. UNCONSCIOUS. Indy
        TURNS. He sees that the speeding tank is going to CRASH into the
        treefull of his friends. Indiana LEAPS into the open tank compartment.

        INT. TANK

        Indiana TAKES the controls. But they are completely ALIEN to him. He
        hears a SQUEAL. TYKI. Behind HIM. Tyki motions to a SPECIFIC CONTROL.
        Indy GRABS HOLD of it.

        EXT. PLAINS

        The tank SCREECHES. SPINNING TO A STOP. INCHES from the swaying tree.
        Scraggy, Clare, Betsy, Kezure and the others, emit a UNIFIED SIGH OF
        RELIEF. But the tree suddenly CRACKS. It TILTS. FALLING OVER THE
        RAVINE EDGE! Everyone SCREAMS!

        There is the sudden CRACK OF A WHIP! The whip WRAPS ITSELF around the
        trunk of the tree. Indiana HOLDS the opposite end. He PULLS with all
        of his strength. HOLDING the tree in place. He PREVENTS the tree from
        FALLING into the ravine. Indy SHOUTS to his friends. Through GRITTED
        TEETH.

                                        INDIANA
                        Jump!... Jump!...

        Everyone begins to LEAP from the tree. To the GROUND. Indy CONTINUES
        to hold the tree in place. Muscles BULGING. Sweat POURING. Veins
        POPPING. Soon, everyone is back on the GROUND. SAFE. Indy RETRIEVES
        his whip. The tree TILTS. FALLING over the ravine edge. The tree
        CRASHES to the rocks below. SPLINTERING into a million pieces.

        On the top level of the tank, Gutterbuhg STIRS. WAKES. But Indiana is
        UPON HIM. Using a rope, Indy TIES UP Gutterbuhg. He removes the AMMO
        CARTRIDGE from the Nazi's mechanical arm. EMPTYING the bullets onto
        the ground. Indiana PUSHES Gutterbuhg INSIDE THE TANK.

        Tyki CRAWLS out of the tank. He SEES Clare. TEARS of happiness fill
        his eyes. He RUNS to Clare. The two exchange a WARM EMBRACE. Tyki SEES
        Scraggy. They shake hands and begin an EXCITED CONVERSATION. Like two
        OLD FRIENDS.

        INT. TANK

        Indy grabs the RADIO MICROPHONE. He HOLDS it in front of Gutterbuhg.

                                        INDIANA
                        Call your mommy.

        Gutterbuhg GROWLS. He SPEAKS German into the microphone. The voice of
        LIEUT. MEPHISTO answers. Echoing over the SPEAKERS. Indy GRABS the
        microphone. INTERRUPTING.

                                        INDIANA
                        This is Jones. I've got your tank.
                                (pause)
                        It's all over, pal. You lose.

                                                                        CUT TO:

        CLOSE-UP: LIEUT. MEPHISTO

        He is ANGRY. UPSET. But he FORCES himself to CALMLY address Indiana.

                                        MEPHISTO
                        Doctor Jones... You surprise me. For
                        a supposedly intelligent man...you
                        jump to childish conclusions.
                        Remember... You are driving our
                        tank. We can FOLLOW you anywhere.
                                (vehement)
                        You are far from defeating us, my
                        friend. The battle has only just
                        begun.

        CAMERA PULLS BACK. Mephisto is standing beside a long ROW OF TENTS.
        Housing many TROOPS. Several JEEPS are parked in the background. All
        mounted with RECOILEST CANNONS. 5 CANVAS TRUCKS are also here. Filled
        with more TROOPS, CANNONS and AMMUNITION. The Nazis have assembled an
        ENTIRE ARMY!

        INDIANA

        DROPS the microphone. Suddenly WORRIED. He HURRIES out of the tank.
        Gutterbuhg stays BEHIND. LAUGHING.

        EXT. PLAINS

        Indiana HURRIES to Tyki and the others. Indy shoots an IMPATIENT
        glance to Scraggy.

                                        INDIANA
                        We've got to move. Fast.
                                (points to Tyki)
                        Ask him if he knows the way to the
                        City from here.

        Scraggy ASKS Tyki. The pygmy ANSWERS, pointing OFF SCREEN. Scraggy
        TRANSLATES for Indiana.

                                        SCRAGGY
                        He do not know exact place... But it
                        is somewhere over there.

        Indy TURNs to the direction where Scraggy points. Several miles away,
        we see COUNTLESS ROWS OF MOUNTAINS. Thick layers of CLOUDS surround
        the mountains. Indiana SIGHS.

                                        INDIANA
                        A lotta' good that does us... It
                        could take us months...years...to
                        search everyone of those.

        Betsy has an IDEA. She removes the STONE MIRROR from Indiana's pocket.

                                        BETSY
                        Maybe he knows what to do with
                        this...

        Betsy GIVES the mirror to Tyki. His eyes WIDEN. In AWE. Tyki
        RECOGNIZES the mirror. He excitedly EXPLAINS to Scraggy, who
        TRANSLATES for Indiana.

                                        SCRAGGY
                        It is "Magical Mirror of Sun Wu
                        Kung"...

                                        INDIANA
                        But whattayou do with it?

        Scraggy ASKS Tyki. The energetic pygmy PLACES the mirror against an
        upright stone. Tyki ADJUSTS the mirror, until it FACES the distant
        mountains. Tyki emits a high pitched GIGGLE. POINTING to the mirror.
        Everyone GATHERS around the mirror. The SOUND TRACK MUSIC SOARS.

        The mirror reflects the CLOUDS above the mountains. But above one
        SPECIFIC MOUNTAIN, we see the image of a CITY REFLECTED ON THE CLOUDS!

        Indiana TURNS away from the mirror, looking at the SPECIFIC MOONTAIN.
        But the city is ONLY REFLECTED IN THE MAGICAL MIRROR! Clare SMILES at
        Indy, quoting Tyki from earlier.

                                        CLARE
                        "I come from Land Of City On
                        Clouds".

        Indiana NODS. HOPEFUL. ANXIOUS. He looks back to the magical
        REFLECTION.

                                                                        CUT TO:

        THE TANK

        travelling a NARROW PATH. Along the side of a STEEP MOUNTAIN. The tank
        moves UPWARD. Toward the mountain TOP. The tank JERKS. WOBBLES. It's
        as if the driver were having TROUBLE with the controls.

        INT. TANK

        Indiana DRIVES. UNFAMILIAR with the controls. The tank is CROWDED with
        everyone. Betsy and Clare sit BESIDE Indy. Gutterbuhg is DIRECTLY
        BEHIND HIM. Kezure TEACHES a game to Scraggy. Tyki, the Pirates and
        the various crew members WATCH. The game appears to be a BIZARRE
        VERSION of chess. Only the tokens are DRIED INSECTS and LIZARDS.
        Kezure EXPLAINS.

                                        KEZURE
                        This is called "Taskipi". Only the
                        bravest play.

        Upon hearing this, Scraggy is even MORE EXCITED TO PLAY. The game
        BEGINS.

        Indiana is becoming extremely FRUSTRATED by the tank controls. Betsy
        gives a SERIOUS LOOK to him.

                                        BETSY
                        I've been talking to Dr. Clarke
                        about our problem.

                                        INDIANA
                                (struggling with tank)
                        Problem?... Hey... What're you two
                        doin' talkin' behind my back?...

                                        CLARE
                        Betsy needed help. I obliged.

                                        INDIANA
                        Since when did you become the female
                        Sigmund Freud?

                                        CLARE
                        Since I received a Masters Degree in
                        Psychology.

        Indy ROLLS HIS EYES. Meanwhile, Kezure has TAKEN all of Scraggy's
        tokens. He's obviously WON the game. A carefree Scraggy THROWS up his
        hands.

                                        SCRAGGY
                        We play again?

                                        KEZURE
                                (pause, serious)
                        The game is not yet over, my friend.

                                        SCRAGGY
                        Oh?

                                        KEZURE
                        You have lost. You must pay.

                                        SCRAGGY
                                (going through pockets)
                        I don't have money...

                                        KEZURE
                        No. No. money.
                                (deadly smile)
                        Rules of the game declare that I may
                        choose a souvenir.
                                (removes a knife)
                        A part of your body. Any part I
                        wish.

        Scraggy GULPS. Kezure PAUSES. RUBBING his jaw. THINKING. Meanwhile,
        Betsy EXPLAINS to Indians.

                                        BETSY
                        Dr. Clarke says that you're not
                        really in love with me. You're just
                        trying to prove that you can still
                        attract younger women. You're
                        terrified of getting old.

                                        INDIANA
                        That's crazy.

                                        BETSY
                        That's what I told her. I told her
                        that you really did love me.

                                        INDIANA
                                (fumbling)
                        Well...that's...ah...well...

                                        BETSY
                                (worried)
                        You mean... She was right?...

                                        INDIANA
                        No... I mean Yes... I mean...

        Indy TURNS, seeing Clare GLARING at him. Indy SIGHS. PAUSES. He gives
        Betsy a TENDER, HONEST look.

                                        INDIANA
                        No, Betsy. I don't love you.

                                        BETSY
                                (tears fill her eyes)
                        That's the first time you ever said
                        it!

        Betsy begins CRYING. Into Clare's ARMS. Indiana SHAKES his head. Clare
        COMFORTS Betsy.

                                        CLARE
                        There. There. He's a very disturbed
                        man.

        Indiana SIGHS. He TURNS. FACE to FACE with a GRINNING and NODDING
        Gutterbuhg.

        Kezure has made his DECISION. Scraggy WAITS. TERRIFIED. Kezure RAISES
        his knife. TOWARD Scraggy's face.

                                        KEZURE
                        Your eyes. They are a striking deep
                        blue.

        Scraggy COVERS his face. Kezure ATTACKS him. Trying to CUT OUT
        Scraggy's eyes. A FIGHT begins. The crew members VS. the Pirates.
        Indiana TURNS, away from the controls. He BREAKS UP the fight.

                                        INDIANA
                                (angry)
                        Enough. We're in this together. If
                        we start fighting among ourselves...
                        we'll never get out alive.

        The men CALM DOWN. CATCHING their breath. Kezure PUTS AWAY his knife.
        He GLARES at Scraggy.

                                        KEZURE
                        You owe me, old man.

        EXT. MOUNTAIN

        The tank, without a driver, begins to SWERVE OFF THE MOUNTAIN ROAD.

        INT. TANK

        Clare NOTICES the tank going over the mountain. She SCREAMS.

                                        CLARE
                        Doctor Jones!!!

        Indy TURNS. LEAPING back to the controls. He hurriedly STEERS the tank
        back onto the mountain path. Saving it at the LAST MOMENT. Everyone
        CATCHES their breath. Indiana STEPS on the gas, continuing AHEAD.

                                                                        CUT TO:

        EXT. MOUNTAIN - A FEW HOURS LATER

        The tank has nearly made it to the TOP of the mountain. Trekking
        through a NARROW, ROCKY RAVINE. The tank rolls to a STOP. The top
        hatch FLIPS OPEN. Indiana, Scraggy and Tyki POP OUT. Tyki suddenly
        points to the MOUNTAIN TOP, which is cloaked in thick LAYERS OF
        CLOUDS. Tyki's eyes fill with JOYOUS TEARS. He begins to SHOUT. His
        voice SQUEALS with EXCITEMENT. Scraggy TRANSLATES for Indy.

                                        SCRAGGY
                        He say that two miles ahead...we
                        will find his home.

        Indiana SMILES. EXCITED by the prospects. TOUCHED by Tyki's reaction.
        Indy looks to the FOOT of the mountain. Several miles BELOW.

        THE NAZI FORCES

        have ARRIVED! They are still at least TWO HOURS from reaching Indiana
        and the others. The massive army MOVES FAST. They begin to DRIVE along
        the mountain path. FOLLOWING Indiana. In HOT PURSUIT.

        Indy PAUSES. WORRIED. THINKING. He LOOKS at the surrounding ROCKY
        WALLS, then to the tank's enormous GUN BARREL. An IDEA. He HURRIES
        back inside of the tank. Scraggy and Tyki FOLLOW. CLOSING the hatch
        above them.

        INT. TANK

        Indy LOOKS at the tank's control panel. A PUZZLEMENT. He LOOKS at
        Gutterbuhg.

                                        INDIANA
                        How do I work the big gun?

        Gutterbuhg SMILES. He REFUSES to answer. Indy has NO TIME for games.
        He LOOKS at Kezure.

                                        INDIANA
                        Want your souvenir?
                                (grabs Gutterbuhg's left
                                arm)
                        Start with his good arm.

        Kezure SMILES and removes his LONG KNIFE. He moves it Gutterbuhg's
        NECK. The snivelling Nazi CRIES OUT.

                                        GUTTERBUHG
                        W-W-Wait!... Please!...

        Indy NODS to Kezure. The Pirate King moves his KNIFE. Gutterbuhg
        hurriedly POINTS to two switches on the control panel.

                                        GUTTERBUHG
                        There. That is what you want.

        Indy NODS. He TURNS to the switches.

        EXT. RAVINE

        CLOSE-UP: The tank's large gun barrel SWIVELS. Pointing UPWARD. To the
        ROCKS above. The gun FIRES A SHOT. It swivels a FEW FEET. Then FIRES
        ANOTHER. And ANOTHER. A RUMBLING SOUND echoes through the area.

        INT. TANK

        Indy HITS the gas.

        EXT. RAVINE

        The tank SHOOTS forward. SPEEDING ahead. An AVALANCHE BEGINS! JUST
        MISSING the tank. Several pounds of ROCKS and DEBRIS fall from above.
        The rocks create A THICK WALL. BLOCKING the mountain path.

        The tank CONTINUES along the twisting, narrow mountain path. Moving
        further and further UPWARD. The tank DISAPPEARS INTO THE THICK CLOUDS
        that surround the mountain.

        INT. TANK

        Indiana LOOKS through the persiscope. His view BLINDED by the clouds.

        EXT. MOUNTAIN

        The tank is a LARGE, GREY BLUR through the clouds. Several DARK,
        BULKING FIGURES APPEAR! They CLIMB along the ravine sides and tops.
        The mysterious figures SURROUND the tank. All are holding ENORMOUS
        BOULDERS over their heads. AIMED at the tank.

        INT. TANK

        Indy EASES up on the gas. The tank SLOWS. Suddenly, there is a LOUD
        CRASH! The tank is HIT. RATTLING. SHAKING. Everyone is TOSSED. Save
        for Indy, who STAYS at the controls. He continues to GUIDE the tank
        FORWARD. There is another CRASH. And ANOTHER. And ANOTHER.

        EXT. MOUNTAIN

        The dark figures SHOWER the tank with heavy boulders. The tank's gun
        barrel SNAPS IN TWO. Headlights SMASH. Its body becomes DENTED.
        CRACKED.

        INT. TANK

        Indiana is TOUGH. PERSISTENT. He continues to move the jolting tank
        FORWARD. As the surrounding walls CAVE IN. SHATTER. Everyone PANICS.
        SCREAMING.

        EXT. MOUNTAIN

        The injured, wobbling tank moves OUT OF THE CLOUDS. Arriving around
        the corner from the MOUNTAIN TOP. The countless dark figures continue
        to FOLLOW the tank. SCURRYING along the ravine sides and tops. The
        figures EMERGE from the clouds. For the first time, they are VISIBLE.
        And we see that the figures are TALL... HAIRY... MUSCULAR... GORILLAS!
        They CONTINUE to assault the tank with boulders.

        INT. TANK

        Indiana still attempts to move the tank FORWARD. But the engine begins
        to COUGH. SPUTTER. And DIES.

        EXT. MOUNTAIN

        The tank COMES TO A SUDDEN STOP. One of the Gorillas emits a BIGS
        PITCHED SHRIEK. COMMUNICATING with the others. The others PAUSE. They
        STOP the attack. The Gorillas APPROACH the tank. SLOWLY. CAUTIOUSLY.
        The apes REACH OUT. TOUCHING the tank's wrecked body. A few of the
        apes begin to CLIMB onto the tank.

        The tank's top hatch FLIPS OPEN. Indy's HEAD pops out. TWO HAIRY ARMS
        REACH INTO FRAME AND GRAB INDIANA! An enormous Gorilla pulls Indy OUT
        OF THE HATCH! The ape TOSSES INDY OFF SCREEN!

        Indiana FLIES INTO THE AIR! He LANDS IN THE ARMS of another Gorilla.
        The ape TAKES Indy's WHIP and THROWS him to another Gorilla, who takes
        Indy's HAT. The Gorilla TOSSES Indy to another ape, who tears off
        Indy's LEATHER JACKET. The helpless Indy is THROWN to yet another
        Gorilla. The angry ape RAISES Indy over his head. The Gorilla prepares
        to THROW INDIANA OFF OF THE MOUNTAIN'S EDGE!

        Tyki's VOICE ERUPTS FROM OFF SCREEN. The Gorilla PAUSES, suspending
        Indiana HIGH IN THE AIR. The Gorilla TURNS to Tyki. The pygmy STANDS
        on the tank. He SHOUTS AN ORDER to the Gorilla. The ape NODS.
        UNDERSTANDING. He KNOWS Tyki. The Gorilla gently PLACES Indy back on
        the ground. Indiana ADJUSTS what remains of his clothing. He turns,
        seeing A GROUP OF GORILLAS. HUDDLED together. The Gorillas SEPARATE.
        They have DRESSED one of the apes in INDIANA'S HAT, LEATHER JACKET AND
        WHIP! The ape begins to SNAP THE WHIP, almost as if he were IMITATING
        Indy.

        Scraggy, Betsy, Clare and the others have CLIMBED OUT of the tank.
        Upon seeing the Gorilla DRESSED as Indy, they BURST INTO LAUGHTER. A
        very ANGRY Indiana growls at Tyki.

                                        INDIANA
                                (pointing to Gorilla)
                        Tell him to take off my stuff!

        Through laughter, Scraggy TRANSLATES for Tyki. The pygmy SHOUTS an
        order to the Gorilla. The ape REMOVES the hat and leather jacket,
        RELUCTANTLY giving them back to a grumbling Indiana.

        Tyki continues to SHOOT orders to the other Gorillas. The pygmy
        suddenly appears STRONG. AUTHORITATIVE. He obviously has POWER over
        the beasts. The Gorillas GATHER together. They MOVE TOWARD the people.
        The apes GENTLY take the hands of the various humans. It is a WARM,
        ENCHANTING sight, as the friendly Gorillas LEAD the humans forward.
        Clare, using her Gorilla MOTIONS and SOUNDS, communicates with the
        beasts. The group moves AROUND A TWISTING CORNER OF THE PATH. Toward
        the MOUNTAIN TOP.

        AROUND THE CORNER

        Indiana and the others are met with an AWESOME SIGHT! Indy STOPS. His
        mouth DROPS OPEN. Clare is equally ASTOUNDED. Betsy and the others
        STARE AHEAD. In total WONDERMENT. Even Gutterbuhg is AMAZED. The SOUND
        TRACK MUSIC EXPLODES INTO A THUNDERING CRESCENDO!

        THE LOST CITY OF SUN WU-KUNG

        LIES AHEAD of the group. A SPECTACULAR SIGHT! A city whose every
        building and tower is cast in SOLID GOLD! SPARKLING! GLISTENING! A
        HEAVENLY place. The City is protected by a deep MOAT. The fins of
        several SHARKS move through the moat waters. A THICK STONE WALL
        surrounds the city. A large, golden DRAWBRIDGE is built into the wall.
        PASSAGEWAY into the city.

        A tremendous TOWER stretches above the city walls. The GUARD, a pygmy
        similiar to Tyki, is POSTED in the tower. The guard SPOTS Tyki,
        approaching the city walls. The guard's EYES LIGHT. He SMILES. The
        guard CRIES OUT! SHOUTING to everyone inside of the City. He continues
        to REPEAT a certain phrase.

        Scraggy TRANSLATES the guard's words for Indiana.

                                        SCRAGGY
                        He say... "Our Prince has returned
                        home".

        Indiana SMILES. Soon, the beautiful sound of COUNTLESS RINGING BELLS
        is heard, welcoming Tyki home. Eyes WATERING, a proud Tyki and the
        Gorillas LEAD everyone to the foot of the City Walls. The enormous
        drawbridge begins to LOWER. A STUNNING SHAFT OF GOLDEN LIGHT escapes
        from the opening. As the drawbridge continues to lower, the shaft of
        light becomes WIDER. BRIGHTER. It ILLUMINATES the faces of Indy and
        the others. When the drawbridge is completely LOWERED, everyone is LED
        INTO THE CITY. Their bodies SILHOUETTED against the warm glowing
        light.

        INT. CITY

        WE ENTER with Indy and the others. The city is BURSTING with the
        bright colors of various VEGETABLE and FRUIT GARDENS, and various
        other EXOTIC PLANT LIFE. Luscious GREEN GRASS and CRYSTAL CLEAR LAKES
        surround many of the homes. The earthen streets are literally PAVED
        WITH GOLD. The men and women of the City are members of Tyki's RACE.
        ORIENTAL PYGMIES. There is a PEACEFUL, JOYOUS quality about them. They
        RUSH toward Tyki. EMBRACING him. SHOWERING him with kisses. WELCOMING
        him home.

        Indiana and the others are in AWE of this new world. Gutterbuhg WALKS
        with them. CAMERA PANS to his HANDS. He struggles to UNTIE his
        bindings.

        Kezure SPOTS something. A small, SOLID GOLD GARDEN TOOL. Lying in a
        VEGETABLE GARDEN. Kezure's eyes fill with GREED. He moves to STEAL the
        can. Kezure GRABS the tool and begins to HIDE it. BENEATH his cloak. A
        LARGE GORILLA'S HAND GRABS Kezure's arm. TOWERING over the Pirate
        king, the Gorilla WAVES his finger at Kezure. A WARNING. NO STEALING.
        The nervous Kezure NODS. He PLACES the garden tool back on the ground.

        Meanwhile, Indy and the others are led to an elaborate PALACE. They
        ascend the several GOLDEN STAIRS, toward the entrance. The palace
        doors OPEN. An OLDER MAN steps outside. He is BOHBALA. The City's
        RULER. A few PALACE GUARDS stand beside him. Bohbala RAISES his arms
        over the crowd. Pygmies and Gorillas DROP TO THEIR KNEES. In REVERNCE.

        Tyki RUNS to Bohbala. They EMBRACE. TEARS OF JOY fill their eyes.
        Bohbala WIPES away his tears. He gives a WARM SMILE to Indiana and the
        others. He SPEAKS. SOFTLY. In a WISE voice. Scraggy TRANSLATES for the
        others.

                                        SCRAGGY
                        He thank us...for returning his son.

        Indiana and the others SMILE. Betsy WHIPSERS to Indy.

                                        BETSY
                        If the little guy's pushin' 200
                        years?... How old's his Father?

        Indy motions for Betsy to "Shhh". Bohbala continues to SPEAK. Scraggy
        TRANSLATES.

                                        SCRAGGY
                        His name "Bohbala". He is Ruler of
                        City, faithful servant of his Lord
                        and Master... Sun Wu-Kung.
                                (pause, smile)
                        He welcome us to stay. As long as we
                        wish.

        Indiana exchanges a HOPEFUL glance with Clare. As Bohbala CONTINUES to
        speak, CAMERA PANS TO GUTTERBUHG. The Nazi has successfully UNTIED his
        bindings. FREE. While the others listen to Bohbala, Gutterbuhg REMOVES
        ONE SPARE BULLET FROM HIS MOUTH. He slyly INSERTS the bullet into his
        mechanical arm.

        Indiana is TOO CONCERNED with Bohbala to notice Gutterbuhg.

                                        INDIANA
                                (anxious, to Scraggy)
                        Ask him where we may find the burial
                        place...or the remains...of Sun Wu-
                        Kung...

        Scraggy TURNS to ask Bohbala. But his question is INTERRUPTED by
        Gutterbuhg's MECHANICAL ARM. It EXTENDS INTO FRAME! Its finger POINTED
        AT INDIANA! Everyone STARES. SHOCKED. But the bizarre sight greatly
        AMUSES Bohbala. He begins to LAUGH. He REACHES OUT and PUSHES
        Gutterbuhg's finger away. But the machine gun GOES OFF! FIRING!
        Bohbala is HIT! In the CHEST. He FALLS. Tyki KNEELS, cradling
        Bohbala's head in his arms. Tyki CALLS his Father's name. It is
        FUTILE. Bohbala is DEAD.

        The crowd of villagers STARE. CONFUSED. They are unaccustomed to
        VIOLENCE.

        Indiana CLUTCHES Gutterbuhg by the throat.

                                        INDIANA
                        Bastard...

        Indiana pulls back his fist to PUNCH the Nazi. But Indy is STOPPED by
        the PALACE GUARDS. They move their SWORDS to his throat. Indy is
        suddenly PUZZLED. The VILLAGERS FALL TO THEIR KNEES. BOWING to
        Gutterbuhg. A distraught Tyki hurriedly EXPLAINS to Scraggy, who
        translates for Indy.

                                        SCRAGGY
                        It is written... If ruler is
                        defeated by greater power...he who
                        possess that power...
                                (points to Gutterbuhg)
                        ...shall become ruler!

        Gutterbuhg's eyes fill with a sadistic THRILL. He RAISES his
        MECHANICAL ARM. In a "Heil Hitler" POSE. The entire City IMITATES the
        Nazi. RAISING their right arms. CHEERING. HAILING their new leader.

        Indiana is HORRIFIED by the scene. Tyki is UPSET. SCREAMING. He knows
        that Gutterbuhg is truly EVIL! But NONE of the villagers listen.
        Indiana LOOKS to his SHOCKED friends.

                                        INDIANA
                        This is turning into one helluva
                        nightmare.

                                        GUTTERBUBG
                                (hears, smiles at Indy)
                        One you will never awaken from,
                        Doctor Jones.

        Indy GLARES at Gutterbuhg. Clare and Betsy exchange a FRIGHTENED
        glance.

                                                                        CUT TO:

        INT. PALACE - RULER'S CHAMBER

        A beautiful, expansive chamber, filled with TAPESTRIES and ARTWORK.
        Gutterbuhg sits in an elaborate GOLDEN THRONE. He has donned a
        ghoulish NEW OUTFIT. The robes of BOHBALA, the dead ruler. Gutterbuhg
        is being ATTENDED upon by several villagers, who bring him countless
        PLATES OF FOOD. He is surrounded by SEVERAL WOMEN, who patiently wait
        for his orders. Gutterbuhg GOBBLES down the variety of food and wine.
        DROOLING. SLOBBERING.

        Scraggy KNEELS before the Nazi. Gutterbuhg USES Indiana's WHIP as a
        LEASH. It is TIED around Scraggy's neck and HELD by the Nazi.
        Gutterbuhg PULLS the leash. HARD. Nearly STRANGLING Scraggy. His mouth
        FILLED WITH FOOD, Gutterbuhg SCREAMS at Scraggy.

                                        GUTTERBUHG
                        I want to see Jones!

        Scraggy TRANSLATES for the guards.

        INT. DUNGEON

        DARK. MUSTY. Surrounded with moss covered STONE WALLS. Located BENEATH
        the Palace. Indy and the others are LOCKED inside. Everyone is SILENT.
        STARING. WAITING. Clare CONSOLES a tearful, despondent Tyki. The
        dungeon gate OPENS. The two Guards ENTER. They DRAG Indiana out of the
        dungeon. Betsy CALLS OUT to Indy. Trying to FOLLOW. But the guards
        SLAM the wooden door in Betsy's face. She peers through the small
        BARRED WINDOW. WORRIED. UPSET.

        INT. PALACE

        Indiana is LED into the Ruler's Chamber. Indy SEES Scraggy, tied to a
        leash. An angry, VENGEFUL look covers Indy's face. He TURNS to
        Gutterbuhg. The Nazi, still STUFFING his face with food, pulls TIGHTLY
        on Scraggy's leash.

                                        GUTTERBUHG
                        Your friend makes a wonderful
                        interpreter.

        Indy's eyes BURN. Gutterbuhg GULPS down a glass of wine. Liquid
        SPITTLES from the sides of his mouth. He LOOKS at Indy.

                                        GUTTERBUHG
                        "The Nazi Party will exist for one
                        thousand years...and I wish to be
                        alive for every year!"
                                (pause)
                        That is a favorite philosophy of our
                        feuher.

                                        INDIANA
                        Your feuher's philosphies belong on
                        a bathroom wall.

                                        GUTTERBUHG
                                (angry, slapping Indy
                                across the face)
                        This is a very serious matter,
                        Doctor Jones. It could save your
                        life.
                                (pause)
                        I understand that somewhere in this
                        City...there is a Garden of...
                        Immortal Peaches?...
                                (Indy doesn't respond,
                                Gutterbuhg continues)
                        I want information about this
                        Garden... And I would greatly
                        appreciate it, if you would share
                        everything you know, with me.

                                        INDIANA
                        I don't share anything with Nazis.

        Gutterbuhg NODS. He TAKES another bite of food, shooting a GLOWERING
        look to Indiana.

                                        GUTTERBUHG
                        Very well. My friends will be here
                        soon. They will rest...enjoy the
                        pleasures of my newfound kingdom...
                                (kisses a woman, and
                                pushes her away)
                        Then we shall exterminate these
                        worthless people! Destroy their
                        City! And we will carry away all of
                        its riches...in pieces.

        Gutterbuhg goes back to his FOOD. Scraggy exchanges a WORRIED GLANCE
        with Indiana.

                                                                        CUT TO:

        THE NAZI ARMY

        TRAVELLING along the narrow mountain path. They are more than HALFWAY
        up the mountain. LIEUT. MEPHISTO rides in the FRONT JEEP. He LOOKS to
        his driver, who REPORTS to Mephisto.

                                        DRIVER
                                (German, English
                                subtitles)
                        Sir... We shall reach the mountain
                        top in less than sixty minutes.

        Mephisto NODS. ANXIOUS.

                                                                        CUT TO:

        THE LOST CITY - COLISEUM

        An enormous STONE ARENA. Located in the CENTER of the City. It
        resembles the ROMAN COLISEUM in size and structure. The coliseum's top
        walls are SURROUNDED by countless, large METAL BELLS. The bells are
        RINGING. They are the same bells we heard earlier...but they now sound
        EERIE... THREATENING. The many seats are FILLED with members of the
        village. All GATHERED for a special event.

        Gutterbuhg sits in the elaborate RULER'S BOX. It is covered with a
        protective, GOLDEN GRATING. The box is located directly above the
        earthen PLAYING FIELD. Indy's WHIP is still tied around Scraggy's
        neck, who kneels at Gutterbuhg's FEET.

        TWO GUARDS lead a shirtless INDIANA JONES onto the playing field. They
        bring Indy to a STEEL CAGE, located directly below Gutterbuhg's box.
        Inside of the cage, are TWO ENORMOUS BUFFALO. ANGRY. RESTLESS.

        Betsy, Clare, Tyki, Kezure, the remaining Pirates and Crew members,
        all helplessly watch from inside of a LARGE METAL CAGE. The cage is
        SUSPENDED in the air... DANGLING over a deep pit. It is filled with
        COUNTLESS MANEATING TIGERS.

        Indy is LED into the cage. BETWEEN the two buffalo. The guards GRABS
        HOLD of Indiana. They TIE one of his arms, and one of his legs, to
        EACH SIDW of the buffalo. Preparing to DRAW and QUARTER Indiana.

        A DELIGHTED Gutterbuhg PEERS DOWN at Indiana.

                                        GUTTERBUHG
                        Doctor Jones... Those beasts are
                        anxious to run wild. Free.
                                (vicious smile)
                        How long will you be able to ride...
                        before they TEAR YOU IN TWO?

        Indy LOOKS at Scraggy, who is very FRIGHTENED.

                                        GUTTERBUHG
                        Goodbye, Doctor Jones.

        Gutterbuhg TURNS to the guards. Ready to give them the ORDER...to OPEN
        THE CAGE and SET THE BUFFALO FREE! Indy suddenly SCREAMS.

                                        INDIANA
                        Heil Hitler!

        Upon hearing the words, Gutterbuhg STANDS. Like a ROBOT. He RAISES his
        mechanical arm in a "Heil Hitler" POSE.

                                        GUTTERBUHG
                        Heil Hitler!

        The FINGERS of Gutterbuhg's mechanical arm get CAUGHT IN THE METAL
        GRATING ABOVE HIS HEAD! Gutterbuhg TRIES TO REMOVE his fingers. NO
        GOOD. STUCK. Gutterbuhg PULLS. HARD. His mechanical arm is RIPPED FROM
        ITS SOCKET! It DANGLES from the grating.

        The crowd WATCHES. PUZZLED. SHOCKED.

        Scraggy THINKS FAST. He LEAPS to his feet and GRABS the arm. He TEARS
        IT OUT of the grating. Scraggy HOLDS the arm above his head. Now it is
        HE who possesses the POWER! The crowd CHEERS Scraggy! Their NEW RULER!

        Gutterbuhg STEPS BACK. Suddenly FRIGHTENED. Scraggy ORDERS the guards
        to FREE Indiana. The guards hurriedly UNTIE Indy from the buffalo.
        Gutterbuhg TURNS. RUNNING out of the Coliseum. Scraggy SCREAMS to the
        people, motioning for them to FOLLOW Gutterbuhg. Several people LEAP
        from their seats. CHASING the Nazi.

        EXT. COLISEUM

        Gutterbuhg DASHES OUT! A CROWD OF VILLAGERS follow him. In HOT
        PURSUIT. Gutterbuhg RUNS toward the city gates. He RUNS through.
        ESCAPING the City. The crowd PAUSES. STOPPING. They'll go NO FURTHER.
        They SCREAM and SHOUT at the departing Gutterbuhg, who disappears INTO
        THE MOUNTAINS.

        INT. COLISEUM

        Indiana REJOINS his friends on the playing field. They have been FREED
        from the cage. Scraggy gives the WHIP to Indy. Indy is IMPATIENT.
        WORRIED. He LOOKS at everyone.

                                        INDIANA
                        Nazis'll be be here soon. We gotta
                        move fast.

        Scraggy gives Gutterbuhg's MECAHNICAL ARM to Tyki. The pygmy NODS. He
        UNDERSTANDS. Tyki RAISES THE ARM TOWARD THE PEOPLE. They CHEER Tyki,
        their rightful ruler. Tyki, PULLS BACK and THROWS the mechanical arm.
        HIGH INTO THE AIR! It SOARS several feet! FLYING OVER the coliseum
        walls.

        EXT. CITY

        The arm flies THROUGH the air... It lands into the MOAT! The arm is
        ATTACKED by a horde of hungry sharks. They TEAR it to pieces.

                                                                        CUT TO:

        EXT. MOUNTAIN PATH

        The Nazis have arrived at the section of path that is BLOCKED by the
        AVALANCHE. Their other VEHICLES and TROOPS have pulled back. A FEW
        HUNDRED FEET from the AVALANCHE. SEVERAL STICKS OF DYNAMITE have been
        placed beneath the avalanche. The T.N.T. is connected to a LONG FUSE,
        that extends along the path. LIEUT. MEPHISTO stands at the fuse's end.
        He STRIKES a match. Preparing to LIGHT THE FUSE. The match flare is
        INCHES from the fuse... Mephisto is INTERRUPTED by a FAMILIAR VOICE.
        It is GUTTERBUHG. Mephisto BLOWS OUT the match.

        A SOAKING WET Sgt. Gutterbuhg SLIDES down the edge of the ravine. He
        still wears the COLORFUL, ELABORATE ROBES of Bohbala. Mephisto is
        PUZZLED by Gutterbuhg's BIZARRE APPEARANCE. Gutterbuhg STOPS in front
        of Mephisto. Gutterbuhg ATTEMPTS a "Heil, Hitler"... but suddenly
        realizes that his mechanical arm is GONE. Gutterbuhg DRIPS WATER all
        over Mephisto, who is DISGUSTED by the appearance of his officer. He
        SLAPS Gutterbuhg.

                                        MEPHISTO
                                (German; English
                                subtitles)
                        Idiot!... Why are you dressed like
                        that!... Where is your uniform?...

        Before he can answer, Gutterbuhg is SHOVED AWAY by the disgusted
        Mephisto, who ATTEMPTS to LIGHT the fuse. But his matches are USELESS.
        Soaked with WATER. Furious, Mephisto SLAPS Gutterbuhg, ordering him to
        fetch something. The snivelling Gutterbuhg nods and bows, SCURRYING
        away. He RUNS into the rear of A CANVAS TRUCK.

        INT. TRUCK

        Filled with several crates of DYNAMITE and SUPPLIES. Gutterbuhg DASHES
        inside. Toward a SILVER, METALLIC BRIEFCASE that rests in the rear of
        the truck. Gutterbuhg's greasy fingers OPEN the briefcase.

        Inside, encased in black velvet, are TWO RECTANGULAR COMPARTMENTS. One
        of the compartments is EMPTY. The other houses another MECHANICAL ARM.
        Gutterbuhg quickly ATTACHES the arm to the stub of his shoulder and
        RUNS BACK OUTSIDE.

        EXT. MOUNTAIN PATH

        Gutterbuhg REJOINS Mephisto and EXTENDS his new mechanical arm TOWARD
        THE FUSE. Gutterbuhg POINTS his finger. He SQUEEZES A LEVER, located
        on the palm of the mechanical arm. A BRIGHT, JAGGED LINE OF ELECTRICAL
        CURRENT shoots from the arm's finger! The electricity LIGHTS the fuse.
        It BURNS. Moving TOWARD the dynamite. Gutterbuhg and Mephisto HIDE
        behind a rock. There is a LOUD EXPLOSION. Rocks and debris FLY THROUGH
        THE AIR. The path is CLEARED.

        INT. CITY

        The SOUND OF THE EXPLOSION echoes through the City. SHAKING the city
        walls. The Nazis are CLOSE.

        Indiana STANDS in the city square. He has ASSEMBLED everyone for the
        battle. Tyki and the pygmies are armed with BOWS and ARROWS, SPEARS
        and BLOW PIPES. Kezure and the Pirates hold their SWORDS. Scraggy's
        men carry REVOLVERS and DAGGERS. Clare and Betsy STAND with several
        Gorillas. Tyki WHISPERS to Scraggy, who TRANSLATES for Indiana.

                                        SCRAGGY
                        They want you to give speech.

                                        INDIANA
                        What?!?...

                                        SCRAGGY
                        Before battle... General always give
                        speech to inspire troops.

                                        INDIANA
                        General?... Who the hell do they
                        think I am... Custer?...

        But ALL EYES are on Indiana. DEPENDING on him. Indy SIGHS. Trying to
        THINK of something to say. He MUMBLES to Scraggy.

                                        INDIANA
                        Geez... The only speeches I remember
                        are from college...when I played
                        ball...

        Scraggy SHRUGS. Indy CLEARS his throat. He LOOKS at everyone.
        FUMBLING.

                                        INDIANA
                        Men...and, ah...women... I...ah...
                        We're about to face one of our
                        toughest opponents... They've got
                        size...hardware...and well, quite
                        frankly...we're the underdogs...

        Indy's eyes LIGHT. A moment of INSPIRATION. The background MUSIC
        SLOWLY BEGINS TO RISE. Indy's voice becomes LOUDER. TOUGHER.

                                        INDIANA
                        But...well, if it wasn't for the
                        little guy...where would this
                        country be?...
                                (excited, louder)
                        I mean...I knew this little guy once
                        ...a scrawny runt, with thick black
                        glasses and about 300 different
                        kinds of allergies... But this
                        little kid had a dream... He wanted
                        to be on the football team.
                                (Music rises, so does
                                Indy's voice)
                        Well, all the big guys made his life
                        miserable...always shoving his head
                        in the drinking fountain...putting
                        mustard in his pants...throwing me
                        ...'er, HIM!...throwing HIM in the
                        shower with all his clothes on...
                                (louder, heartfelt)
                        But that little guy didn't quit. Be
                        worked hard. Never gave up. And in
                        two years...he was the Quarterback.
                        Star of the team. And you know why?...
                                (Music SOARS, as does
                                Indy's voice)
                        'Cause that little kid had somethin'
                        that those big guys never heard
                        of... He had HEART! And nothin' can
                        stop that! Nothin'!
                                (we hear the Nazis
                                approaching, Indy
                                screams)
                        Now let's go out there and show 'em
                        JUST HOW TOUGH THE LITTLE GUYS ARE!

        Everyone breaks into a loud CHEER. Ready to FIGHT. The sound track
        music SOARS. Indiana RAISES HIS SWORD. He TURNS and RUNS toward the
        DRAWBRIDGE. The people FOLLOW, as Indy LEADS THEM INTO BATTLE!

        EXT. CITY

        Indiana, armed with a shield, sword and pistol, LEADS his troops
        forward. The Nazis are APPROACHING. LIEUT. MEPHISTO rides in the front
        jeep, which is mounted with a large RECOILIST MACHINE GUN. The entire
        Nazi army is BEHIND HIM. Mephisto's jeep begins to CROSS the
        drawbridge. Moving TOWARD Indiana and the others. The recoilist
        machine gunner OPENS FIRE on Indy and the troops.

        Bullets BOUNCE from Indy's shield. Several of the pygmies are HIT.
        FALLING to the drawbridge. An angry pygmy THROWS his spear. It HITS
        the machine gunner. THROUGH the heart.

        The jeep continues to DRIVE FORWARD. HEADED straight for Indiana, who
        LEAPS ONTO the jeep's hood. Indy's troops SPLIT INTO GROUPS. Dashing
        around the speeding jeep to BATTLE the oncoming Nazis.

        Indiana CRAWLS along the jeep hood. TOWARD the Nazis. Mephisto
        attempts to SHOOT Indy. The bullets ZIP through the windshield.
        WHIZZING by Indy's head. Indiana GRABS Mephisto. He PULLS the Nazi
        over the windshield. Indiana and Mephisto TUMBLE along the jeep's
        hood. FIGHTING. STRUGGLING for the gun.

        The jeep DIRECTLY BEHIND Mephisto is filled with several CRATES OF
        DYNAMITE. GUTTERBUHG, back in uniform, rides here with THREE NAZI
        SOLDIERS. As the pygmy troops come forward, Gutterbuhg EXTENDS HIS
        MECHANICAL ARM. He ZAPS several of the pygmies. KILLING them with
        deadly JOLTS OF ELECTRICITY.

        As the jeep PASSES through the City gates, Indiana and Mephisto
        continue to BATTLE along the hood.

        INT. CITY

        Mephisto ATTEMPTS TO SHOOT Indiana. But Indy PUSHES AWAY the Nazi's
        arm. The gun FIRES. HITTING the jeep driver, who SLUMPS over the
        wheel. The speeding jeep SPINS OUT OF CONTROL. It FLIPS. Sending
        Indiana and Mephisto FLYING through the air. They TUMBLE to the
        ground. The jeep CRASHES into a wall.

        A SHAKEN Indiana gets to his feet. Mephisto LIES A few feet away. OUT
        COLD. Suddenly, a BLAST OF ELECTRICITY BURSTS INTO FRAME! SPARKING the
        ground beside Indiana. Indy TURNS and sees GUTTERBUBG! The Nazi's jeep
        has ENTERED the city. Gutterbuhg POINTS his mechanical arm toward
        Indy. ANOTHER ELECTRICAL SHOCK ejects from his finger. Indy DIVES. The
        shock TEARS A SMOLDERING HOLE through the building behind him. Only
        INCHES above Indy.

        Meanwhile, the Nazis begin to UNLOAD the dynamite from Gutterbubg's
        jeep. They UNWRAP a long, section of FUSE from a large coil. Placing
        the fuse ALONG THE GROUND.

        Indiana is RUNNING for his life. Gutterbuhg is DIRECTLY BEHIND him. In
        HOT PURSUIT. The Nazi continuously FIRES ELECTRICAL SHOTS at Indiana.
        The thin lines of electricity WHIZ by Indy's HEAD. His ARMS. His LEGS.
        JUST MISSING INDY. A CAT AND MOUSE CHASE BEGINS, as Gutterbuhg PURSUES
        Indiana throughout the city.

                                                                        CUT TO:

        TYKI AND SEVERAL PYGMIES

        They have CLIMBED to the top of the City Walls. From here, they GUARD
        and DEFEND their city. Crowds of NAZI TROOPS are on foot. Running
        TOWARD the city walls. The pygmies SHOWER the Nazis with ARROWS,
        SPEARS and POISINOUS DARTS. The Nazis fight back with MACHINE GUNS and
        RIFLES. A HEATED, BLOODY BATTLE.

                                                                        CUT TO:

        SCRAGGY AND THE CREW MEMBERS

        They stand at the CITY GATE. PROTECTING the City entrance. They
        hurriedly load a large, wooden CATAPULT with a huge BALL OF HAY. A
        crew member TORCHES the hay. It BURSTS INTO FLAME. Scraggy CRIES
        "Fire!" His men LAUNCH the fireball. It SAILS over the City Walls.

        THE FIREBALL

        LANDS directly onto a speeding NAZI JEEP. The Nazis and jeep CATCH
        FIRE! The vehicle LOSES CONTROL. The flaming jeep CRASHES into the
        side of a mountain wall.

                                                                        CUT TO:

        A NAZI TANK

        ROLLS toward the city. Its GUN BARREL aimed at the city walls. CAMERA
        PANS AWAY, SEVERAL FEET AHEAD OF THE TANK. CAMERA MOVES UPWARD, TO THE
        MOUNTAIN TOP, ABOVE the path. CLARE is here. A GROUP OF GORILLAS are
        beside her. The apes each have a TIGHT HOLD of individual sections of
        HANGING VINE. They stand at the EDGE OF THE RAVINE. Clare LOOKS to the
        OPPOSITE RAVINE. BETSY is here. She stands with ANOTHER GROUP OF
        GORILLAS, who also securely bold lengths of vine.

        On the mountain path, the Nazi tank PASSES DIRECTLY BENEATH Betsy and
        Clare. The two women TURN to the Gorillas. Emitting Gorilla GRUNTS,
        MOANS and MOTIONS, Betsy and Clare COMMUNICATE with the apes. The
        Gorillas LISTEN. NODDING. UNDERSTANDING. When the tank is DIRECTLY
        BELOW... Betsy and Clare ORDER the Gorillas to JUMP!

        The apes SWING from the mountain. RIDING the vines. TOWARD the tank.
        The Gorillas LAND on the tank. They CLIMB aboard. EXPLORING the tank's
        surface.

        INT. TANK

        FILLED with Nazis. The gunner looks into the PERISCOPE. He is met with
        the reflection of a SNARLING GORILLA'S FACE. He SCREAMS and JUMPS
        BACK.

        There is a sound of RIPPING METAL. Suddenly, the tank's top HATCH is
        TORN OPEN. COUNTLESS GORILLAS pour inside! The apes ATTACK.
        OVERPOWERING the Nazis.

        EXT. TANK

        As the Gorillas climb inside of the tank, Betsy SWINGS across the
        passageway to Clare. She EXCHANGES a congratulatory handshake with
        Clare. Betsy's face suddenly goes WHITE. A SHOCKING SIGHT.

        A GROUP OF NAZIS have climbed to the mountain top. The soldiers SPOT
        Clare and Betsy. They RUN TOWARD the women. Betsy and Clare DASH OFF.
        Into the THICK of the jungle. The Nazis FOLLOW. In HOT PURSUIT.

                                                                        CUT TO:

        TWO LARGE CANVAS TRUCKS

        BARRELLING along the mountain path. KEZURE, the Pirate King, LEAPS
        from the side of the path, between the two trucks. Kezure climbs onto
        the REAR BUMPER of the FIRST TRUCK. The DRIVER of the SECOND TRUCK
        spots Kezure. He begins to FIRE SHOTS at the Pirate King. As bullets
        whiz by him, Kezure hurriedly removes a thick METAL CHAIN from around
        his neck. He securely CONNECTS the two truck BUMPERS with the chain.

        INT. SECOND TRUCK

        Filled with NAZI TROOPS. SEATED. ARMED. Waiting to FIGHT. There is a
        sudden RIPPING SOUND. Followed by ANOTHER. And ANOTHER. The NAZIS are
        STARTLED to see the BLADES OF COUNTLESS SWORDS. PIERCING the canvas.
        Through all SIDES of the truck. SEVERAL PIRATES leap through the
        canvas. ATTACKING the Nazis. The Nazis FIGHT BACK with bayonets and
        daggers.

        INT. FIRST TRUCK - CABIN

        Two Pirates BURST into the cabin. They STAB the Nazi driver. The
        CACKLING Pirates take control of the steering wheel. They madly STEER
        the truck toward the steep EDGE of the mountain path.

        THE FIRST TRUCK

        PLUMMETS over the eage. The second truck, ATTACHED by the metal chain,
        FOLLOWS the first truck. The two canvas trucks FALL into the moat!
        SPLASHING into the shark infestea waters!

                                                                        CUT TO:

        INT. CITY

        The Nazis have planted an enormous PILE OF DYNAMITE on the palace
        stairs. Enough to DESTROY the entire city. The T.N.T. is attached to a
        LONG FUSE, that stretches hundreds of feet, over VARIOUS SECTIONS of
        the city. The Nazis LIGHT the fuse end. It SPARKS. IGNITES. BURNING
        FAST. The Nazis TURN and RUN.

        Gutterbuhg continues to CHASE Indiana. BLASTS OF ELECTRICITY SHOOT
        from the Nazi's arm. Indy DUCKS... DODGES... AVOIDING the electrical
        jolts. Indy SPINS around a building corner. He spots the BURNING FUSE.
        It STRETCHES along the ground, moving up OVER a wooden fence. Indy
        DIVES and STOMPS OUT the fuse. But Gutterbuhg, who is directly behind
        Indy, RELIGHTS the fuse with a shot of electricity. Before Indy has a
        chance to stop the fuse...Gutterbuhg AIMS at Indy. Indy LEAPS OVER the
        fence. Gutterbuhg SHOOTS. The fence is SPLINTERED by the powerful
        electrical blast.

        Indiana runs into a small ALLEYWAY. The burning fuse STRETCHES up
        along the alley wall, moving to the ROOFTOP. Indy begins to climb the
        ancient golden bricks that PROTRUDE from the wall. TOWARD the roof.
        Gutterbuhg APPEARS. He SHOOTS at Indiana, who avoids the blast by
        LEAPING onto the roof. Gutterbuhg hurriedly begins to CLIMB the wall.
        FOLLOWING Indiana.

        EXT. ROOFTOP

        Gutterbuhg ARRIVES at the top. He LOOKS around. There is NO SIGN of
        Indy. But the fuse RESTS at the roof's edge. UNLIT. Gutterbuhg
        RESTARTS the fuse. At that moment, Indiana LEAPS OUT from inside of
        the stone smokestack. He JUMPS the unsuspecting Gutterbuhg. They
        TUMBLE and FALL OFF the rooftop edge.

        Indiana and Gutterbuhg HIT the ground. They continue to STRUGGLE...
        FIGHT...as the fuse BURNS in front of them. It SPEEDS toward the pile
        of dynamite. Less than FIFTY FEET AHEAD. Still wrestling with
        Gutterbuhg, Indy ROLLS toward the fuse. Indy reaches out and STOPS THE
        FUSE with his hand. But Gutterbuhg MOVES FAST. Again, the Nazi
        RELIGHTS the fuse.

        Indy suddenly LEAPS to his feet. He RUNS OFF SCREEN. Gutterbuhg
        FOLLOWS. The fuse continues to BURN. Moving CLOSER...CLOSER...to the
        dynamite.

        Indiana runs to a CLUSTER OF TREES. He comes to an abrupt stop,
        between TWO TREES. Gutterbuhg is UPON HIM. The Nazi PAUSES. Only a FEW
        FEET from Indy. Gutterbuhg POINTS his arm at Indy. A CLEAR SHOT.
        Gutterbuhg SMILES. Indiana is TRAPPED.

        THE FUSE is now only a FEW FEET from the dynamite. It will BLOW at any
        second!

        Gutterbuhg SHOOTS. Moving like LIGHTNING, Indy LEAPS OUT OF THE WAY,
        revealing a LARGE LAKE behind him. It's TOO LATE for Gutterbubg. The
        electrical current HITS THE WATER. The Nazi's body SURGES with
        electricity. Gutterbuhg FRIES. He SHIVERS. SHAKES. FROZEN, as the
        powerful electrical current FLOWS through his veins. SMOKE billows
        from his body. His mechanical arm suddenly EXPLODES. Gutterbuhg's
        charred body FALLS. FACE DOWN. ELECTROCUTED.

        Indiana LEAPS TO HIS FEET. Suddenly remembering... THE FUSE! It is now
        INCHES from the T.N.T. Indy can't get to it IN TIME. He GRABS his
        whip. His arm SNAPS FORWARD. The whip CRACKS. It SLICES the remaining
        fuse in two. The fuse FIZZLES and GOES OUT. The city is SAVED. Indy
        SIGHS. There is a GUNSHOT! A BULLET whizzes by Indy's head. He TURNS.

        MEPHISTO, bruised and bloodied from the jeep accident, stands SEVERAL
        FEET AWAY. Mephisto's LUGER is aimed at Indy. Prepared to take ANOTHER
        SHOT. Indy removes his REVOLVER. He FIRES at Mephisto. The Nazi DASHES
        into the COLISEUM. Indiana FOLLOWS.

                                                                        CUT TO:

        TYKI

        BATTLING the oncoming Nazis with his sword. Tyki fights HARD. FAST. He
        manages to DEFEAT many Nazis. But the sword is suddenly KNOCKED from
        Tyki's hand. A TROOP OF NAZIS come toward him. Their eyes MURDEROUS.
        Tyki is TRAPPED. HELPLESS.

        INT. CITY

        Scraggy and his crew members load ANOTHER FIREBALL onto the catapult.
        Scraggy cries "FIRE!" The fireball FLIES over the city walls. It lands
        DIRECTLY IN FRONT of the Nazi troops who are about to attack Tyki.
        Many of the soldiers CATCH FIRE. The others RUN from the flames. Tyki
        is UNHURT. He REJOINS his friends in the battle.

                                                                        CUT TO:

        CLARE AND BETSY

        BREATHLESS...FRIGHTENED...they continue to RUN through the jungle. The
        Nazis are a few feet BEHIND THEM. Moving FAST. Getting CLOSER. The
        women turn a corner, scramble through a section of bushes and find
        themselves face to face with...ANOTHER TROOP OF NAZIS.

        Clare and Betsy STOP. TRAPPED. SURROUNDED by Nazis. The soldiers MOVE
        TOWARD the women. The Nazis eyes are LECHEROUS. HUNGRY. Clare WHISPERS
        to a TREMBLING Betsy.

                                        CLARE
                        Do exactly what I do.

        Betsy NODS. The Nazis MOVE CLOSER. Clare looks to the SKY. She begins
        to make BIZARRE...HIGH PITCHED...NOISES. A CONFUSED Betsy makes the
        same noises. The Nazis LOOK at each other and CHUCKLE. The women
        CONTINUE to make the sounds.

        Suddenly, the exact sound seems to ECHO FROM THE SKY. It becomes
        LOUDER... LOUDER... But it belongs to A HUNDRED VOICES. The Nazis
        PAUSE. Looking UPWARD. PUZZLED.

        There is a SPLATTERING OF BIRDS. They ATTACK from above. The birds'
        screeching is IDENTICAL to Clare and Betsy's calls. The angry birds
        ATTACK THE NAZIS. PECKING. SCRATCHING. BITING. Clare and Betsy
        CONTINUE to make the sounds, which causes the birds to IGNORE THEM.
        The Nazis SCREAM. DROPPING their weapons. FALLING to their knees. Each
        soldier is COVERED with birds. They are being TORN TO SHREDS. Clare
        and Betsy TURN and RUN. ESCAPING into the jungle. The Nazis' screaming
        ECHOES behind them. As they run, Clare EXPLAINS to Betsy.

                                        CLARE
                        I made the sound of a baby Swandola
                        bird, crying for help... The Mother
                        birds immediately reply to the cries
                        ...angrily protecting their
                        children, and murdering the baby's
                        attackers.

                                                                        CUT TO:

        THE TWO CANVAS TRUCKS

        They crookedly FLOAT along the shark infested moat waters. The
        battered, bruised trucks now resemble two sinking PIRATE SHIPS. Kezure
        and the Pirates BATTLE the Nazis along the truck frames. The pirates
        fight in their element... WATER! With fast SWINGING SWORDS, the
        Pirates are defeating the Nazis. Several Nazis fall INTO THE WATER and
        are immediately ATTACKED by countless SHARKS.

        At one point, Kezure FALLS INTO THE WATER. Several SHARKS come for
        him. The Pirate King DISAPPEARS beneath the water surface. A few of
        his men PAUSE. WORRIED. AFRAID. Suddenly, Kezure LEAPS OUT OF THE
        WATER. He holds a LIVE SHARK in his hands. The crazed Kezure TAKES A
        BITE from the shark. He TOSSES the fish back into the water. Kezure
        CHEWS ana SWALLOWS the raw shark meat. BLOOD spills down his chin.
        Kezure resumes his FIGHTING with the Nazis, as the two truck frames
        continue to SINK.

                                                                        CUT TO:

        INT. TANK

        Several Nazis are SPRAWLED on the tank floor. UNCONSCIOUS. UNDRESSED.
        CAMERA PANS UPWARD. The Gorillas have TAKEN CONTROL of the tank. They
        have DRESSED THEMSELVES IN NAZI UNIFORMS!

        EXT. TANK

        As the battle RAGES around them, the Gorilla's tank makes a sudden
        U-TURN. It heads straight for the SECOND NAZI TANK.

        INT. SECOND TANK

        The Nazis stare through their PERISCOPE. Puzzled by the sight of their
        own tank COMING TOWARD THEM.

        EXT. TANK

        The Gorilla's tank FIRES A DIRECT SHOT at the other Nazi tank. BLAM!
        The Nazis' tank is BLOWN TO SMITHEREENS.

        INT. GORILLA TANK

        The Gorillas break into a VICTORIOUS CHEER. JUMPING. SCREAMING.

                                                                        CUT TO:

        INT. COLISEUM

        Indiana WALKS across the coliseum floor. REVOLVER in hand. He moves
        SLOWLY. CAUTIOUSLY. He is looking for a SIGN of Mephisto. But
        everything is SILENT. CALM. DESERTED.

        Mephisto SNEAKS along the top wall of the coliseum. HIDING behind the
        row of surrounding BELLS. The Nazi UNLATCHES the chain that holds all
        of the bells in place. The bells begin to FALL. THUNDERING down the
        coliseum stairs.

        Indy COVERS his ears. The sound of countless CLANGING BELLS is nearly
        deafening. He TURNS. Seeing the enormous bells ROLLING TOWARD HIM!
        Indiana begins to RUN. GIANT ROLLING BELLS CHASE HIM FROM ALL
        DIRECTIONS! Indy TWISTS...TURNS...LEAPS...in an effort to avoid being
        CRUSHED by the heavy bells.

        Mephisto WATCHES from above. SMILING.

        Indy CONTINUES to run. A giant ROLLING BELL chases him from behind.
        The bell GAINS SPEED. Getting CLOSER. CLOSER. A few feet in front of
        Indy...is the deadly TIGER PIT. But Indy CAN'T STOP RUNNING, or he'll
        be CRUSHED by the bell. Indiana LEAPS INTO THE PIT! The bell ROLLS
        DIRECTLY OVER the pit.

        But Indiana is SAFE. There is a FIVE INCH DROP from the ground, to the
        pit's OVERHEAD METAL BARS. Indy LIES on the bars. SAFELY above the
        countless TIGERS.

        The bells have all COME TO A STOP. They LIE around the coliseum
        ground. STILL. Only one bell GENTLY ROCKS. It slowly TEETERS on the
        coliseum stairs. It HASN'T yet rolled off.

        Indiana begins to CLIMB OUT out of the pit, when suddenly... ANOTHER
        GUNSHOT RINGS OUT. Indy is HIT. In the CHEST. He SLIPS. FALLS. Bis
        wounded body is SPRAWLED on the bars. TEETERING. Ready to FALL into
        the waiting tigers.

        Mephisto's luger is SMOKING. The Nazi WALKS down the coliseum stairs.
        He moves TOWARD Indiana. Seeing Mephisto heading for him... Indiana
        REMOVES his gun. He AIMS at the Nazi. But Indy's vision is BLURRED.
        His hand TREMBLES. Mephisto's silhouette nears... But the bullet ZIPS
        PAST Mephisto and STRIKES a section of wood below the teetering bell.
        This causes the bell to FALL...and slowly ROLL forward.

        Mephisto ARRIVES at the edge of the Tiger Pit. He is about to shoot
        Indy...then comes upon ANOTHER IDEA. Mephisto LOWERS the luger. He
        gives a SWIFT KICK to Indy's ribs. Indiana FALLS THROUGH the bars. His
        arm SHOOTS OUT. With his last bit of strength, Indy's hand GRABS HOLD
        of a bar. CLUTCHING on for dear life. His body DANGLES over the
        tigers. They SNAP at his legs. HUNGRY. GROWLING. Mephisto SMILES. He
        STEPS on Indy's fingers. GRINDING them beneath his boot heel. Indy
        CRIES OUT... He's going to FALL...

        Mephisto PAUSES. He HEARS something behind him. A CLANGING BELL.
        Getting CLOSER. LOUDER. Mephisto TURNS. He sees the GIANT BELL. COMING
        at him. Only INCHES AWAY. There is NO TIME to move. The bell ROLLS
        OVER MEPHISTO. KNOCKING him INTO THE PIT.

        Mephisto FALLS through the bars. INSIDE the pit. INTO the middle of
        the hungry tigers. Mephisto SCREAMS. The tigers are UPON HIM. The Nazi
        is RIPPED TO SHREDS. Within seconds, his screams are a MEMORY.

        A very WEAK Indiana still clutches the bar. He manages to BOOST
        himself out of the pit. He takes a FEW STEPS. WOBBLING. BLOOD pours
        from the wound in his chest. He STUMBLES. To his KNEES. His eyes ROLL
        BACK. He FALLS to the ground. His body is STILL. MOTIONLESS.

                                                                        CUT TO:

        INT. TANK

        The Gorillas, still dressed as NAZIS, continue to DRIVE THE TANK
        FORWARD.

        EXT. TANK

        The tank SPEEDS TOWARD THE ROWS OF CHARGING NAZI TROOPS. The Nazis
        STOP. SHOCKED to see their own tank coming at them. But the tank
        continues to BARREL AHEAD. Many of the Nazis are CRUSHED beneath the
        heavy tank treads. Others DROP their weapons and RUN. FRIGHTENED.

        INT. TANK

        The Gorillas are ECSTATIC. HOWLING. CHEERING.

                                                                        CUT TO:

        KEZURE AND THE PIRATES

        They have DEFEATED all of the Nazis. One of the canvas trucks has
        completely SUNK. Only a small section of the other truck JUTS OUT of
        the water. The Pirates CLING to the fleeting safety of the sinking
        truck frame, which is surrounded by several HUNGRY SHARKS. There are
        even TOO MANY maneaters for the powerful Kezure to handle. As the
        frame continues to SINK...the Pirates' feet get CLOSER...CLOSER...to
        the snapping sharks...

        Suddenly, a ROPE DROPS FROM OVERHEAD! Kezure LOOKS UP. SCRAGGY and his
        crew members stand on the DRAWBRIDGE. They have DROPPED the line.
        Kezure and the Pirates CLIMB upward. To SAFETY.

        On the drawbridge, Scraggy ASSISTS Kezure. Scraggy SMILES, repeating
        Kezure's earlier threat.

                                        SCRAGGY
                        You owe me, old man.

        Kezure LAUGHS. He EMBRACES Scraggy. They are joined by TYKI and the
        OTHER PYGMIES. A sudden CALM...a sudden SILENCE...overcomes the city.
        The battle has ENDED. The Nazis have been DEFEATED. The city is SAVED.
        But Tyki is SOLEMN. DISTRESSED. He STARES OFF SCREEN. CAMERA PANS TO
        HIS P.O.V. We see the countless BODIES OF PYGMIES. SPRAWLED on the
        ground. DEAD. The price you pay for FREEDOM. Suddenly, the silence is
        INTERRUPTED. Someone is CRYING. It is BETSY.

        Scraggy looks OFF SCREEN, to the direction of the sounds. The color
        LEAVES his face.

        SCRAGGY'S P.O.V.

        A group of pygmies CARRY the limp body of Indiana Jones out of the
        coliseum. They GENTLY LOWER Indy's body to the ground. Clare and Betsy
        KNEEL beside Indy. TEARS run down Betsy's face.

        Scraggy suddenly BREAKS AWAY from the crowd. CAMERA DOLLIES WITH HIM
        as he runs toward Indy. Scraggy STOPS at Indy's body. Clare, eyes
        FILLED with tears NODS to Scraggy. She can BARELY utter the words...

                                        CLARE
                        He's...dead...

        TEARS erupt in Scraggy's eyes. He breaks down CRYING. A startled
        KEZURE joins the others. CAMERA PULLS BACK to an extremely LONG SHOT.
        The entire village GATHERS around Indiana's body. Everyone is SOLEMN.
        SILENT.

                                                                        A SLOW DISSOLVE:

        CLOSE-UP: INDIANA'S BODY.

        It is LYING in state. Resting on a BAMBOO STRETCHER. It is covered
        with EXOTIC, COLORFUL FLOWERS. CAMERA PULLS BACK. Indy is being
        carried by several, elaborately dressed PYGMIES. At the head of a long

        FUNERAL PROCESSION. Betsy, Clare, Scraggy and Kezure MARCH beside
        Indy's body. They also wear the ceremonial FUNERAL FLOWERS. Behind
        them, the body of BOHBALA is being carried. And behind the ruler, the
        bodies of all DEAD PYGMIES are being carried by the remaining
        VILLAGERS and GORILLAS. It is NIGHTIME. All mourners are carrying
        FLICKERING CANDLES. At the rear of the procession, a lone pygmy strums
        an UNUSUAL STRING INSTRUMENT. This creates a HAUNTING melody.

        CAMERA PULLS BACK TO A LONG SHOT, as we see the procession move
        through the city. The hundreds of flickering candles against the dark
        night sky create a BEAUTIFUL IMAGE. The procession arrives at a large
        STONE WALL. It appears to be a DEAD END. Tyki WALKS to the wall.

        He FALLS to his knees and begins to CHANT. Clare, Betsy, Scraggy and
        Kezure WATCH. There is a SMALL RUMBLE. A hairline CRACK begins to form
        in the mountain. As if it were being DRAWN by an invisible hand, the
        crack forms a LARGE DOOR in the wall. The door slowly OPENS. An almost
        BLINDING WHlTE LIGHT emanates from inside. Tyki ENTERS. The procession
        FOLLOWS.

        INT. WALL

        The procession ascends a TWISTING STONE STAIRCASE, that spirals
        upward, where the light becomes BRIGHTER... BRIGHTER... At the
        stairway top, there is ANOTHER DOORWAY. Tyki and the others ENTER.
        Indiana's body is CARRIED through.

        THE GARDEN OF IMMORTAL PEACHES!

        A breathtakingly beautiful forest of never ending luscious green
        trees, filled with succulent, ripe PEACHES. We have never seen COLORS
        like this. So MAGICAL...so INTENSE... Bright SUNLIGHT shines from a
        vivid blue sky. There is always a RAINBOW here. The procession ENTERS.
        Scraggy, Clare, Betsy and Kezure stare in total WONDERMENT. Betsy is
        PUZZLED by the bright sunlight.

                                        BETSY
                        But... It's... It's the middle of
                        the night...

        Tyki WHISPERS to Scraggy, who explains to Betsy.

                                        SCRAGGY
                        Sun always shine in the Garden of
                        Immortal Peaches.

        Clare NODS. Kezure is MESMERIZED by the peach trees. His mouth HANGS
        OPEN. He TURNS to Scraggy.

                                        KEZURE
                        These are the peaches that make one
                        ...forever young?...

        Scraggy NODS. Tyki LEADS the procession to a clearing in the garden.
        Many freshly dug GRAVES are here. All of the bodies are carried to
        SEPARATE GRAVES, including Indiana And Bohbala.

        A few feet ahead of the graves, rests the LARGEST PEACH TREE in the
        forest. It is much WIDER and TALLER than the others. There is a small,
        glass encased TOMB built into the tree. Inside of the tomb, is a TINY
        SKELETON. No more than FOUR FEET TALL. The skeleton is adorned with a
        LION SKINNED ROBE and golden CROWN. In its hand, the skeleton clutches
        the famous GOLDEN HOOPED ROD, a glorious, elaborate STAFF. An ancient
        inscription is ETCHED IN STONE over the tomb. Pointing to the
        inscription, Clare TURNS to Scraggy.

                                        CLARE
                        What does it say?...

                                        SCRAGGY
                                (translating)
                        "Our Lord... Our Master... Sun...
                        Wu... Kung"

        THE SOUND TRACK MUSIC RISES. It is the tomb of the STONE MONKEY KING.
        Clare exchanges an AWE INSPIRED glance with Betsy, then looks to the
        still body of Indiana.

                                        CLARE
                        Damn you, Jones! Why couldn't you be
                        here to share this with me!

        The pygmies begin to LOWER the dead bodies, including Indiana and
        Bohbala, into the ground. Tyki reads from ANCIENT SCRIPTURE. Scraggy
        SOBS on the shoulder of Kezure, who continues to stare in ASTONISHMENT
        at the peach trees.

        Suddenly, there is a RUMBLING SOUND. Followed by a slight, TREMOR. The
        trees begin to SWAY, as a HOWLING WIND rushes through them. The tomb
        of Sun Wu Kung GLOWS with a BRIGHT LIGHT. The glass surrounding the
        tomb suddenly SHATTERS. The skeleton's head TURNS. Its body RATTLES.
        Beginning to MOVE. The skeleton STEPS OUT OF THE TOMB.

        Everyone STARES in awe. TERRIFIED.

        The skeleton takes a FEW STEPS forward, STOPS, and RAISES its arms.
        HIGH in the air. The skeleton OPENS its mouth. Emitting a HIGH PITCHED
        ...UNEARTHLY...SCREECH! An ectoplasmic GREEN SMOKE seeps from the
        skeleton's fingers, slowly TRAVELING over the heads of the humans. The
        ectoplasm separates into several INDIVIDUAL LINES, that touch down
        upon EACH OF THE GORILLAS. The ectoplasm ENCIRCLES each the Gorilla's
        bodies. The Gorillas begin to RISE from the ground. HIGH in the air.
        The ectoplasm appears to be CARRYING them toward Sun Wu Kung. As the
        Gorillas TRAVEL through the air, their bodies begin to SHRINK. Growing
        SMALLER. THINNER.

        The humans stare into the SKY. Watching the AMAZING, MAGICAL
        TRANSFORMATION.

        As the Gorillas get CLOSER to Sun Wu Kung, their bodies have shrunken
        to TINY, HAIR-LIKE substances. When the Gorillas ARRIVE at the
        skeleton, they ATTACH themselves to his body. We see that the shrunken
        Gorillas are actually individual HAIRS on the skeleton's body. As the
        countless hairs CONVERGE, the skeleton begins to take SHAPE...FORM...

        SUN WU KUNG COMES TO LIFE! He is UNLIKE anyone or anything we have
        ever seen. HALF-HUMAN. HALF-HONKEY. His face is covered with WRINKLES.
        His wide eyes are COAL BLACK. PROBING. WARM. When he smiles, it is
        DEVILISH, but incredibly CHARMING. His movements are PERKY. QUICK. An
        extremely ADORABLE little fellow. Instantly LOVABLE. But there is a
        STRONG, POWERFUL presense about him. He is indeed, a HEAVENLY FIGURE.

        Sun Wu Kung LOOKS over the congregation. Everyone FALLS to their
        knees. Clare, Betsy, Scraggy and a RELUCTANT Kezure do the same.

        Sun Wu Kung PACES through the clearing. He LOOKS into the many graves.
        He is DISTRESSED. TROUBLED. His wrinkled face twists into FURIOUS
        expression. He RAISES his golden hooped rod to the sky. He SCREAMS.
        His old voice CREAKS and GROANS.

                                        SUN WU KUNG
                        We cannot bury these men!... This is
                        a garden of life... Not of death!...

        Betsy WHISPERS to Clare.

                                        BETSY
                        Why's he speakin' in English?

                                        CLARE
                        He is a heavenly being. According to
                        legend, when a heavenly being
                        speaks, men of all countries can
                        understand him. We hear him in
                        English...the pygmies hear him in
                        their language.

        Betsy NODS. Sun Wu Kung CONTINUES his heartfelt scream into the
        heavens.

                                        SUN WU KUNG
                        Return their souls!... I demand
                        it!... Return their souls!

        A few MOMENTS pass. Then...a thick, white cloud ECLIPSES the sun. A
        small hole in the cloud, allows one RAY OF SUNLIGHT to shine through.
        The ray shines down upon ONE PARTICULAR PEACH TREE. Sun Wu Kung TURNS
        to that peach tree. He raises the GOLDEN HOOPED ROD toward the tree.
        He begins to SING an unusual hymn. Suddenly, several peaches magically
        FLY from the trees. They congregate ABOVE the golden hooped rod. The
        peaches SPIN in midair. With quick movements of the rod, Sun Wu Kung
        SENDS several peaches flying OFF SCREEN.

        CAMERA FOLLOWS the magical peaches as they SEPARATE and FLY INTO EACH
        GRAVE. Toward the BODIES OF THE DEAD PYGMIES. Each body is HIT with an
        individual peach. When the peaches MAKE CONTACT with the dead bodies,
        there is a small, colorful EXPLOSION. A small FIREWORKS display. The
        bodies erupt with a BRIGHT GOLDEN GLOW. A few moments PASS. One of the
        bodies STIRS. MOVES. The body SITS UP. Gets to its FEET. ANOTHER BODY
        does the same. So does ANOTHER. And ANOTHER. Soon, the various pygmies
        CLIMB out of the graves. Their wounds have DISAPPEARED. Their life has
        been RESTORED.

        Sun Wu Kung flings the remaining TWO PEACHES into the GRAVES of
        Indiana and Bohbala. There is a small EXPLOSION...followed by the WARM
        GLOW of their bodies. The wound in Indy's chest VANISHES. His eyes POP
        OPEN. To the delight of his friends, Indy STANDS. ALIVE. He is
        PUZZLLED by the surrounding grave. Clare, Scraggy and Betsy HELP
        Indiana OUT of the grave. They SHOWER him with EMBRACES and KISSES.
        But Indy remains CONFUSED. PUZZLED.

                                        INDIANA
                        What the hell's goin' on?

        Sun Wu Kung, looking very PLEASED with himself, stands BEHIND Indiana.
        Clare SMILES at Indy.

                                        CLARE
                        I think there is someone you should
                        meet...

        Clare POINTS to behind Indy, who TURNS and sees the smiling SUN WU
        KUNG. Indy is at first SHOCKED... His face breaks into a CHILDLIKE
        SMILE...filled with DELIGHT. He then manages to UTTER...

                                        INDIANA
                        You... You're... Sun Wu Kung?...

        Sun Wu Kung STEPS FORWARD. He nods and ANSWERS.

                                        SUN WU KUNG
                        You are... Indiana Jones?...

                                        INDIANA
                                (taken aback)
                        Huh?... You know me?

                                        SUN WU KUNG
                                (nods)
                        I have watched you for many, many
                        years...from the heavens. I was
                        fascinated by your bravery...your
                        passion...in searching for me.

                                        INDIANA
                        Well, I... Thanks I'm very honored.

                                        SUN WU KUNG
                        The honor is mine, Doctor Jones. You
                        and your friends have saved my city
                        from ruin.
                                (a pause)
                        I would like to return the favor.

        Sun Wu Kung gives Indiana the GOLDEN HOOPED ROD. Indiana takes the
        PRICELESS ARTIFACT. He STARES at the beautiful rod. He is very MOVED.
        SPEECHLESS. Sun Wu Kung EXPLAINS. RAISES an eyebrow.

                                        SUN WU KUNG
                        The Golden Hooped Rod will be a
                        faithful friend. It is capable of
                        one hundred transformations...and
                        will always remain by your side.

        Indy manages a NOD. Sun Wu Kung SIGHS.

                                        SUN WU KUNG
                        I will explore the heavens for
                        another. Surely, my search will be
                        shorter and less hazardous than
                        yours!

        Indiana SMILES.

        Meanwhile, Kezure uses the oppurtunity to SNEAK AWAY. He DISAPPEARS
        into a cluster of PEACH TREES. He CLIMBS the smallest tree. The GREEDY
        Pirate King begins to PICK several peaches. HIDING them in his
        pockets.

        Sun Wu Kung LOOKS OVER the healthy, restored community of pygmies. The
        Monkey King SMILES.

                                        SUN WU KUNG
                        With my city alive again...I will be
                        able to return to the heavens.
                                (warm smile to Indy and
                                the others)
                        Goodbye...my dear friends.

        Sun Wu Kung again RAISES his arms. Green ECOTPLASM again emanates from
        his fingers. The individual strands of HAIR fly from his body. In a
        reversal of what we saw only moments ago, the strands of hair FLY
        through the air. They grow LARGER...LARGER...until they resume the
        shape of the GORILLAS.

        Sun Wu Kung has RETURNED to his skeletal form. He TURNS and WALKS back
        to his resting place. The pieces of broken glass RE-ASSEMBLE. SEALING
        the tomb.

        Kezure, his pockets STUFFED with peaches, hurriedly REJOINS the
        others. Tyki EMBRACES Bohbala, glad to have his Father ALIVE. Bohbala,
        resuming his position as Ruler, LEADS HIS PEOPLE out of the garden.
        Indiana, CLUTCHING his golden hooped prize, EXITS with the others.

                                                                        CUT TO:

        EXT. CITY GATES - THE FOLLOWING MORNING

        Indiana, Clare, Betsy, Scraggy, Kezure, the Pirates and Crew members,
        have GATHERED outside of the city walls for the journey home. They are
        saying "Goodbye" to TYKI, BOHBALA And the other PYGMIES.

        Clare and Tyki exchange a TEARFUL FAREWELL, communicating in hand
        signals. They share a final EMBRACE. Bohbala again THANKS Indiana for
        his help. Betsy says "Goodbye" to the many GORILLAS. Betsy
        COMMUNICATES in Gorilla hand motions and growls.

        Indiana, holding the Golden Hooped Rod, TURNS and moves across the
        drawbridge. The others FOLLOW. The entire city of pygmies and Gorillas
        CHEER for their departing friends. Indy and the others DISAPPEAR into
        the clouds, walking down the MOUNTAIN PATH. The Lost city GLISTENS in
        the background. The drawbridge CLOSES...until the next visitor
        ARRIVES.

                                                                        DISSOLVE T0:

        EXT. MOUNTAIN PATH - A FEW HOURS LATER

        Early AFTERNOON. The sun is HOT. SCORCHING. Indy and his party REST.
        They NAP in a shady section of the path. CAMERA PANS THE SNOOZING
        BODIES of everyone, coming to a STOP at Indiana. The Golden Hooped Rod
        RESTS beside Indy. A HAND COMES INTO FRAME and GRABS the staff. OTHER
        HANDS MOVE INTO FRAME. They STEAL Indy's WHIP and REVOLVER. They TAKE
        all weapons from Scraggy and his crew members.

        Indiana is awakened by a SWORD. At his THROAT. Indy REACHES for his
        gun and whip...GONE. He LOOKS UP. KEZURE stands over him, holding the
        sword in one hand, the GOLDEN ROD in another. Indy TURNS. The other
        Pirates hold SWORDS and DAGGERS at the throats of Clare, Betsy,
        Scraggy and the crew members. Kezure TWIRLS the golden hooped rod in
        front of him. He SMILES at Indiana.

                                        KEZURE
                        She is a wonderful treasure...
                        Eh?...

                                        INDIANA
                        We had a deal.

                                        KEZURE
                                (moves sword closer to
                                Indy's throat)
                        I have no deals with dead men.

                                        INDIANA
                        Son of a bitch.

        Kezure LAUGHS. He has REMOVED a peach from his pocket. He SHINES the
        peach on his cloak, and gives a SHRUG to Indiana.

                                        KEZURE
                                (shrugs, laughs)
                        I am an old Pirate, Doctor Jones. Do
                        you suddenly expect me to treat you
                        with kindness and fairness?... It is
                        not my way of life!

        Indy is DISGUSTED. Kezure TAKES A LARGE BITE from the peach. As he
        chews and swallows, Kezure NODS to his men, motioning toward Indy and
        the others.

                                        KEZURE
                        Kill them...
                                (takes another bite of
                                the peach)
                        But save their hair. I will make a
                        coat out of it.

        The men MOVE to kill Scraggy, Betsy, Clare and the crew members.
        Suddenly, Kezure emits a LOUD SCREAM. He GRABS his stomach in pain. He
        FALLS to his knees. The HALF EATEN PEACH rolls from his hand. Onto the
        GROUND.

        Indy and Clare RUSH TOWARD Kezure. Something very STRANGE is happening
        to the Pirate King... His hair begins to FALL OUT. His teeth ROT. His
        skin SHRIVELS. His body becomes THINNER. SPINDLY. Kezure has begun to
        RAPIDLY AGE. He continues to SCREAM. In horrible PAIN.

        The Pirates STEP AWAY. FRIGHTENED. The others WATCH IN HORROR.

        Kezure's body CONTORTS. His skin WITHERS... FLAKES... It begins to
        PEEL from his bones. His screams FADE... His eyeballs ROLL OUT of
        their sockets. Only his skeleton REMAINS. It turns BLACK and CRUMBLES
        TO DUST. Only his elaborate clothing REMAINS. The many stolen peaches
        ROLL OUT of his cloak, onto the ground.

        The remaining Pirates DROP THEIR WEAPONS. They RUN OFF down the
        mountain. SCARED to death!

        Indiana HOLDS the half eaten peach in his hand. Betsy is PUZZLED.

                                        BETSY
                        I thought the peaches promised
                        immortality...eternal youth?...

                                        INDIANA
                        The garden of immortal peaches
                        promises life only to those who are
                        pure in heart.
                                (pause)
                        Kezure was evil. His heart was
                        filled with greed.

        Indiana DROPS the peach to the ground. He grabs his WHIP, REVOLVER and
        GOLDEN HOOPED ROD. Scraggy and his crew members RETRIEVE their
        weapons. Everyone TURNS, CONTINUING down the mountain path. LEAVING
        Kezure's clothes and the several peaches behind.

                                                                        CUT TO:

        EXT. MOZAMBIQUE - DOCK - A FEW DAYS LATER

        Passengers board a large OCEAN LINER, bound for the United States.
        INDIANA JONES is here. Bags PACKED. He holds a rectangular wooden
        crate, covered with the words "FRAGILE". The Golden Hooped Rod is
        obviously STORED inside. Indy is WAITING for someone. He impatiently
        CHECKS his wristwach. LOOKING around. He GRUMBLES to himself.

                                        INDIANA
                        Where's Betsy?... The boat leaves in
                        five minutes...

        Suddenly, a HORN interrupts. Indy turns to the DIRECTION OF THE SOUND.
        It is SCRAGGY. He is wearing DRIVING GOGGLES. He rides a battered,
        bruised MOTORCYCLE, attached to a ricketty SIDECAR. The word "TAXI" is
        painted on the sidecar's exterior. Scraggy PULLS UP beside Indiana.
        Scraggy JUMPS OFF the motorcycle. Excitedly, he RUNS toward Indy.

                                        SCRAGGY
                        Oh, Indy! Indy! I want to give you
                        something for your journey!

        Scraggy FUMBLES through his pockets. He removes a small bottle of
        PURPLE LIQUID. He HOLDS it out to Indy.

                                        SCRAGGY
                        Take one drink before bed. It keep
                        out all bad spirits.

        Indy DECLINES. He flashes a FLASK OF WHISKEY from inside of his coat
        pocket.

                                        INDIANA
                        Thanks, Scraggy...

        But this'll keep out all the bad spirits. Scraggy SHRUGS. They are
        suddenly INTERRUPTED.

                                        BETSY (O.S.)
                        Indy!...

        Indiana TURNS. BETSY and CLARE walk toward him. Indy LOOKS at Betsy.
        PUZZLED.

                                        INDIANA
                        Where're your bags?

                                        BETSY
                        I'm not leaving.

                                        INDIANA
                        Huh?... But, you... You have to
                        finish school.

                                        BETSY
                        I'm staying on as Clare's assistant.

        Indy shoots a JEALOUS GLANCE to Clare, then back to Betsy.

                                        INDIANA
                        But you're MY assistant.

                                        BETSY
                        Not any more. I'm having my credits
                        transfered.

                                        INDIANA
                        Why?...

                                        BETSY
                        Clare is a brilliant teacher.

                                        INDIANA
                                (jealous)
                        So am I.

                                        CLARE
                        Yes, but I don't offer a course in
                        seduction.

                                        INDIANA
                        You stay out of this.

                                        BETSY
                        Indy... I thought you wanted me out
                        of your life...

                                        INDIANA
                        That was before I realized how
                        gifted...how talented you are... I
                        mean... I could really use you...

                                        CLARE
                        Especially aboard ship for three
                        weeks. It gets terribly lonely.

                                        INDIANA
                        I warned you...

                                        BETSY
                        Indy, I've learned a lot from you.
                        But it's time I started
                        concentrating on a career in
                        anthropology...instead of romance.

                                        INDIANA
                                (sighs, to Betsy)
                        You've certainly developed a mature
                        attitude.

                                        BETSY
                                (hugs him)
                        Thanks to you.
                                (pauses, looking into
                                Indy's eyes)
                        You know... I always thought of you
                        as my knight in shining armor...

                                        INDIANA
                                (flattered)
                        Really?

                                        BETSY
                        But now, I'll think of you as the
                        Father I never had.

                                        INDIANA
                                (rolls his eyes)
                        Terrific.

        Clare WALKS up to him. She EXTENDS her hand.

                                        CLARE
                        Doctor Jones...although your libido
                        is questionable, your bravery and
                        intelligence are exceptional.
                                (a smile)
                        It has been an honor working with
                        you.

                                        INDIANA
                                (taken aback)
                        Why... Thanks.

        Indy LEANS toward Clare, as if he is going to KISS HER. He RAISES an
        eyebrow. SPEAKING in his smoothest...most suave...

                                        INDIANA
                        You know, Clare...there's
                        something...

                                        CLARE
                        Yes...

                                        INDIANA
                                (moving closer)
                        ...something I've been wanting to
                        do...

                                        CLARE
                        Yes...

                                        INDIANA
                                (closer)
                        ...since we first met...

        LEANING forward, Indy closes his eyes to KISS Clare. But Clare MOVES
        AWAY. BONZO THE GORILLA enters the FRAME. BONZO KISSES Indy on the
        lips. Indy OPENS his eyes. He tries to MOVE AWAY. But the Gorilla will
        not move, WRAPPING HER ARMS around Indy. The Gorilla WRESTLES Indy to
        the ground.

        By using Gorilla HAND MOTIONS and GRUNTS, Clare manages to persuade
        BONZO to MOVE AWAY from Indiana. Indy WIPES his mouth. Clare, Betsy
        and Scraggy are LAUGHING. Betsy EXPLAINS to Clare.

                                        BETSY
                        Sorry. Guess I left her cage open...
                        she followed us.

        The ocean liner's horn SOUNDS! It begins to DRIFT away from the dock.
        Indiana TURNS and RUNS up the stairs, leading to the boat. The boat is
        a FEW FEET from the dock. Indy LEAPS onto the boat. He MAKES IT. JUST
        IN TIME.

        Indiana pauses... Suddenly UPSET. He realizes that he's FORGOTTEN the
        Golden Hooped Rod! It SITS on the dock. At Scraggy's FEET. As the
        Ocean Liner PULLS AWAY, Indy is about to SCREAM to his friends... But
        Clare PICKS UP the crate. She SHRUGS to Indy. The ocean liner pulls
        FURTHER...FURTHER...from the dock. Indiana is HELPLESS. He CAN'T GO
        BACK.

                                                                        DISSOLVE TO:

        INT. CLARE'S ROOM - THAT EVENING

        Clare is SOUND ASLEEP in bed. CAMERA PANS TO a corner of the room. The
        wooden crate holding the Golden Hooped Rod RESTS here. Suddenly, the
        box's NAILS begin to TWIST. TURN. As if they were being turned by
        INVISIBLE HANDS. They FALL OUT of the box. DROPPING to the floor. ONE
        by ONE. The box SLOWLY OPENS. The Golden Hooped Rod SHIKMERS in the
        moonlight. Suddenly, the staff begins to MOVE. TWISTING. SHRINKING. It
        CHANGES SHAPE...turning into a GOLDEN EAGLE! The bird slowly FLAPS its
        wings and FLIES OUT of the open window. INTO the night. Clare
        continues to peacefully SLEEP.

                                                                        CUT TO:

        EXT. OCEAN - NIGHT

        The full moon ILLUMINATES the night sky. SHIMMERING across the ocean
        waters. Countless BRIGHT STARS sparkle in the night sky. Indy's OCEAN
        LINER sails across the water. The image of an EAGLE appears in the
        night sky. SILHOUETTED against the moon.

        INT. SHIP CABIN

        Indiana Jones is SOUND ASLEEP in his bed. The room's porthole
        mysteriously SWINGS OPEN. The Golden Eagle FLIES inside. The eagle
        TRANSFORMS back into the Golden Hooped Rod. The rod LEANS AGAINST the
        wall. The moonlight REFLECTS the rod, SHINING into Indiana's eyes.
        Indy WAKES. He SITS UP and sees the Golden Hooped Rod. At first, he is
        SHOCKED. He TOUCHES the rod...then comes upon a REALIZATION. The
        CREAKY VOICE of Sun Wu Kung FILLS the SOUNDTRACK.

                                        SUN WU KUNG (V.O.)
                        The Golden Hooped Rod will be a
                        faithful friend. It is capable of
                        one hundred transformations...and
                        will always remain by your side.

        Indy STANDS. He turns and LOOKS out of the porthole. A DREAMY...
        SATISFIED smile covers Indy's face, as he stares at the stars ABOVE.
        SOUND TRACK MUSIC SOARS. CAMERA PULLS BACK, TO EXTREMELY LONG SHOT of
        the ship SAILING across the ocean.

                                        THE END

                               A Screenplay by 
                               Chris Columbus


                                                                        FIRST DRAFT
                                                                        2/10/95







        UNDERWATER - CLOSE-UP: A brightly colored FLY, attached to a dangling,
        fishing line. A large SALMON swims to the fly. The salmon EXAMINES the
        fly, deciding whether or not to bite.

        CAMERA PANS UPWARD, tracking the line and moving OUT OF THE WATER. We
        PASS the crooked boards of a small ROWBOAT and continue to PAN UPWARD.
        A MAN reclines in the boat. NAPPING. His hands gently grip a WOODEN
        FISHING POLE. He is handsomely dressed in SPORTSMAN'S trousers and a
        blazer. His green, tweed fishing hat is lowered OVER HIS FACE. Its
        brim is filled with various types of TACKLE and BAIT.

        It is DUSK. A warm, SUMMER evening. The boat rests on a calm lake,
        surrounded by MOORS. Thick night FOG has begun to settle over the
        entire area.

        TITLE: SCOTLAND. 1937.

        Suddenly, the man's fishing line becomes TAUT. The wooden pole
        BUCKLES. The man STIRS. He SITS UP, moving the hat from his face.
        CAMERA DOLLIES FORWARD, into a CLOSE UP of the man. It is INDIANA
        JONES. His face ANXIOUS... HOPEFUL... Indy begins to REEL in his
        catch.

        A VOICE interrupts. In the DISTANCE.

                                        MACGOWAN (O.S.)
                        Doctor Jones!... Doctor Jones !...

        Indy TURNS to the direction of the sound, still STRUGGLING with the
        line.

        INDIANA'S POV

        Countless ORANGE FLAMES sparkle across the moors. The TORCHES are
        being carried by several members of a small village. The VILLAGERS are
        gathered behind a group of SIX POLICEMEN. The policemen are headed by
        INSPECTOR ANGUS MACGOWAN, a plump, balding fellow, with a veiny,
        bulbous nose, beady green eyes and a thick, curled red moustache.
        MacGowan SHOUTS to Indy.

                                        MACGOWAN
                        We need your assistance!

                                        INDIANA
                                (struggling with the
                                fishing line)
                        C'mon, Mac... It's the first bite
                        I've had all week...

                                        MACGOWAN
                        Please... It's very importantl...

        Indiana STRUGGLES a bit longer with the line. But his conscience
        prevails and Indy DROPS the fishing pole. With a GRUMBLE, he ROWS back
        to shore.

        THE MOORS - SEVERAL MINUTES LATER

        NIGHT has fallen. It is very DARK. A RELUCTANT Indiana has joined the
        Inspector and the other Policemen. They LEAD the townspeople along the
        foggy moors. Slowly, carefully, the villagers SEARCH... CREEPING...
        their faces tense, many unable to hide their FEAR. A summer wind sends
        an eeire HOWL whistling through the night air. Blue MOONLIGHT bathes
        the moors, creating stark, frightening shadows.

        An expression of ANGER and ANNOYANCE cover Indiana's face. He GRUMBLES
        to MacGowan.

                                        INDIANA
                        Do you value our friendship, Mac?

                                        MACGOWAN
                        More than me' nightly pint.

                                        INDIANA
                        Then this better not be some wild
                        goose chase...

                                        MACGOWAN
                        T'ain't wild geese we're after,
                        Doctor Jones. You got me' word on
                        that...
                                (sincere)
                        ...and a MacGowan's word is truer
                        than an angel's kiss!

        There is a sudden SCREAM! One of the villagers STUMBLES UPON
        something. Everyone GATHERS around the villager.

        A CORPSE lies before them. The body has a somewhat rubbery appearance,
        as if all of its bones had been BROKEN. The man's pale, greenish face
        is FROZEN in a hideous grimace. Indiana and MacGowan STARE in shock.
        The villagers WHISPER among themselves.

                                        YOUNG MAN
                        Scotty Ferguson.

                                        OLD WOMAN
                        He's the eighth.

                                        MAN
                        Just like the others...all his bones
                        busted...crushed...

                                        OLD MAN
                        Whatever's killin' people around
                        here ain't human.

                                        WOMAN
                                (pointing OFFSCREEN)
                        It's there! Again!

        The woman SHOOTS FORWARD. The police and the townspeople are right
        BEHIND her. A curious Indiana FOLLOWS.

        The woman stops in a CLEARING. She is POINTING ahead. The villagers
        SURROUND her. They STARE ahead, in the direction where the woman
        points. Nearly a mile in the distance, WE SEE

        AN ANCIENT SCOTTISH CASTLE.

        An enormous, 16th CENTURY stone structure. Tall, forboding towers,
        lined with menacing GARGOYLES, pierce the night sky. The castle
        appears DESERTED. Its interior is completely DARK, save for a small,
        flickering CANDLELIGHT. It burns from the castle's UPSTAIRS WINDOW.

        Indiana gives a QUESTIONING look to MacGowan. The Inpector points to
        the castle's upstairs window.

                                        MACGOWAN
                        That light...only burns after a
                        murder's been committed.

                                        INDIANA
                                (nods, turning toward
                                the castle)
                        Let's go.

        The villagers STEP BACK. Eyes wide with FEAR. Murmers of 'Ain't goin'
        in there', 'Nor I', 'Got me a wife and kids', are heard from the
        TERRIFIED villagers. Indiana TURNS to MacGowan. Even the usually
        sturdy Inspector is TREMBLING. But MacGowan turns to his men, FORCING
        himself to be strong.

                                        MACGOWAN
                        Well... Ahmmmm...that is what we're
                        here for...eh, men?...ah...
                                (points to men)
                        Hennesey... Galbraith...
                        Bottomley... You're comin' with us.

        As each man is called, the color LEAVES his face. The chosen policemen
        RELUCTANTLY join the Inspector and Indiana, as they begin walking
        TOWARD the castle. The remaining villagers and policemen STAY BEHIND.
        WAITING. The elderly woman KISSES the crucifix that hangs from her
        neck. She STARES at the departing men.

                                        ELDERLY WOMAN
                        May God help them.

                                                                        CUT TO:

        THE CASTLE DOORS.

        Two enormous wooden doors, covered with intricate CARVINGS of demons,
        serpents and gargoyles, adorn the castle entrance. Indiana and the
        police STAND before the doors. Indy GLANCES to the upstairs window.
        The candle still FLICKERS.

        A long, wooden bar, carved into the shape of a SERPENT, is fastened
        through the metal door latches. It BLOCKS the castle entrance. Indy
        and the Policemen GRAB HOLD of the bar. It is extremely HEAVY. Using
        all of their strength, they manage to slide the bar OUT of the door
        latches. It hits the ground with a THUD, rolling down the castle
        stairs.

        Indiana CLUTCHES the rusty, metal door handles. He PULLS. HARD. The
        doors CREAK. GROAN. And slowly OPEN. A thick CLOUD OF DUST explodes
        from inside of the castle. It BLOWS OUT all of the torches.

        Behind the open doors, there is only TOTAL DARKNESS. Indiana ENTERS,
        holding the flashlight before him. The Policemen exchange FRIGHTENED
        glances. Inspector MacGowan SHOVES them through the open doors.

        INT. CASTLE

        Indy's flashlight BEAM glazes over the castle's interior. It is a
        STONE PALACE. FILLED with elaborate, antique furnishings, macabre
        sculptures and oil paintings. The place is bathed in DUST. Thick
        COBWEBS fill each corner. It is extremely COLD. The men's breaths are
        VISIBLE. Hennesey RUBS his folded arms.

                                        HENNESEY
                        It's deathly cold in 'ere. How could
                        a human bein' survive?...

        Hearing this, the other Policemen exchange TERRIFIED glances. Indiana
        shines his flashlight to a TWISTING, STONE STAIRCASE. The staircase
        spirals upward along a far wall, leading to the SECOND FLOOR. A FAINT
        GLIMMER of light emanates from the top of the stairs. Indiana moves
        FORWARD. The Policemen FOLLOW.

        Indiana ASCENDS the stairs. SLOWLY. SILENTLY. Toward the LIGHT.
        MacGowan and the others are directly BEHIND Indy. As he makes his way
        to the top, Indiana examines the bizarre OIL PAINTINGS that line the
        wall. There are various PORTRAITS and LANDSCAPES, depicting everything
        from MILITARY BATTLES to SUNDAY PICNICS. But the unsettling quality of
        the pictures, is that they each feature the same white haired, ELDERLY
        MAN. Indy COMMENTS to Mac.

                                        INDIANA
                        This guy's got one hell of an ego.

                                        MACGOWAN
                        Baron Seamus Seagrove III. Some say
                        'e walks the moors every midnight...
                        others claim e's been dead for
                        years...

        Indy arrives at the TOP OF THE STAIRS. His hand rests on a SCULPTURE
        that is part of the bannister. The sculpture is a bust of BARON
        SEAGROVE. Indiana makes his way to the first doorway, where the LIGHT
        emanates. The door is WIDE OPEN. A THICK COBWEB covers the entrance.
        Indy WIPES away the web, and ENTERS the room. The Policemen DRAW their
        pistols. They FOLLOW.

        INT. ROOM

        A BEDROOM. Deserted, except for a few pieces of elaborate, ancient
        FURNITURE and a large CANOPY BED. Everything in the room is CAKED with
        dust and cobwebs...save for the burning CANDLE. It RESTS on the
        windowsill, in a sparkling, sterling silver holder. It bathes the room
        in ORANGE LIGHT.

        Indiana walks TOWARD the candle. Arm outstreched, he prepares to LIFT
        it. The Policeman WATCH. SHIVERING. SILENT. Tightly gripping their
        PISTOLS. Indy's fingers are INCHES from the candlestick. SUDDENLY...

        There is a LOUD WHOOSH! The candle GOES OUT! Indiana DROPS his
        flashlight. There is TOTAL DARKNESS. We hear the distant, MANICAL
        LAUGH of a man. It ECHOES through the castle. Indy retrieves the
        flashlight, clicking it back ON. The candle has DISAPPEARED! The laugh
        has SOBSIDED.

        MacGowan LOOKS at his men. A TROOBLED look covers the Inspector's
        face. MacGowan's eyes DART about the room. Hennesy is GONE!

                                        MACGOWAN
                        Hennesey?... Hennesey?...

                                        GALBRAITH
                                (panic)
                        'E was standin' right 'ere! Just a
                        second ago... Standin' right beside
                        me!...

        THE SOOND OF A BELL! A thick, dull RINGING! In the DISTANCE! It sends
        a CHILL through the men. Indiana DARTS out of the room. FOLLOWING the
        sound. The Policemen are right BEHIND HIM.

        INT. CASTLE

        Indy and the Police HURRY down the stairs. The ringing bell CONTINUES.
        MacGowan is CALLING for Hennesey. Indy DASHES to a door along the far
        wall. He OPENS it. It leads into a DARK BASEMENT. The sound of the
        ringing bell echoes from INSIDE. Indiana ENTERS, motioning for the
        others to FOLLOW.

        INT. BASEMENT

        A decrepit, narrow, wooden STAIRWAY leads into the basement. Indy
        holds tightly to his FLASHLIGHT. The Policemen are CLUSTERED behind
        him, taking each step with extreme caution. The boards CREAK and GROAN
        with their every move.

        MacGowan LEANS to his side, calling for Hennesey. MacGowan's weight
        causes the rotted bannister to SNAP IN TWO! He LOSES his footing!
        FALLING off the side of the stairs! Indiana's arm SHOOTS OUT! GRABBING
        HOLD of MacGowan's collar. Indy PULLS MacGowan back to SAFETY.
        MacGowan CATCHES his breath. SHAKING.

                                        MACGOWAN
                        Thanks for catchin' me.

                                        INDIANA
                        I'd rather be catchin' trout.

        They CONTINUE down the stairs, arrivifig at the bottom. It is a large,
        MUSTY STONE BASEMENT. The slimy walls are covered with a GREEN MOSS.
        There are several DOORS along the basement wall. The sound of the
        ringing bell is much LOUDER down here.

        Indiana moves to the FIRST DOOR. He REACHES for the handle. The
        Policemen DRAW their pistols. Indy OPENS the door. A LARGE OBJECT
        SHOOTS OUT FROM INSIDE! Rolling TOWARD the men! The policemen FIRE
        their guns. SEVERAL SHOTS ring out. The object comes to a STOP. A DEEP
        RED LIQUID pours out onto the floor. Indy DIPS his finger into the
        liquid. He TASTES.

                                        INDIANA
                        Interesting blood type...

        The Policemen STARE. WIDE EYED. Indy SMILES.

                                        INDIANA
                        Cabernet sauvignon. 1897.

        Indy's flashlight beam shines ahead, ILLUMINATING the 'mysterious
        object', a WINE BARREL. And inside the room, is a deserted WINE
        CELLAR. Suddenly, a LOUD CREAK echoes through the basement. Galbraith
        CRIES OUT.

                                        GALBRAITH
                                (pointing OFF SCREEN)
                        Look!

        Everyone TURNS. A large STONE DOOR, built into the wall, slowly OPENS.
        Indy and the police stare in AMAZEMENT. The door STOPS. Wide OPEN. A
        FLICKERING LIGHT glimmers from inside. Indiana WALKS to the opening.
        He PEERS into the opening. The Police stay a FEW STEPS behind.

        BEHIND THE DOOR

        A FAMILY CRYPT. Stone COFFINS, with glass covered tops, line the crypt
        walls. Macabre, ghastly RELIGIOUS STATUES decorate the room. Countless
        DEATH MASKS cover the ceiling, all carved with that same frighteningly
        familiar face... BARON SEAGROVE!

        CAMERA DOLLIES to the far corner of the crypt. It STOPS on a CLOSE-UP
        of the CANDLESTICK! The EXACT candle from upstairs! Still BURNING! It
        rests on one of the coffin's GLASS TOPS.

        A TREMBLING MacGowan steps back, away from the crypt. Be BLURTS an
        order to his men.

                                        MACGOWAN
                        Galbraith... You come with me! We'll
                        search for Hennesey... Out here!
                        Bottomley... You go with Doctor
                        Jones...
                                (finger shaking, points
                                to inside of crypt)
                        In there.

        MacGowan and Galbraith nearly fall over each other as they SCRAMBLE
        away from the crypt. The two DASH OFF into another section of the
        basement. Indy SHAKES his head. He ENTERS the crypt. A reluctant and
        very frightened Bottomley FOLLOWS.

        INT. CRYPT

        Indy's flashlight beam dances across the glass COFFIN TOPS. Decayed
        CORPSES smile from inside, their hands tightly clutching crucifixes.
        Bottomley is HORRIFIED by the sights. Indiana continues AHEAD. He
        PASSES the burning candle, moving further into the darkness of the
        crypt. The shivering Bottomley stays directly BEHIND Indy. With their
        every step, the bell's ringing grows LOUDER... LOUDER...

        Indiana and Bottomley arrive in a circular CHAMBER, located at the far
        end of the crypt. Here, the ringing bell is nearly DEAFENING. The
        sound echoes from ABOVE. We are on the floor of the BELL TOWER.
        Indiana SHINES his flashlight UPWARD. The beam stops on a RINGING BELL
        that hangs SEVERAL FEET in the air. Inside of the bell, dangling by
        his feet, is the DEAD BODY of

        HENNESEY! He has REPLACED THE BELL CLAPPER! His body SWINGS back and
        forth. It SLAMS into the sides of the bell. Causing the DULL RINGING.

        Bottomley SCREAMS. Indiana GRABS Bottomley's arm.

                                        INDIANA
                        Let's get outta' here.

        Indy and Bottomley TURN to the crypt door. It begins to CLOSE! The two
        men DASH FORWARD. The door CONTINUES to close. Indy and Bottomley are
        only INCHES away...when the door SLAMS SHUT! They PUSH and KICK at the
        door. NO GOOD. It WON'T BUDGE. A PANICKED Bottomley calls for help.

                                        BOTTOMLEY
                        Inspector MacGowan! Galbraith! Open
                        the door!

        Using his flashlight, Indy SCANS the door, looking for a CRACK,
        another way OUT. Indy NUDGES Bottomley.

                                        INDIANA
                                (motioning to candle)
                        I need more light.

        Bottomley HURRIES to the candle. He REACHES OUT. There is a LOUD
        WHOOSH! The candle flame GOES OUT! Followed by TOTAL DARKNESS! Indy
        TURNS from the door.

                                        INDIANA
                        Bottomley?...

        NO answer. Indy SHINES his flashlight toward the area. The candle is
        GONE. There is NO SIGN of Bottomley. Indiana takes a STEP FORWARD.

                                        INDIANA
                        Bottomley?...

        AGAIN, no answer. Indy SWEEPS the flashlight beam across the room. It
        PASSES one of the coffins...then SHOOTS BACK! Indy is met with a
        SHOCKING SIGHT!

        BOTTOMLEY LIES INSIDE THE COFFIN! DEAD! His face twisted in a GHOULISH
        SMILE. All of his bones BROKEN. His hands are wrapped around a
        CRUCIFIX. Indy STARES in horror. There is a SOUND. FOOTSTEPS. There is
        SOMEONE ELSE in here. Indy's flashlight beam DARTS around the crypt.
        There is NO SIGN of anyone.

                                        INDIANA
                        Who is it?... Who's there?...

        The same crazed LAUGH of a man echoes through the crypt. A CHILLED
        Indy TURNS BACK to the door. He is startled to find the crypt door
        COVERED WITH A THICK SHEET OF ICE!

        Indy REACHES OUT. He TOUCHES the sparkling, green ice. He SNAPS back
        his hand. His fingers are BURNT.

        INT. BASEMENT

        MacGowan and Galbraith are OUTSIDE of the crypt door. They PULL at the
        door's metal handles. Trying to OPEN IT. But the door WON'T MOVE.
        MacGowan CALLS through the door.

                                        MACGOWAN
                        Doctor Jones! Try to push!

        INT. CRYPT

        Indy ANSWERS, taking a STEP BACK.

                                        INDIANA
                        Can't! There's some kinda' hot ice
                        coverin' the...

        Indiana suddenly FALLS! The floor has DISAPPEARED FROM BENEATH HIM!

        Indy manages to GRAB HOLD of a stone coffin. His fingers tightly GRIP
        the coffin's edge. Indiana LOOKS DOWN. Beneath him, is a SEVERAL
        HUNDRED FOOT DROP INTO TOTAL DARKNESS!

        Indy tries to PULL HIMSELF UP. The coffin's ancient stone begins to
        CRUMBLE. Large chunks and pieces FALL from Indy's grasp. He is LOSING
        HIS GRIP.

        Seconds before he plummets into the abyss, Indiana REACHES inside of
        the coffin. He clutches onto a CORPSE'S ARM! Using the arm, Indy
        SWINGS DOWNWARD.

        INT. ABYSS

        At the precise moment, Indiana RELEASES the dead arm. He LANDS on a
        ROCKY LEDGE. Located only a few feet BELOW the open crypt floor. Indy
        STANDS on the ledge. SAFE. He SMILES. RELIEVED. Suddenly, the ledge
        SNAPS!

        Indiana FALLS! His body DROPS hundreds of feet into the blackness. A
        MOMENT passes. Then... WE HEAR A SPLASH!

        BOTTOM OF THE HOLE!

        A POOL OF WATER! Surrounded by rocky, cavernous WALLS. Indiana's hat
        FLOATS on the water's surface. Indy POPS OUT of the water, bobbing up
        beside the hat. Indy REACHES for the hat. Suddenly, a FISH flaps out
        of the water. The fish GOBBLES UP one of the hat's live baits and
        disappears back underwater. Indy SMIRKS.

                                        INDIANA
                        NOW they bite!

        Indy attempts to PULL himself out of the water. There is a LOUD SOUND.
        Grinding METAL. Rattling CHAINS. Indy's eyes DART to his side.

        TWO HORIZONTAL METAL GATES EJECT FROM THE CAVERN WALLS! They SHOOT
        across the water! Like LIGHTNING! They're headed TOWARD each other...
        and Indy's HEAD!

        Indy DIVES underwater. THE GATES SNAP SHUT! Less than an INCH above
        the water's surface! Indy ATTEMPTS to resurface. The closed gate STOPS
        HIM. He CLUTCHES the grating, trying to MOVE the gate. It's TOO
        STRONG! Indy STRUGGLES for air. NO GOOD. There isn't enough SPACE.
        He's going to DROWN!

        UNDERWATER

        In desperation, Indy SWIMS downward. Looking for an ALTERNATE ESCAPE.
        But there is NO BOTTOM in sight. Indy's eyes BULGE. His face loses
        COLOR. Only a few precious SECONDS OF LIFE remain...when suddenly, he
        SPOTS SOMETHING. A SMALL TUNNEL. Built into the CAVERN WALL. Indiana
        hurriedly SWIMS to the tunnel. He BOLTS inside.

        A WATER FOUNTAIN. A large, THREE TIERED stone structure. Instead of
        the familiar carvings of angels and beautiful maidens, this fountain
        is surrounded with water spewing DEMONS, GARGOYLES and hellish BEASTS.
        CAMERA DOLLIES TO A LARGE METAL DRAIN, located inside of the
        fountain's base. The drain cover begins to TURN. Suddenly FLIPPING
        OPEN! Indiana CRAWLS out of the opening. He GULPS at the air. COLOR
        returns to his face. LIFE returns to his body. Indy RISES to his feet.
        He finds himself STANDING in the fountain.

        INDY'S POV

        He is inside of a BANQUET ROOM. The sprawling room is beautifully
        DECORATED in Victorian dignity. The room is IMMACULATE. Not one SPECK
        of dust. Two Medieval SUITS OF ARMOR adorn one wall. A gargantuan
        crystal CHANDELIER hangs above a long, mahogany BANQUET TABLE.

        At the far end of the table, sits a shriveled, white haired ELDERLY
        MAN. It is BARON SEAMUS SEAGROVE III, the fellow whose likeness
        appeared in every piece of artwork. Baron Seagrove is CALMLY eating
        his dinner. A bloated ROASTED PIG rests on a silver platter before
        him. The same candle we saw burning in the upstairs room and the
        family crypt, now RESTS on the table. Directly BESIDE the Baron.

        Two powerful, muscular MASTIFFS are tied to Baron Seagrove's chair.
        Teeth BARED. Eyes AELAZE. The hounds FIGHT for a scrap of meat.

        Indiana stares in BEWILDERMENT at the new surroundings. He STEPS OUT
        of the fountain. Baron Seagrove seems UNAWARE of Indy's presense.
        Indiana WALKS TOWARD the Baron.

                                        INDIANA
                        Excuse me, sir...? Hello...?

        Baron Seagrove DOES NOT look up from his plate. Indy moves CLOSER. He
        speaks LOUDER.

                                        INDIANA
                        Canyou hear me?...

        CLOSE-UP: BENEATH THE TABLE

        Baron seagrove's hand nonchalantly UNTIES the Mastiff's bindings.

        INDIANA

        still WALKS toward the table. The Baron continues to IGNORE him. Indy
        is ANNOYED.

                                        INDIANA
                        Listen, pal... There are two dead
                        Policemen upstairs and...

        The Mastiffs LEAP forward. COMING at Indiana. He tries to GET AWAY.
        TOO SLOW. The hounds are UPON HIM. TEARING. CLAWING. BITING. They DRAG
        Indy to the floor.

        Baron Seagrove continues to ENJOY his dinner, seemingly OBLIVIOUS to
        the scene before him.

        Indiana FIGHTS for his life. The VICIOUS dogs tear at his clothing and
        skin. Indy SPOTS something. On the wall ABOVE. Hanging amidst a
        display of stuffed animal heads, is a HUNTER'S TRUMPET. Indy STRUGGLES
        to his knees. Trying to REACH for the horn. But the dogs are still
        BITING. CLAWING. WEAKENING Indiana.

        Indy's fingers are INCHES from the horn. The Mastiffs' sharp claws RIP
        at his arm. But Indy manages to SNATCH the trumpet. He quickly moves
        the horn to his LIPS. He BLOWS. HARD. A HIGH, PIERCING NOTE fills the
        air. The dogs respond to the SOUND. They HALT. STOPPING their attack.
        For a MOMENT.

        Tattered and bruised, Indiana LEAPS to his feet. He DROPS the horn. He
        RUNS.

        The Mastiffs come to their SENSES. They DART after Indy. Mouths
        FOAMING.

        Baron Seagrove continues to DINE, still IGNORING the action.

        Indy runs to a VELVET CURTAIN. He GRABS HOLD of a long, thick rope
        that is attached to the curtain. Indiana TEARS the curtain from the
        wall. A large STAINED GLASS WINDOW is behind the curtain.

        The FIRST MASTIFF leaps at Indy. Indiana quickly DRAPES the curtain
        OVER the hound. Indy ties a large KNOT in the open curtain end. The
        dog is TRAPPED.

        Indy TURNS. The SECOND MASTIFF is only a FEW FEET AWAY. BARRELLING
        toward Indy. Indiana HOPS to the window ledge. He OPENS the window.
        The Mastiff LEAPS UPWARD! Indiana JUMPS OUT OF THE WINDOW! The dog
        FOLLOWS Indy, also JUMPING OUT OF THE WINDOW!

        EXT. WINDOW

        The Mastiff FALLS. Flying hundreds of feet into the ROCKY WATERS
        BELOW. The hound's vicious howl FADES. CAMERA PANS from the water and
        STOPS ON INDIANA JONES! Indy has OUTSMARTED the Mastiff. Be HANGS onto
        the swinging WINDOW FRAME. SAFE. He LEAPS back inside the room.

        INT. BANQUET ROOM

        Baron Seagrove pours himself a glass of WINE. A very ANGRY Indiana
        walks toward the Baron.

                                        INDIANA
                        Chow time's over, mister. You better
                        start talkin'.

        The Baron still IGNORES Indiana.

                                        INDIANA
                        There's a lot of strange things
                        happening around here...

        A SUIT OF ARMOR, located a few feet behind Indy, suddenly TWITCHES.
        Its arm LOWERS. Its head slowly TURNS.

        Indiana still walks TOWARD the Baron, who is only concerned with
        spreading butter on his bread. Indy SHOUTS.

                                        INDIANA
                        ...and I want some answers! Do you
                        hear me?
                                (louder)
                        I want some answers! Now!

        There is a LOUD CREAK OF METAL. A huge, sharp BATTLE AXE SHOOTS INTO
        FRAME! SWINGING toward Indy's head! Indiana SPINS. The axe is only
        INCHES from his face. Indy LEAPS BACK. WHOOSH! The axe SLICES through
        the air. JUST MISSING Indy. The shaken Indiana is SHOCKED to see

        A GLISTENING, BLACK SUIT OF ARMOR! The black knight is nearly SEVEN
        FEET TALL! It has COME TO LIFE and is walking TOWARD Indy. The black
        knight is WILDLY swinging the battle axe. Indiana continues to STEP
        BACK... BACK... Unbeknownst to Indy, his steps are leading him toward

        ANOTHER SUIT OF ARMOR! Also over seven feet tall, this armor is made
        of a SILVERY, WHITE METAL! As Indy moves CLOSER, the WHITE KNIGHT
        OPENS ITS ARMS! When Indy is within reach, the white knight LOCKS its
        powerful arms around Indy's chest! Indiana TRIES to break free. NO
        GOOD. The white knight's grip is TOO TIGHT. Indy is TRAPPED!

        The black knight still COMES TOWARD Indiana. Its frenzied axe SWINGS
        back and forth. Indy still STRUGGLES with the white knight's bone
        crunching grip.

        The black knight is only a FEW FEET from Indy. Its deadly axe blade
        INCHES from Indy's face. Indiana MOVES FAST. He JERKS his body
        forward. This FLIPS the white knight off its feet! OVER Indy's head.
        The white knight FLIES INTO the black knight. CRASH! This sends both
        knights FALLING to the floor.

        Indiana SHOOTS to his feet. The two knights LEAP to their feet. They
        CHASE Indy. The black knight armed with his AXE, the white knight
        armed with a long, sharp SWORD!

        Baron Seagrove SPOONS another helping of boiled potatoes onto his
        plate.

        Indy snatches a SHIELD and SWORD from a nearby wall display. Ready to
        FIGHT. The knights are UPON HIM. Indiana battles BOTH knights. He
        DEFENDS the bludgeoning battle axe with his shield, and SWORDFIGHTS
        the other knight! THRASH! CLANG! The sound of HEAVY METAL fills the
        room!

        Indy's sword STRIKES the white knight's thick chest. The sword SNAPS
        IN TWO. In the confusion, Indy's shield is KNOCKED from his hand by
        the powerful battle axe. Indy is DEFENSLESS.

        The two metal giants RAISE their weapons. HIGH. AIMING for Indy's
        head. The two knights SWING! Indy DIVES to the floor! The knights
        CAN'T STOP their weapons in time... CRUNCH! They deliver a HARD BLOW
        to each other! The woozy knights WOBBLE and SPIN. In a momentary DAZE.
        Indiana JUMPS to his feet.

        The BLACK KNIGHT hisses. FURIOUS. He DASHES after Indiana. The WHITE
        KNIGHT is still REELING from the blow.

        Seeing the black knight in HOT PURSUIT, Indy searches for a WEAPON. He
        spots the curtain's long, thick ROPE. LYING on the floor.

        The black knight is nearly UPON Indy. AXE RAISED! Indiana GRABS the
        rope. He SPINS. FACING the knight. Indy SNAPS HIS WRIST! A LOUD CRACK!
        The rope SHOOTS FORWARD! Not unlike Indiana's familiar WHIP!

        The rope WRAPS itself around the black knight's neck. Indy JERKS the
        whip forward. HARD. This sends the knight FLYING THROUGH THE AIR! The
        knight crashes into the stone FOONTAIN! Several of the fountain's
        sculptures SHATTER into pieces. The dazed, dented black knight
        ATTEMPTS to stand...but LOSES his footing. The knight FALLS backward.
        Into the fountain's WIDE DRAIN OPENING! Its HEAVY ARMOR causes the
        knight to SINK. DISAPPEARING into the hole. Into the POOL OF WATER.

        Indy CATCHES HIS BREATH. The white knight's SWORD SWINGS INTO FRAME!
        SLICING through Indiana's jacket! Indy JUMPS BACK. The vicious white
        knight COMES toward him.

        Indiana TURNS to run. Finding himself at the BANQUET TABLE. Face to
        face with the ROASTED PIG. A few feet away, Baron Seagrove CONTINUES
        to dine. The white knight raises his sword ABOVE Indy. WHOOSH! The
        sword begins to swing DOWN! Indiana DUCKS and DODGES the deadly blows.
        Instead of carving Indiana, the knight's sword manages to SLICE
        perfect sections of the roasted pig. The satisfied Baron HELPS HIMSELF
        to a freshly carved slice of pork.

        Indiana LEAPS onto the table top. Trying to ESCAPE the living suit of
        armor. But the white knight CLIMBS up onto the table. FOLLOWING Indy.

        The sword slashing knight PURSUES Indy along the table top. Indy
        GLANCES upward. To the heavy CHANDELIER. Indy SMILES. A PLAN. He
        continues to STEP BACKWARD. Leading the knight DIRECTLY BELOW the
        chandelier.

        At the precise moment, Indy picks up a STERLING SILVER PLATE from the
        table top. Indy WHISKS the plate in the air. Toward the ROPE that
        holds the chandelier. The spinning plate SEVERS the rope. The
        chandelier FLIES DOWNWARDl! CRASHING ON TOP of the white knight! The
        knight lies BENEATH the chandelier. MOTIONLESS. The sword DROPS from
        its lifeless hand. Onto the TABLE TOP.

        Indy takes the knight's SWORD. Eyes on FIRE, sword OUTSTRETCHED,
        Indiana WALKS across the table top. HEADED for Baron Seagrove.

        The Baron prepares to take ANOTHER BITE of his food. THE SWORD SHOOTS
        INTO FRAME! The tip of the blade RESTS upon Baron Seagrove's rubbery
        throat. Indiana SNARLS.

                                        INDIANA
                        Haven't you had enough?

        Baron Seagrove finally LOOKS at Indiana. The Baron LOWERS his fork.
        His face twists into an EERIE GRIN. He begins LAUGHING. It's the SAME
        MANIACAL LAUGH we heard earlier. Indy responds by BLOWING OUT the
        flame of the mysterious candle.

        The room's door BURSTS OPEN! INSPECTOR MACGOWAN and GALBRAITH dash
        inside. They HURRY to Baron Seagrove. Their PISTOLS aimed at him.
        Galbraith HANDCUFFS the Baron. MacGowan looks at the BRUISED, BLOODIED
        and TATTERED Indiana Jones.

                                        MACGOWAN
                        Now you can get back to your
                        fishing, Doctor Jones.

                                        INDIANA
                        No chance, Mac. My plane leaves in
                        the morning. Vacation's over. Gotta'
                        get back to school.

                                        MACGOWAN
                                (shakes his head)
                        'Tis a shame to go home empty
                        handed...
                                (smiles, an idea)
                        Tell ya' what, my friend... I fancy
                        me'self quite the fisherman...
                        Tomorrow, I'll go out and catch you
                        a real beauty, eh?...

                                        INDIANA
                                (sarcastic smirk)
                        Right. Send it to me airmail.

                                        MACGOWAN
                                (incredulous)
                        Doctor Jones! A MacGowan's word is
                        truer than...

                                        INDIANA
                        Yeah, yeah...an angel's kiss. I
                        know.

        They EXIT the room.

        EXT. CASTLE

        The villagers SURROUND the castle. Their BRIGHT TORCHES are raised
        high in the air. Baron Seagrove is LED out of the castle by Indiana
        and the Police. The crowd begins to WHISPER. ANXIOUS. EXCITED. As the
        Baron is led to the POLICE VEHICLE, he turns and LOOKS at Indy. The
        Baron speaks in a TREMBLING, RASPY voice. His eyes are WILD.

                                        BARON SEAGROVE
                        No...jail...can...hold...me.

        A CHILL rushes through Indiana. The Baron turns, CONTINUING to the
        Police wagon. One of the villagers SHOUTS.

                                        VILLAGER
                        'E's done it! Indiana Jones has
                        captured the killer!

        The crowd CHEERS. Indiana gives a HUMBLE NOD and WAVE. MacGowan SHAKES
        Indy's hand. Indy glances to the POLICE VEHICLE.

        INDY'S POV

        Baron Seagrove CLIMBS into the back compartment of the police vehicle.
        Galbraith CLOSES the vehicle doors. The Baron is still VISIBLE through
        the vehicle's windows. He LIGHTS a cigarette. It appears that the
        MATCH FLAME SHINES THROUGH THE BARON'S BODY! It's as if he were a
        GHOST!

        Indiana TURNS to the others. Eyes WIDE. SHOCKED. But it is obvious
        that NO ONE else has SEEN the apparition. MacGowan notices the PALE
        expression on Indy's face.

                                        MACGOWAN
                        What is it, man? You look as if
                        you've seen a screamin' banshee!

        Indy POINTS back to the police vehicle. But it has already DEPARTED.
        It drives over a far hill, DISAPPEARING INTO THE NIGHT. Indy SIGHS,
        turning back to MacGowan.

                                        INDIANA
                        Ah... It was nothing, Mac. Nothing
                        at all.

        CAMERA DOLLIES INTO INDIANA'S TROUBLED, UNCERTAIN FACE. THE BARON'S
        LAUGH FILLS THE SOUND TRACK.

                                                                        SLOW DISSOLVE:

        EXT. MARSHALL UNIVERSITY - A FEW DAYS LATER

        Early AFTERNOON. A RAINY Spring day. Students RUN to the University
        doors, protecting themselves with textbooks.

        INT. INDIANA JONES' OFFICE

        Rain SPLATTERS the window of this cramped, CLUTTERED room. Crooked
        stacks of dog eared TEXTBOOKS and PAPERS nearly reach the ceiling. The
        spindly bookshelves are stuffed with various ARCHEOLOGICAL RELICS and
        INSTRUMENTS: animal and bird skeletons, fossils, primitive statues,
        etc. Sitting at a small wooden desk, amidst a mountain of TERM PAPERS,
        is INDIANA JONES. Indy is WEARING a brown three piece suit and
        circular, wire rimmed glasses. In one hand, he holds a STUDENT SEAT
        ASSIGNMENT CARD, as he hurriedly READS through the term papers. He
        furiously GRADES each paper.

        To make matters worse; the office is CROWDED WITH STUDENTS, with
        countless others POURING out into the hallway. All of the students are
        ANXIOUS to get inside. They are BADGERING, COMPLAINING and MOANING at
        Indy.

                                        TEDDY
                        Doctor Jones... I took your class
                        instead of all the others!... I
                        coulda' had Professor Needles...
                        Professor Eisenschmidt...
                        Professor...

                                        ANGELA
                        You promised. You said you'd have
                        'em graded by yesterday.

                                        VIRGIL
                        My paper finished yet? Name's
                        "Virgil Vektor". That's VIRGIL.
                                (spelling it out)
                        Capital V... I... R...

                                        JULIA
                        My parents paid good money to send
                        me here. You know how much they
                        shelled out for your class?

                                        CHARLES
                        He doesn't care about us. He only
                        wants fame and fortune. We're just a
                        buncha' peons to him.

                                        VIRGIL
                        VEKTOR. Capital V... E... K...

        Indiana continues to grade the papers, trying to IGNORE the verbal
        assault. BETSY TUFFET pushes her way to the front. Betsy is Indy's
        STUDENT ASSISTANT. She is 21 YEARS OLD, with thick, luxurious black
        hair, bright brown eyes and a small framed, athletic body. Betsy is a
        TOUGH. BRASH. A BROOKLYN kid. She moves CLOSE to Indy, her hair
        brushing his cheek. Indiana is very TENSE, continuously working on the
        term papers.

                                        BETSY
                        Hello, Ind --
                                (giggle)
                        Doctor Jones.

                                        INDIANA
                        Not now, Betsy.

                                        BETSY
                        LOOK at all of those papers!

                                        INDIANA
                        Please, I...

                                        BETSY
                        Want me to come by later? Help you
                        grade?

                                        INDIANA
                        Help me grade. Yeah. Sure.

                                        BETSY
                        Goodbye, Ind --
                                (giggles)
                        Doctor Jones!

        She EXITS. Indy SIGHS. Again, the obnoxious student SHOUTS.

                                        VIRGIL
                        Didja' get the name? VIRGIL! Capital
                        V... I... R...

        PROFESSOR THAD PRIESTLY enters, pushing Virgil aside. Priestly is a
        young, wisecracking, greasy haired AQUAINTANCE of Indy's. He SHOVES a
        photograph BENEATH Indy's nose.

                                        PRIESTLY
                        Moby Dick.

                                        INDIANA
                        Huh?...

                                        PRIESTLY
                                (points to photo)
                        That's what I named 'im. Captain
                        said it was the biggest fish he ever
                        saw.

        Indiana GLANCES to the photo. It is a picture of Prof. Priestly
        dressed in fisherman's outfit, standing on a pier, holding a GIANT
        FISH. Indy STEAMS. Priestly gives him a MANLY SLAP to the back.

                                        PRIESTLY
                        What about you, Jonesey? You were
                        over in Scotty-land for two weeks...
                        Didja' catch the big one?...

                                        INDIANA
                        Look, Priestly... I'm real busy...

        Indy is suddenly INTERRUPTED by a HARD SLAP to his face. He LOOKS UP.
        A beautiful, blonde student, REBECCA, stands over his desk. She
        SCREAMS. FURIOUS.

                                        REBECCA
                        Two-timing bastard!

        Indiana RUBS his jaw. STARTLED. Rebecca CONTINUES.

                                        REBECCA
                        How could you?!?... My own
                        Mother?!?... In my own bed?!?...
                                (slaps him again)
                        I've had it with you! It's over!

        Priestly HIDES his chuckle. Rebecca THROWS a shirt that obviously
        belongs to Indiana on the desk and STORMS out of the room. Indy shakes
        his head and CONTINUES working. The students are still HARASSING him.
        A LOUD VOICE ECHOES through the room.

                                        POSTMAN (O.S.)
                        Special Delivery! Dr. Indiana Jones!

        A burly POSTMAN stands in the doorway, holding a thick, enormous BROWN
        ENVELOPE. Indy MOTIONS to the postman. The Postman tries to MAKE his
        way through the crowd. Indiana goes back to his grading, but is
        suddenly INTERRUPTED BY A LOUD TAPPING NOISE. He LOOKS UP. DEAN CLAUDE
        COVENTRY, a stately, elderly gentleman, RAPS a steel ruler on
        Indiana's desk. The Dean is UPSET. Very SERIOUS.

                                        DEAN COVENTRY
                        Doctor Jones, I've had complaints
                        from several of the students --

        The Postman INTERRUPTS, dropping the heavy envelope onto Indy's desk.
        The Postman SHOVES a yellow paper in front of Indy.

                                        POSTMAN
                        Sign here.

        Indy SIGNS. Dean Coventry continues LECTURING.

                                        DEAN COVENTRY
                        They feel that you are ignoring
                        them, that you are distracted...

                                        INDIANA
                                (gives Postman the
                                signed paper)
                        Me?... Distracted?...

                                        POSTMAN
                                (staring at Indy's
                                signature, puzzled)
                        What's this? "B+"? That's how you
                        sign your name?

        Indy GRABS the paper. He's signed a "B+" on the LINE where his name is
        supposed to appear. Indy CROSSES out the grade and signs his name.
        Professor Coventry still LECTURES Indiana.

                                        DEAN COVENTRY
                        Marshall University is not the place
                        for sloppy behavior...

        At that moment, Indy OPENS the envelope! A LARGE AMOUNT OF WATER POURS
        OUT! SATURATING the papers on the desk! This is followed by an
        ENORMOUS DEAD TROUT! It FLOPS onto Indy's desk. The students exchange
        STARTLED and NAUSEOUS glances. Indiana removes a water logged NOTE
        from the envelope. It reads, "A MACGOWAN'S WORD IS TRUER THAN AN
        ANGEL'S KISS". Indiana uses a TISSUE to WIPE some of the water from
        his desk. Dean Coventry SHAKES A FINGER at Indy.

                                        DEAN COVENTRY
                        I have one final warning for you,
                        Doctor Jones --

        THE PHONE RINGS! INTERRUPTING the Dean! Indiana quickly ANSWERS the
        phone. A FUMING Dean Coventry impatiently waits to finish his threat.
        Indiana SPEAKS into the receiver.

                                        INDIANA
                        Yes... Oh, Hello, Marcus... Look,
                        can you hold on?...
                                (back to Dean)
                        You were saying, sir?

                                        DEAN COVENTRY
                        Either you begin concentrating on
                        your --

                                        INDIANA
                                (interrupted by phone)
                        Yes, Marcus... I'm still here...
                        Just hold on!
                                (back to Dean)
                        I'm very sorry, sir...

                                        DEAN COVENTRY
                                (boiling)
                        -- concentrating on your teaching
                        duties or --

                                        INDIANA
                                (into phone)
                        Damn it, Marcus! I'm standing here
                        with Dean... What?.. Just how
                        important?...
                                (listening, impatient)
                        It is, huh?... Okay. Five minutes.
                        Yeah. I'll be right over. But this
                        better be important, Marcus!

        Indiana HANGS UP. He gives an EMBARASSED look to the furious, red
        faced Dean.

                                        DEAN COVENTRY
                        You are on probation, Jones! Ten
                        days! If there is no improvement,
                        you will be dismissed!

        The Dean STORMS OUT of the room. Indiana GATHERS the wet papers. He
        begins to EXIT the room, EXPLAINING to the students as he makes his
        way through the crowd.

                                        INDIANA
                        I promise...by tomorrow...I'll have
                        all of these graded...and DRIED!

        Indiana continues making APOLOGIES and EXCUSES. The obnoxious student
        again SHOUTS at him.

                                        VIRGIL
                        VIRGIL VEKTOR! Capital V... I...
                        R...

                                        INDIANA
                                (hands him paper)
                        "F"!

        Virgil STARES at his paper, adorned with a large RED "F"! Indiana
        EXITS the room.

        INT. HISTORY MUSEUM - PREHISTORIC ROOM

        The large room is filled with skeletons, fossils and statues dating
        back to the DAWN OF MAN. Indiana, his arms cluttered with the soaking
        term papers, hurriedly enters the museum with MARCUS BRODY. Marcus is
        very ANXIOUS. EXCITED. He carries a l6MM METAL FILM CANNISTER beneath
        his arm. Indiana is very IMPATIENT. His eyes dart to a full sized
        skeleton of a TYRONOSAURUS REX.

                                        INDIANA
                        This better be important, Marcus...
                        or the museum will soon be
                        displaying my bones. My teaching
                        career is in danger of extinction.

                                        MARCUS
                                (smiles)
                        You will not be disappointed,
                        Indiana.

                                                                        CUT TO:

        CLOSE-UP: AN ANCIENT PAINTING. The watercolor features an upright,
        wrinkled face SUN WU KUNG, the STONE MONKEY KING. But the monkey is
        NOT made of stone. He appears to be HALF HUMAN... HALF MONKEY. His
        face is WISE. His coal black eyes are PENETRATING. He wears a LION
        SKIN ROBE, and holds a tall, GOLDEN HOOPED STAFF. Sun Wu Kung stands
        amidst a garden of luscious, ripe PEACE TREES. He is surrounded by a
        HEAVENLY GLOW, a bright ray of light that emanates from an opening in
        the CLOUDS.

                                        MARCUS (O.S.)
                        ...Look familiar?

        CAMERA PULLS BACK. We are inside of the museum BOARD ROOM. Marcus
        holds the tattered painting before Indiana, who sits at a desk, still
        feverishly GRADING the wet term papers. After he finishes each paper,
        Indy PINS it to a nearby bulletin board for drying. He GLANCES to the
        painting of Sun Wu Kung.

                                        INDIANA
                        "Sun wu Kung, The Stone Monkey
                        King". Big deal. That was ten years
                        ago, Marcus.
                                (going back to papers,
                                wanting to change
                                subject)
                        Geez! This Heller kid's got the
                        worst grammar.

                                        MARCUS
                        Ten years or fifty years. It will
                        always be in your blood.

                                        INDIANA
                                (ignoring Marcus)
                        Don't believe this... He spells
                        "repeat" with two "E's".

                                        MARCUS
                        Think back, Indiana. Remember your
                        desire? Your passion?

                                        INDIANA
                                (still ignores Marcus)
                        Kid gets an "A" on content...a "D"
                        on form.

                                        MARCUS
                                (angry, slams his fist
                                on the desk)
                        Damn it, man! You can't bury those
                        feelings forever!

        Indiana finally LOOKS UP from the papers. He glances at Marcus, then
        LOOKS at the painting. CAMERA DOLLIES INTO Indiana's face. He becomes
        very SERIOUS. SOMBER. His eyes are EMPTY. Memories of FAILURE fill his
        head.

                                        INDIANA
                        Two years. Nearly two years of my
                        life...looking for the remains of
                        that Monkey...a piece of his
                        legendary Golden Hooped Rod...or
                        some sign of the Lost City.
                                (shakes his head)
                        Nine men perished on the journey.
                        Rest of us nearly died from
                        starvation or one of the many
                        horrible deseases we discovered...
                                (looks back to papers,
                                in a near whisper)
                        We still came back empty handed.

                                        MARCUS
                                (threading the
                                projector)
                        One mustn't give up so easily,
                        Indiana.

                                        INDIANA
                        Give up?!?... Marcus, we spent
                        thirteen months in China!...another
                        seven in India!...

                                        MARCUS
                        But none in Africa.

                                        INDIANA
                                (puzzled expression)
                        There was no proof...archeological
                        or anthropological...to indicate
                        that Sun Wu-Kung ever visited
                        Africa...

                                        MARCUS
                        Until now.

        Marcus TURNS OFF the room lights.

                                        INDIANA
                        Hey... My papers...

        Marcus STARTS the projector. A BLACK AND WHITE image flickers on the
        far wall. We see a PYGMY, standing in what appears to be a grassy
        area. The pygmy's name is TYKI. He is ADORABLE. A little Over FOUR
        FEET TALL, his body is TAUT, MUSCULAR. His long black hair is SHAGGY,
        his eyes are WIDE and BRIGHT. Almost CHILDLIKE. His face is CUTE.
        IMPISH. Covered with a very INQUISITIVE expression. Tyki's energy is
        BOUNDLESS. He cannot stop MOVING. Standing BESIDE Tyki, is

        DR. CLARE CLARKE. 32 years old. A tall, strikingly BEAUTIFUL woman.
        She is COMMUNICATING with Tyki in sign language.

                                        MARCUS
                        The woman is Dr. Clare Clarke. The
                        famous zoologist. She works in
                        Africa, studying animals in their
                        natural habitat.

                                        INDIANA
                        Very interesting, Marcus. Now if
                        you'll turn the lights back on --

                                        MARCUS
                                (continuing)
                        Three weeks ago, Dr. Clarke
                        discovered that cute little
                        fellow... "Tyki"...a pygmy of an
                        unusual race...unrelated to any
                        known African tribe...

                                        INDIANA
                                (bored)
                        Marcus. The lights.

                                        MARCUS
                        Dr. Clarke believes that Tyki comes
                        from the Lost Civilization of Sun
                        Wu-Kung.

        Indiana PAUSES. He STANDS, walking closer to the flickering image.
        Suddenly INTERESTED.

                                        INDIANA
                        What?... But how did Miss --

                                        MARCUS
                        "Doctor".

                                        INDIANA
                        "Doctor" Clake. How did she arrive
                        at such a preposterous hypothesis?

                                        MARCUS
                        The pygmy speaks in a language that
                        has no African origins...but bears a
                        strong resemblance to Chinese.

                                        INDIANA
                        Means nothing. The rivers of Africa
                        have been plagued by various
                        Oriental Pirates and Scavengers
                        since the 16th Century.
                                (turns from screen)
                        Not much evidence, Marcus.

                                        MARCUS
                        There's more. The pygmy was found
                        wearing an ornamental peach stone
                        around his neck...believed to come
                        from Sun Wu-Kung's legendary Garden
                        Of Immortal Peaches.

                                        INDIANA
                                (skeptical)
                        Marcus, there are countless
                        undiscovered African tribes...all
                        with various obscure beliefs and
                        practices...
                                (smirks)
                        One tribe may wear peach stones...
                        another may wear banana peels...

        Indiana WALKS back to his papers. Marcus PAUSES.

                                        MARCUS
                        There is one final bit of
                        evidence...

                                        INDIANA
                        Enlighten me.

                                        MARCUS
                        The pygmy is over 200 years old.

        Indiana ADJUSTS his spectacles. He STARES at the black and white
        image. The cute pygmy appears to be in his MID-TWENTIES. He walks to
        the CAMERA, STARING into the lens. Tyki examines the camera with
        CURIOSITY.

                        That's impossible.

                                        MARCUS
                        Dr. Clarke has done a considerable
                        amount of testing on the pygmy's
                        clothing...his sandals...everything
                        was over 200 years old.

                                        INDIANA
                                (skeptical)
                        He's probably wearing his Great
                        Grandfather's stuff.

        CAMERA PANS BACK to the projected image. Tyki begins to UNSCREW the
        camera lens. The picture goes OUT OF FOCUS. The film RUNS OUT. Marcus
        TURNS OFF the projector and flips ON the overhead room lights. Indiana
        gives Marcus a PUZZLED look.

                                        INDIANA
                        What does all of this have to do
                        with me?

                                        MARCUS
                        Dr. Clarke wants to mount an
                        expedition to find the Lost City of
                        Sun Wu-Kung. She is quite familiar
                        with your reputation...she'd like
                        you to come along.

                                        INDIANA
                                (gathering his papers)
                        No chance.

                                        MARCUS
                        There will be money involved... The
                        museum is willing to fund the
                        expedition...

                                        INDIANA
                        Sorry, Marcus. I've burned this
                        bridge.

        Indiana TURNS and begins to WALK out of the room. Marcus CALLS him.

                                        MARCUS
                        Indiana...

        Indy TURNS. He WAVES the papers at Marcus.

                                        INDIANA
                        Marcus. Please. I've got to finish
                        these...

                                        MARCUS
                        You've got to finish something much
                        more important. You crossed the
                        threshold over a decade ago...and
                        it's been tearing at your insides
                        ever since.
                                (passionate)
                        My friend, if there is even one iota
                        of truth in Dr. Clarke's findings...
                        then you can lift the veil of
                        mystery that has surrounded this
                        Chinese legend for Centuries. You
                        may uncover the secrets to a Lost
                        Civilization...and possibly, to
                        man's never ending search for
                        immortality.

        Indiana STARES at the painting of Sun Wu Kung.

                                        MARCUS
                        Indiana... Can you afford to pass up
                        the single most important adventure
                        of your life?

        Indiana has NO ANSWER for Marcus. Indy PICKS up the painting. A
        THRILLING expression slowly covers Indiana's face. His eyes GLIMMER.
        Filled with a long, lost EXCITEMENT. The SOUND TRACK MUSIC SOARS!

                                                                        CUT TO:

        CLOSE UP: THE STACK OF TERM PAPERS

        The papers are slightly CRUMPLED. Still WET. A DROP OF WATER hits the
        papers. CAMERA PANS UPWARD. BETSY TUFFET, Indy's student assistant,
        sits at the desk, grading the papers. She is CRYING. Her falling TEARS
        soak the papers. We are INSIDE of Indiana's apartment. LATER that
        evening.

        INDIANA stands in the background. He is hurriedly PACKING his bags.
        His familiar GUN, HAT and WHIP lie on the bed, beside the suitcase.
        Indy NOTICES that Betsy is crying. He WALKS to Betsy. Indy puts his
        arm on Betsy's shoulder, attempting to COMFORT her. Betsy SNAPS at
        Indy.

                                        BETSY
                        You can't do this to me!

                                        INDIANA
                                (shaking tears off the
                                papers)
                        C'mon, Betsy. Relax. You're gettin'
                        'em all wet again.

                                        BETSY
                        You just can't go away...I mean...
                        Africa is so far away, and...well...
                                (heartfelt)
                        I love you, Indy.

                                        INDIANA
                        Thought we agreed this was s'posed
                        to be casual...

                                        BETSY
                        You call what happened last night
                        "casual".

                                        INDIANA
                        My dear...a momentary lapse into
                        passion does not a love affair make.

                                        BETSY
                                (very upset)
                        Momentary lapse! So that's all I am
                        to you!

        Betsy SHOOTS to her feet, walking OFF SCREEN.

                                        INDIANA
                        Betsy... Wait...

        Indiana SIGHS. His eye CATCHES one of the termpapers. He begins to
        READ, making a few CORRECTIONS.

        We see Betsy's HAND removes Indiana's WHIP from the bed.

        Indiana continues to CORRECT the papers. Suddenly, there is a CREAKING
        NOISE. Indy TURNS. His face goes WHITE. He runs OFF SCREEN.

        One end of Indiana's WHIP is attached to an OVERHEAD LAMP. CAMERA PANS
        DOWN the whip. The other end has been formed into a NOOSE around
        Betsy's neck. Sbe stands on a wooden CHAIR. She KICKS AWAY the chair.
        Suddenly GAGGING. Indiana GRABS Betsy in midair. He TAKES the noose
        from her neck and PLACES Betsy on the floor.

                                        INDIANA
                                (angry)
                        Whatsa' matter with you!... Tryin'
                        to ruin my whip!...

                                        BETSY
                        If I can't have you... I don't want
                        to live.

        Indiana TOSSES the whip into his suitcase. He pulls up the chair and
        forces Betsy to be SEATED. He pours her a tall glass of BOURBON.

                                        INDIANA
                        Drink this. You'll feel better.

        Indiana WALKS to his suitcase, continuing to pack. His BACK is to
        Betsy. She raises the GLASS to her lips. She PAUSES, reading a MESSAGE
        on the Bourbon bottle. It reads: DANGER! CONTENTS FLAMMABLE! Betsy
        BEAMS. An IDEA. She LIFTS the bottle over her head and begins to DOUSE
        her body with the liquid.

        Indiana is BUSY folding his clothing. Suddenly, we hear the FLICK OF A
        MATCHSTICK! Indy TURNS. He sees the bourbon covered Betsy preparing to
        LIGHT HER BODY ON FIRE! Indy DASHES forward. He BLOWS OUT the match,
        moments before it SPARKS Betsy's clothing. Indy SHAKES Betsy by the
        shoulders.

                                        INDIANA
                        C'mon, Betsy... Get a hold of
                        yourself. You're young. There are a
                        lot of other guys...

                                        BETSY
                        Not like you.

                                        INDIANA
                                (succumbing to his ego)
                        That's true...
                                (realizing his mistake)
                        But that's no reason to stop living!
                        Besides, I'm too old for you. By the
                        time you're seventy five, I'll be...
                                (calculates, the thought
                                of it makes him grimace)
                        Yeccchhh! I'll be disgusting.

        Indiana TURNS and finishes his packing. Betsy SIGHS. She notices an
        enormous, STONE AFRICAN URN. The 150 POUND antique sits atop a section
        of BOOKSHELVES.

        Meanwhile, Indiana makes certain that his gun is PACKED. He places the
        familiar HAT on his head and begins to CLOSE the suitcase.

        CLOSE UP: THE AFRICAN URN. It is WOBBLING. SHAKING. Moving CLOSER and
        CLOSER to the edge of the bookshelves. CAMERA PANS TO THE FLOOR. Betsy
        LIES here. Directly BELOW the trembling urn. Betsy SHAKES the
        bookshelves, causing the urn to TILT and SHIVER. The urn is nearly
        HALFWAY OFF of the edge. If it falls...the urn will CRUSH Betsy's
        head.

        Indiana STRUGGLES with closing his tightly packed suitcase.

        The urn FALLS! HEADED STRAIGHT for Betsy! Indiana SUDDENLY GRABS the
        urn. In MIDAIR. Inches before it STRIKES Betsy. Indiana RESTS the urn
        on the floor. He HELPS Betsy to her feet. Betsy WRAPS her arms tightly
        around Indiana.

                                        BETSY
                        Don't leave me, Indy!

        Indiana PICKS UP his suitcase and tries to WALK to the door. But
        Betsy's arms are still TIGHTLY WRAPPED around him. Finally, Indy
        STOPS. His eyes BURN through Betsy.

                                        INDIANA
                                (cruel)
                        Look... You're just a flighty kid.
                        Twenty minutes after I walk out this
                        door, you'll have a date with the
                        college Romeo. Two hours from now,
                        you'll be madly in love with him. By
                        tomorrow, you'll forget I ever
                        existed.

        Hurt, Betsy REMOVES her arms from Indiana. He gives her a QUICK KISS
        to the cheek and hurriedly EXITS. Betsy GLARES at the closed door. A
        TOUGH, ANGRY expression covers her face.

                                        BETSY
                        Never underestimate the
                        determination of a Brooklyn girl,
                        Doctor Jones. Never.

                                                                        DISSOLVE TO:

        LONG SHOT - AN OCEAN LINER

        The SILHOUETTE of the ship sails across the water. A beautiful ORANGE
        SKY fills the background.

        INDIANA JONES

        stands aboard the ship's DECK. It is a typical, 30's LUXURY Ocean
        liner, filled with vacationing TOURISTS. Indiana STARES into the
        sunrise. His face is a study in CONCENTRATION and INTENSITY. He
        anxiously AWAITS his adventure.

                                                                        DISSOLVE TO:

        MAP OF THE WORLD

        A MOVING RED LINE traces Indiana's journey across the ocean, toward
        AFRICA. The red line comes to a stop at MOZAMBIQUE.

        EXT. CENTRAL MOZAMBIQUE - BEIRA - A HOT, SUNNY AFTERNOON

        Chief PORT on the coast. Gateway to the ZAMBESI RIVER. SUPPLY SHIPS,
        SAILBOATS and RAFTS line the marina. The docks are crowded with
        various MERCHANTS and SAILORS, unloading their goods. Small SHOPS and
        RESTAURANTS clutter the waterfront. Behind them are rows of one story,
        low square HOMES. Tall, healthy PALM TREES surround the Area.

        An OCEAN LINER has anchored along the shore. Several PASSENGERS exit
        from the ship. INDIANA steps onto the ocean liner's exit ramp. He is
        UNSHAVEN, wearing his traditional LEATHER JACKET and HAT. Indy LOOKS
        AROUND, expecting to MEET someone.

        INDY'S POV - THE DOCK

        There is a a LOUD CAR HORN. Crowds of pedestrians LEAP out of the way.
        A rusted, yellow MODEL-T barrels along the rickety dock. The word
        "TAXI" is crudely painted on the car's trembling doors. The car's
        tires are WOBBLING. LOOSE. Thick, black SMOKE pours from the cracked
        EXHAUST PIPE. The ancient car RATTLES and GRINDS.

        Upon seeing the car, Indiana SMILES.

        At the foot of the ocean liner's ramp, the car SCREECHES TO A STOP!

        SCRAGGY BRIER

        Indiana's friend and guide, JUMPS out of the taxi. Scraggy is a rough,
        unkempt AFRICAN MAN. An elderly fellow, with the ENERGY and VITALITY
        of a youth. His snow white hair and beard are WILD. SPIKED. He wears
        TATTERED, DIRTY clothes that are many sizes too large for his SKINNY
        body. Homemade CROCODILE SANDALS flop on his feet.

        Scraggy suddenly breaks into a WILD GRIN. He SPOTS Indiana. Scraggy
        SHOOTS up the exit ramp, running through the crowd of people. Scraggy
        stops a FEW FEET in front of Indiana. Scraggy WAVES his arms before
        him, as if he were BLESSING Indiana. Following this, Scraggy LEAPS
        into Indy's arms. Indiana CRADLES Scraggy like a child. Speaking with
        a Portugese accent, Scraggy EXCLAIMS...

                                        SCRAGGY
                        Indy! At last we are reunited!
                                (looks to sky)
                        Oh, Keechingo, God Of Friendship...I
                        thank you for granting my wish!

        Indy RESTS Scraggy back onto the ramp. Scraggy MOVES to assist Indiana
        with his luggage. Before picking it up, Scraggy RAISES his arms over
        the baggage. Again, he BLESSES the suitcases. Scraggy then PICKS UP
        the bags. Indy CHUCKLES.

                                        INDIANA
                        I see you haven't changed, Scraggy.

                                        SCRAGGY
                        Mahootmek, God Of Goodness, say...
                        "Before body make contact with
                        foreign object...one must cast out
                        bad spirits, or -- "

                                        INDIANA
                        " -- or bad spirits will enter your
                        body!"

                                        SCRAGGY
                        Yes! You have excellent memory,
                        Indy.

                                        INDIANA
                        I should! Last time we saw each
                        other...you made me wear the same
                        clothes for 3 weeks straight.

                                        SCRAGGY
                        Never separate body from clothes, or
                        bad spirits will hide in pockets!

                                        INDIANA
                        In other words... If people never
                        changed clothes...there would be no
                        evil in the world.

                                        SCRAGGY
                        Exactly!

                                        INDIANA
                                (chuckles, puts his arm
                                around Scraggy)
                        I missed all a' your crazy
                        philosophies, Scraggy.

                                        SCRAGGY
                        They not so crazy, Indy.
                                (serious, eyes wide with
                                fear)
                        These days... There is much evil in
                        the air. I feel it. Everywhere.

        Indy and Scraggy CONTINUE to walk down the ramp, moving OFF SCREEN.
        CAMERA PANS TO A FEW FEET BEHIND THEM. CAMERA STOPS, as the SCREEN IS
        FILLED WITH A LARGE, BLAZING RED SWASTIKA! CAMERA PANS UPWARD. We see
        that this is the SLEEVE OF A GERMAN SOLDIER. CAMERA STOPS on the face
        of

        SGT. HELMUT GUTTERBUHG

        A thin, skeletal NAZI. He resembles the ANGEL OF DEATH. Gutterbuhg's
        face is NARROW and SUNKEN. His deep set eyes are a frightening LIGHT
        BLUE. His complexion is PALE. EMOTIONLESS. His hair is BLONDE.
        STRINGY. His right arm appears RIGID. It rests STIFFLY at his side.

        Gutterbuhg FOLLOWS Indy and Scraggy through the crowd. The Nazi
        REMOVES something from his pocket. It is a tiny, MECHANICAL ITEM. It
        resembles a COCKROACH. We see that it is a mini RADIO TRANSMITTER.
        Gutterbuhg WHISPERS into it.

                                        GUTTERBUHG
                                (German, English
                                subtitles)
                        Are we making contact?

        The mechanical roach's eyes BLINK RED. Gutterbuhg gives a CHILLING
        SMILE.

        Meanwhile, Indiana and Scraggy ARRIVE at the Taxi. Scraggy begins to
        SECURE Indy's baggage to the roof. Indy OPENS the rear door of the
        cab. He begins to CLIMB into the back seat. He is met with a SWIFT
        KICK TO THE STOMACH! He FALLS to the ground. The wind KNOCKED out of
        him. Scraggy RUNS to the open door, scolding the person INSIDE.

                                        SCRAGGY
                        Dr. Clarke! Why you kick Dr.
                        Jones?...

        DR. CLARE CLARKE

        STEPS OUT of the shadows of the car. We RECOGNIZE her from Marcus'
        film, but she is even MORE BEAUTIFUL in person. She is the SAME AGE as
        Indy. Her hair is BRIGHT RED. She removes her glasses, revealing
        sparkling GREEN EYES. She is very PRIM. Very PROPER. But extremely
        INTELLIGENT and QUICK WITTED. She is dressed in KHAKI SLACKS and
        SHIRT. She speaks in a slight BRITISH ACCENT. She hurriedly ASSISTS
        Indiana to his feet.

                                        CLARE
                        Dr. Jones! Forgive me.

                                        INDIANA
                        No sweat.

                                        CLARE
                        Thought I was being attacked by a
                        degenerate sailor.

                                        INDIANA
                        No. Just a degenerate archeologist.

                                        CLARE
                        Your appearance is deceiving.

                                        INDIANA
                        Likewise.

        They exchange a handshake and a SMILE. Immediately ATTRACTED to each
        other.

                                        PORTER (O.S.)
                        Indiana Jones! Calling passenger
                        Indiana Jones!

        Indiana TURNS. A ship PORTER walks through the crowd, pushing a LARGE
        BARREL on a dolly. Indy WAVES to the Porter. The Porter STOPS in front
        of him.

                                        PORTER
                        You left this aboard ship.

                                        INDIANA
                                (puzzled)
                        There must be some mistake... I
                        didn't --

        The Porter POINTS to a section of the barrel that reads: DELIVER TO:
        DR. INDIANA JONES.

                                        PORTER
                        That's you, ain't it?

                                        INDIANA
                        Well, yeah...but...

        The Porter DROPS the barrel in front of Indiana and hurriedly WALKS
        back to the ship.

        SGT. GUTTERBUHG continues to SPY on Indiana. The Nazi HIDES a few feet
        away. In a DARK alleyway.

        A puzzled Indiana begins to OPEN the barrel. Scraggy SHOUTS a warning.

                                        SCRAGGY
                        Indy! Remember Mahootmek, God Of
                        Goodness! "Before body make contact
                        with foreign object -- "

        Indiana IGNORES Scraggy and begins to PRY OPEN the barrel.

                                        SCRAGGY
                        "...you must cast out bad spirits!"

        Indiana still IGNORES Scraggy. He STRUGGLES with the barrel top,
        FLIRTING with Clare.

                                        INDIANA
                        May I call you "Clare"?

                                        CLARE
                        Please.

                                        INDIANA
                        Well, Clare... We've obviously got a
                        lot of notes to compare... Let's get
                        started tonight...over dinner.

                                        CLARE
                        I'd like that very much.

                                        INDIANA
                        Friend of mine owns a Cafe... He'll
                        get us a nice quiet table. No
                        disturbances. Just the two of us --

        At that moment, the barrel lid FLIES OFF! The inside if FILLED with
        old, brown BANANA PEELS. Suddenly, BETSY'S HEAD POKES THROUGH the
        peels! Indiana is SHOCKED. Scraggy SIGHS.

                                        SCRAGGY
                        I warn you, Indy! You must always
                        cast out bad spirits!

        A dirty, unkempt Betsy LEAPS OUT OF THE BARREL! She THROWS her arms
        around Indy.

                                        BETSY
                        My precious!

                                        CLARE
                                (puzzled, to Indy)
                        Your daughter?

                                        INDIANA
                        My assistant.

                                        BETSY
                        His girlfriend.

                                        CLARE
                                (revolted)
                        A child!

                                        INDIANA
                                (to Clare)
                        It's nothing. Really.
                                (to Betsy)
                        What the hell are you doing here'?

                                        BETSY
                        Proving my love for you.

                                        CLARE
                        How terribly sordid.

                                        INDIANA
                                (to Clare)
                        Puppy love. Schoolgirl crush. She'll
                        get over it.

                                        BETSY
                        Never. This proves that nothing can
                        come between us. Not an ocean. Not
                        two separate Continents.

                                        CLARE
                        Think I'm going to be ill.

                                        INDIANA
                                (puzzled, to Betsy)
                        How...I mean... How could you stay
                        alive?

                                        BETSY
                        Hey... I'm from Brooklyn.

                                        INDIANA
                        But we'ye been sailing for three
                        weeks!

                                        BETSY
                        Stowed away in the banana barrel.
                        Ate my way to the bottom.

                                        CLARE
                                (nauseous)
                        Charming.

                                        BETSY
                                (pointing to Clare)
                        Hey, Indy... Who's the babe?

                                        CLARE
                        Your intellectual and emotional
                        superior.

                                        BETSY
                        Yeah...well you're gettin' on my
                        nerves, Miss... Miss...

                                        CLARE
                                (extends her hand)
                        "Doctor" Clare Clarke.

                                        BETSY
                                (reluctantly shaking
                                Clare's hand)
                        Betsy Tuffet...

                                        CLARE
                        As in curds and whey?

                                        BETSY
                                (getting tough)
                        Listen, sister... You better stay
                        away from Indy...

                                        CLARE
                        My dear, he has no interest in me.
                        I've already celebrated my tenth
                        Birthday.

        Indiana SHOOTS Clare an angry glance. Indy removes a wad of BILLS from
        his pocket. He GIVES them to Betsy.

                                        INDIANA
                        Look, Betsy... Why don't you get
                        back on the boat... This time, as a
                        passenger.

                                        SCRAGGY
                        Too late, Indy.

        Scraggy points toward the OCEAN LINER. The boat is SEVERAL FEET from
        shore. It SAILS back out to sea. Indiana STEAMS.

                                        INDIANA
                        When's the next one out?

                                        SCRAGGY
                        Two weeks.

        Indiana GRUMBLES. An amused Dr. Clarke gets back into the car. Indy
        SHOVES Betsy inside. He is FURIOUS.

        Before Indiana gets into the car, GUTTERBUHG steps out from the
        alleyway. He TOSSES the tiny mechanical COCKROACH at Indiana. The
        roach ATTACHES itself to Indy's TROUSER LEG. The tiny transmittor is
        very LIGHT. Indiana can feel NOTHING. He gets INTO the car. Scraggy
        BLESSES the Taxi and gets into the driver's seat.

        Gutterbuhg WATCHES as the battered Model-T DRIVES OFF. The NAZI turns,
        walking in an opposite direction. The CAMERA FOLLOWS Gutterbuhg, as he
        enters a SEEDY WATERFRONT HOTEL.

        INT. HOTEL

        Gutterbuhg walks through the DIMLY LIT lobby, filled with dusty, tacky
        African furnishings. He turns a corner, into a NARROW, decrepid
        hallway. He STOPS at the last DOORWAY. Room 113. He OPENS the door
        with a key and ENTERS.

        INT. ROOM

        A SMALL, MUSTY Hotel room. It is furnished with a SINGLE BED, A SOFA,
        TWO CHAIRS and A FIRE PLACE. Two BIZARRE AFRICAN STATUES adorn the
        fireplace mantle. Gutterbuhg carefully LOCKS the room door. He walks
        to the FIREPLACE. He TILTS one of the African statues forward. There
        is a mechanical, CREAKING SOUND. Suddenly, the SOFA BEGINS TO MOVE. It
        SLIDES a few feet, revealing an OPENING BENEATH THE FLOOR. A STAIRCASE
        leads into the opening. Gutterbuhg DESCENDS the stairs.

        INT. OPENING

        Gutterbuhg enters a LARGE, BRIGHTLY LIT ROOM. We are inside of A
        SECRET NAZI HEADQUARTERS. The room is filled with various
        COMMUNICATIONS EQUIPMENT and RADIO TRANSMITTERS. SEVERAL NAZI SOLDIERS
        are seated before the equipment, monitoring various radio signals. An
        enormous GLASS PANEL covers one wall. THROUGH THE PANEL WE SEE

        TWO SPEEDBOATS. LONG. SLEEK. HIGH POWERED. MAHOGANY HULLED. Both
        speedboats are adorned with a SWASTIKA. They FLOAT in water, in an
        UNDERGROUND, MAN-MADE CHAMBER. Directly BESIDE the speedboats, parked
        on a STONE INCLINE, are

        TWO AUTOMOBILES. The cars are enormous, beautiful "WOODIES". Equipped
        with a RUNNING BOARD and WOOD PANELLED SIDES. The cars GLISTEN. BRAND
        NEW.

        Gutterbuhg turns to KLAUS, a hulking Nazi who stands in the corner.
        Pointing to Klaus' FEET, Gutterbuhg SHOUTS an order to Klaus. CAMERA
        PANS to Klaus' feet. The Nazi's BOOT IS UNTIED. A LONG STRING dangles
        on the floor. The embarassed Klaus KNEELS and sloppily RE-TIES his
        shoe.

        Gutterbuhg turns to a Nazi who sits at a RADIO RECEIVER. The Nazi
        wears HEADPHONES, LISTENING for a transmission. THE LONG, FRIGHTENING
        SHADOW OF A MAN overcomes Gutterbuhg. He TURNS. FEAR covers
        Gutterbuhg's face. The shadow RAISES its arm. HEIL HITLER! Gutterbuhg
        also RAISES his right arm. But a BIZARRE, MECHANICAL SQUEAK, is caused
        by the movement of his arm.

        LIEUTENANT WERNER VON MEPEISTO

        stands BEFORE Gutterbuhg. Mephisto is a NAZI nightmare. His face is
        THICK and BULLISH. His bulging eyes are a reddish BROWN, giving him
        the appearance of a DEMON from hell. He has NO FACIAL HAIR. NO
        eyebrows. NO eyelashes. Completely BALD. His body is THICK. MUSCULAR.
        He is over SIX FEET TALL. He GLARES down at Gutterbuhg.

                                        MEPHISTO
                                (German, English
                                subtitles)
                        Were you successful?

        Gutterbuhg gives a TIMID NOD. With trembling fingers, he reaches over
        and TURNS UP THE VOLUME of the radio transmission. The voices of
        Indiana, Betsy, Clare and Scraggy echo through a TINNY SPEAKER.
        Mephisto manages a pleased GRUNT.

                                        MEPHISTO

                        Keep a record of everything that is
                        said.

        Gutterbuhg NUDGES the officer before him. The officer hurriedly begins
        to SCRAWL a manuscript of the radio transmission. Mephisto NODS.

                                        MEPHISTO
                                (German, English
                                subtitles)
                        Ever since our battle for the Lost
                        Ark... The feuhrer has been very
                        interested in the adventures of
                        Indiana Jones. Very interested.

                                                                        CUT TO:

        EXT. ZOOLOGICAL COMPOUND

        A miniature ZOO. The PEACEFUL compound is surrounded with small man
        made lakes and palm trees. There are countless METAL CAGES, filled
        with various ANIMALS. The TIGERS, LIONS, GORILLAS and other violent
        creatures, are kept BEHIND BARS. But the LLAMAS, GIRAFFES, DEER and
        various tame animals are FREE to roam the compound grounds.

        Indiana ENTERS with Clare, Betsy and Scraggy. The persistant Betsy is
        ANNOYING Indy. She attempts to SNUGGLE closer to him. Indiana PUSHES
        her away. Betsy TRIES to hold his hand. Indy SHAKES her loose. Scraggy
        WATCHES all of this, GIGGLING to himself.

        We hear SINGING. A high, pitched BEAUTIFUL VOICE. Clare walks to the
        far end of the compound, toward the SINGING. The others FOLLOW. Betsy
        walks by BONZO, A LARGE CHIMPANZEE. As Betsy PASSES, the chimp catches
        a FAMILIAR SMELL. Bonzo begins to FOLLOW Betsy.

        Clare OPENS the door of a large metal cage. Here, the singing is
        LOUDER. Clare ENTERS the cage. Indiana FOLLOWS. Scraggy BLESSES the
        cage, then enters. Betsy MOVES to go inside, but Bonzo's LARGE HAIRY
        HAND REACHES OUT and GRABS BETSY! PULLING the girl OFF SCREEN!

        INT. CAGE

        Filled with hand made wooden and bamboo FURNITURE. TYKI, the adorable
        PYGMY from Marcus' film, is INSIDE. Tyki is dressed only in a BELTED,
        leather loin cloth and SANDALS. He is perched on the floor, working on
        a large TAPESTRY. The tapestry depicts a colorful picture of CLOUDS.
        The buildings of a LARGE CITY are REFLECTED on the clouds. Tyki
        pleasantly SINGS as he does his work.

        Upon hearing the cage door OPEN, Tyki LOOKS UP. He SEES Clare. A
        JOYOUS SMILE covers his face. The pygmy RUNS to Clare, giving her a
        huge HUG and a KISS. Clare INTRODUCES Tyki to the others.

                                        CLARE
                        Tyki... This is Doctor Jones...

        Tyki EXTENDS his right hand. He SHAKES Indiana's hand. Indiana is
        CHARMED by the civilized display of friendship. Indy SMILES at Clare.

                                        INDIANA
                        He's a real gentleman.

                                        CLARE
                                (shrugs)
                        Just basic manners. What it takes
                        most men a lifetime to learn...
                        Tyki's accomplished in two weeks.
                                (introduces Scraggy)
                        This is our guide, Scraggy Brier...
                        and Miss Bets--

        Clare pauses, noticing that Betsy is MISSING. Clare suddenly breaks
        into a LAUGH! She points OFF SCREEN. Everyone TURNS.

        EXT. COMPOOND

        Bonzo is being extremely AFFECTIONATE toward Betsy. The chimpanzee
        PULLS and GRABS at Betsy. It is all VERY SIMILIAR to what Betsy has
        been doing to Indiana. Betsy WRESTLES with Bonzo, CALLING Indy for
        help.

        INT. CAGE

        Everyone CHUCKLES at Betsy's dillemma.

                                        CLARE
                        It appears that Bonzo is attracted
                        to Miss Tuffet's Derfume... Eau De
                        Banana Peel.

        Tyki has gone back to his ARTWORK. A FASCINATED Indiana looks over the
        pygmy's shoulder.

                                        INDIANA
                        Where did you find him?...

                                        CLARE
                        About ten miles from here. We were
                        on a photographic expedition...in
                        the thick of the jungle... I heard
                        sounds. Whimpering. Moaning. I took
                        a few steps, and found Tyki. He was
                        lying in a shallow swamp...semi
                        conscious...a high fever...nearly
                        dead from exhaustion. He had
                        obviously been travelling on foot
                        for many days, over countless
                        miles... So I brought him back to
                        the compound...nursed him back to
                        health...

        Indiana STARES at the pygmy. A skeptical look COVERS his face.

                                        INDIANA
                        Clare, I hate to quibble with your
                        anthropological abilities...

                                        CLARE
                        Quibble.

                                        INDIANA
                        ...but if this little fellow is over
                        200 years old... I mean... What
                        accounts for his youthful
                        appearance?...his vitality?...

        Clare OPENS a door at the rear of the cage. It LEADS into another
        room, directly behind the CAGE. Clare and Indiana ENTER. Scraggy STAYS
        behind. He EXCHANGES a friendly smile with Tyki. Meanwhile, in the
        BACKGROUND, we see BETSY and the CHIMPANZEE. They ROLL BY on the
        ground. Still WRESTLING.

        CLOSE UP: PEACE STONE.

        A FRUIT FLY crawls along the peach pit's surface.

                                        CLARE (O.S.)
                        Tyki was wearing this when I found
                        him.

        CAMERA PULLS BACK. We are in a SMALL, STERILE ROOM. The peach stone
        rests on a TABLE. Indiana and Clare STAND over the stone. Indy PICKS
        UP the stone, examining it. An annoying FRUIT FLY buzzes around Indy's
        head. CAMERA PANS DOWN to Indiana's trouser leg. The RADIO TRANSMITTOR
        is still attached to his pants. The tiny bug's eyes BLINK. RED.

                                                                        CUT TO:

        SGT. GUTTERBUHG.

        He stands inside of Nazi Headquarters, huddled over the RADIO. The
        VOICES of Indiana and Clare echo over the speaker. Gutterbuhg
        FURIOUSLY transcribes the conversation.

                                        CLARE (O.S.)
                        Dr. Jones, you are obviously
                        familiar with the legend of Sun Wu-
                        King's Garden of Immortal Peaches?...

                                        INDIANA (O.S.)
                        A bite from the fruit of that peach
                        tree would give a person eternal
                        life...make them forever young...

        The vicious Gutterbuhg SMILES. CAMERA PANS to his notebook. Gutterbuhg
        underlines the words "FOREVER YOUNG".

                                                                        CUT BACK TO:

        INDIANA

        STUDYING the peach pit. The fruit fly continues to BUZZ around
        Indiana's head.

                                        INDIANA
                        There's nothing unusual about this
                        ...nothing to indicate that it's
                        from Sun Wu Kung's garden...

        The fruit fly LANDS on Indiana's neck. Indy SMACKS the fly! KILLING
        it! A SHOCKED Clare RUNS to Indiana. She GRABS his hand and GENTLY
        removes what remains of the fruit fly. She GLARES at Indiana. FURIOUS.

                                        CLARE
                        This fruit fly had a normal life-
                        span of TWENTY FOUR HOURS.
                                (frustrated sigh)
                        As an experiment...the fly was put
                        in this room...alone...with only the
                        peach stone to sustain its
                        existence. The fly stayed alive for
                        THREE WEEKS.
                                (looks at dead fly)
                        Until now.

        She FLICKS the'fly against the wall. Indy gives an EMBARASSED SHRUG.

                                        INDIANA
                        Sorry.

        Indiana and Clare are suddenly INTERRUPTED by the sound of Scraggy and
        Tyki's LAUGHTER. This is followed by the two of them having a
        DISCUSSION! In Tyki's FOREIGN TONGUE! Clare and Indy exchange a
        SHOCKED GLANCE and DASH out of the room.

        INT. CAGE

        Scraggy and Tyki are having a CONVERSATION. Clare POINTS to Scraggy,
        giving a PUZZLED LOOK to Indiana.

                                        CLARE
                        He understands him?

                                        INDIANA
                                (nods)
                        Scraggy knows hundreds of
                        languages... He's the best guide in
                        Africa.
                                (turns to Scraggy)
                        Ask Tyki where he came from.

        Scraggy NODS and ASKS Tyki. Tyki ANSWERS and POINTS to the painting of
        the clouds. Scraggy TRANSLATES.

                                        SCRAGGY
                        He say... "I come from 'Land Of City
                        On Clouds'".

                                        INDIANA
                                (puzzled)
                        Huh?... What the hell's that s'posed
                        to mean?
                                (to Scraggy)
                        Can he take us there?

        Scraggy ASKS Tyki. Tyki ANSWERS. He and Scraggy LAUGH hysterically.
        Scraggy LOOKS at Indiana.

                                        SCRAGGY
                        He say if he could... He would go
                        back!

        Tyki OFFERS some more information to Scraggy. Scraggy TRANSLATES.

                                        SCRAGGY
                        He say "Pai Cho" may help you.

        Indiana's eyes WIDEN. STARTLED. AMAZED. Clare LOOKS at Indy. PUZZLED.

                                        CLARE
                        "Pai Cho"?

                                        INDIANA
                        The Sacres Proverbs and Writings of
                        Sun Wu Kung.
                                (anxious, looking at
                                Scraggy)
                        His disciples always carry the Pai
                        Cho with them...

        Scraggy ASKS Tyki. The pygmy NODS and REMOVES his belt. We see that
        the thick belt actually unravels into a CLOTH SCROLL. Tyki KISSES the
        scroll and GIVES it to Scraggy. Scraggy nervously OPENS the scroll. It
        is filled with countless ANCIENT CHINESE WRITINGS and PROVERBS.
        Indiana STARES over Scraggy's shoulder.

                                        INDIANA
                        Can you translate it?...

        Scraggy NODS. Indiana's eyes ANXIOUSLY scan the document. He is
        BREATHLESS. EXCITED. The SOUND TRACK MUSIC SOARS.

        Suddenly, BETSY AND THE CHIMPANZEE FALL INTO FRAME! ON TOP OF THE
        SCROLL! Bonzo STRADDLES Betsy, trying to move his lips TOWARD hers!
        She is SCREAMING!

                                        BETSY
                        Get...him...off...of...me...!

        Bonzo moves its lips to Betsy and gives her a BIG KISS! SMACK! Betsy
        GRIMACES. Finally, Clare begins to make BIZARRE MONKEY HAND MOTIONS
        and SOUNDS. Bonzo TURNS. He UNDERSTANDS Clare. She continues to
        COMMUNICATE with the chimp, until Bonzo turns and RUNS out of the
        cage! Indiana and Scraggy exchange an IMPRESSED GLANCE. Betsy WIPES
        the kiss from her lips.

                                                                        CUT TO:

        CLOSE UP: A FLASHING NEON SIGN.

        It reads: "DASHIELL'S AMERICAN BAR". It adorns the front of a stylish,
        Mozambique NIGHTCLUB.

        INT. DASHIELL'S BAR

        DIMLY lit. SMOKY. Filled with cloth covered TABLES and ornamental,
        AFRICAN furnishings. A 9 piece JAZZ BAND plays SWING TUNES. A few
        couples SWAY on the dance floor. The place is swarming with NAZIS.
        Many are SEATED at the bar. Others are scattered at various TABLES
        throughout the restaurant. Some stand in CORNERS. Lurking in the
        SHADOWS. They are all looking in one direction, watching one man...
        INDIANA JONES.

        Indy sits with Scraggy, Clare and Betsy, at a table near the REAR of
        the restaurant. They are eating DINNER. But Indy, Scraggy and Clare
        are more interested in the Stone Monkey SCROLLS. A very NERVOUS
        Scraggy TRANSLATES. Indiana, wearing his spectacles, takes pages and
        pages of NOTES. Searching for a CLUE. An INTERESTED Clare reads over
        Indiana's shoulder. Betsy tries to become INCLUDED in the discussion.
        But everyone IGNORES her. Scraggy continues to TRANSLATE.

                                        SCRAGGY
                        "Sun Wu Kung run like fire,
                        He journey to Many Monkey Land,
                        To build his final empire."

                                        BETSY
                        Who's Sun Wu-Kung?

                        Many Monkey Land... That's a
                        definite reference to Africa.

                                Indiana)
                        That confirms our suspicions that he
                        may have formed his Civilization
                        here...

                        doesn't concern you.

                                (insulted)
                        Fine. Terrific. Who cares about this
                        stuff anyway! We're in a nightclub.
                        We should be havin' fun.
                                (grabs Indiana's hand)
                        C'mon, Indy. Let's dance.

                                        INDIANA
                        Later.

                                        BETSY
                        What a buncha' stiffs!
                                (condescending, to
                                Clare)
                        Bet you can't dance.

                                        CLARE
                        Quite the contrary...I spent several
                        months studying dance.

                                        BETSY
                        Oh yeah? Whattayou' know?... The
                        Bunny Hop?... The Jitterbug?...

                                        CLARE
                                (shakes her head)
                        The Bondogea. The Kyebe Kyebe. The
                        Dungumaro.

                                        BETSY
                        Huh?

                                        CLARE
                        African Tribal dances.

                                        BETSY
                        Never heard of 'em.

                                        CLARE
                        Of course not. They're beyond the
                        spectrum of your microscopic world.

        Insulted, Betsy GOBBLES down her glass of wine and TURNS back to
        Indiana, who is still deeply CONCENTRATING on the scrolls.

        UNDER THE TABLE

        Betsy's FOOT reaches across the floor. It RESTS on Indy's leg. Betsy
        begins to RUB against Indiana's trouser leg. The red eyed MECHANICAL
        BUG is still attached to Indiana's trousers.

        INDIANA

        GLARES at Betsy. Clare REACHES for her cup of coffee. She NOTICES that
        the coffee cup trembles SLIGHTLY. Clare GLANCES beneath the table, and
        sees Betsy RUBBING Indy's leg. Clare is DISGUSTED.

        ABOVE the table, Clare shoots a scowl of DISAPPROVAL at Indy. A
        FLUSTERED Indy tries to explain...but is suddenly INTERRUPTED by a
        hand on his shoulder. It is DASHIELL, the suave, HANDSOME owner of the
        restaurant. Dashiell gives a CaARMING SMILE to everyone at the table.

                                        DASHIELL
                        Enjoying your dinners?...

        Everyone NODS, expressing their thanks. Dashiell LEANS close to
        Indiana and WHISPERS.

                                        DASHIELL
                        Watch yourself, sport. Most of the
                        talk here tonight is about you. And
                        it isn't good.

        Indiana's eyes DART around the room. He sees the VARIOUS NAZIS.
        WATCHING him. Indy gives a CONFIDENT SMILE. A WORRIED Dashiell
        continues WHISPERING to Indiana.

                                        DASHIELL
                        I don't know what you've done to the
                        Nazis. But they are certainly no
                        friends of yours.

                                                                        CUT TO:

        EXT. ZOOLOGICAL COMPOUND

        DARK. SILENT. Many of the animals are ASLEEP in their cages. A
        SECURITY GUARD keeps watch on the compound. He STANDS outside of the
        METAL GATES. There is a SUDDEN SOUND. The guard TURNS.

        THE FIGURES OF THREE MEN stand before him. In the SHADOWS. The NERVOUS
        Guard places a hand on his holster.

                                        GUARD
                        Who's there?...

        We hear a MECHANICAL CREAK. A MAN'S LEATHER GLOVED HAND extends from
        the shadows. The hand's FINGER is POINTED at the Security GUARD.

        CLOSE UP: VARIOUS ANIMALS

        The sound of RAPID MACHINE GUN FIRE echoes throughout the camp! CAMERA
        RECORDS the animal's SHOCKED REACTIONS!

        THE SECURITY GUARD

        lies on the GROUND. DEAD. His body riddled with BULLETS. The SHINY,
        BLACK BOOTS of the three men PASS his body. We notice that one of the
        boot's SHOELACES are untied.

        TYKI

        STARES into the dark night. FEAR covers his face. He is SEATED inside
        of his cage. A CANDLE flickers beside him. Tyki's hands REST on the
        beautiful tapestry. Tyki LISTENS. He hears FOOTSTEPS. COMING toward
        his cage. Tyki REACHES to his side. He grabs a STONE DAGGER.

        Suddenly, a LOOD GONSHOT! The SPLINTERED LOCK from Tyki's cage goes
        spinning across the floor. The cage door CREAKS OPEN.

        GUTTERBUHG stands in the doorway. TWO NAZI SOLDIERS, HELMUT and KLACE
        (who we met earlier), are beside him. Gutterbuhg SMILES. His stiff
        right arm EXTENDS from his side. His leather gloved INDEX FINGER is
        POINTING ahead.

        Tyki GROWLS at the Nazis. He STANDS. RAISING the stone dagger OVER HIS
        HEAD.

        Gutterbuhg's FINGER BEGINS TO RAPIDLY FIRE BULLETS! His MECHANICAL ARM
        is actually a A MACEINE GUN!

        The bullets TEAR through Tyki's tapestry. They make a crooked,
        tattered line through the BEAUTIFOL WORK. DESTROYING it. A terrified
        Tyki WATCHES.

        Gutterbuhg STOPS shooting. He REMOVES the empty cartridge from a SLOT
        in his mechanical arm, and REPLACES it with another. He points the
        DEADLY FINGER at Tyki. A trembling Tyki DROPS the dagger. The three
        NAZIS walk toward the helpless pygmy.

                                                                        CUT TO:

        INT. DASHIELL'S BAR

        Indiana, Scraggy and Clare CONTINUE to excitedly STUDY the map. A
        NEGLECTED Betsy POURS herself the last of the wine. She is very DRUNK,
        singing along with the band's version of Cole Porter's "Night and
        Day".

        BENEATH THE TABLE

        Betsy continues to RUB her FOOT against Indiana's leg.

        INDIANA

        tries to IGNORE Betsy's playing. Scraggy continues to TRANSLATE the
        scroll.

                                        SCRAGGY
                        "With his Golden Hooped Rod,
                        And its powerful lightning rays,
                        Sun Wu Kung build Water Curtain Cave,
                        Where he live for 500 days."

                                        CLARE
                        The Golden Hooped Rod?

                                        INDIANA
                        A heavenly staff with many different
                        powers...most notably, it had the
                        ability to transform itself into
                        hundreds of objects...
                                (staring)
                        It remains the most priceless
                        treasure of Sun Wu Kung's empire.

                                        CLARE
                        And what is the...the Water Curtain
                        Cave?

                                        INDIANA
                        Sun Wu Kung's legendary hideout...an
                        enormous secret cave, hidden behind
                        a running waterfall.

        Clare again REACHES for her coffee. The cup and saucer are still
        TREMBLING. Clare PEEKS under the table, and again SEES Betsy's foot
        RUBBING Indiana's leg. Clare gives a revolted GRUMBLE. Indiana
        EXCITEDLY explains Scraggy's translation.

                                        INDIANA
                        This proves that the Water Curtain
                        Cave exists in Africa...
                                (to Scraggy)
                        Does it mention anything about Sun
                        Wu Kung's travels?

                                        SCRAGGY
                                (reading scroll)
                        Only place called..."Twisted Snake
                        Water".

                                        INDIANA
                        The Zarnbesi River! It has a
                        reputation for its deadly water
                        snakes...

                                        CLARE
                        It would have been Sun Wu Kung's
                        logical path.

                                        INDIANA
                                (confident, anxious)
                        It will also be our logical path.

        Clare SMILES.

        BENEATH THE TABLE

        Betsy's foot CONTINUES to rub Indiana's leg. Finally Indy reaches
        down, trying to SLAP Betsy's foot away! But Indy's hand STUMBLES upon
        something else. The MECHANICAL BUG. Indy TRIES to remove the bug. But
        the tiny device WON'T BUDGE.

        ABOVE TABLE

        Indiana's hand is buried beneath the table, STRUGGLING to remove the
        bug. To Clare, it appears as if Indy is PLAYING with Betsy's foot.
        Clare gives an INCREDULOUS look to Indiana.

                                        CLARE
                        Please try to control that monstrous
                        libido of yours!

        Indiana finally REMOVES the mechanical bug. He LIFTS it above the
        table. EXAMINING it. Clare is about to ASK a question. Indy INDICATES
        for her to "Shhhh". He COVERS the bug and WHISPERS to the others.

                                        INDIANA
                        We have to get back to the compound.
                        Tyki may be in danger.

        Indiana, Clare and Scraggy HURRY from the table. A TIPSY Betsy
        Follows. Indiana passes the JAZZ BAND. He nonchalantly DROPS the
        mechanical bug into the trumpet player's HORN! The trumpet player
        hits a PIERCING HIGH NOTE!

                                                                        CUT T0:

        NAZI HEADQUARTERS

        The Nazi wearing the radio HEADPHONES emits a LOUD SCREAM! His
        eardrums BURSTING with the trumpet sound!

                                                                        CUT TO:

        INT. COMPOUND

        Gutterbuhg, Klaus and Helmut LEAD the bound and gagged Tyki OUT OF THE
        COMPOUND. They keep their LUGERS at his back. Suddenly, Klaus TRIPS
        over something. A FAWN. Klaus GROWLS. He SHOUTS a German order to
        Helmut, who GRABS a tight hold of the baby deer. Klaus AIMS his luger
        at the fawn's head. Gutterbuhg and Helmut exchange a chilling LAUGH.
        Tyki stares in HORROR. Klaus CLICKS the luger...ready to SHOOT...

        There is an earth shattering CRACK! A WHIP SHOOTS INTO FRAME! The whip
        WRAPS ITSELF around the luger! TEARING the gun OUT of Klaus' hand! The
        fawn breaks FREE and RUNS OFF. The Nazis exchange a SHOCKED glance.
        They TURN and SEE

        INDIANA JONES! He stands a FEW FEET away. Holding the WHIP. Indiana
        POINTS to Tyki, angrilly SHOUTING to the Nazis.

                                        INDIANA
                        Get your hands off him.

        Gutterbuhg LAUGES. He POINTS his finger at Indiana. Indy is PUZZLED.
        The finger begins to SHOOT! RAPID MACHINE GUN FIRE! Indy DIVES for
        cover.

        Holding Tyki CAPTIVE, the Nazis TURN and begin to RUN out of the
        compound. Indy gets to his FEET. He LIFTS his gun. Ready to SHOOT. But
        the Nazis are running behind SEVERAL ROWS OF CAGES, filled with
        ANIMALS. Indiana CAN'T SHOOT. He dashes back OUTSIDE.

        EXT. ZOOLOGICAL COMPOUND

        Located on the WATERFRONT. Countless rows of LONG, WOODEN DOCKS line
        the marina. The Nazis run to below a ROTTED, ANCIENT DOCK. Here, one
        of their SPEEDBOATS waits. Motor RUNNING. RUDOLPH, a pudgy Nazi, is at
        the wheel. The Nazis hurriedly CLIMB into the speedboat, PUSHING Tyki
        inside with them.

        Indy RUNS to Scraggy's Model-T. Scraggy SITS in the driver's seat.
        Betsy and Clare SIT in the rear. A drunk Betsy still sings "Night and
        Day". Indy leaps onto the SIDEBOARD. He SEES the Nazis ahead, CLIMBING
        into the speedboat. Indy motions for Scraggy to DRIVE. FAST. TOWARD
        the dock.

        The Nazi speedboat SHOOTS FORWARD. Moving BENEATH the dock.

        Scraggy's Model-T FOLLOWS ABOVE, along the SHAKY dock. Indiana RIDES
        the car's rusted sideboard. He SEES the speedboat below, through the
        WIDE OPENINGS in the dock's slated boards. Indy begins to SHOOT at the
        Nazis. Gutterbuhg raises his mechanical arm, FIRING SHOTS back at
        Indiana.

        Machine gun fire SPLINTERS the dock boards, SLICING through the
        Model-T. The side mirror is BLASTED to pieces. The floor beneath Betsy
        and Clare erupts with FLYING BULLETS. JUST MISSING the girls. Clare is
        HORRIFIED. Betsy laughs HYSTERICALLY.

        The Model-T is less than TWENTY FEET from the end of the dock. If they
        continue ahead, the car will PLUNGE SEVERAL FEET INTO THE WATER! But
        Scraggy doesn't take his FOOT from the gas.

        GUTTERBUHG smiles, seeing the vast ocean ahead. Knowing he's almost
        FREE.

        As he DODGES bullets, Indiana SEES the end of the dock ahead. He
        SHOUTS to Scraggy.

                                        INDIANA
                        When I tell you... Hit the brakes!

        Scraggy NODS. The end of the dock is only a FEW FEET ahead. Getting
        CLOSER... CLOSER... Clare COVERS her eyes. Between hiccups, Betsy
        laughingly SINGS. Indy LOOKS to the speedboat... BACK to the
        approaching dock edge... He PAUSES... WAITING for the right moment...
        He SCREAMS!

                                        INDIANA
                        Now, Scraggy!

        Scraggy's foot SLAMS ON THE BRAKES! The sudden jolt sends Indy FLYING
        INTO THE AIR!

        The speedboat SHOOTS OUT from beneath the dock! Indiana LANDS DIRECTLY
        ON TOP OF THE SPEEDBOAT! A SPECTACULAR STUNT!

        Helmut POINTS his gun at Indy. Indy reacts with a SWIFT KICK to
        Helmut's jaw. The Nazi HITS the deck. OUT COLD. Klaus COMES for Indy.
        They begin to FIGHT. An angry Gutterbuhg tries to SHOOT... But Indy
        and Klaus move TOO QUICKLY! Gutterbuhg CAN'T get a clear shot.

        The Model-T has COME TO A STOP. SAFE. Its front wheels TEETER over the
        dock's edge. Scraggy, Betsy and Clare GET OUT. Clare CATCHES her
        breath. Knees SHAKING. Betsy is still LAUGHING.

                                        BETSY
                        About time we had some fun!

        A WORRIED Scraggy sees Indiana, FIGHTING with the Nazis.

                                        SCRAGGY
                        Bad spirits have Indy! He in
                        trouble! Big trouble!

        Scraggy RUNS OFF SCREEN.

        The Nazi speedboat is HEADED TOWARD THE SIDE OF AN ENORMOUS OCEAN
        LINER! Gutterbuhg RADIOS for help. Indiana and Klaus continue to
        FIGHT. ROLLING along the deck. Exchanging PUNCHES. A bound Tyki
        watches with WIDE EYES. HELPLESS.

        The speedboat makes a sudden SHARP TURN. AVOIDING A COLLISION with the
        Ocean liner. Indiana and Klaus TUMBLE OFF, THE BOAT! INTO THE WATER!

        UNDERWATER

        Indiana and Klaus CONTINUE their battle. They wrestle only a few feet
        from the ship's large, SPINNING STEEL PROPELLERS. The propellers
        create a SUCTION FORCE. DRAWING Indy and Klaus CLOSER... CLOSER...
        toward a SPINNING DEATH.

        Indy and Klaus grab hold of a dangling, STEEL ANCHOR. PREVENTING their
        bodies from being sucked into the propellers. Klaus PULLS a
        switchblade from his pocket. He ATTACKS Indy's CLENCHED FINGERS with
        the knife. Indy begins to LOSE HIS GRIP. His body INCHES toward the
        propellers. Klaus RAISES the knife, to FINISH OFF Indiana...

        But Klaus' UNTIED SHOELACE dangles beside the propellers. The shoelace
        CATCHES a spinning blade. The SHOCKED Nazi is pulled INTO THE
        PROPELLERS!

        Indiana TURNS AWAY, holding TIGHTLY to the anchor. A BLOOD RED CLOUD
        surges through the surrounding water. Indiana CLIMBS the anchor to
        safety.

        ABOVE WATER

        Indiana SURFACES. Taking a GULP of air. Suddenly, the water in front
        of him erupts with MACHINE GUN FIRE. Indiana SEES

        GOTTERBUHG! He has PARKED the Nazi speedboat only a FEW FEET AWAY.
        Gutterbuhg SMILES, pointing his FINGER at the helpless Indiana. A
        SITTING DUCK. Gutterbuhg SMILES.

                                        GUTTERBUHG
                        Goodnight, Doctor Jones.

        There is a LOUD GUNSHOT! Gutterbuhg's mechanical arm is HIT BY A
        BULLET! Pieces of SPRING, METAL and SPROCKETS fly from the wound.
        Gutterbuhg TURNS. FURIOUS.

        DASHIELL, the nightclub owner, is a few feet away. He is driving a
        sleek SPEEDBOAT, its side adorned with the AMERICAN FLAG. Dashiell
        points a PISTOL at Gutterbuhg, ready to take ANOTHER SHOT...

        With a ROAR, The Nazi speedboat DRIVES AWAY! Toward a CLUSTER OF
        DOCKS! Indiana CLIMBS into Dashiell's speedboat.

                                        DASHIELL
                        Scraggy said you might be needing
                        some help, sport.

        Dashiell HITS the gas. TEARING after the Nazis.

        A FRENZIED, HIGH SPEED CHASE BEGINS! Through the DARKNESS. Beneath the
        ROWS OF DOCKS. The speedboats face countless OBSTACLES. They SWERVE
        around a virtual forest of wooden poles, which FLY BY AT BREAKNECK
        SPEED! The men DUCK and DODGE dangling FISH HOOKS and NETS. Many paths
        are BLOCKED by the wooden RAFTS and ROWBOATS. (NOTE: Because of the
        darkness, these obstacles APPEAR only when they are a FEW FEET AHEAD
        of the speedboats. This makes the chase completely SURPRISING and
        SCARY, causing a FUNHOUSE effect.)

        Throughout the chase, Indiana and the Nazis continue to exchange
        GUNFIRE. A frustrated Gutterbuhg CAN'T SHOOT. His mechanical-machine
        gun arm rendered USELESS by Dashiell's bullet. He continues to RADIO
        Nazi headquarters for help.

        Dashiell CATCHES UP with the Nazis. The two speedboats travel SIDE BY
        SIDE. Their edges SCRAPE together. SPARKS fly. The recovered Helmut
        AIMS his luger at Indiana... But Indy LEAPS toward the Nazi. The two
        FALL. ROLLING. TUMBLING. STRUGGLING for the gun. They fight BETWEEN
        the two speedboats. The crack below them slightly OPENING and CLOSING.

        Up ahead, an ENORMOUS STONE POLE appears. To AVOID a collision, the
        speedboats MUST SEPARATE. Dashiell SCREAMS.

                                        DASHIELL
                        Indy! Rollout!

        Indy FREES himself from Helmut and ROLLS back onto Dashiell's boat.
        Helmut LOOKS UP. He sees the stone pole AHEAD. COMING AT HIM. Helmut
        tries to MOVE...TOO LATE. The two boats SEPARATE. Helmut SMACKS into
        the pole! CRUSHED!

        Dashiell TURNS AWAY from the wheel, looking at Indiana.

                                        DASHIELL
                        You okay, sport?

        Indiana begins to answer...then sees SOMETHING. AHEAD. He SCREAMS.

                                        INDIANA
                        Dash!...

        Dashiell TURNS BACK. The speedboat is HEADED STRAIGHT FOR A SOLID
        WOODEN WALL! A sign on the wall reads: FUTTERMAN'S FISHING WAREHOUSE.

        The Nazi speedboat has already made a SHARP TURN, AVOIDING the
        warehouse. There's NO TIME for Dashiell to TURN. Indy HITS the deck.
        The speedboat ARCHES upward, at an ANGLE... CRASH! The speedboat
        BLASTS into the warehouse. Splintered wood SPLATTERS through the air.

        INT. WAREHOUSE

        Dashiell's speedboat BURSTS through another wall. The boat SKIDS
        across the warehouse floor. SCREECHING TO A STOP! A SHAKEN Dashiell
        gets out. Indy RUNS to the window.

        INDIANA'S POV

        The NAZI SPEEDBOAT shoots out of the docks, ESCAPING across the water.

        Indiana grabs his WHIP. He KICKS OPEN the warehouse window. He SNAPS
        his wrist. CRACK. The whip SHOOTS forward, ATTACHING ITSELF TO THE
        REAR OF THE NAZI SPEEDBOAT! Indy firmly GRIPS his end of the whip. The
        whip TIGHTENS. WHOOSH! Indiana is PULLED out of the window.

        Gutterbuhg exchanges a VICTORIOUS laugh with Rudolph, the speedboat
        driver, thinking they have LOST Indiana. A frightened Tyki LOOKS BACK.
        His eyes suddenly fill with HOPE. Gutterbuhg TURNS. His mouth DROPS
        OPEN.

        Indiana uses his WHIP to WATER SKI BEHIND THE NAZI SPEEDBOAT! A red
        faced Gutterbuhg SLAMS his fist on the dashboard. He removes a SHARP
        KNIFE. He hurriedly begins to SLICE through Indy's whip. Trying to
        BREAK THE CONNECTION.

        Indiana AIMS his pistol at Gutterbuhg. But suddenly, a SHOT WHIZZES by
        Indy's head. Followed by ANOTHER. And ANOTHER. COMING from behind.
        Indy TURNS. A SECOND NAZI SPEEDBOAT is in HOT PURSUIT! There are FIVE
        NAZIS inside. Armed with PISTOLS and RIFLES. All FIRING SHOTS at
        Indiana.

        Meanwhile, Gutterbuhg's knife continues to SLICE through Indy's whip.
        Only a FEW THREADS remain.

        Indiana performs some EXPERT WATER SKIING. SWERVING. SPINNING.
        JUMPING. All in an attempt to AVOID the flying bullets from behind.
        Suddenly, Indy's whip SNAPS! Indiana FALLS UNDERWATER! Directly IN THE
        PATH of the seccnd Nazi speedboat!

        Tyki HIDES his eyes. Gutterbuhg LAUGHS. It appears that Indiana has
        met a GRISLY DEATH.

        The Nazis in the second speedboat are DELIGHTED. SHAKING each other's
        hands. CAMERA PANS TO BELOW the speedboat. We move UNDERWATER. SOUND
        TRACK MUSIC SOARS! We see INDIANA. Very much ALIVE. He STRADDLES THE
        BOTTOM OF THE SPEEDING BOAT! HOLDING ON with all of his strength!
        Indiana CLIMBS toward the side of the speedboat, BATTLING the pressure
        of the rushing water.

        CAMERA FOLLOWS INDIANA, OUT OF THE WATER, AS HE CLIMBS ABOARD THE
        SECOND SPEEDBOAT. The four Nazis are LAUGHING. TALKING. Their backs
        turned to the APPROACHING Indiana. Moving like LIGHTNING, Indy GRABS
        one of the Nazis and TOSSES HIM OVERBOARD. With a SWIFT PUNCH to the
        stomach and jaw, Indy sends another Nazi INTO THE WATER. The other two
        Nazis TACKLE Indy. They FALL to the deck. FIGHTING.

        Gutterbuhg LOOKS BACK. SHOCKED that Indy is still alive. Gutterbuhg
        GROWLS. FRUSTRATED. His eyes suddenly LIGHT. He SPOTS something.
        AHEAD.

        TWO GARGANTUAN OCEAN LINERS

        are MOVING TOWARD EACH OTHER. Coming TOGETHER. There is an OPENING
        between the two ships, that continues to get SMALLER, as the ships
        move CLOSER.

        Gutterbuhg SMILES. An IDEA. He orders Rudolph to DRIVE THROUGH THE
        OPENING.

        In the second speedboat, the Nazis have OVERCOME Indiana. One Nazi
        PINS Indy down. The other removes a THICK METAL CHAIN from his neck. A
        RED SWASTIKA dangles from the chain. The Nazi WRAPS the chain around
        Indy's neck. He begins to STRANGLE Indiana.

        Gutterbuhg's speedboat MOVES TOWARD the ocean liners. The opening
        between the two ships continues to SHRINK. Getting SMALLER...and
        SMALLER...

        The second speedboat is DIRECTLY BEHIND Gutterbuhg. The Nazis are
        STRANGLING Indiana. The color begins to LEAVE Indy's face. He GASPS
        for air.

        The opening between the two Ocean liners continues to get SMALLER...
        Less than TEN FEET WIDE. Gutterbuhg's speedboat is only a FEW FEET
        AWAY.

        Through his fluttering eyes, Indiana SEES Gutterbuhg's speedboat
        headed for the ocean liners. Indiana is nearly UNCONSCIOUS. The
        giggling Nazis TIGHTEN the chain around his neck.

        With LESS THAN AN INCH to spare... Gutterbuhg's speedboat SQUEEZES
        between the two Ocean Liners!

        The second speedboat is only a FEW FEET from the Ocean Liners. But as
        the ships move CLOSER...the opening is nearly CLOSED. The driver CAN'T
        TURN AWAY. He's TOO CLOSE. He emits a SCREAM. The Nazis PAUSE from
        strangling Indiana. They TURN.

        Indy MOVES FAST. He DIVES overboard. INTO THE WATER.

        The speedboat HITS the opening. TOO SMALL. The speedboat is CRUSHED
        between the two Ocean Liners. The Nazis let out their FINAL SCREAMS.
        Followed by a fiery EXPLOSION! Flaming pieces of the wreckage are
        SPLATTERED through the night sky.

        GOTTERBUHG turns. His grinning, sadistic face LIT by the explosion.
        Tyki's eyes are filled with FEAR.

        SEVERAL FEET AWAY, Indiana Jones SURFACES. ALIVE. He SWIMS to the
        nearby shore and CLIMBS out of the water. He RUBS his reddened neck,
        catches his breath and LOOKS into the distance. Indy SEES Gutterbuhg's
        speedboat. TOO FAR to catch.

        GUTTERBUHG sees the SILHOUETTE of Indy, standing on the distant shore.
        Gutterbuhg orders the driver to move FASTER. The engine ROARS.
        Gutterbuhg LOOKS back at Indy. The Nazi emits a MANIACAL LAUGH that
        pierces the air.

        Indiana watches the speedboat ESCAPE into the night. His eyes fill
        with RAGE. VENGEANCE. Clare, Scraggy and a VERY DRUNK Betsy JOIN Indy
        on the shore. Betsy PUTS her arms around Indiana. She RESTS her head
        on his shoulder. She CLOSES her eyes and emits a DRUNKEN SIGH.

                                        BETSY
                        What a romantic night!

        An ANNOYED Indy pushes Betsy away. In a drunken stupor, Betsy moves to
        the next person, CLARE. Thinking she's still with Indiana, Betsy puts
        her arms AROUND Clare. A WORRIED Clare is TOO CONCERNED with the
        departing Nazi speedboat. Clare TURNS to Inqy.

                                        CLARE
                        Will they hurt Tyki?

                                        INDIANA
                                (shaking his head)
                        They know he's important to us.
                                (holds up ancient
                                scroll)
                        They'll use him to bargain for this.

        Eyes CLOSED, resting her head on Clare's shoulder, Betsy SIGHS.

                                        BETSY
                        Indy, you smell so good! So
                        masculine!

        Clare PUSHES Betsy away. Betsy SPINS and WRAPS HER ARMS around
        Scraggy. Clare watches the Nazi Speedboat DISAPPEAR into the night.

                                        CLARE
                        Will they be following us?

                                        INDIANA
                        Every step of the way.

        Betsy, still thinking she's SNUGGLING with Indiana, rubs her face
        against Scraggy's bristly beard.

                                        BETSY
                        Mmmm, Indy. I love it when you don't
                        shave. It's so sexy!

        Scraggy PUSHES Betsy away. She SPINS, this time putting her arms
        around a hanging FISHERMAN'S NET. Filled with FISH. Meanwhile, Scraggy
        LOOKS at Indiana and Clare.

                                        SCRAGGY
                        Pandoola, God of Purity, say...
                        "Always stay ten paces ahead of bad
                        spirit".

                                        INDIANA
                        Exactly. We can't let the Nazis get
                        to the City first. If they do,
                        they'll wipe out one of the greatest
                        archeological finds in History!

        Indiana turns and WALKS AWAY. Clare and Scraggy hurriedly FOLLOW.
        There's NO TIME to lose. The drunken Betsy continues to embrace the
        net of DEAD FISH. Betsy TURNS. Eyes CLOSED. She SMILES.

                                        BETSY
                        How 'bout a little goodnight kiss?

        Betsy KISSES the LIPS OF A DEAD FISH! She SMILES. IMPRESSED.

                                        BETSY
                        Mmmmm, Indy...you really know the
                        way to a girl's heart!

        Betsy OPENS her eyes. FACE TO FACE with the dead fish. Betsy SCREAMS
        and RUNS toward the departing Indiana, Clare and Scraggy!

        EXT. ZAMBESI RIVER - THE FOLLOWING DAY

        Early MORNING. The sparkling waters of the Zambesi are lined by thick
        JUNGLE. Sounds of screeching GIBBONS, exotic BIRDS, chattering
        INSECTS, and various other WILDLIFE echo from the jungle. BRIGHT RAYS
        of HOT sunlight sprinkle through the leaves of the towering palm
        trees.

        A 55 foot, tattered, wooden RIVER BOAT, the "ADOBO", travels along the
        Zambesi. The boat is filled with various crates and barrels of
        SUPPLIES. And there are several men, CREW MEMBERS, all natives of
        Mozambique. They are a MOTLEY crew, all armed with SWORDS and DAGGERS.
        They are DIRTY. TATTERED. UNKEMPT. The boat pulls a long, WOODEN RAFT
        behind it. Scraggy's MODEL-T is attached to the raft. One of the crew
        members, a YOUNG MAN, sits on the raft. He strums a BEATEN GUITAR,
        singing a FOLK SONG.

        INDIANA stands at the ship's steering wheel. Forehead COVERED with
        sweat. He GUIDES the ship along the twisting waters. CLARE exits from
        a cabin, carrying a stenographer's NOTEBOOK. She looks RADIANT. Her
        red hair SHIMMERS in the morning sun. Clare walks up BESIDE Indy. She
        CRINKLES her nose.

                                        CLARE
                        What is that awful aroma?

                                        INDIANA
                        Scraggy's takin' a shower.

        Indy points OFF SCREEN. Scraggy, fully clothed, STANDS here. He rubs a
        large, FRESH ONION over his FACE, ARMS and LEGS. SQUEEZING the onion
        JUICE over his body. Indiana EXPLAINS to a befuddled Clare.

                                        INDIANA
                        He believes that onions keep bad
                        spirits from entering his body.

                                        CLARE
                                (writing in her
                                notebook)
                        In all my years of anthropology...
                        I've never run across anyone or
                        anything quite like Scraggy.

                                        INDIANA
                                (chuckles)
                        He's a rare breed.
                                (turns, looks at Clare
                                for the first time)
                        You're looking very lovely.

                                        CLARE
                        You're looking very lecherous.

                                        INDIANA
                                (turns away, angry)
                        Just tryin' to be friendly.

                                        CLARE
                        Save it for the schoolgirls.

                                        INDIANA
                        Look, Clare... Betsy's just an
                        anxious archeology student...she
                        admires my work...
                                (egotistical shrug)
                        Who can blame her?...
                                (back to his point)
                        But it's just some kinda' hero
                        worship thing...

        There was never any romance.

                                        BETSY
                                (pops in from OFF
                                SCREEN, kisses Indiana)
                        I dreamed about our first night
                        together!

        Indy SIGHS. Clare DISGUSTINGLY shakes her head. She continues to
        scrawl more into her notebook. Indiana gives her a STARTLED look.

                                        INDIANA
                        You're writin' this down?...

                                        CLARE
                                (nods)
                        I'm keeping an accurate record of
                        our journey.

                                        INDIANA
                        What's that got to do with my
                        personal life?

                                        CLARE
                        Evidence. I plan on testifying at
                        your child molestation trial.

        Indiana SHAKES his head. STARING into the distance. He SIGHS.

                                        INDIANA
                        Why do I do this to myself?

        Holding her head in PAIN, Betsy turns to Clare.

                                        BETSY
                                (holds her head in pain,
                                to Clare)
                        Hey, lady...you're s'posed to be a
                        Doctor...you got any cures for a
                        hangover?...

                                        CLARE
                        The best I've heard was used by a
                        New Zealand Tribe...
                                (pauses, thinking)
                        One part crushed owl skull...two
                        parts rhino saliva...one part zebra
                        dandruff.

        Betsy's face becomes PALE. Indy INTERRUPTS.

                                        INDIANA
                        No, No... Get a cup of donkey sweat
                        ...two spoons of skunk hair...and
                        one pint of shredded lizard tongue.

        Betsy turns a light shade of GREEN. Scraggy ARGUES.

                                        SCRAGGY
                        I always use family cure! Two spoons
                        chopped leeches... Half cup horse
                        mucous...two quarts crocodile urine!

                                        BETSY
                                (ready to throw up)
                        Ex...cuse...me...!

        Betsy runs OFF SCREEN. The others exchange a SHRUG. Scraggy LOOKS at
        the river ahead.

                                        SCRAGGY
                        How far we travel, Indy?...

                                        INDIANA
                        Almost 20 miles.

                                        CLARE
                        Any sign of the Nazis?

                                        INDIANA
                                (shakes his head,
                                confident)
                        Long as we keep up this pace...
                        they'll have trouble tracking us.

        CAMERA PANS from the hopeful faces of Indiana, Scraggy and Clare, to
        the CABIN behind them. Here, a CREW MEMBER HIDES in the shadows. His
        face HIDDEN. He HOLDS a small radio receiver. He WHISPERS into the
        receiver. Speaking in perfect GERMAN.

                                                                        CUT TO:

        GUTTERBUBG.

        He is seated in NAZI HEADQUARTERS. He repairs his detached, MACHINE
        GUN ARM, which sits on the table before him. Behind Gutterbuhg, a
        GROUP OF NAZIS listen to the radio transmission of Scraggy's
        treacherous Crew Member, who discloses the LOCATION of the River Boat.
        The Nazis CHART out the boat's exact location on a large, WALL MAP.
        LIEUT. MEPHISTO supervises the project. Tyki, BOUND, GAGGED and
        BRUISED, watches from a corner. MEPHISTO looks at all the Nazis.

                                        MEPHISTO
                                (German, English
                                subtitles)
                        We must leave. Immediately.

                                                                        DISSOLVE TO:

        NIGHT IN THE JUNGLE.

        VARIOUS SHOTS of exotic animals. A creeping PANTHER. A sleeping WHITE
        BAT. A tense SCORPION. A family of CROCODILES.

        ABOARD SHIP

        Indiana, Scraggy, Clare and Betsy are GATHERED on the deck. Seated in
        a CIRCLE. They are surrounded by the CREW MEMBERS. Everyone eats their
        DINNER from tin cans. The surrounding lanterns cast an EERIE LIGHT on
        the area. The young crew member plays a soft, SPOOKY tune on his
        guitar. Betsy is RESTLESS. She GLARES at the guitar player.

                                        BETSY
                        Don't you know somethin' else?
                        Somethin' upbeat?...

        The guitar player IGNORES Betsy, continuing to play. Betsy SIGHS.
        UPSET. BORED.

                                        BETSY
                        It's so hot... Stuffy... Do we have
                        to stay on this stupid boat all
                        night?...

                                        INDIANA
                                (nods)
                        We have to keep moving.

                                        BETSY
                        Can we at least jump in the
                        water?... Go for a swim?...

                                        CLARE
                        There's an old legend about the
                        Zambesi... In ancient times,
                        criminals were given their choice of
                        execution...or swimming across the
                        Zambesi. Most chose execution.

                                        INDIANA
                        Clare's right. We'll be safer on the
                        boat.
                                (annoyed, to Betsy)
                        Now quit moanin' and eat your food.

        An angry Betsy TOSSES her tin can overboard. She STANDS. FURIOUS with
        Indiana.

                                        BETSY
                        You are so rude! I travel thousands
                        of miles just to be with you...and
                        everybody treats me like dirt!
                                (to Clare)
                        Nobody even talks to me without
                        making some condescending remark
                        they think I'm too stupid to
                        understand!
                                (very upset)
                        So maybe I don't know a lot about
                        weird tribal dances... I'm still
                        pretty good with anthropology and
                        archeology... Maybe I could even
                        help you out...if somebody gave me a
                        chance...clued me in to what it is
                        we're doin' here...
                                (to Indy)
                        'Cause whether you like it or not,
                        Indiana Jones... I'm part of this
                        expedition, too!

        Clare RAISES an eyebrow. IMPRESSED. Indiana says NOTHING. He can't
        ARGUE. Scraggy INTERJECTS.

                                        SCRAGGY
                                (motions to crew
                                members)
                        My friends also curious about where
                        we journey to, Indy.

        The crew members NOD. STARING at Indiana. Indiana turns to Clare. She
        SMILES.

                                        CLARE
                        Tell us all a bedtime story, Doctor
                        Jones.

        Indiana SIGHS. The crew member's GUITAR PLAYING COMBINES with the
        SOUND TRACK, backing up Indiana's story with an EERIE TUNE.

                                        INDIANA
                        Long ago...a place known as the
                        Flower Fruit Mountain, in the
                        Chinese province of Ao-Lai...was
                        struck by lightning. A Stone Monkey,
                        "Sun Wu-Kung", was born.

                                        SCRAGGY
                        This monkey?... He could walk?...
                        Talk?... Like human?...

                                        INDIANA
                        More than human. He was blessed with
                        countless heavenly powers... But it
                        wasn't enough. Sun Wu-Kung wanted to
                        learn the secret of Eternal Life...
                        of Immortality...
                                (pause)
                        Equipped with his Golden Hooped Rod
                        to protect him, Sun Wu Kung
                        travelled the world for many years
                        ...learning the secret philosophies
                        and teachings of Eternal Youth.
                        Eventually, he was granted entrance
                        to heaven...where the Jade Emperor
                        gave Sun Wu Kung the title of "Great
                        Sage of the Heavens"...and permitted
                        him to oversee the Garden of
                        Immortal Peaches.
                                (pause)
                        After several years, the stone
                        monkey returned to somewhere on
                        earth. Here, he ruled an empire...a
                        Civilization of Monkeys and humans
                        who had life spans of many hundred
                        years...
                                (shrugs)
                        The exact whereabouts of that Lost
                        City has been a mystery for hundreds
                        of years...until Doctor Clarke
                        discovered the pygmy.

        The crew members, Scraggy, Betsy and Clare, listen with FASCINATION.

                                        INDIANA
                        It's uncertain just how much of this
                        legend is based in reality...
                        Nevertheless, we're hoping to find
                        some sign of the Lost Civilization.

                                        BETSY
                        What about Sun Wu Kung?...

                                        INDIANA
                        Whatever he was...a stone idol...an
                        actual monkey...a human being...is
                        unknown. But he is one of the most
                        influentual religious figures in
                        History, and his remains are most
                        likely somewhere in the Lost City.

        Suddenly, they are INTERRUPTED BY A DISTANT SOUND. A LOW, RUMBLING
        SOUND. BIZARRE. UNEARTHLY. UNLIKE anything we've heard before. Indiana
        TURNS to Scraggy.

                                        INDIANA
                        Sound familiar?

                                        SCRAGGY
                                (shakes his head)
                        It is far, far away...many miles...

                                        BETSY
                                (frightened)
                        What is it?... Some kinda' weird
                        animal?...

                                        CLARE
                        No animal sounds like that.

                                        SCRAGGY
                        Could be "Banseebaba".

                                        CLARE
                        Banseebaba?

                                        SCRAGGY
                        Banseebaba is giant demon from hell.
                        He is 50 feet tall. Breathes fire.
                        Make sound like human never hear
                        before. He is made up of all evil in
                        the world!

                                        CLARE
                        Cheery thought.

        The sound suddenly STOPS. Everyone exchanges a FRIGHTENED, TERRIFIED
        GLANCE. Indiana STANDS.

                                        INDIANA
                        Whatever the hell it is... It went
                        to sleep for the night. Which is
                        what we should do.

                                                                        CUT TO:

        LATER THAT NIGHT - LONG SHOT - THE BOAT

        The boat sails along the RIVER. Beneath the MOONLIGHT. A lone CREW
        MEMBER stays awake. At the STEERING WHEEL. Other CREW MEMBERS sleep
        along the deck. Scraggy SLEEPS in a hanging cot.

        INDIANA

        is ASLEEP in his CABIN. Suddenly, the door SLOWLY CREAKS OPEN. A
        SHADOW appears on the cabin wall. COMING TOWARD Indiana. The shadow
        EXTENDS a hand. The hand GRABS Indy's blanket. Indy WAKES. He LEAPS
        out of bed and TACKLES the mysterious person. Indy FLIPS on the cabin
        lamp. The intruder is none other than...BETSY. Indiana PULLS Betsy to
        her feet. She gives a flirtatious SMILE.

                                        BETSY
                        Couldn't sleep. The heat. I'm in the
                        mood for passion.

                                        INDIANA
                        I'm in the mood for isolation.

        Indiana LEADS Betsy to the open door. He begins to PUSH her back
        outside. Betsy STOPS him.

                                        BETSY
                        I'm not leaving. Not till I get a
                        kiss.

                                        INDIANA
                        Betsy...

                                        BETSY
                                (serious)
                        One kiss. Or I'll scream. I swear.
                        I'll wake the whole boat.

        Indiana has NO CHOICE. He SIGHS.

                                        INDIANA
                        OKay. Just one.
                                (leans toward her,
                                pauses)
                        Keep your mouth closed.

        They KISS. Betsy WRAPS her arms around Indiana, turning it into a
        PASSIONATE KISS.

        At that moment, ACROSS THE HALL, Clare exits the bathroom, TOOTHBRUSH
        in hand. She SEES the kissing Indiana and Betty. Clare STARES. OPEN
        MOUTHED. SHOCKED. Indiana OPENS his eyes. He SEES Clare WATCHING HIM.
        An ANGRY Clare MARCHES into her room. She SLAMS the door. WE HEAR
        Clare LOCKING the door behind her, and moving a piece of furniture in
        front of the door. Indiana PUSHES Betsy away. ANGRY. He quickly CLOSES
        his door. Betsy WALKS back to her room. A huge, SATISFIED SMILE covers
        her face.

        THE FOLLOWING MORNING

        SUNRISE. PEACEFUL. CALM. Birds SING. The River Boat has travelled
        countless miles, into the heart of the ZAMBESI. A tired CREW MEMBER
        mans the boat's steering wheel. CAMERA PANS DOWN, moving along the
        side of the boat. WE STOP AT WATER LEVEL. A HAND SHOOTS OUT OF THE
        WATER. GRIPPING a rusted, sharp KNIFE. Followed by ANOTHER HAND. And
        ANOTHER. And ANOTHER. Until there are COUNTLESS HANDS, REACHING FOR
        THE SIDE OF THE RIVER BOAT. The hands GRAB HOLD of the boat. SEVERAL
        DARK FIGURES slowly RISE out of the water. Only the OUTLINES of their
        bodies are VISIBLE, backlit by the RISING SUN. The figures CLIMB UP
        the side of the boat. Carefully CREEPING. Moving SILENTLY.

        Indiana stands on the REAR DECK, shirt WRAPPED around his waist. He is
        SHAVING. CLARE sits a few feet away. WRITING in her journal. Indy
        GLANCES to her. CURIOUS.

                                        INDIANA
                        What's that you're writing?...

                                        CLARE
                        "The Erotic Adventures Of Indiana
                        Jones, Professor Of Perversity".

                                        INDIANA
                                (back to shaving)
                        Very funny.

        CAMERA PANS TO THE FRONT DECK. STOPPING on the DRIVER. He STARES
        ahead. STEERING the ship. SUDDENLY, A FIGURE APPEARS. BEHIND the
        driver. The figure GRABS the driver. AROUND THE NECK. Before the
        driver can SCREAM...the figure SLICES HIS THROAT.

        Scraggy WITNESSES this. Through an OPEN PORTHOLE. His face covered
        with SHOCK. FEAR.

        INT. LOWER CABIN - KITCHEN

        Betsy stands over a large SKILLET. She FRIES pancakes, LIFTING the
        first pancake, Betsy places it on a PLATE that rests beside her. Betsy
        TURNS to get another pancake. A HAND REACHES FROM OFF SCREEN. The hand
        GRABS the pancake from the plate. Betsy TURNS back. She sees the EMPTY
        PLATE. She is PUZZLED. CONFUSED. She SHRUGS, placing ANOTHER PANCAKE
        on the plate. She TURNS back to the skillet. Again, a hand GRABS the
        pancake. Betsy turns and again sees an EMPTY PLATE. She hears
        GIGGLING. BEHIND her. She turns and SEES

        AN ORIENTAL PIRATE. TALL. MUSCULAR. The Pirate TOWERS above Betsy. He
        is dressed in COLORFUL, TATTERED clothes. The pirate LAUGHS. His
        bloated mouth DRIBBLES with pancake crumbs. Betsy STEPS BACK.
        FRIGHTENED. The Pirate removes a DAGGER from his belt. Eyes filled
        with LECHERY, the Pirate moves toward Betsy. She GRABS the skillet.
        THROWING HOT OIL in the Pirate's face. He SCREAMS. Betsy DASHES OUT of
        the kitchen.

        INDIANA

        has nearly finished SHAVING. He tries to CONVINCE Clare of his
        innocence. She continues to WRITE. IGNORING him.

                                        INDIANA
                        You are blowing this Betsy thing all
                        out of proportion...

        Indiana LEANS down. He RINSES his face in a large BUCKET OF WATER. A
        DAGGER FLIES INTO FRAME! JUST MISSING Indiana. It STICKS into the
        wall. A FEW FEET ABOVE Indy's head. Clare WITNESSES this. SHOCKED.
        UNAWARE of the danger, Indiana RAISES his head out of the bucket. He
        still tries to REASON with Clare.

                                        INDIANA
                        It's not as if I have this sleazy
                        reputation...

        Clare is trying to INTERRUPT Indy, trying to POINT OUT the dagger. But
        before she can say a word, Indiana again LEANS into the water bucket.
        ANOTHER DAGGER SHOOTS INTO FRAME! INTO the wall. This time only INCHES
        above Indy's head. Indiana again RAISES his head.

                                        INDIANA
                        I am a respected...honored...
                        admired...

        Clare LEAPS FORWARD. She pushes Indy OUT OF THE WAY, moments before
        another DAGGER FLIES INTO FRAME! STICKING into the wall! Indy and
        Clare TURN.

        THREE PIRATES stand here. DIRTY. TOOTHLESS. UGLY. SWORDS EXTENDED,
        they MOVE toward Indiana and Clare. Indy's eyes DART to the water
        bucket table. His WHIP and PISTOL rest here. OUT OF REACH. Indy and
        Clare are TRAPPED. The Pirates move CLOSER...

        Suddenly, A LOUD SCREAM. The Pirates LOOK UP. SCRAGGY swings from a
        ROPE above. TOWARD the Pirates. Before the Pirates can react, Scraggy
        CRASHES into them. They TUMBLE to the deck. Scraggy SHOOTS to his
        feet. He tosses a spare SWORD to Indy. Scraggy and Indy begin to
        SWORDFIGBT the Pirates.

        Clare TURNS. DASHING around the corner. To SAFETY. A SUDDEN STOP. Her
        face is buried in the hairy, bare chest of KEZURE, an enormous, bear-
        like PIRATE KING. Kezure HASN'T BATHED in years. He is dressed in
        SEVERAL LAYERS of tattered, colorful clothing, GOLDEN JEWELRY, and
        ANIMAL SKINS. His STRINGY hair is long, tied in a PONYTAIL behind his
        head. A thick, long MOUSTACHE wraps around a large mouth, filled with
        crooked, GOLDEN TEETH. Clare SHRIEKS. Kezure GRABS her around the
        waist. He TOSSES Clare over his shoulder.

        The river boat is overcome with a mixture of ORIENTAL and BLACK
        Pirates. SOUND TRACK MUSIC SOARS! There is a HEATED BATTLE between the
        crew members and the Pirates. Fists FLYING. Swords CLASHING.

        Using her Brooklyn street smarts, Betsy FIGHTS like a pro. With a
        swift PUNCH and KICK, Betsy DEFEATS one Pirate. She takes his SWORD.
        ANOTHER Pirate comes for Betsy. She EDGES him on.

                                        BETSY
                        C'mon... You ain't so tough. You
                        wouldn't last ten minutes in
                        Brooklyn.

        The Pirate ATTACKS. He and Betsy begin a HEATED SWORDFIGHT.

        Indiana and Scraggy CONTINUE TO BATTLE the onslaught of sword slinging
        Pirates. Suddenly, Indy is interrupted by Clare's LOUD SCREAM! He
        TURNS.

        A PIRATE SHIP

        has APPEARED. BESIDE the river boat. The ship is ANCIENT. OMINOUS.
        COUNTLESS PIRATES are aboard the ship. Armed with GUNS, BOWS AND
        ARROWS and CANNONS.

        EXT. RIVER BOAT - TOP DECK

        KEZURE, the Pirate King, stands at the edge of the boat. He still
        HOLDS the screaming Clare over his shoulder. From the Pirate ship, the
        Pirates toss a GRAPNEL ROPE to Kezure. The Pirate King GRABS BOLD of
        the rope. Holding TIGHTLY to Clare, Kezure SWINGS from the river boat,
        to the Pirate Ship.

        INDIANA runs through the FIGHTING crew members and Pirates, in an
        effort to SAVE Clare. Suddenly, the SOUND OF CANNON FIRE! The river
        boat ROCKS! HIT by a CANNONBALL! Indy KEEPS his balance. SWORD in
        hand, he DIVES INTO THE WATER.

        Indiana SWIMS across the Zambesi. TOWARD the Pirate ship. The water
        surrounding Indy erupts with COUNTLESS SPRAYS OF BULLETS, CANNONBALLS
        and FLYING ARROWS.

        EXT. RIVER BOAT - TOP DECK

        The swordfighting crew members manage to keep the many Pirates AT BAY.
        Scraggy EXCHANGES swordplay with a Pirate. The sword is KNOCKED from
        Scraggy's hand. He is DEFENSELESS. The Pirate COMES in for the kill.
        He RAISES HIS SWORD...ready to PLUNGE it into Scraggy's heart... The
        Pirate suddenly PAUSES. A HORRIFIED look on his face. The end of a
        SWORD SHOOTS OUT OF THE PIRATE'S CHEST! A MOMENT PASSES...the sword
        SLIDES BACK INSIDE of the Pirate's chest. The Pirate FALLS to the
        deck. BETSY stands behind him. She holds the BLOODIED SWORD. Scraggy
        gives her a THANKFUL NOD.

        EXT. PIRATE SHIP

        Indiana has MADE IT ACROSS the Zambesi. He CLIMBS UP the side of the
        Pirate Ship. The Pirates begin to SHOOT at Indy. Indy is HIT. An
        ARROW. In the ARM. He dives to safety in a nearby CANNON COMPARTMENT.

        INT. CANNON COMPARTMENT

        Indy PULLS the arrow out of his arm. He is suddenly ATTACKED by the
        Pirate Gunner. The two begin to STRUGGLE. FIGHT. CAMERA PANS TO the
        rear of the cannon, moving to a CLOSE UP of the FUSE. The fuse is LIT.
        BURNING.

        Meanwhile, Indy and the Pirate fight DIRECTLY IN FRONT OF THE CANNON'S
        OPEN BARREL! Every few seconds, each of their heads MOVES IN FRONT of
        the opening. The fuse continues to BURN. Getting LOWER...LOWER...

        EXT. PIRATE SHIP - TOP DECK

        Clare has been TIED to a mast pole. Kezure STANDS in front of her. As
        his men BATTLE around him, Kezure leans forward. The drooling Pirate
        King sloppily KISSES Clare. Along her NECK. Clare is NAUSEOUS.

        INT. CANNON COMPARTMENT

        Indy and the Pirate continue to FIGHT. The cannon fuse SPARKS. BURNING
        toward the bottom. The Pirate pushes Indy's head INSIDE OF THE CANNON
        OPENING. The FUSE will BLOW at any second. At the last moment, Indiana
        OVERPOWERS the Pirate. Indy LEAPS to the floor. The Pirate FALLS
        FORWARD. FACE TO FACE WITH THE CANNON OPENING! BOOM! The cannon FIRES!
        Indy's shirt is SPLATTERED with blood. Indiana RUNS to a wooden
        staircase, hurrying up the stairs. To the TOP DECK.

        EXT. PIRATE SHIP - TOP DECK

        Kezure kisses the bare shoulder of the STRUGGLING, HELPLESS Clare.
        Indy EMERGES from the cannon compartment. Upon seeing the Pirate King
        ATTACK Clare, Indiana SHOUTS.

                                        INDIANA
                        You son of a bitch.

        Kezure TURNS. He emits a gravelly laugh and scratches his neck,
        curiously STUDYING Indiana. Indy EXTENDS his sword. The Pirate King
        removes a long, sharp GOLDEN SWORD. They begin to FIGHT. Moving ALONG
        the deck. A FAST PACED, HEATED swordfight.

        EXT. RIVER BOAT - TOP DECK

        A PIRATE has taken over the boat's WHEEL. He STEERS the river boat OFF
        THE REGULAR PATH. It SPEEDS toward the base of a LARGE, THRASHING
        WATERFALL. The Pirate ship moves ALONGSIDE of the river boat, also
        HEADED for the waterfall. SCRAGGY and BETSY sees the waterfall ahead.
        PANIC fills their eyes. They DASH to the steering wheel. Betsy
        DISTRACTS the Pirate. They begin to SWORDFIGHT. Scraggy TAKES the
        steering wheel. He attaempts to steer the ship AWAY from the
        waterfall.

        EXT. PIRATE SHIP - TOP DECK

        Indiana and the Pirate King have climbed to the top of the SHIP'S
        MAST. They battle AMIDST the tangled ropes. SWORDS CLASHING. As the
        two men fight, Indy notices that the Pirate ship is HEADED FOR THE
        WATERFALL. Indiana has a sudden REALIZATION. He sees Scraggy, trying
        to STEER THE RIVER BOAT IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION. Indy SCREAMS above
        the cannon fire.

                                        INDIANA
                                (still fighting)
                        Scraggy!... No!... Keep goin'
                        straight!... Full steam ahead!...

        SCRAGGY

        is CONFUSED by Indy's orders. He SCREAMS back to Indiana.

                                        SCRAGGY
                        What?... You crazy Indy?... We be
                        crushed!... We smash into rock
                        wall!...

        INDIANA

        still SWORDFIGHTING the Pirate King, SCREAMS to Scraggy.

                                        INDIANA
                        No!... Trust me!... Full steam
                        ahead!... Full steam ahead !...

        SCRAGGY

        BLESSES himself. His face is STRONG. CONFIDENT. He REVS the engine.
        FULL SPEED. He TIGHTLY CLUTCHES the wheel. AIMING the river boat
        toward the waterfall.

        INDIANA AND KEZURE

        SWING from sail to sail, continuing their SPECTACULAR swordfight.
        CLARE helplessly watches from the deck.

        THE RIVER BOAT AND THE PIRATE SHIP

        continue to move SIDE BY SIDE. Moving CLOSER...CLOSER...to the
        shattering waterfall.

        SCRAGGY

        continues to rev the RIVER BOAT'S engine. CHANTING various prayers
        under his breath. In the background, a FEISTY Betsy continues to
        swordfight.

        THE RIVER BOAT AND THE PIRATE SHIP

        PENETRATE the waterfall. The two boats are met with an exploding
        shower of POWERFUL WATER! Crew members and Pirates are TOSSED ABOUT
        the deck. Indiana and the Pirate King hold TIGHTLY to the sails, to
        AVOID being thrown into the waters below.

        EXT. RIVER BOAT

        The aged boat TOSSES. TILTS. SPINS. Nearly CAPSIZING. Boards CREAK and
        MOAN. Ready to BURST. But Scraggy holds TIGHTLY to the steering wheel.
        Keeping the boat AFLOAT.

        The powerful water sends Betsy SOMERSAULTING along the deck. She tries
        to GRAB HOLD of something...anything...that will PREVENT her from
        falling off the boat. Betsy finally CLUTCHES onto something. The ARM
        OF A DEAD PIRATE.

        THE RIVER BOAT AND THE PIRATE SHIP

        are IMMERSED into the waterfall. They DISAPPEAR behind the thrashing
        curtain of water.

        INT. BEHIND THE WATERFALL

        The Pirates' HIDDEN FORTRESS. An enormous, underground CAVERN.
        Hndreds of BURNING TORCHES cast a devilish glow. The grey rocks of the
        cavern walls stretch UPWARD. Filled with countless, tiny CAVES.
        Various stone artifacts and ancient untensils are SCATTERED throughout
        the cavern. There are several other PIRATES here. ARMED. Waiting for
        the RETURN of the Pirate Ship.

        The River Boat and Pirate Ship ENTER the cave. The rushing waterfall
        THRASHES behind them. The BATTERED and BRUISED River Boat comes to a
        ROUGH stop. SCREECHING along a far wall. The Pirate Ship sails to a
        SMOOTH STOP in the middle of the cavern. Armed with guns, knives and
        swords, the Pirates hurriedly SURROUND the intruding River Boat. They
        take Betsy, Scraggy and the crew members CAPTIVE.

        KEZURE leaps to the Pirate Ship's deck and quickly UNTIES Clare.
        Indiana ATTEMPTS to FOLLOW. He PAUSES. Quickly GRABBING A FEW STICKS
        OF DYNAMITE from the Pirate Ship deck. Kezure begins to LEAD Clare off
        of the ship. His sword at her THROAT. Indiana CALLS OUT.

                                        INDIANA
                        Wait...

        Kezure STOPS. He TURNS. Indy WALKS toward Kezure, stopping less than
        TEN FEET from the Pirate King and Clare. Indy's eyes BURN through
        Kezure.

                                        INDIANA
                        Free the girl...
                                (glances to his captive
                                friends)
                        ...and my friends...
                                (lights a match, moves
                                it toward TNT fuses)
                        ...or I blow your hideout here out
                        of the water!

        Kezure LAUGHS. Indiana LIGHTS the dynamite fuses. Kezure STOPS
        laughing...WORRIED for a moment... Then, the Pirate King breaks into a
        wide, DEFIANT SMILE.

                                        KEZURE
                        Good. We will all die.

        A STANDOFF. Indy DIDN'T EXPECT this. He is suddenly FRIGHTENED.
        PUZZLED. Betsy, Scraggy and Clare STARE at Indy. Waiting for his NEXT
        MOVE...as the dynamite fuse SLOWLY BURNS. Getting CLOSER...CLOSER...to
        the TNT. Kezure seems CALM. Perfectly WILLING TO DIE. Indy gets
        ANOTHER IDEA. He BLURTS it out to Kezure.

                                        INDIANA
                        We can take you to the Lost City of
                        Sun Wu Kung!

                                        KEZURE
                        Hah! Better men than you have tried
                        to find the Lost City... They have
                        all failed.
                                (cynical laugh)
                        You are a fool.

                                        INDIANA
                                (as the TNT fuse burns
                                LOWER...LOWER...)
                        No... You're the fool. You and your
                        friends are hiding out in Sun Wu
                        Kung's Water Curtain Cave...and you
                        don't even know it.

                                        KEZURE
                                (puzzled, looking
                                around)
                        Huh?...

        Scraggy and Betsy exchange a SHOCKED glance. Clare is also SURPRISED
        by the news. The TNT fuse nears the end...ready to BLOW AT ANY
        SECOND... Indiana removes the ANCIENT SCROLL from his pocket. He
        EXTENDS the scroll to Kezure.

                                        INDIANA
                        The Sacred Pai-Cho Scroll.

        Kezure GRABS the scroll. Attempting to READ it. Indy INTERRUPTS.

                                        INDIANA
                        Don't bother. Only WE can translate
                        it.

        Kezure EXAMINES the scroll. PUZZLED by the writing. Indiana and
        Scraggy exchange a HOPEFUL glanpe. Kezure PAUSES. THINKING. He MUMBLES
        to himself.

                                        KEZURE
                        The Lost City... Said to have
                        streets paved in gold...treasures
                        far greater than any mortal man
                        could imagine...

        Kezure PUSHES Clare away. TOWARD Indiana. Clare EMBRACES Indy, as he
        BLOWS OUT the dynamite fuse. Kezure GROWLS at Indy.

                                        KEZURE
                        Your pathetic lives will be spared.
                        For now.
                                (scratching his neck)
                        But everything we find in the Lost
                        City...belongs to ME.

                        Fat chance, Sinbad. It's 50-50. Or
                        you've got no deal.

                                        KEZURE
                                (vicious smile)
                        It is my way. Or you've got no head.

                                                                        CUT TO:

        INT. WATER CURTAIN CAVE - THAT NIGHT

        A group of Pirates sit TOGETHER. DRUNK. They SING one of their ancient
        songs. The GUITAR strumming crew member accompanies them. Indiana and
        Scraggy sit around a BLAZING FIRE with Kezure and several other
        Pirates. Indy, wearing his spectacles, TRANSLATES the scrolls with
        Scraggy. Indiana is PUZZLED. TROUBLED. He LOOKS at Scraggy.

                                        INDIANA
                        Read that last proverb again...

                                        SCRAGGY
                                (reads translation)
                        "High tide drowns curiosity,
                        Low tide quenches thirst".

                                        INDIANA
                                (stands, looking at the
                                surroundings)
                        There's something here...something
                        that could help us...

        Meanwhile, Betsy and Clare work in ANOTHER SECTION of the cave. Clare
        is doing some ARCHEOLOGICAL WORK, studying the various artifacts and
        utensils. Betsy ASSISTS her. They are surrounded by LEERING, HUNGRY
        EYED PIRATES. The drunken Pirates DON'T take their eyes off of the
        girls. Betsy NOTICES. She POINTS it out to Clare.

                                        BETSY
                        Look at 'em. It's like they've never
                        seen a woman before.

                                        CLARE
                        To them... We're the ultimate women.

                                        BETSY
                        Kinda' flattering, isn't it?...
                        Being the girl of 200 guy's dreams?

        Clare and Betsy exchange a CHUCKLE.

        Meanwhile, Indiana, Scraggy and Kezure WALK through the cavern. Indy
        is LOOKING around. CURIOUS, he turns to Kezure.

                                        INDIANA
                        Is there an area... A place where
                        the tide changes?...

        Kezure leads Indiana and Scraggy into a DARK CORNER of the cavern. A
        large, smooth WALL stretches to the ceiling. The wall is filled with
        intricate CRACKS. At the base of the wall, water slowly POURS into the
        cavern. Kezure POINTS to the water.

                                        KEZURE
                        In a few hours...the water will be
                        lower...much lower...

                                        INDIANA
                        And the remainder of this wall will
                        be visible?....

        Kezure NODS. Indiana's eyes LIGHT. A REALIZATION. He excitedly TURNS
        to Kezure.

                                        INDIANA
                        We're gonna need light. A lot of
                        light. On this wall.

        Kezure NODS. Indiana EXCHANGES an anxious, hopeful glance with
        Scraggy.

                                                                        DISSOLVE TO:

        CLOSE UP - A SNORING PIRATE

        CAMERA PULLS BACK. All of the Pirates SLEEP. Their slumbering bodies
        LIE in various positions, throughout the cave. Indiana and Kezure are
        STILL AWAKE. The flickering orange light of the TORCHES illuminates
        the wall in front of them. They AWAIT the lowering tide. Scraggy,
        Betsy and Clare SLEEP on the ground beside them. Kezure POURS two
        glasses of whiskey from a STONE BOTTLE. He gives a GLASS to Indiana.
        Kezure TOASTS.

                                        KEZURE
                        To my good fortune.

        Kezure GOBBLES down the whiskey. Indiana RELUCTANTLY drinks. Kezure
        pours TWO more glasses. LAUGHING.

                                        KEZURE
                        You know... We are very much alike,
                        Doctor jones.

                                        INDIANA
                        I doubt that.

                                        KEZURE
                        We both share a remarkable talent
                        for killing.

                                        INDIANA
                        I've never gotten used to killing,
                        pal. I do it for survival.

                                        KEZURE
                        I do it for pleasure.

        Indiana DOWNS his whiskey. A LAUGHING Kezure does the same. Indiana
        NOTICES something. ON the wall. He JUMPS to his feet. CAMERA PANS TO
        THE WALL. The tide is VERY LOW. The entire wall is now VISIBLE. What
        were once simple CRACKS, have become the specific LINES OF A MAP. A
        group of ARROWS leads to an "X" at the BOTTOM CORNER OF THE MAP. A
        FASCINATED Kezure and Indiana STUDY the wall.

                                        INDIANA
                                (astounded)
                        This is incredible...this map was
                        obviously used by Sun Wu Kung's
                        disciples...if they were ever
                        lost...

                                        KEZURE
                        These drawings...they are of the
                        surrounding jungle...

                                        INDIANA
                                (points to "X")
                        Where is that?...

                                        KEZURE
                        It is located at the most South
                        Eastern part of the jungle...near
                        the mountains... There is a village
                        there. The Mongooboo Tribe.

                                        INDIANA
                        You know them?

                                        KEZURE
                        Very well. I traded with the chief
                        for many years.

                                        INDIANA
                                (anxious, excited)
                        Good. We'll leave in the morning.

        CAMERA PANS FROM Indiana and Kezure, to a DARK CAVE. A FEW FEET away.
        Standing inside, is the figure of the MYSTERIOUS CREW MEMBER. The
        TRAITOR. His face is HIDDEN in the shadows. Again, he RADIOS back to
        Nazis. He WHISPERS in German. CAMERA DOLLIES INTO A CLOSE UP of his
        RADIO MICROPHONE. A RED SWASTIKA adorns the microphone.

        EXT. JUNGLE PLAINS - THE FOLLOWING AFTERNOON

        Scraggy's decrepid MODEL-T TAXI putters across the flat, jungle
        terrain. The HOT SUN shines in the background. The car is completely
        PACKED with people. Ready to BURST. Scraggy DRIVES. Indiana, Clare and
        Betsy are CROWDED in the front seat. Kezure and four Pirates ride in
        the REAR COMPARTMENT. Everyone is UNCOMFORTABLE. CRAMPED. SWEATING.
        Two of Scraggy's crew members STRADDLE the sideboard. Three men sit on
        the ROOF, including the GUITAR PLAYER, who plays a delightful melody.
        Various rusted POTS, PANS and other UTENSILS dangle from the car. This
        creates a CHARMING, JINGLING sound.

        The taxi passes a HERD OF GIRAFFE. The beautiful animals stare in
        BEWILDERMENT at the passing taxi. Suddenly, there is a DISTANT SOUND.
        The same LOW, RUMBLING we heard earlier. The giraffes SCATTER. AFRAID
        of the unnatural sound.

        INT. TAXI

        The bizarre SOUND echoes through the taxi. Indy EXCHANGES a puzzled
        look with the others.

                                        INDIANA
                        That sound. Again.

                                        SCRAGGY
                                (listening)
                        Still far away...but getting closer.

        The sound STOPS. Indiana is BOTHERED. DISTURBED. Kezure LEANS forward.
        He points to a CLUSTERED AREA OF JUNGLE. Nearly a MILE in the
        distance.

                                        KEZURE
                        The village is there. Beyond the
                        thick of jungle.

        Scraggy NODS. He DRIVES toward the village. Suddenly, AN ARROW SHOOTS
        THROUGH THE WINDOW! JUST MISSING everyone. It SHATTERS the passenger
        window.

        A TRIBE OF NATIVE WARRIORS appear on the terrain. There are HUNDREDS.
        SCREAMING in high pitched squeals. Their bodies ADORNED with red and
        white PAINT. The angry warriors RUN TOWARD the taxi. FIRING ARROWS!

        On the Taxi roof, the men DIVE for cover. Arrows WHIZ by their heads.
        Inside, everyone ROLLS UP the windows. The taxi is attacked with a
        SHOWER OF ARROWS. Scraggy FLOORS the gas. The taxi keeps MOVING AHEAD.
        SPEEDING toward the jungle. Indiana GLARES at Kezure.

                                        INDIANA
                        Thought you said they knew you?...

        Kezure gives a PUZZLED SHRUG.

        The WARRIORS continue to CHASE the Taxi. Getting CLOSER. Firing more
        ARROWS. The taxi SPINS to a stop. Directly in front of a LARGE OPENING
        that leads into the jungle. Everyone POURS OUT of the Taxi. ARROWS fly
        by their heads. They DASH through the opening. Into the JUNGLE. The
        Warriors STOP. OUTSIDE of the opening. They DON'T ENTER. TURNING to
        each other, they begin to LAUGH. VICTORIOUS.

        INT. JUNGLE

        An almost PERFECT PATH has been cleared through the thick Jungle.
        Indiana and the others RUN through the path. Indy SUDDENLY PAUSES.
        MOTIONING for the others to STOP. A PUZZLED LOOK covers his face.

                                        INDIANA
                        Wait... Listen... They're not
                        following us...

        One of the Pirates CONTINUES TO MOVE FORWARD. His foot TRIPS A THIN
        STRING that stretches across the path. WHOOSH! A BOOBY TRAPPED PALM
        TREE SWINGS FORWARD! It SLAMS into the Pirate! Like a giant BASEBALL
        BAT! It sends the Pirate FLYING UPWARD. HIGH INTO THE AIR! His body is
        THROWN several feet into the jungle.

        Indiana exchanges a CAUTIOUS look with the others.

                                        INDIANA
                        Be careful where you step... We've
                        got to move slowly...very slowly...

        Indiana LEADS everyone. They CREEP through the path. Indy PAUSES.
        CAMERA PANS TO HIS WAIST. A SECTION OF VINE stretches across the path.
        ANOTHER booby trap. Indiana CRAWLS BENEATH THE VINE. He MOTIONS for
        the others to follow. One by one, they CAREFULLY CRAWL beneath the
        vine. The guitar player is LAST. He begins to CRAWL through. He NEARLY
        makes it, when...the top of his guitar HITS THE VINE! The vine SNAPS.
        There is a CREAKING SOUND.

        A GIANT, METAL TRAP, OVER FOUR FEET HIGH, SHOOTS UP FROM THE GROUND! A
        HUMAN TRAP! The GUITAR PLAYER DIVES TO SAFETY! The trap's SHARP METAL
        TEETH SNAP SHUT! The guitar is SNAPPED IN TWO!

        Soon, the path ERUPTS with countless ROWS OF TRAPS. They EJECT from
        the ground. SNAPPING SHUT. One AFTER the other. Everyone begins to
        RUN. The traps SNAP SHUT ONLY A FEW FEET BEHIND THEM! Everyone ROUNDS
        A CORNER... They COME UPON...

        AN ENORMOUS PIT! Over TEN FEET DEEP! Filled with countless layers of
        SCORPIONS! There is NOWHERE TO TURN. NOWHERE TO RUN. The METAL TRAPS
        continue to SHUT BEHIND THEM!

        Indiana removes his SWORD. He slices at A BAMBOO TREE. The traps
        CONTINUE TO SHUT BEHIND HIM. Getting CLOSER. CLOSER. Indiana gives A
        FINAL WHACK TO THE TREE. It FALLS. STRETCHING across the pool. Only A
        FEW FEET ABOVE the stinging scorpions. Indiana begins to CLIMB ACROSS.
        Moving HAND OVER HAND. Everyone hurriedly FOLLOWS. The bamboo tree
        CREAKS with their every movement. Their feet DANGLE only INCHES above
        the scorpions. The last Pirate GRABS HOLD of the bamboo tree, just as
        the FINAL METAL TRAP SHUTS! JUST MISSING HIM!

        As the last Pirate makes his way ACROSS the pit, he DROPS a small bag
        of GOLD COINS. The coins REST a few feet below. DIRECTLY ON TOP of the
        scorpions. The Pirate PAUSES. DECIDING whether to climb to safety or
        retrieve the coins. Everyone else has MADE IT across. The GREEDY
        Pirate wants his money. With his left hand, he HOLDS TIGHTLY to the
        bamboo tree. With the other, he REACHES for the coins. His fingers are
        INCHES from the ciins. But he LOSES his grip. He FALLS. INTO THE PIT.
        SURROUNDED by hundreds of scorpions. He STRUGGLES to get out.
        CLIMBING. SWIMMING. But he only manages to SINK. The Pirate's SCREAMS
        die, as his body is ENGULFED by the stinging scorpions.

        Indiana and the others CONTINUE AHEAD. Moving SLOWLY. CAREFULLY.
        Someone's foot STEPS ON A WOODEN TRIGGER. There is another CREAKING
        SOUND. Behind everyone, a large BAMBOO DOOR EJECTS FROM THE GROUND. It
        leads to an UNDERGROUND CAGE. The door CREAKS OPEN. THREE FEROCIOUS
        LIONS LEAP OUT! TEETH BARED. GROWLING. They COME FOR the humans.

        Everyone DASHES FORWARD. RUNNING. The lions are in HOT PURSUIT. FAST.
        The humans don't stand a CHANCE. Suddenly, Clare STOPS. She TURNS.
        FACING the charging lions. Indiana LOOKS BACK. SCREAMING.

                                        INDIANA
                        Clare! What are you...?!?

        The lions STOP. Inches from Clare. They SURROUND her. Ready to ATTACK.
        Indiana WATCHES. PUZZLED. Clare begins to make bizarre PURRING and
        COOING SOUNDS. The lions PAUSE. They RECOGNIZE the sounds. Clare
        CONTINUES. The lions begin to WARM UP to her. Clare KNEELS. She PETS
        the beasts. The lions SNUGGLE up to Clare. LICKING her face. Indiana
        and the others COME CLOSER. PUZZLED. Clare EXPLAINS.

                                        CLARE
                        I imitated the sound of a Lion
                        Mother calling her babies.

        Betsy is IMPRESSED. Indiana SMILES. RELIEVED.

                                        INDIANA
                        C'mon. Let's get outta' --

        Indy TURNS...FACE TO FACE with a grotesque SHRUNKEN HEAD! He STEPS
        BACK. The shrunken head is worn around the neck of a tall, muscular
        TRIBAL CHIEF. Leader of the WARRIORS. Countless NATIVES stand behind
        the chief. A look of ANGER...HATE...covers the Chief's face. Indiana
        gives a HOPEFUL glance to Kezure.

                                        INDIANA
                        Is this the Tribal Chief you told me
                        about?... Your friend?...

                                        KEZURE
                                (points to shrunken
                                head)
                        No. That is him.

        Indiana ROLLS his eyes. The warriors SURROUND everyone. ARROWS aimed.
        Ready to KILL. The Warriors lead everyone OUT of the path.

        EXT. MONGOOBO VILLAGE

        Several GRASS HUTS are scattered throughout this large village.
        Indiana and the others are LED into the village. They PASS the
        penetrating, unfriendly glares of the villagers. Kezure EXPLAINS to
        Indiana.

                                        KEZURE
                        This is a different tribe. New. They
                        have taken over the village.

                                        INDIANA
                        What happened to the other tribe?

        Kezure SHRUGS. Indiana TURNS to Scraggy.

                                        INDIANA
                        You recognize their language?

        PAGE 73 MISSING FROM HARD COPY

        Suddenly, a VOICE echoes from inside of the oven. The natives LISTEN.
        Again, the voice SHOUTS from inside. It's SCRAGGY. The natives
        RECOGNIZE the language. They quickly OPEN the oven door. Scraggy is
        SCREAMING in the tribe's tongue. The grille is PULLED out of the oven.
        The natives hurriedly UNTIE the slightly smoked Indiana, Kezure and
        Scraggy.

        Scraggy SHOOTS to his feet. FURIOUS. He begins to SHOUT at the tribal
        CHIEF. The Chief and the villagers are AWESTRUCK by Scraggy's words.
        The nervous Chief ORDERS Clare, Betsy and the others UNTIED. Scraggy
        WHISPERS to Indiana.

                                        SCRAGGY
                        I tell him we divine messengers of
                        Sun Wu-Kung. If he interfere with
                        our mission... Jade Emperor come
                        down from heavens and destroy his
                        village.

        Indy SMILES. Scraggy TURNS and again SHOUTS to the chief. The chief
        OBEYS Scraggy's every word. He LEADS Indy and Scraggy to another area
        of the village. Scraggy TRANSLATES for Indiana.

                                        SCRAGGY
                        I tell him we lose path to city... I
                        ask if he have something to help us.

        The chief leads Indy and Scraggy into a LARGE GRASS HUT.

        INT. GRASS HUT

        EMPTY, save for an elaborate MARBLE ALTAR. A dull MIRROR rests on the
        altar. The small mirror is surrounded by a crude, STONE FRAME. The
        chief PICKS up the mirror and GIVES it to Scraggy. The chief EXPLAINS.
        Scraggy GIVES the mirror to Indiana.

                                        SCRAGGY
                                (translating)
                        He say this will help us. And since
                        we are divine messengers...we will
                        know how to use it!

        Indiana SMIRKS. He EXAMINES the mirror. Totally CONFUSED by it.

                                                                        CUT TO:

        EXT. MONGOOBOO VILLAGE - DAWN

        The village SLEEPS. QUIET. PEACEFUL. Scraggy's Model-T is PARKED here.
        Several of the crew members and Pirates are SLEEPING in and around the
        car. KEZURE is sprawled on the car's roof. SNORING. It is obvious that
        they have CAMPED here for the evening.

        Suddenly, a SLIGHT TREMOR surges through the village. A soft
        VIBRATION. Cooking utensils RATTLE. Grass huts SHAKE.

        INT. GRASS HUT

        Indiana SLEEPS here. In a HAMMOCK. The vibration WAKES Indy. As he
        moves to climb out of the hammock, a FIGURE LEAPS ON TOP OF HIM!
        BETSY.

                                        BETSY
                        Indy. I'm frightened.

                                        INDIANA
                        I'm claustrophobic.

        Indiana attempts to PUSH Betsy out of the hammock. She RESISTS. They
        begin to WRESTLE. STRUGGLE. The hammock becomes TANGLED around their
        bodies.

        Clare WALKS BY the hut. She LOOKS inside. To her, it appears that Indy
        and Betsy are in the middle of a PASSIONATE love scene. She emits a
        SHOCKED GASP. Indiana SEES Clare. He CALLS OUT.

                                        INDIANA
                        Clare!... Wait!...

        But the startled Clare HURRIES AWAY. Indiana manages to ESCAPE Betsy
        and the tangled hammock. He LANDS on the floor. BREATHLESS.

        EXT. VILLAGE

        The vibrating INTENSIFIES. The ground begins to RUMBLE. The
        surrounding trees SHAKE. The villagers POUR out of their huts,
        gathering in the middle of town. FRIGHTENED. Indiana and Betsy JOIN
        Scraggy, Clare, Kezure and the others. Betsy is PUZZLED by the
        tremors.

                                        BETSY
                        An earthquake?

        The Tribal Chief STEPS FORWARD. He says ONE WORD in his language.
        Scraggy TRANSLATES for the others.

                                        SCRAGGY
                        Wildebeest.

                                                                        CUT TO:

        A HERD OF STAMPEDING WILDEBEEST

        Hundreds of the RAGING animals plow through the jungle. Moving FAST.
        They CRUSH everything in their path.

        EXT. MONGOOBOO VILLAGE

        The vibrating is LOUDER. HARDER. The villagers PANIC. They RUN AWAY.
        SCATTERING into the jungle. Indiana and his party are CLUSTERED
        together. Clare EXCLAIMS.

                                        CLARE
                        We have to get out... Or we'll be
                        crushed to death.

                                        INDIANA
                        Scraggy... How close?

        Scraggy puts his EAR to the trembling ground. He LISTENS.

                                        SCRAGGY
                        Two miles.

        Indy dashes to the Model-T SUPPLY RACK. He tosses SHOVELS to each of
        the group. He LOOKS around.

                                        INDIANA
                        Where's the softest ground?...

        Scraggy asks a PASSING VILLAGER. The villager SHOUTS some gibberish
        and continues running. Scraggy POINTS OFF SCREEN. Toward a COMMUNAL
        GRAVEYARD.

                                                                        CUT TO:

        THE WILDEBEEST.

        SNORTING. STOMPING. CARVING a wide path through the thick jungle.
        Small animals RUN for their lives. Bunnies DASH ahead of the herd.
        Monkeys SWING to other trees. The ANGRY Wildebeest continue ahead.

        EXT. VILLAGE

        Indiana and the others stand in the LARGE GRAVEYARD. SHOVELS in hand.
        They have DUG A LARGE HOLE. Pieces of DECAYED BODIES and SKELETONS
        protrude from the surrounding hole. Scraggy STARES at the ghastly
        sight. Eyes WIDE. FEARFUL. He begins to BABBLE. HYSTERICAL.

                                        SCRAGGY
                        Oh, no! Many dead spirits! Bad
                        spirits... We must stay away...

        Indy interrupts by PUSHING SCRAGGY INTO THE OPEN GRAVE. Scraggy falls
        into the ARMS OF A SKELETON. He SCREAMS.

                                                                        CUT TO:

        THE HERD OF WILDEBEEST

        BURSTING through a section of jungle. They arrive on the VAST JUNGLE
        PLAIN. Directly ahead of them, several feet in the distance, is the
        MONGOOBOO VILLAGE. The Wildebeest head STRAIGHT for the village.

        EXT. VILLAGE

        DESERTED. NO SIGN of human life. Everything TREMBLES with the force of
        a major earthquake. The wildebeest ARRIVE. DESTROYING the village.
        Grass Huts are FLATTENED. The enormous stone oven COLLAPSES. CRUMBLING
        to pieces. Scraggy's Model-T is OVERTURNED.

        With nothing left standing, the wildebeest MOVE ON. The village has
        been completely DEVASTATED. Surrounded with a heavy CLOUD OF DUST.
        CAMERA PANS TO THE GRAVEYARD. Grave markers and tombstones lie BROKEN
        and CRUSHED. Countless HOOFPRINTS cover the flat ground. The dust
        begins to SETTLE. The graveyard ground suddenly BUCKLES. MOVING. A
        HAND shoots out. Indiana CLIMBS OUT of the dirt. He is FOLLOWED by the
        others, who also CLIMB OUT from underground. Everyone is UNHURT. SAFE.
        PROTECTED by the ground above. A skeleton has ATTACHED itself to
        Betsy. REFUSING to let go.

        Scraggy, Indy and a few of the men RUN to the overturned Model-T Taxi.
        They GRAB hold of the car and TURN it back upright.

        Clare LOOKS at the devastated village. Betsy stands beside her,
        STRUGGLING TO ESCAPE from the clutches of the skeleton. Clare looks
        into the DISTANCE. Watching the DEPARTING Wildebeest. She is TROUBLED.
        WORRIED.

                                        CLARE
                        That's odd... Wildebeests will not
                        stampede unless provoked...

        Suddenly, the same LOW, RUMBLING SOUND from earlier, ECHOES through
        the area. But this time it is LOUD. Nearly DEAFENING. Scraggy LOOKS at
        Indy.

                                        SCRAGGY
                        This time, it is very close, Indy.
                        Very close!

        At that moment, directly behind Scraggy and Indy, the jungle ERUPTS!
        The trees SEPARATE. CRASHING to the ground. Making way for some GIANT
        BEHEMOTH. Scraggy and the others LEAP IN ONE DIRECTION. Indiana LEAPS
        IN ANOTHER.

        A GIANT TANK

        SHOOTS out of the jungle. A METAL MONSTROSITY. ONE of a kind. The tank
        is over TEN TIMES the size of a normal tank. Nearly 100 FEET LONG.
        Over 25 FEET HIGH. It is equipped with THREE LEVELS. On the TOP LEVEL,
        is the tank's swivelling GUN BARREL. ENORMOUS. The size of a CANNON.
        Two giant, BLAZING RED SWASTIKAS adorn both sides of the tank's SECOND
        LEVEL.

        The tank RUNS OVER Scraggy's Model-T. The car is FLATTENED. A THICK
        CLOUD OF DUST erupts from the ground.

        INT. TANK

        GUTTERBUHG is here. He views the outside action through a PERISCOPE.
        TWO NAZI GUNNERS are behind him. WAITING for orders to shoot. TYKI
        sits in the background. The confused pygmy is BOUND and GAGGED.

        OUTSIDE

        Scraggy, Clare, Betsy, Kezure and the others DASH across the plains.
        RUNNING AWAY from the pursuing tank. But Indiana is NOT with them.
        Scraggy, UNABLE TO SEE through the dust, calls out.

                                        SCRAGGY
                        Indy?... Indy?...

        Indiana is SEVERAL FEET AWAY. On the GROUND. ALONE. LOST in the thick
        of DUST. Suddenly, a DARK FIGURE appears. TOWERING over Indiana. The
        dust begins to CLEAR. Revealing a protruding WHITE HORN. More dust
        CLEARS. We see that the figure is a large, BLACK RHINOCEROS! Indy
        LEAPS to his feet. The rhino SNORTS. Indy turns to RUN. The rhino
        CHASES him!

        Meanwhile, with most of the dust CLEARED, the TANK CHASES INDY'S
        FRIENDS ACROSS THE JUNGLE PLAINS.

        INT. TANK

        Gutterbuhg LOOKS into the periscope. Indy's friends are in his SIGHTS.
        Gutterbuhg SCREAMS to the gunners.

                                        GUTTERBUHG
                                (German; English
                                subtitles)
                        Fire!

        OUTSIDE

        The tank's large barrel FIRES A SHOT at the running group. The blast
        FLIES OVER THEIR HEADS. JUST MISSING everyone. It BLASTS a row of palm
        trees to smithereens.

        INDIANA is still running from the rampaging rhino. Indy begins to RUN
        IN A CIRCLE. The angry rhino FOLLOWS him. The circle begins to
        TIGHTEN... Becoming SMALLER... SMALLER... Until Indy is nearly running
        ALONGSIDE of the rhino. At the exact moment, Indy GRABS HOLD of the
        rhino. He LEAPS onto the beast. With a bit of careful maneuvering,
        Indiana is RIDING THE RHINOCEROS!

        Scraggy, Betsy, Clare, Kezure and the others CONTINUE TO RUN. The tank
        is right BEHIND THEM. MOVING FAST. In HOT PURSUIT. The tank FIRES
        ANOTHER SHOT! It SPLATTERS the ground. BESIDE the group. Again, JUST
        MISSING everyone. The group TURNS. RUNNING in ANOTHER DIRECTION. The
        tank FOLLOWS.

        Indiana continues to ride the WILD, BUCKING rhino. He has NO CONTROL
        over the beast. The rhino spots SOMETHING. The TANK. From this angle,
        the tank, with its large protruding gun barrel, resembles a GIANT
        RHINOCEROS. Seeing this, the rhino turns and RUNS TOWARD the tank.
        HEAD ON. Indy holds TIGHTLY.

        Scraggy and the others PAUSE. They see the tank BEHIND THEM. They see
        the rhino AHEAD of them. The group makes QUICK TURN. To the RIGHT.
        They run toward a RAVINE.

        The tank is headed STRAIGHT for Indy and the rhino. Both moving at
        FULL SPEED.

        INT. TANK

        Through the periscope, Gutterbuhg SEES Indy and the rhino.

        INDIANA

        continues to RIDE the uncontrollable rhino. They are within THIRTY
        FEET of the oncoming tank.

        INT. TANK

        Gutterbuhg SCREAMS in German, ordering the Nazi Gunner to "Fire".

        EXT. PLAINS

        The tank FIRES. The blast is LOW. The ground in front of Indy and the
        rhino EXPLODES. A cloud of dust ERUPTS.

        INT. TANK

        Gutterbuhg LOOKS through the periscope. His view is BLOCKED by dust.

        EXT. PLAINS

        The tank is UPON Indy and the rhino. The rhino SCREECHES to a stop.
        FRIGHTENED by the blast. Indiana LEAPS ONTO THE TANK. GRIPPING the
        front section. HOLDING ON for dear life. Moments before he is crushed
        beneath the tank's giant treads, the RHINO TURNS and RUNS OFF.

        Scraggy, Betsy, Clare, Kezure and the others, have arrived at the foot
        of a tall, several branched TREE. Located at the side of the RAVINE.
        Over the ravine's edge, is a SEVERAL HUNDRED FOOT DROP onto jagged
        rocks. Scraggy begins to CLIMB the tree.

                                        SCRAGGY
                        Safest place from bad spirits...is
                        in branches of tree.

        The others SHRUG. They have NO CHOICE but to FOLLOW Scraggy up into
        the branches of the tree.

        Indiana CLIMBS along the side of the monstrous tank. He searches for a
        PASSAGEWAY inside of the tank.

        INT. TANK

        The Nazis are UNAWARE of Indy's presense on the tank. Gutterbuhg
        CONTINUES to look through the periscope. The dust begins to CLEAR. He
        FOCUSES his sights on Indy's friends. LOCATED several feet away. They
        CLIMB into the TREE. Gutterbuhg SMILES.

        EXT. TANK

        Indy CANNOT FIND a passageway into the tank. He SEES the GUN BARREL.
        OVERHEAD. It SWIVELS. AIMING toward the tree filled with Indy's
        friends. Indy GRABS one of the tank's LARGE HEADLIGHTS. He PULLS HARD.
        SNAPPING OFF the headlight. Indy LEAPS upward. He quickly STUFFS the
        headlight inside of the barrel opening.

        INT. TANK

        The tree of Indy's friends are in Gutterbuhg's SIGHTS. A PERFECT SHOT.
        Gutterbuhg SCREAMS in German, ordering the Nazi gunners to SHOOT. They
        FIRE. But the barrel BACKFIRES! EXPLODING in the face of the two Nazi
        gunners. It sends them FLYING against the wall. OUT COLD. The cabin
        fills with SMOKE. Only Gutterbuhg and Tyki REMAIN. A FURIOUS
        Gutterbuhg PICKS up the radio. He SCREAMS into the microphone.

                                        GUTTERBUHG
                                (German; English
                                subtitles)
                        Send help! We need assistance!

        Tyki HELPLESSLY watches in the background. Gutterbuhg LOOKS into the
        periscope. He SEES Indiana. ON the tank. Gutterbuhg hits a RED BUTTON.
        On the CONTROL PANEL.

        EXT. TANK

        COUNTLESS ROWS OF MACHINE GUNS eject from secret slots. All AROUND the
        tank's FIRST LEVEL. The machine guns begin to FIRE. RAPIDLY. WILDLY.
        Indiana DUCKS and DODGES the guns. He CLIMBS to the SECOND LEVEL. But
        the large SWASTIKAS begin to move. OPENING. They are actually HIDDEN
        DOORS. SECRET COMPARTMENTS. Several NAZI SOLDIERS exit the
        compartments. They COME FOR Indiana. He FIGHTS the onslaught of
        soldiers. PUNCHING. WRESTLING.

        The tank, without a driver, begins to wildly SPIN. Going in CIRCLES.

        From the tree, SCRAGGY sees Indy's dillemma. He SHOUTS to the others.

                                        SCRAGGY
                        Indy in trouble! We must help!

        Scraggy begins to CLIMB OUT of the tree. A GUN suddenly MOVES INTO
        FRAME. POINTED at Scraggy's head. Scraggy TURNS. One of his CREW
        MEMBERS holds the gun.

                                        CREW MEMBER
                                (German accent)
                        Don't move.
                                (to the others)
                        All of you. Stay where you are.

        Scraggy and the others FREEZE. Clare makes a REALIZATION. She GLARES
        at the Crew Member.

                                        CLARE
                        It was you. You're the reason the
                        Nazis found us.

        The crew member gives an evil SMILE.

        Indiana continues to FIGHT the Nazis, along the SECOND LEVEL of the
        frenzied tank. Indy has DEFEATED most of the soldiers. Only TWO NAZIS
        remain. They OVERCOME Indy. They push him DOWNWARD. Toward the tank's
        FIRST LEVEL. Toward the rows of FIRING MACHINE GUNS. Indiana STRUGGLES
        to break free. But the powerful Nazis push him CLOSER...CLOSER...to
        the machine guns.

        In the TREE, the crew member keeps his pistol AIMED at Scraggy's head.
        CAMERA PANS UPWARD. Kezure is PERCHED on the top branch. ABOVE
        Scraggy. At the right moment, Kezure LEAPS DOWN. ON TOP of the
        treacherous crew member. Kezure KNOCKS the gun from the crew member's
        hand. BLAM! The gun GOES OFF. A stray bullet STRIKES the tree trunk.
        Kezure PUNCHES the crew member, who LOSES HIS BALANCE and FALLS from
        the tree. Going OVER THE EDGE of the ravine. His body DROPS hundreds
        of feet. CRASHING to the rocks below.

        Kezure SMILES. VICTORIOUS. But the tree suddenly CREAKS. GROANS. A
        CRACK has formed around the trunk, where the bullet STRUCK. The tree
        begins to TILT. Slowly TEETERING over the ravine's edge. Everyone
        PANICS. Betsy SHOUTS.

                                        BETSY
                        Nobody move. Or we'll go over.

        Everyone FREEZES. Scared to DEATH. They TIGHTLY GRIP their branches.
        The tree SWAYS. SLOWLY.

        Indiana still FIGHTS the two Nazis. STRUGGLING to keep his body from
        the tank's deadly machine guns. Indy FLIPS one of the Nazis over his
        head. The Nazi falls DIRECTLY IN FRONT of an entire row of machine
        guns. His body does a GROTESQUE DANCE OF DEATH. RIDDLED with bullets.

        Indiana and the other Nazi exchange PUNCHES. Their bodies TUMBLE over
        the rear of the tank. They fall onto a SMALL LEDGE. Above the
        enormous, rotating TANK TREADS. Indy and the Nazi battle to push the
        other OFF THE LEDGE. Indiana PREVAILS. He pushes the Nazi ON TOP of
        the giant treads. The Nazi tries to CLIMB BACK...but his body is
        DRAGGED BENEATH THE TANK. CRUSHED.

        Indiana turns, seeing Gutterbuhg climb out of a SECRET HATCH. On the
        tank's TOP LEVEL. Gutterbuhg POINTS HIS FINGER at Indy. It rapidly
        FIRES BULLETS. Indy DODGES around the side of the tank. Bullets BOUNCE
        off the metal beside him.

        Meanwhile, Indy's friends sit BREATHLESSLY on the swaying tree.
        Everyone is SILENT. STILL. Kezure suddenly SNEEZES. The tree CREAKS.
        It WAVERS over the ravine's edge. Nearly GOING OVER. But it DOESN'T.
        Everyone CATCHES THEIR BREATH. The tree continues to TEETER.

        Gutterbuhg PURSUES Indiana. Playing CAT AND MOUSE along the top level
        of the tank. Indiana PEERS around a corner. Seeing Gutterbuhg AHEAD.
        Indy grabs hold of the large ROTATING GUN BARREL. Indy LIFTS his feet.
        He SWINGS FORWAFD. RIDING the gun barrel. He SPINS around the tank's
        side and comes up BEHIND the unsuspecting Gutterbuhg. Indy JUMPS the
        Nazi. They begin to FIGHT. Gutterbuhg tries to move his Mechanical arm
        INTO POSITION. To SHOOT Indy.

        The tank continues to LOSE CONTROL. It no longer SPINS in CIRCLES. It
        is headed STRAIGHT TOWARD the tree filled with Indy's friends.

        INT. TANK

        Tyki SITS inside. WATCHING through the periscope. HELPLESS.

        EXT. PLAINS

        Gutterbuhg and Indiana continue to FIGHT. Suddenly, there is a BUZZING
        SOUND. An AIRPLANE ENGINE. Indiana LOOKS TO THE SKY. A NAZI BIPLANE
        FLIES TOWARD HIM. The biplane DIVES. Moving LOWER. LOWER. Gutterbuhg
        ROLLS OUT OF THE WAY. Indy is TRAPPED. A SITTING DUCK. The biplane
        SWOOPS DOWN. Trying to HIT Indy. He DIVES onto the tank top. Lying
        FLAT. The plane flies DIRECTLY OVER Indy. JUST MISSING him by a FEW
        FEET.

        Meanwhile, the tank still DRIVES DIRECTLY TOWARD the swaying tree and
        ravine. Scraggy, Betsy, Clare, Kezure and the others remain FROZEN.
        STILL. WATCHING the tank come for them. They are FRIGHTENED. HELPLESS.

        Indy and Gutterbuhg have RESUMED their fighting. STANDING on the
        tank's top. The biplane LOOPS in the air. Coming back for ANOTHER
        SHOT. Gutterbuhg LEAPS out of its path. The plane HEADS STRAIGHT for
        Indy. He again DIVES to the tank's top. The biplane SWOOPS DOWN. This
        time AIMING LOWER. As it PASSES Indy, its wheels GRAZE his back. Indy
        CRIES OUT.

        The tank continues to SPEED TOWD the tree of trapped people. Getting
        CLOSER...CLOSER...

        His back ACHING, Indy struggles to keep Gutterbuhg's machine gun arm
        from shooting him. The biplane does another midair LOOP. It TURNS and
        HEADS straight for Indy. This time, the plane WON'T MISS. As the
        biplane gets CLOSE... Indy grabs a tight HOLD of Gutterbuhg's
        Mechanical arm. Indy RAISES the arm. AIMING at the biplane. Indy pulls
        the arm's TRIGGER. FIRING a round of shots. The rapid bullets STRIKE
        the plane's belly. The biplane LOSES CONTROL. Its engine COUGHS. DIES.
        The biplane SPINS. Flipping into a NOSEDIVE. Leaving a trail of BLACK
        SMOKE. The biplane HITS the ground. A FLAMING CRASH! SEVERAL FEET from
        the tank.

        Indiana OVERPOWERS Gutterbuhg. With TWO HARD PUNCHES, Indy FLOORS the
        Nazi. Gutterbuhg lies SPRAWLED on the tank's top. UNCONSCIOUS. Indy
        TURNS. He sees that the speeding tank is going to CRASH into the
        treefull of his friends. Indiana LEAPS into the open tank compartment.

        INT. TANK

        Indiana TAKES the controls. But they are completely ALIEN to him. He
        hears a SQUEAL. TYKI. Behind HIM. Tyki motions to a SPECIFIC CONTROL.
        Indy GRABS HOLD of it.

        EXT. PLAINS

        The tank SCREECHES. SPINNING TO A STOP. INCHES from the swaying tree.
        Scraggy, Clare, Betsy, Kezure and the others, emit a UNIFIED SIGH OF
        RELIEF. But the tree suddenly CRACKS. It TILTS. FALLING OVER THE
        RAVINE EDGE! Everyone SCREAMS!

        There is the sudden CRACK OF A WHIP! The whip WRAPS ITSELF around the
        trunk of the tree. Indiana HOLDS the opposite end. He PULLS with all
        of his strength. HOLDING the tree in place. He PREVENTS the tree from
        FALLING into the ravine. Indy SHOUTS to his friends. Through GRITTED
        TEETH.

                                        INDIANA
                        Jump!... Jump!...

        Everyone begins to LEAP from the tree. To the GROUND. Indy CONTINUES
        to hold the tree in place. Muscles BULGING. Sweat POURING. Veins
        POPPING. Soon, everyone is back on the GROUND. SAFE. Indy RETRIEVES
        his whip. The tree TILTS. FALLING over the ravine edge. The tree
        CRASHES to the rocks below. SPLINTERING into a million pieces.

        On the top level of the tank, Gutterbuhg STIRS. WAKES. But Indiana is
        UPON HIM. Using a rope, Indy TIES UP Gutterbuhg. He removes the AMMO
        CARTRIDGE from the Nazi's mechanical arm. EMPTYING the bullets onto
        the ground. Indiana PUSHES Gutterbuhg INSIDE THE TANK.

        Tyki CRAWLS out of the tank. He SEES Clare. TEARS of happiness fill
        his eyes. He RUNS to Clare. The two exchange a WARM EMBRACE. Tyki SEES
        Scraggy. They shake hands and begin an EXCITED CONVERSATION. Like two
        OLD FRIENDS.

        INT. TANK

        Indy grabs the RADIO MICROPHONE. He HOLDS it in front of Gutterbuhg.

                                        INDIANA
                        Call your mommy.

        Gutterbuhg GROWLS. He SPEAKS German into the microphone. The voice of
        LIEUT. MEPHISTO answers. Echoing over the SPEAKERS. Indy GRABS the
        microphone. INTERRUPTING.

                                        INDIANA
                        This is Jones. I've got your tank.
                                (pause)
                        It's all over, pal. You lose.

                                                                        CUT TO:

        CLOSE-UP: LIEUT. MEPHISTO

        He is ANGRY. UPSET. But he FORCES himself to CALMLY address Indiana.

                                        MEPHISTO
                        Doctor Jones... You surprise me. For
                        a supposedly intelligent man...you
                        jump to childish conclusions.
                        Remember... You are driving our
                        tank. We can FOLLOW you anywhere.
                                (vehement)
                        You are far from defeating us, my
                        friend. The battle has only just
                        begun.

        CAMERA PULLS BACK. Mephisto is standing beside a long ROW OF TENTS.
        Housing many TROOPS. Several JEEPS are parked in the background. All
        mounted with RECOILEST CANNONS. 5 CANVAS TRUCKS are also here. Filled
        with more TROOPS, CANNONS and AMMUNITION. The Nazis have assembled an
        ENTIRE ARMY!

        INDIANA

        DROPS the microphone. Suddenly WORRIED. He HURRIES out of the tank.
        Gutterbuhg stays BEHIND. LAUGHING.

        EXT. PLAINS

        Indiana HURRIES to Tyki and the others. Indy shoots an IMPATIENT
        glance to Scraggy.

                                        INDIANA
                        We've got to move. Fast.
                                (points to Tyki)
                        Ask him if he knows the way to the
                        City from here.

        Scraggy ASKS Tyki. The pygmy ANSWERS, pointing OFF SCREEN. Scraggy
        TRANSLATES for Indiana.

                                        SCRAGGY
                        He do not know exact place... But it
                        is somewhere over there.

        Indy TURNs to the direction where Scraggy points. Several miles away,
        we see COUNTLESS ROWS OF MOUNTAINS. Thick layers of CLOUDS surround
        the mountains. Indiana SIGHS.

                                        INDIANA
                        A lotta' good that does us... It
                        could take us months...years...to
                        search everyone of those.

        Betsy has an IDEA. She removes the STONE MIRROR from Indiana's pocket.

                                        BETSY
                        Maybe he knows what to do with
                        this...

        Betsy GIVES the mirror to Tyki. His eyes WIDEN. In AWE. Tyki
        RECOGNIZES the mirror. He excitedly EXPLAINS to Scraggy, who
        TRANSLATES for Indiana.

                                        SCRAGGY
                        It is "Magical Mirror of Sun Wu
                        Kung"...

                                        INDIANA
                        But whattayou do with it?

        Scraggy ASKS Tyki. The energetic pygmy PLACES the mirror against an
        upright stone. Tyki ADJUSTS the mirror, until it FACES the distant
        mountains. Tyki emits a high pitched GIGGLE. POINTING to the mirror.
        Everyone GATHERS around the mirror. The SOUND TRACK MUSIC SOARS.

        The mirror reflects the CLOUDS above the mountains. But above one
        SPECIFIC MOUNTAIN, we see the image of a CITY REFLECTED ON THE CLOUDS!

        Indiana TURNS away from the mirror, looking at the SPECIFIC MOONTAIN.
        But the city is ONLY REFLECTED IN THE MAGICAL MIRROR! Clare SMILES at
        Indy, quoting Tyki from earlier.

                                        CLARE
                        "I come from Land Of City On
                        Clouds".

        Indiana NODS. HOPEFUL. ANXIOUS. He looks back to the magical
        REFLECTION.

                                                                        CUT TO:

        THE TANK

        travelling a NARROW PATH. Along the side of a STEEP MOUNTAIN. The tank
        moves UPWARD. Toward the mountain TOP. The tank JERKS. WOBBLES. It's
        as if the driver were having TROUBLE with the controls.

        INT. TANK

        Indiana DRIVES. UNFAMILIAR with the controls. The tank is CROWDED with
        everyone. Betsy and Clare sit BESIDE Indy. Gutterbuhg is DIRECTLY
        BEHIND HIM. Kezure TEACHES a game to Scraggy. Tyki, the Pirates and
        the various crew members WATCH. The game appears to be a BIZARRE
        VERSION of chess. Only the tokens are DRIED INSECTS and LIZARDS.
        Kezure EXPLAINS.

                                        KEZURE
                        This is called "Taskipi". Only the
                        bravest play.

        Upon hearing this, Scraggy is even MORE EXCITED TO PLAY. The game
        BEGINS.

        Indiana is becoming extremely FRUSTRATED by the tank controls. Betsy
        gives a SERIOUS LOOK to him.

                                        BETSY
                        I've been talking to Dr. Clarke
                        about our problem.

                                        INDIANA
                                (struggling with tank)
                        Problem?... Hey... What're you two
                        doin' talkin' behind my back?...

                                        CLARE
                        Betsy needed help. I obliged.

                                        INDIANA
                        Since when did you become the female
                        Sigmund Freud?

                                        CLARE
                        Since I received a Masters Degree in
                        Psychology.

        Indy ROLLS HIS EYES. Meanwhile, Kezure has TAKEN all of Scraggy's
        tokens. He's obviously WON the game. A carefree Scraggy THROWS up his
        hands.

                                        SCRAGGY
                        We play again?

                                        KEZURE
                                (pause, serious)
                        The game is not yet over, my friend.

                                        SCRAGGY
                        Oh?

                                        KEZURE
                        You have lost. You must pay.

                                        SCRAGGY
                                (going through pockets)
                        I don't have money...

                                        KEZURE
                        No. No. money.
                                (deadly smile)
                        Rules of the game declare that I may
                        choose a souvenir.
                                (removes a knife)
                        A part of your body. Any part I
                        wish.

        Scraggy GULPS. Kezure PAUSES. RUBBING his jaw. THINKING. Meanwhile,
        Betsy EXPLAINS to Indians.

                                        BETSY
                        Dr. Clarke says that you're not
                        really in love with me. You're just
                        trying to prove that you can still
                        attract younger women. You're
                        terrified of getting old.

                                        INDIANA
                        That's crazy.

                                        BETSY
                        That's what I told her. I told her
                        that you really did love me.

                                        INDIANA
                                (fumbling)
                        Well...that's...ah...well...

                                        BETSY
                                (worried)
                        You mean... She was right?...

                                        INDIANA
                        No... I mean Yes... I mean...

        Indy TURNS, seeing Clare GLARING at him. Indy SIGHS. PAUSES. He gives
        Betsy a TENDER, HONEST look.

                                        INDIANA
                        No, Betsy. I don't love you.

                                        BETSY
                                (tears fill her eyes)
                        That's the first time you ever said
                        it!

        Betsy begins CRYING. Into Clare's ARMS. Indiana SHAKES his head. Clare
        COMFORTS Betsy.

                                        CLARE
                        There. There. He's a very disturbed
                        man.

        Indiana SIGHS. He TURNS. FACE to FACE with a GRINNING and NODDING
        Gutterbuhg.

        Kezure has made his DECISION. Scraggy WAITS. TERRIFIED. Kezure RAISES
        his knife. TOWARD Scraggy's face.

                                        KEZURE
                        Your eyes. They are a striking deep
                        blue.

        Scraggy COVERS his face. Kezure ATTACKS him. Trying to CUT OUT
        Scraggy's eyes. A FIGHT begins. The crew members VS. the Pirates.
        Indiana TURNS, away from the controls. He BREAKS UP the fight.

                                        INDIANA
                                (angry)
                        Enough. We're in this together. If
                        we start fighting among ourselves...
                        we'll never get out alive.

        The men CALM DOWN. CATCHING their breath. Kezure PUTS AWAY his knife.
        He GLARES at Scraggy.

                                        KEZURE
                        You owe me, old man.

        EXT. MOUNTAIN

        The tank, without a driver, begins to SWERVE OFF THE MOUNTAIN ROAD.

        INT. TANK

        Clare NOTICES the tank going over the mountain. She SCREAMS.

                                        CLARE
                        Doctor Jones!!!

        Indy TURNS. LEAPING back to the controls. He hurriedly STEERS the tank
        back onto the mountain path. Saving it at the LAST MOMENT. Everyone
        CATCHES their breath. Indiana STEPS on the gas, continuing AHEAD.

                                                                        CUT TO:

        EXT. MOUNTAIN - A FEW HOURS LATER

        The tank has nearly made it to the TOP of the mountain. Trekking
        through a NARROW, ROCKY RAVINE. The tank rolls to a STOP. The top
        hatch FLIPS OPEN. Indiana, Scraggy and Tyki POP OUT. Tyki suddenly
        points to the MOUNTAIN TOP, which is cloaked in thick LAYERS OF
        CLOUDS. Tyki's eyes fill with JOYOUS TEARS. He begins to SHOUT. His
        voice SQUEALS with EXCITEMENT. Scraggy TRANSLATES for Indy.

                                        SCRAGGY
                        He say that two miles ahead...we
                        will find his home.

        Indiana SMILES. EXCITED by the prospects. TOUCHED by Tyki's reaction.
        Indy looks to the FOOT of the mountain. Several miles BELOW.

        THE NAZI FORCES

        have ARRIVED! They are still at least TWO HOURS from reaching Indiana
        and the others. The massive army MOVES FAST. They begin to DRIVE along
        the mountain path. FOLLOWING Indiana. In HOT PURSUIT.

        Indy PAUSES. WORRIED. THINKING. He LOOKS at the surrounding ROCKY
        WALLS, then to the tank's enormous GUN BARREL. An IDEA. He HURRIES
        back inside of the tank. Scraggy and Tyki FOLLOW. CLOSING the hatch
        above them.

        INT. TANK

        Indy LOOKS at the tank's control panel. A PUZZLEMENT. He LOOKS at
        Gutterbuhg.

                                        INDIANA
                        How do I work the big gun?

        Gutterbuhg SMILES. He REFUSES to answer. Indy has NO TIME for games.
        He LOOKS at Kezure.

                                        INDIANA
                        Want your souvenir?
                                (grabs Gutterbuhg's left
                                arm)
                        Start with his good arm.

        Kezure SMILES and removes his LONG KNIFE. He moves it Gutterbuhg's
        NECK. The snivelling Nazi CRIES OUT.

                                        GUTTERBUHG
                        W-W-Wait!... Please!...

        Indy NODS to Kezure. The Pirate King moves his KNIFE. Gutterbuhg
        hurriedly POINTS to two switches on the control panel.

                                        GUTTERBUHG
                        There. That is what you want.

        Indy NODS. He TURNS to the switches.

        EXT. RAVINE

        CLOSE-UP: The tank's large gun barrel SWIVELS. Pointing UPWARD. To the
        ROCKS above. The gun FIRES A SHOT. It swivels a FEW FEET. Then FIRES
        ANOTHER. And ANOTHER. A RUMBLING SOUND echoes through the area.

        INT. TANK

        Indy HITS the gas.

        EXT. RAVINE

        The tank SHOOTS forward. SPEEDING ahead. An AVALANCHE BEGINS! JUST
        MISSING the tank. Several pounds of ROCKS and DEBRIS fall from above.
        The rocks create A THICK WALL. BLOCKING the mountain path.

        The tank CONTINUES along the twisting, narrow mountain path. Moving
        further and further UPWARD. The tank DISAPPEARS INTO THE THICK CLOUDS
        that surround the mountain.

        INT. TANK

        Indiana LOOKS through the persiscope. His view BLINDED by the clouds.

        EXT. MOUNTAIN

        The tank is a LARGE, GREY BLUR through the clouds. Several DARK,
        BULKING FIGURES APPEAR! They CLIMB along the ravine sides and tops.
        The mysterious figures SURROUND the tank. All are holding ENORMOUS
        BOULDERS over their heads. AIMED at the tank.

        INT. TANK

        Indy EASES up on the gas. The tank SLOWS. Suddenly, there is a LOUD
        CRASH! The tank is HIT. RATTLING. SHAKING. Everyone is TOSSED. Save
        for Indy, who STAYS at the controls. He continues to GUIDE the tank
        FORWARD. There is another CRASH. And ANOTHER. And ANOTHER.

        EXT. MOUNTAIN

        The dark figures SHOWER the tank with heavy boulders. The tank's gun
        barrel SNAPS IN TWO. Headlights SMASH. Its body becomes DENTED.
        CRACKED.

        INT. TANK

        Indiana is TOUGH. PERSISTENT. He continues to move the jolting tank
        FORWARD. As the surrounding walls CAVE IN. SHATTER. Everyone PANICS.
        SCREAMING.

        EXT. MOUNTAIN

        The injured, wobbling tank moves OUT OF THE CLOUDS. Arriving around
        the corner from the MOUNTAIN TOP. The countless dark figures continue
        to FOLLOW the tank. SCURRYING along the ravine sides and tops. The
        figures EMERGE from the clouds. For the first time, they are VISIBLE.
        And we see that the figures are TALL... HAIRY... MUSCULAR... GORILLAS!
        They CONTINUE to assault the tank with boulders.

        INT. TANK

        Indiana still attempts to move the tank FORWARD. But the engine begins
        to COUGH. SPUTTER. And DIES.

        EXT. MOUNTAIN

        The tank COMES TO A SUDDEN STOP. One of the Gorillas emits a BIGS
        PITCHED SHRIEK. COMMUNICATING with the others. The others PAUSE. They
        STOP the attack. The Gorillas APPROACH the tank. SLOWLY. CAUTIOUSLY.
        The apes REACH OUT. TOUCHING the tank's wrecked body. A few of the
        apes begin to CLIMB onto the tank.

        The tank's top hatch FLIPS OPEN. Indy's HEAD pops out. TWO HAIRY ARMS
        REACH INTO FRAME AND GRAB INDIANA! An enormous Gorilla pulls Indy OUT
        OF THE HATCH! The ape TOSSES INDY OFF SCREEN!

        Indiana FLIES INTO THE AIR! He LANDS IN THE ARMS of another Gorilla.
        The ape TAKES Indy's WHIP and THROWS him to another Gorilla, who takes
        Indy's HAT. The Gorilla TOSSES Indy to another ape, who tears off
        Indy's LEATHER JACKET. The helpless Indy is THROWN to yet another
        Gorilla. The angry ape RAISES Indy over his head. The Gorilla prepares
        to THROW INDIANA OFF OF THE MOUNTAIN'S EDGE!

        Tyki's VOICE ERUPTS FROM OFF SCREEN. The Gorilla PAUSES, suspending
        Indiana HIGH IN THE AIR. The Gorilla TURNS to Tyki. The pygmy STANDS
        on the tank. He SHOUTS AN ORDER to the Gorilla. The ape NODS.
        UNDERSTANDING. He KNOWS Tyki. The Gorilla gently PLACES Indy back on
        the ground. Indiana ADJUSTS what remains of his clothing. He turns,
        seeing A GROUP OF GORILLAS. HUDDLED together. The Gorillas SEPARATE.
        They have DRESSED one of the apes in INDIANA'S HAT, LEATHER JACKET AND
        WHIP! The ape begins to SNAP THE WHIP, almost as if he were IMITATING
        Indy.

        Scraggy, Betsy, Clare and the others have CLIMBED OUT of the tank.
        Upon seeing the Gorilla DRESSED as Indy, they BURST INTO LAUGHTER. A
        very ANGRY Indiana growls at Tyki.

                                        INDIANA
                                (pointing to Gorilla)
                        Tell him to take off my stuff!

        Through laughter, Scraggy TRANSLATES for Tyki. The pygmy SHOUTS an
        order to the Gorilla. The ape REMOVES the hat and leather jacket,
        RELUCTANTLY giving them back to a grumbling Indiana.

        Tyki continues to SHOOT orders to the other Gorillas. The pygmy
        suddenly appears STRONG. AUTHORITATIVE. He obviously has POWER over
        the beasts. The Gorillas GATHER together. They MOVE TOWARD the people.
        The apes GENTLY take the hands of the various humans. It is a WARM,
        ENCHANTING sight, as the friendly Gorillas LEAD the humans forward.
        Clare, using her Gorilla MOTIONS and SOUNDS, communicates with the
        beasts. The group moves AROUND A TWISTING CORNER OF THE PATH. Toward
        the MOUNTAIN TOP.

        AROUND THE CORNER

        Indiana and the others are met with an AWESOME SIGHT! Indy STOPS. His
        mouth DROPS OPEN. Clare is equally ASTOUNDED. Betsy and the others
        STARE AHEAD. In total WONDERMENT. Even Gutterbuhg is AMAZED. The SOUND
        TRACK MUSIC EXPLODES INTO A THUNDERING CRESCENDO!

        THE LOST CITY OF SUN WU-KUNG

        LIES AHEAD of the group. A SPECTACULAR SIGHT! A city whose every
        building and tower is cast in SOLID GOLD! SPARKLING! GLISTENING! A
        HEAVENLY place. The City is protected by a deep MOAT. The fins of
        several SHARKS move through the moat waters. A THICK STONE WALL
        surrounds the city. A large, golden DRAWBRIDGE is built into the wall.
        PASSAGEWAY into the city.

        A tremendous TOWER stretches above the city walls. The GUARD, a pygmy
        similiar to Tyki, is POSTED in the tower. The guard SPOTS Tyki,
        approaching the city walls. The guard's EYES LIGHT. He SMILES. The
        guard CRIES OUT! SHOUTING to everyone inside of the City. He continues
        to REPEAT a certain phrase.

        Scraggy TRANSLATES the guard's words for Indiana.

                                        SCRAGGY
                        He say... "Our Prince has returned
                        home".

        Indiana SMILES. Soon, the beautiful sound of COUNTLESS RINGING BELLS
        is heard, welcoming Tyki home. Eyes WATERING, a proud Tyki and the
        Gorillas LEAD everyone to the foot of the City Walls. The enormous
        drawbridge begins to LOWER. A STUNNING SHAFT OF GOLDEN LIGHT escapes
        from the opening. As the drawbridge continues to lower, the shaft of
        light becomes WIDER. BRIGHTER. It ILLUMINATES the faces of Indy and
        the others. When the drawbridge is completely LOWERED, everyone is LED
        INTO THE CITY. Their bodies SILHOUETTED against the warm glowing
        light.

        INT. CITY

        WE ENTER with Indy and the others. The city is BURSTING with the
        bright colors of various VEGETABLE and FRUIT GARDENS, and various
        other EXOTIC PLANT LIFE. Luscious GREEN GRASS and CRYSTAL CLEAR LAKES
        surround many of the homes. The earthen streets are literally PAVED
        WITH GOLD. The men and women of the City are members of Tyki's RACE.
        ORIENTAL PYGMIES. There is a PEACEFUL, JOYOUS quality about them. They
        RUSH toward Tyki. EMBRACING him. SHOWERING him with kisses. WELCOMING
        him home.

        Indiana and the others are in AWE of this new world. Gutterbuhg WALKS
        with them. CAMERA PANS to his HANDS. He struggles to UNTIE his
        bindings.

        Kezure SPOTS something. A small, SOLID GOLD GARDEN TOOL. Lying in a
        VEGETABLE GARDEN. Kezure's eyes fill with GREED. He moves to STEAL the
        can. Kezure GRABS the tool and begins to HIDE it. BENEATH his cloak. A
        LARGE GORILLA'S HAND GRABS Kezure's arm. TOWERING over the Pirate
        king, the Gorilla WAVES his finger at Kezure. A WARNING. NO STEALING.
        The nervous Kezure NODS. He PLACES the garden tool back on the ground.

        Meanwhile, Indy and the others are led to an elaborate PALACE. They
        ascend the several GOLDEN STAIRS, toward the entrance. The palace
        doors OPEN. An OLDER MAN steps outside. He is BOHBALA. The City's
        RULER. A few PALACE GUARDS stand beside him. Bohbala RAISES his arms
        over the crowd. Pygmies and Gorillas DROP TO THEIR KNEES. In REVERNCE.

        Tyki RUNS to Bohbala. They EMBRACE. TEARS OF JOY fill their eyes.
        Bohbala WIPES away his tears. He gives a WARM SMILE to Indiana and the
        others. He SPEAKS. SOFTLY. In a WISE voice. Scraggy TRANSLATES for the
        others.

                                        SCRAGGY
                        He thank us...for returning his son.

        Indiana and the others SMILE. Betsy WHIPSERS to Indy.

                                        BETSY
                        If the little guy's pushin' 200
                        years?... How old's his Father?

        Indy motions for Betsy to "Shhh". Bohbala continues to SPEAK. Scraggy
        TRANSLATES.

                                        SCRAGGY
                        His name "Bohbala". He is Ruler of
                        City, faithful servant of his Lord
                        and Master... Sun Wu-Kung.
                                (pause, smile)
                        He welcome us to stay. As long as we
                        wish.

        Indiana exchanges a HOPEFUL glance with Clare. As Bohbala CONTINUES to
        speak, CAMERA PANS TO GUTTERBUHG. The Nazi has successfully UNTIED his
        bindings. FREE. While the others listen to Bohbala, Gutterbuhg REMOVES
        ONE SPARE BULLET FROM HIS MOUTH. He slyly INSERTS the bullet into his
        mechanical arm.

        Indiana is TOO CONCERNED with Bohbala to notice Gutterbuhg.

                                        INDIANA
                                (anxious, to Scraggy)
                        Ask him where we may find the burial
                        place...or the remains...of Sun Wu-
                        Kung...

        Scraggy TURNS to ask Bohbala. But his question is INTERRUPTED by
        Gutterbuhg's MECHANICAL ARM. It EXTENDS INTO FRAME! Its finger POINTED
        AT INDIANA! Everyone STARES. SHOCKED. But the bizarre sight greatly
        AMUSES Bohbala. He begins to LAUGH. He REACHES OUT and PUSHES
        Gutterbuhg's finger away. But the machine gun GOES OFF! FIRING!
        Bohbala is HIT! In the CHEST. He FALLS. Tyki KNEELS, cradling
        Bohbala's head in his arms. Tyki CALLS his Father's name. It is
        FUTILE. Bohbala is DEAD.

        The crowd of villagers STARE. CONFUSED. They are unaccustomed to
        VIOLENCE.

        Indiana CLUTCHES Gutterbuhg by the throat.

                                        INDIANA
                        Bastard...

        Indiana pulls back his fist to PUNCH the Nazi. But Indy is STOPPED by
        the PALACE GUARDS. They move their SWORDS to his throat. Indy is
        suddenly PUZZLED. The VILLAGERS FALL TO THEIR KNEES. BOWING to
        Gutterbuhg. A distraught Tyki hurriedly EXPLAINS to Scraggy, who
        translates for Indy.

                                        SCRAGGY
                        It is written... If ruler is
                        defeated by greater power...he who
                        possess that power...
                                (points to Gutterbuhg)
                        ...shall become ruler!

        Gutterbuhg's eyes fill with a sadistic THRILL. He RAISES his
        MECHANICAL ARM. In a "Heil Hitler" POSE. The entire City IMITATES the
        Nazi. RAISING their right arms. CHEERING. HAILING their new leader.

        Indiana is HORRIFIED by the scene. Tyki is UPSET. SCREAMING. He knows
        that Gutterbuhg is truly EVIL! But NONE of the villagers listen.
        Indiana LOOKS to his SHOCKED friends.

                                        INDIANA
                        This is turning into one helluva
                        nightmare.

                                        GUTTERBUBG
                                (hears, smiles at Indy)
                        One you will never awaken from,
                        Doctor Jones.

        Indy GLARES at Gutterbuhg. Clare and Betsy exchange a FRIGHTENED
        glance.

                                                                        CUT TO:

        INT. PALACE - RULER'S CHAMBER

        A beautiful, expansive chamber, filled with TAPESTRIES and ARTWORK.
        Gutterbuhg sits in an elaborate GOLDEN THRONE. He has donned a
        ghoulish NEW OUTFIT. The robes of BOHBALA, the dead ruler. Gutterbuhg
        is being ATTENDED upon by several villagers, who bring him countless
        PLATES OF FOOD. He is surrounded by SEVERAL WOMEN, who patiently wait
        for his orders. Gutterbuhg GOBBLES down the variety of food and wine.
        DROOLING. SLOBBERING.

        Scraggy KNEELS before the Nazi. Gutterbuhg USES Indiana's WHIP as a
        LEASH. It is TIED around Scraggy's neck and HELD by the Nazi.
        Gutterbuhg PULLS the leash. HARD. Nearly STRANGLING Scraggy. His mouth
        FILLED WITH FOOD, Gutterbuhg SCREAMS at Scraggy.

                                        GUTTERBUHG
                        I want to see Jones!

        Scraggy TRANSLATES for the guards.

        INT. DUNGEON

        DARK. MUSTY. Surrounded with moss covered STONE WALLS. Located BENEATH
        the Palace. Indy and the others are LOCKED inside. Everyone is SILENT.
        STARING. WAITING. Clare CONSOLES a tearful, despondent Tyki. The
        dungeon gate OPENS. The two Guards ENTER. They DRAG Indiana out of the
        dungeon. Betsy CALLS OUT to Indy. Trying to FOLLOW. But the guards
        SLAM the wooden door in Betsy's face. She peers through the small
        BARRED WINDOW. WORRIED. UPSET.

        INT. PALACE

        Indiana is LED into the Ruler's Chamber. Indy SEES Scraggy, tied to a
        leash. An angry, VENGEFUL look covers Indy's face. He TURNS to
        Gutterbuhg. The Nazi, still STUFFING his face with food, pulls TIGHTLY
        on Scraggy's leash.

                                        GUTTERBUHG
                        Your friend makes a wonderful
                        interpreter.

        Indy's eyes BURN. Gutterbuhg GULPS down a glass of wine. Liquid
        SPITTLES from the sides of his mouth. He LOOKS at Indy.

                                        GUTTERBUHG
                        "The Nazi Party will exist for one
                        thousand years...and I wish to be
                        alive for every year!"
                                (pause)
                        That is a favorite philosophy of our
                        feuher.

                                        INDIANA
                        Your feuher's philosphies belong on
                        a bathroom wall.

                                        GUTTERBUHG
                                (angry, slapping Indy
                                across the face)
                        This is a very serious matter,
                        Doctor Jones. It could save your
                        life.
                                (pause)
                        I understand that somewhere in this
                        City...there is a Garden of...
                        Immortal Peaches?...
                                (Indy doesn't respond,
                                Gutterbuhg continues)
                        I want information about this
                        Garden... And I would greatly
                        appreciate it, if you would share
                        everything you know, with me.

                                        INDIANA
                        I don't share anything with Nazis.

        Gutterbuhg NODS. He TAKES another bite of food, shooting a GLOWERING
        look to Indiana.

                                        GUTTERBUHG
                        Very well. My friends will be here
                        soon. They will rest...enjoy the
                        pleasures of my newfound kingdom...
                                (kisses a woman, and
                                pushes her away)
                        Then we shall exterminate these
                        worthless people! Destroy their
                        City! And we will carry away all of
                        its riches...in pieces.

        Gutterbuhg goes back to his FOOD. Scraggy exchanges a WORRIED GLANCE
        with Indiana.

                                                                        CUT TO:

        THE NAZI ARMY

        TRAVELLING along the narrow mountain path. They are more than HALFWAY
        up the mountain. LIEUT. MEPHISTO rides in the FRONT JEEP. He LOOKS to
        his driver, who REPORTS to Mephisto.

                                        DRIVER
                                (German, English
                                subtitles)
                        Sir... We shall reach the mountain
                        top in less than sixty minutes.

        Mephisto NODS. ANXIOUS.

                                                                        CUT TO:

        THE LOST CITY - COLISEUM

        An enormous STONE ARENA. Located in the CENTER of the City. It
        resembles the ROMAN COLISEUM in size and structure. The coliseum's top
        walls are SURROUNDED by countless, large METAL BELLS. The bells are
        RINGING. They are the same bells we heard earlier...but they now sound
        EERIE... THREATENING. The many seats are FILLED with members of the
        village. All GATHERED for a special event.

        Gutterbuhg sits in the elaborate RULER'S BOX. It is covered with a
        protective, GOLDEN GRATING. The box is located directly above the
        earthen PLAYING FIELD. Indy's WHIP is still tied around Scraggy's
        neck, who kneels at Gutterbuhg's FEET.

        TWO GUARDS lead a shirtless INDIANA JONES onto the playing field. They
        bring Indy to a STEEL CAGE, located directly below Gutterbuhg's box.
        Inside of the cage, are TWO ENORMOUS BUFFALO. ANGRY. RESTLESS.

        Betsy, Clare, Tyki, Kezure, the remaining Pirates and Crew members,
        all helplessly watch from inside of a LARGE METAL CAGE. The cage is
        SUSPENDED in the air... DANGLING over a deep pit. It is filled with
        COUNTLESS MANEATING TIGERS.

        Indy is LED into the cage. BETWEEN the two buffalo. The guards GRABS
        HOLD of Indiana. They TIE one of his arms, and one of his legs, to
        EACH SIDW of the buffalo. Preparing to DRAW and QUARTER Indiana.

        A DELIGHTED Gutterbuhg PEERS DOWN at Indiana.

                                        GUTTERBUHG
                        Doctor Jones... Those beasts are
                        anxious to run wild. Free.
                                (vicious smile)
                        How long will you be able to ride...
                        before they TEAR YOU IN TWO?

        Indy LOOKS at Scraggy, who is very FRIGHTENED.

                                        GUTTERBUHG
                        Goodbye, Doctor Jones.

        Gutterbuhg TURNS to the guards. Ready to give them the ORDER...to OPEN
        THE CAGE and SET THE BUFFALO FREE! Indy suddenly SCREAMS.

                                        INDIANA
                        Heil Hitler!

        Upon hearing the words, Gutterbuhg STANDS. Like a ROBOT. He RAISES his
        mechanical arm in a "Heil Hitler" POSE.

                                        GUTTERBUHG
                        Heil Hitler!

        The FINGERS of Gutterbuhg's mechanical arm get CAUGHT IN THE METAL
        GRATING ABOVE HIS HEAD! Gutterbuhg TRIES TO REMOVE his fingers. NO
        GOOD. STUCK. Gutterbuhg PULLS. HARD. His mechanical arm is RIPPED FROM
        ITS SOCKET! It DANGLES from the grating.

        The crowd WATCHES. PUZZLED. SHOCKED.

        Scraggy THINKS FAST. He LEAPS to his feet and GRABS the arm. He TEARS
        IT OUT of the grating. Scraggy HOLDS the arm above his head. Now it is
        HE who possesses the POWER! The crowd CHEERS Scraggy! Their NEW RULER!

        Gutterbuhg STEPS BACK. Suddenly FRIGHTENED. Scraggy ORDERS the guards
        to FREE Indiana. The guards hurriedly UNTIE Indy from the buffalo.
        Gutterbuhg TURNS. RUNNING out of the Coliseum. Scraggy SCREAMS to the
        people, motioning for them to FOLLOW Gutterbuhg. Several people LEAP
        from their seats. CHASING the Nazi.

        EXT. COLISEUM

        Gutterbuhg DASHES OUT! A CROWD OF VILLAGERS follow him. In HOT
        PURSUIT. Gutterbuhg RUNS toward the city gates. He RUNS through.
        ESCAPING the City. The crowd PAUSES. STOPPING. They'll go NO FURTHER.
        They SCREAM and SHOUT at the departing Gutterbuhg, who disappears INTO
        THE MOUNTAINS.

        INT. COLISEUM

        Indiana REJOINS his friends on the playing field. They have been FREED
        from the cage. Scraggy gives the WHIP to Indy. Indy is IMPATIENT.
        WORRIED. He LOOKS at everyone.

                                        INDIANA
                        Nazis'll be be here soon. We gotta
                        move fast.

        Scraggy gives Gutterbuhg's MECAHNICAL ARM to Tyki. The pygmy NODS. He
        UNDERSTANDS. Tyki RAISES THE ARM TOWARD THE PEOPLE. They CHEER Tyki,
        their rightful ruler. Tyki, PULLS BACK and THROWS the mechanical arm.
        HIGH INTO THE AIR! It SOARS several feet! FLYING OVER the coliseum
        walls.

        EXT. CITY

        The arm flies THROUGH the air... It lands into the MOAT! The arm is
        ATTACKED by a horde of hungry sharks. They TEAR it to pieces.

                                                                        CUT TO:

        EXT. MOUNTAIN PATH

        The Nazis have arrived at the section of path that is BLOCKED by the
        AVALANCHE. Their other VEHICLES and TROOPS have pulled back. A FEW
        HUNDRED FEET from the AVALANCHE. SEVERAL STICKS OF DYNAMITE have been
        placed beneath the avalanche. The T.N.T. is connected to a LONG FUSE,
        that extends along the path. LIEUT. MEPHISTO stands at the fuse's end.
        He STRIKES a match. Preparing to LIGHT THE FUSE. The match flare is
        INCHES from the fuse... Mephisto is INTERRUPTED by a FAMILIAR VOICE.
        It is GUTTERBUHG. Mephisto BLOWS OUT the match.

        A SOAKING WET Sgt. Gutterbuhg SLIDES down the edge of the ravine. He
        still wears the COLORFUL, ELABORATE ROBES of Bohbala. Mephisto is
        PUZZLED by Gutterbuhg's BIZARRE APPEARANCE. Gutterbuhg STOPS in front
        of Mephisto. Gutterbuhg ATTEMPTS a "Heil, Hitler"... but suddenly
        realizes that his mechanical arm is GONE. Gutterbuhg DRIPS WATER all
        over Mephisto, who is DISGUSTED by the appearance of his officer. He
        SLAPS Gutterbuhg.

                                        MEPHISTO
                                (German; English
                                subtitles)
                        Idiot!... Why are you dressed like
                        that!... Where is your uniform?...

        Before he can answer, Gutterbuhg is SHOVED AWAY by the disgusted
        Mephisto, who ATTEMPTS to LIGHT the fuse. But his matches are USELESS.
        Soaked with WATER. Furious, Mephisto SLAPS Gutterbuhg, ordering him to
        fetch something. The snivelling Gutterbuhg nods and bows, SCURRYING
        away. He RUNS into the rear of A CANVAS TRUCK.

        INT. TRUCK

        Filled with several crates of DYNAMITE and SUPPLIES. Gutterbuhg DASHES
        inside. Toward a SILVER, METALLIC BRIEFCASE that rests in the rear of
        the truck. Gutterbuhg's greasy fingers OPEN the briefcase.

        Inside, encased in black velvet, are TWO RECTANGULAR COMPARTMENTS. One
        of the compartments is EMPTY. The other houses another MECHANICAL ARM.
        Gutterbuhg quickly ATTACHES the arm to the stub of his shoulder and
        RUNS BACK OUTSIDE.

        EXT. MOUNTAIN PATH

        Gutterbuhg REJOINS Mephisto and EXTENDS his new mechanical arm TOWARD
        THE FUSE. Gutterbuhg POINTS his finger. He SQUEEZES A LEVER, located
        on the palm of the mechanical arm. A BRIGHT, JAGGED LINE OF ELECTRICAL
        CURRENT shoots from the arm's finger! The electricity LIGHTS the fuse.
        It BURNS. Moving TOWARD the dynamite. Gutterbuhg and Mephisto HIDE
        behind a rock. There is a LOUD EXPLOSION. Rocks and debris FLY THROUGH
        THE AIR. The path is CLEARED.

        INT. CITY

        The SOUND OF THE EXPLOSION echoes through the City. SHAKING the city
        walls. The Nazis are CLOSE.

        Indiana STANDS in the city square. He has ASSEMBLED everyone for the
        battle. Tyki and the pygmies are armed with BOWS and ARROWS, SPEARS
        and BLOW PIPES. Kezure and the Pirates hold their SWORDS. Scraggy's
        men carry REVOLVERS and DAGGERS. Clare and Betsy STAND with several
        Gorillas. Tyki WHISPERS to Scraggy, who TRANSLATES for Indiana.

                                        SCRAGGY
                        They want you to give speech.

                                        INDIANA
                        What?!?...

                                        SCRAGGY
                        Before battle... General always give
                        speech to inspire troops.

                                        INDIANA
                        General?... Who the hell do they
                        think I am... Custer?...

        But ALL EYES are on Indiana. DEPENDING on him. Indy SIGHS. Trying to
        THINK of something to say. He MUMBLES to Scraggy.

                                        INDIANA
                        Geez... The only speeches I remember
                        are from college...when I played
                        ball...

        Scraggy SHRUGS. Indy CLEARS his throat. He LOOKS at everyone.
        FUMBLING.

                                        INDIANA
                        Men...and, ah...women... I...ah...
                        We're about to face one of our
                        toughest opponents... They've got
                        size...hardware...and well, quite
                        frankly...we're the underdogs...

        Indy's eyes LIGHT. A moment of INSPIRATION. The background MUSIC
        SLOWLY BEGINS TO RISE. Indy's voice becomes LOUDER. TOUGHER.

                                        INDIANA
                        But...well, if it wasn't for the
                        little guy...where would this
                        country be?...
                                (excited, louder)
                        I mean...I knew this little guy once
                        ...a scrawny runt, with thick black
                        glasses and about 300 different
                        kinds of allergies... But this
                        little kid had a dream... He wanted
                        to be on the football team.
                                (Music rises, so does
                                Indy's voice)
                        Well, all the big guys made his life
                        miserable...always shoving his head
                        in the drinking fountain...putting
                        mustard in his pants...throwing me
                        ...'er, HIM!...throwing HIM in the
                        shower with all his clothes on...
                                (louder, heartfelt)
                        But that little guy didn't quit. Be
                        worked hard. Never gave up. And in
                        two years...he was the Quarterback.
                        Star of the team. And you know why?...
                                (Music SOARS, as does
                                Indy's voice)
                        'Cause that little kid had somethin'
                        that those big guys never heard
                        of... He had HEART! And nothin' can
                        stop that! Nothin'!
                                (we hear the Nazis
                                approaching, Indy
                                screams)
                        Now let's go out there and show 'em
                        JUST HOW TOUGH THE LITTLE GUYS ARE!

        Everyone breaks into a loud CHEER. Ready to FIGHT. The sound track
        music SOARS. Indiana RAISES HIS SWORD. He TURNS and RUNS toward the
        DRAWBRIDGE. The people FOLLOW, as Indy LEADS THEM INTO BATTLE!

        EXT. CITY

        Indiana, armed with a shield, sword and pistol, LEADS his troops
        forward. The Nazis are APPROACHING. LIEUT. MEPHISTO rides in the front
        jeep, which is mounted with a large RECOILIST MACHINE GUN. The entire
        Nazi army is BEHIND HIM. Mephisto's jeep begins to CROSS the
        drawbridge. Moving TOWARD Indiana and the others. The recoilist
        machine gunner OPENS FIRE on Indy and the troops.

        Bullets BOUNCE from Indy's shield. Several of the pygmies are HIT.
        FALLING to the drawbridge. An angry pygmy THROWS his spear. It HITS
        the machine gunner. THROUGH the heart.

        The jeep continues to DRIVE FORWARD. HEADED straight for Indiana, who
        LEAPS ONTO the jeep's hood. Indy's troops SPLIT INTO GROUPS. Dashing
        around the speeding jeep to BATTLE the oncoming Nazis.

        Indiana CRAWLS along the jeep hood. TOWARD the Nazis. Mephisto
        attempts to SHOOT Indy. The bullets ZIP through the windshield.
        WHIZZING by Indy's head. Indiana GRABS Mephisto. He PULLS the Nazi
        over the windshield. Indiana and Mephisto TUMBLE along the jeep's
        hood. FIGHTING. STRUGGLING for the gun.

        The jeep DIRECTLY BEHIND Mephisto is filled with several CRATES OF
        DYNAMITE. GUTTERBUHG, back in uniform, rides here with THREE NAZI
        SOLDIERS. As the pygmy troops come forward, Gutterbuhg EXTENDS HIS
        MECHANICAL ARM. He ZAPS several of the pygmies. KILLING them with
        deadly JOLTS OF ELECTRICITY.

        As the jeep PASSES through the City gates, Indiana and Mephisto
        continue to BATTLE along the hood.

        INT. CITY

        Mephisto ATTEMPTS TO SHOOT Indiana. But Indy PUSHES AWAY the Nazi's
        arm. The gun FIRES. HITTING the jeep driver, who SLUMPS over the
        wheel. The speeding jeep SPINS OUT OF CONTROL. It FLIPS. Sending
        Indiana and Mephisto FLYING through the air. They TUMBLE to the
        ground. The jeep CRASHES into a wall.

        A SHAKEN Indiana gets to his feet. Mephisto LIES A few feet away. OUT
        COLD. Suddenly, a BLAST OF ELECTRICITY BURSTS INTO FRAME! SPARKING the
        ground beside Indiana. Indy TURNS and sees GUTTERBUBG! The Nazi's jeep
        has ENTERED the city. Gutterbuhg POINTS his mechanical arm toward
        Indy. ANOTHER ELECTRICAL SHOCK ejects from his finger. Indy DIVES. The
        shock TEARS A SMOLDERING HOLE through the building behind him. Only
        INCHES above Indy.

        Meanwhile, the Nazis begin to UNLOAD the dynamite from Gutterbubg's
        jeep. They UNWRAP a long, section of FUSE from a large coil. Placing
        the fuse ALONG THE GROUND.

        Indiana is RUNNING for his life. Gutterbuhg is DIRECTLY BEHIND him. In
        HOT PURSUIT. The Nazi continuously FIRES ELECTRICAL SHOTS at Indiana.
        The thin lines of electricity WHIZ by Indy's HEAD. His ARMS. His LEGS.
        JUST MISSING INDY. A CAT AND MOUSE CHASE BEGINS, as Gutterbuhg PURSUES
        Indiana throughout the city.

                                                                        CUT TO:

        TYKI AND SEVERAL PYGMIES

        They have CLIMBED to the top of the City Walls. From here, they GUARD
        and DEFEND their city. Crowds of NAZI TROOPS are on foot. Running
        TOWARD the city walls. The pygmies SHOWER the Nazis with ARROWS,
        SPEARS and POISINOUS DARTS. The Nazis fight back with MACHINE GUNS and
        RIFLES. A HEATED, BLOODY BATTLE.

                                                                        CUT TO:

        SCRAGGY AND THE CREW MEMBERS

        They stand at the CITY GATE. PROTECTING the City entrance. They
        hurriedly load a large, wooden CATAPULT with a huge BALL OF HAY. A
        crew member TORCHES the hay. It BURSTS INTO FLAME. Scraggy CRIES
        "Fire!" His men LAUNCH the fireball. It SAILS over the City Walls.

        THE FIREBALL

        LANDS directly onto a speeding NAZI JEEP. The Nazis and jeep CATCH
        FIRE! The vehicle LOSES CONTROL. The flaming jeep CRASHES into the
        side of a mountain wall.

                                                                        CUT TO:

        A NAZI TANK

        ROLLS toward the city. Its GUN BARREL aimed at the city walls. CAMERA
        PANS AWAY, SEVERAL FEET AHEAD OF THE TANK. CAMERA MOVES UPWARD, TO THE
        MOUNTAIN TOP, ABOVE the path. CLARE is here. A GROUP OF GORILLAS are
        beside her. The apes each have a TIGHT HOLD of individual sections of
        HANGING VINE. They stand at the EDGE OF THE RAVINE. Clare LOOKS to the
        OPPOSITE RAVINE. BETSY is here. She stands with ANOTHER GROUP OF
        GORILLAS, who also securely bold lengths of vine.

        On the mountain path, the Nazi tank PASSES DIRECTLY BENEATH Betsy and
        Clare. The two women TURN to the Gorillas. Emitting Gorilla GRUNTS,
        MOANS and MOTIONS, Betsy and Clare COMMUNICATE with the apes. The
        Gorillas LISTEN. NODDING. UNDERSTANDING. When the tank is DIRECTLY
        BELOW... Betsy and Clare ORDER the Gorillas to JUMP!

        The apes SWING from the mountain. RIDING the vines. TOWARD the tank.
        The Gorillas LAND on the tank. They CLIMB aboard. EXPLORING the tank's
        surface.

        INT. TANK

        FILLED with Nazis. The gunner looks into the PERISCOPE. He is met with
        the reflection of a SNARLING GORILLA'S FACE. He SCREAMS and JUMPS
        BACK.

        There is a sound of RIPPING METAL. Suddenly, the tank's top HATCH is
        TORN OPEN. COUNTLESS GORILLAS pour inside! The apes ATTACK.
        OVERPOWERING the Nazis.

        EXT. TANK

        As the Gorillas climb inside of the tank, Betsy SWINGS across the
        passageway to Clare. She EXCHANGES a congratulatory handshake with
        Clare. Betsy's face suddenly goes WHITE. A SHOCKING SIGHT.

        A GROUP OF NAZIS have climbed to the mountain top. The soldiers SPOT
        Clare and Betsy. They RUN TOWARD the women. Betsy and Clare DASH OFF.
        Into the THICK of the jungle. The Nazis FOLLOW. In HOT PURSUIT.

                                                                        CUT TO:

        TWO LARGE CANVAS TRUCKS

        BARRELLING along the mountain path. KEZURE, the Pirate King, LEAPS
        from the side of the path, between the two trucks. Kezure climbs onto
        the REAR BUMPER of the FIRST TRUCK. The DRIVER of the SECOND TRUCK
        spots Kezure. He begins to FIRE SHOTS at the Pirate King. As bullets
        whiz by him, Kezure hurriedly removes a thick METAL CHAIN from around
        his neck. He securely CONNECTS the two truck BUMPERS with the chain.

        INT. SECOND TRUCK

        Filled with NAZI TROOPS. SEATED. ARMED. Waiting to FIGHT. There is a
        sudden RIPPING SOUND. Followed by ANOTHER. And ANOTHER. The NAZIS are
        STARTLED to see the BLADES OF COUNTLESS SWORDS. PIERCING the canvas.
        Through all SIDES of the truck. SEVERAL PIRATES leap through the
        canvas. ATTACKING the Nazis. The Nazis FIGHT BACK with bayonets and
        daggers.

        INT. FIRST TRUCK - CABIN

        Two Pirates BURST into the cabin. They STAB the Nazi driver. The
        CACKLING Pirates take control of the steering wheel. They madly STEER
        the truck toward the steep EDGE of the mountain path.

        THE FIRST TRUCK

        PLUMMETS over the eage. The second truck, ATTACHED by the metal chain,
        FOLLOWS the first truck. The two canvas trucks FALL into the moat!
        SPLASHING into the shark infestea waters!

                                                                        CUT TO:

        INT. CITY

        The Nazis have planted an enormous PILE OF DYNAMITE on the palace
        stairs. Enough to DESTROY the entire city. The T.N.T. is attached to a
        LONG FUSE, that stretches hundreds of feet, over VARIOUS SECTIONS of
        the city. The Nazis LIGHT the fuse end. It SPARKS. IGNITES. BURNING
        FAST. The Nazis TURN and RUN.

        Gutterbuhg continues to CHASE Indiana. BLASTS OF ELECTRICITY SHOOT
        from the Nazi's arm. Indy DUCKS... DODGES... AVOIDING the electrical
        jolts. Indy SPINS around a building corner. He spots the BURNING FUSE.
        It STRETCHES along the ground, moving up OVER a wooden fence. Indy
        DIVES and STOMPS OUT the fuse. But Gutterbuhg, who is directly behind
        Indy, RELIGHTS the fuse with a shot of electricity. Before Indy has a
        chance to stop the fuse...Gutterbuhg AIMS at Indy. Indy LEAPS OVER the
        fence. Gutterbuhg SHOOTS. The fence is SPLINTERED by the powerful
        electrical blast.

        Indiana runs into a small ALLEYWAY. The burning fuse STRETCHES up
        along the alley wall, moving to the ROOFTOP. Indy begins to climb the
        ancient golden bricks that PROTRUDE from the wall. TOWARD the roof.
        Gutterbuhg APPEARS. He SHOOTS at Indiana, who avoids the blast by
        LEAPING onto the roof. Gutterbuhg hurriedly begins to CLIMB the wall.
        FOLLOWING Indiana.

        EXT. ROOFTOP

        Gutterbuhg ARRIVES at the top. He LOOKS around. There is NO SIGN of
        Indy. But the fuse RESTS at the roof's edge. UNLIT. Gutterbuhg
        RESTARTS the fuse. At that moment, Indiana LEAPS OUT from inside of
        the stone smokestack. He JUMPS the unsuspecting Gutterbuhg. They
        TUMBLE and FALL OFF the rooftop edge.

        Indiana and Gutterbuhg HIT the ground. They continue to STRUGGLE...
        FIGHT...as the fuse BURNS in front of them. It SPEEDS toward the pile
        of dynamite. Less than FIFTY FEET AHEAD. Still wrestling with
        Gutterbuhg, Indy ROLLS toward the fuse. Indy reaches out and STOPS THE
        FUSE with his hand. But Gutterbuhg MOVES FAST. Again, the Nazi
        RELIGHTS the fuse.

        Indy suddenly LEAPS to his feet. He RUNS OFF SCREEN. Gutterbuhg
        FOLLOWS. The fuse continues to BURN. Moving CLOSER...CLOSER...to the
        dynamite.

        Indiana runs to a CLUSTER OF TREES. He comes to an abrupt stop,
        between TWO TREES. Gutterbuhg is UPON HIM. The Nazi PAUSES. Only a FEW
        FEET from Indy. Gutterbuhg POINTS his arm at Indy. A CLEAR SHOT.
        Gutterbuhg SMILES. Indiana is TRAPPED.

        THE FUSE is now only a FEW FEET from the dynamite. It will BLOW at any
        second!

        Gutterbuhg SHOOTS. Moving like LIGHTNING, Indy LEAPS OUT OF THE WAY,
        revealing a LARGE LAKE behind him. It's TOO LATE for Gutterbubg. The
        electrical current HITS THE WATER. The Nazi's body SURGES with
        electricity. Gutterbuhg FRIES. He SHIVERS. SHAKES. FROZEN, as the
        powerful electrical current FLOWS through his veins. SMOKE billows
        from his body. His mechanical arm suddenly EXPLODES. Gutterbuhg's
        charred body FALLS. FACE DOWN. ELECTROCUTED.

        Indiana LEAPS TO HIS FEET. Suddenly remembering... THE FUSE! It is now
        INCHES from the T.N.T. Indy can't get to it IN TIME. He GRABS his
        whip. His arm SNAPS FORWARD. The whip CRACKS. It SLICES the remaining
        fuse in two. The fuse FIZZLES and GOES OUT. The city is SAVED. Indy
        SIGHS. There is a GUNSHOT! A BULLET whizzes by Indy's head. He TURNS.

        MEPHISTO, bruised and bloodied from the jeep accident, stands SEVERAL
        FEET AWAY. Mephisto's LUGER is aimed at Indy. Prepared to take ANOTHER
        SHOT. Indy removes his REVOLVER. He FIRES at Mephisto. The Nazi DASHES
        into the COLISEUM. Indiana FOLLOWS.

                                                                        CUT TO:

        TYKI

        BATTLING the oncoming Nazis with his sword. Tyki fights HARD. FAST. He
        manages to DEFEAT many Nazis. But the sword is suddenly KNOCKED from
        Tyki's hand. A TROOP OF NAZIS come toward him. Their eyes MURDEROUS.
        Tyki is TRAPPED. HELPLESS.

        INT. CITY

        Scraggy and his crew members load ANOTHER FIREBALL onto the catapult.
        Scraggy cries "FIRE!" The fireball FLIES over the city walls. It lands
        DIRECTLY IN FRONT of the Nazi troops who are about to attack Tyki.
        Many of the soldiers CATCH FIRE. The others RUN from the flames. Tyki
        is UNHURT. He REJOINS his friends in the battle.

                                                                        CUT TO:

        CLARE AND BETSY

        BREATHLESS...FRIGHTENED...they continue to RUN through the jungle. The
        Nazis are a few feet BEHIND THEM. Moving FAST. Getting CLOSER. The
        women turn a corner, scramble through a section of bushes and find
        themselves face to face with...ANOTHER TROOP OF NAZIS.

        Clare and Betsy STOP. TRAPPED. SURROUNDED by Nazis. The soldiers MOVE
        TOWARD the women. The Nazis eyes are LECHEROUS. HUNGRY. Clare WHISPERS
        to a TREMBLING Betsy.

                                        CLARE
                        Do exactly what I do.

        Betsy NODS. The Nazis MOVE CLOSER. Clare looks to the SKY. She begins
        to make BIZARRE...HIGH PITCHED...NOISES. A CONFUSED Betsy makes the
        same noises. The Nazis LOOK at each other and CHUCKLE. The women
        CONTINUE to make the sounds.

        Suddenly, the exact sound seems to ECHO FROM THE SKY. It becomes
        LOUDER... LOUDER... But it belongs to A HUNDRED VOICES. The Nazis
        PAUSE. Looking UPWARD. PUZZLED.

        There is a SPLATTERING OF BIRDS. They ATTACK from above. The birds'
        screeching is IDENTICAL to Clare and Betsy's calls. The angry birds
        ATTACK THE NAZIS. PECKING. SCRATCHING. BITING. Clare and Betsy
        CONTINUE to make the sounds, which causes the birds to IGNORE THEM.
        The Nazis SCREAM. DROPPING their weapons. FALLING to their knees. Each
        soldier is COVERED with birds. They are being TORN TO SHREDS. Clare
        and Betsy TURN and RUN. ESCAPING into the jungle. The Nazis' screaming
        ECHOES behind them. As they run, Clare EXPLAINS to Betsy.

                                        CLARE
                        I made the sound of a baby Swandola
                        bird, crying for help... The Mother
                        birds immediately reply to the cries
                        ...angrily protecting their
                        children, and murdering the baby's
                        attackers.

                                                                        CUT TO:

        THE TWO CANVAS TRUCKS

        They crookedly FLOAT along the shark infested moat waters. The
        battered, bruised trucks now resemble two sinking PIRATE SHIPS. Kezure
        and the Pirates BATTLE the Nazis along the truck frames. The pirates
        fight in their element... WATER! With fast SWINGING SWORDS, the
        Pirates are defeating the Nazis. Several Nazis fall INTO THE WATER and
        are immediately ATTACKED by countless SHARKS.

        At one point, Kezure FALLS INTO THE WATER. Several SHARKS come for
        him. The Pirate King DISAPPEARS beneath the water surface. A few of
        his men PAUSE. WORRIED. AFRAID. Suddenly, Kezure LEAPS OUT OF THE
        WATER. He holds a LIVE SHARK in his hands. The crazed Kezure TAKES A
        BITE from the shark. He TOSSES the fish back into the water. Kezure
        CHEWS ana SWALLOWS the raw shark meat. BLOOD spills down his chin.
        Kezure resumes his FIGHTING with the Nazis, as the two truck frames
        continue to SINK.

                                                                        CUT TO:

        INT. TANK

        Several Nazis are SPRAWLED on the tank floor. UNCONSCIOUS. UNDRESSED.
        CAMERA PANS UPWARD. The Gorillas have TAKEN CONTROL of the tank. They
        have DRESSED THEMSELVES IN NAZI UNIFORMS!

        EXT. TANK

        As the battle RAGES around them, the Gorilla's tank makes a sudden
        U-TURN. It heads straight for the SECOND NAZI TANK.

        INT. SECOND TANK

        The Nazis stare through their PERISCOPE. Puzzled by the sight of their
        own tank COMING TOWARD THEM.

        EXT. TANK

        The Gorilla's tank FIRES A DIRECT SHOT at the other Nazi tank. BLAM!
        The Nazis' tank is BLOWN TO SMITHEREENS.

        INT. GORILLA TANK

        The Gorillas break into a VICTORIOUS CHEER. JUMPING. SCREAMING.

                                                                        CUT TO:

        INT. COLISEUM

        Indiana WALKS across the coliseum floor. REVOLVER in hand. He moves
        SLOWLY. CAUTIOUSLY. He is looking for a SIGN of Mephisto. But
        everything is SILENT. CALM. DESERTED.

        Mephisto SNEAKS along the top wall of the coliseum. HIDING behind the
        row of surrounding BELLS. The Nazi UNLATCHES the chain that holds all
        of the bells in place. The bells begin to FALL. THUNDERING down the
        coliseum stairs.

        Indy COVERS his ears. The sound of countless CLANGING BELLS is nearly
        deafening. He TURNS. Seeing the enormous bells ROLLING TOWARD HIM!
        Indiana begins to RUN. GIANT ROLLING BELLS CHASE HIM FROM ALL
        DIRECTIONS! Indy TWISTS...TURNS...LEAPS...in an effort to avoid being
        CRUSHED by the heavy bells.

        Mephisto WATCHES from above. SMILING.

        Indy CONTINUES to run. A giant ROLLING BELL chases him from behind.
        The bell GAINS SPEED. Getting CLOSER. CLOSER. A few feet in front of
        Indy...is the deadly TIGER PIT. But Indy CAN'T STOP RUNNING, or he'll
        be CRUSHED by the bell. Indiana LEAPS INTO THE PIT! The bell ROLLS
        DIRECTLY OVER the pit.

        But Indiana is SAFE. There is a FIVE INCH DROP from the ground, to the
        pit's OVERHEAD METAL BARS. Indy LIES on the bars. SAFELY above the
        countless TIGERS.

        The bells have all COME TO A STOP. They LIE around the coliseum
        ground. STILL. Only one bell GENTLY ROCKS. It slowly TEETERS on the
        coliseum stairs. It HASN'T yet rolled off.

        Indiana begins to CLIMB OUT out of the pit, when suddenly... ANOTHER
        GUNSHOT RINGS OUT. Indy is HIT. In the CHEST. He SLIPS. FALLS. Bis
        wounded body is SPRAWLED on the bars. TEETERING. Ready to FALL into
        the waiting tigers.

        Mephisto's luger is SMOKING. The Nazi WALKS down the coliseum stairs.
        He moves TOWARD Indiana. Seeing Mephisto heading for him... Indiana
        REMOVES his gun. He AIMS at the Nazi. But Indy's vision is BLURRED.
        His hand TREMBLES. Mephisto's silhouette nears... But the bullet ZIPS
        PAST Mephisto and STRIKES a section of wood below the teetering bell.
        This causes the bell to FALL...and slowly ROLL forward.

        Mephisto ARRIVES at the edge of the Tiger Pit. He is about to shoot
        Indy...then comes upon ANOTHER IDEA. Mephisto LOWERS the luger. He
        gives a SWIFT KICK to Indy's ribs. Indiana FALLS THROUGH the bars. His
        arm SHOOTS OUT. With his last bit of strength, Indy's hand GRABS HOLD
        of a bar. CLUTCHING on for dear life. His body DANGLES over the
        tigers. They SNAP at his legs. HUNGRY. GROWLING. Mephisto SMILES. He
        STEPS on Indy's fingers. GRINDING them beneath his boot heel. Indy
        CRIES OUT... He's going to FALL...

        Mephisto PAUSES. He HEARS something behind him. A CLANGING BELL.
        Getting CLOSER. LOUDER. Mephisto TURNS. He sees the GIANT BELL. COMING
        at him. Only INCHES AWAY. There is NO TIME to move. The bell ROLLS
        OVER MEPHISTO. KNOCKING him INTO THE PIT.

        Mephisto FALLS through the bars. INSIDE the pit. INTO the middle of
        the hungry tigers. Mephisto SCREAMS. The tigers are UPON HIM. The Nazi
        is RIPPED TO SHREDS. Within seconds, his screams are a MEMORY.

        A very WEAK Indiana still clutches the bar. He manages to BOOST
        himself out of the pit. He takes a FEW STEPS. WOBBLING. BLOOD pours
        from the wound in his chest. He STUMBLES. To his KNEES. His eyes ROLL
        BACK. He FALLS to the ground. His body is STILL. MOTIONLESS.

                                                                        CUT TO:

        INT. TANK

        The Gorillas, still dressed as NAZIS, continue to DRIVE THE TANK
        FORWARD.

        EXT. TANK

        The tank SPEEDS TOWARD THE ROWS OF CHARGING NAZI TROOPS. The Nazis
        STOP. SHOCKED to see their own tank coming at them. But the tank
        continues to BARREL AHEAD. Many of the Nazis are CRUSHED beneath the
        heavy tank treads. Others DROP their weapons and RUN. FRIGHTENED.

        INT. TANK

        The Gorillas are ECSTATIC. HOWLING. CHEERING.

                                                                        CUT TO:

        KEZURE AND THE PIRATES

        They have DEFEATED all of the Nazis. One of the canvas trucks has
        completely SUNK. Only a small section of the other truck JUTS OUT of
        the water. The Pirates CLING to the fleeting safety of the sinking
        truck frame, which is surrounded by several HUNGRY SHARKS. There are
        even TOO MANY maneaters for the powerful Kezure to handle. As the
        frame continues to SINK...the Pirates' feet get CLOSER...CLOSER...to
        the snapping sharks...

        Suddenly, a ROPE DROPS FROM OVERHEAD! Kezure LOOKS UP. SCRAGGY and his
        crew members stand on the DRAWBRIDGE. They have DROPPED the line.
        Kezure and the Pirates CLIMB upward. To SAFETY.

        On the drawbridge, Scraggy ASSISTS Kezure. Scraggy SMILES, repeating
        Kezure's earlier threat.

                                        SCRAGGY
                        You owe me, old man.

        Kezure LAUGHS. He EMBRACES Scraggy. They are joined by TYKI and the
        OTHER PYGMIES. A sudden CALM...a sudden SILENCE...overcomes the city.
        The battle has ENDED. The Nazis have been DEFEATED. The city is SAVED.
        But Tyki is SOLEMN. DISTRESSED. He STARES OFF SCREEN. CAMERA PANS TO
        HIS P.O.V. We see the countless BODIES OF PYGMIES. SPRAWLED on the
        ground. DEAD. The price you pay for FREEDOM. Suddenly, the silence is
        INTERRUPTED. Someone is CRYING. It is BETSY.

        Scraggy looks OFF SCREEN, to the direction of the sounds. The color
        LEAVES his face.

        SCRAGGY'S P.O.V.

        A group of pygmies CARRY the limp body of Indiana Jones out of the
        coliseum. They GENTLY LOWER Indy's body to the ground. Clare and Betsy
        KNEEL beside Indy. TEARS run down Betsy's face.

        Scraggy suddenly BREAKS AWAY from the crowd. CAMERA DOLLIES WITH HIM
        as he runs toward Indy. Scraggy STOPS at Indy's body. Clare, eyes
        FILLED with tears NODS to Scraggy. She can BARELY utter the words...

                                        CLARE
                        He's...dead...

        TEARS erupt in Scraggy's eyes. He breaks down CRYING. A startled
        KEZURE joins the others. CAMERA PULLS BACK to an extremely LONG SHOT.
        The entire village GATHERS around Indiana's body. Everyone is SOLEMN.
        SILENT.

                                                                        A SLOW DISSOLVE:

        CLOSE-UP: INDIANA'S BODY.

        It is LYING in state. Resting on a BAMBOO STRETCHER. It is covered
        with EXOTIC, COLORFUL FLOWERS. CAMERA PULLS BACK. Indy is being
        carried by several, elaborately dressed PYGMIES. At the head of a long

        FUNERAL PROCESSION. Betsy, Clare, Scraggy and Kezure MARCH beside
        Indy's body. They also wear the ceremonial FUNERAL FLOWERS. Behind
        them, the body of BOHBALA is being carried. And behind the ruler, the
        bodies of all DEAD PYGMIES are being carried by the remaining
        VILLAGERS and GORILLAS. It is NIGHTIME. All mourners are carrying
        FLICKERING CANDLES. At the rear of the procession, a lone pygmy strums
        an UNUSUAL STRING INSTRUMENT. This creates a HAUNTING melody.

        CAMERA PULLS BACK TO A LONG SHOT, as we see the procession move
        through the city. The hundreds of flickering candles against the dark
        night sky create a BEAUTIFUL IMAGE. The procession arrives at a large
        STONE WALL. It appears to be a DEAD END. Tyki WALKS to the wall.

        He FALLS to his knees and begins to CHANT. Clare, Betsy, Scraggy and
        Kezure WATCH. There is a SMALL RUMBLE. A hairline CRACK begins to form
        in the mountain. As if it were being DRAWN by an invisible hand, the
        crack forms a LARGE DOOR in the wall. The door slowly OPENS. An almost
        BLINDING WHlTE LIGHT emanates from inside. Tyki ENTERS. The procession
        FOLLOWS.

        INT. WALL

        The procession ascends a TWISTING STONE STAIRCASE, that spirals
        upward, where the light becomes BRIGHTER... BRIGHTER... At the
        stairway top, there is ANOTHER DOORWAY. Tyki and the others ENTER.
        Indiana's body is CARRIED through.

        THE GARDEN OF IMMORTAL PEACHES!

        A breathtakingly beautiful forest of never ending luscious green
        trees, filled with succulent, ripe PEACHES. We have never seen COLORS
        like this. So MAGICAL...so INTENSE... Bright SUNLIGHT shines from a
        vivid blue sky. There is always a RAINBOW here. The procession ENTERS.
        Scraggy, Clare, Betsy and Kezure stare in total WONDERMENT. Betsy is
        PUZZLED by the bright sunlight.

                                        BETSY
                        But... It's... It's the middle of
                        the night...

        Tyki WHISPERS to Scraggy, who explains to Betsy.

                                        SCRAGGY
                        Sun always shine in the Garden of
                        Immortal Peaches.

        Clare NODS. Kezure is MESMERIZED by the peach trees. His mouth HANGS
        OPEN. He TURNS to Scraggy.

                                        KEZURE
                        These are the peaches that make one
                        ...forever young?...

        Scraggy NODS. Tyki LEADS the procession to a clearing in the garden.
        Many freshly dug GRAVES are here. All of the bodies are carried to
        SEPARATE GRAVES, including Indiana And Bohbala.

        A few feet ahead of the graves, rests the LARGEST PEACH TREE in the
        forest. It is much WIDER and TALLER than the others. There is a small,
        glass encased TOMB built into the tree. Inside of the tomb, is a TINY
        SKELETON. No more than FOUR FEET TALL. The skeleton is adorned with a
        LION SKINNED ROBE and golden CROWN. In its hand, the skeleton clutches
        the famous GOLDEN HOOPED ROD, a glorious, elaborate STAFF. An ancient
        inscription is ETCHED IN STONE over the tomb. Pointing to the
        inscription, Clare TURNS to Scraggy.

                                        CLARE
                        What does it say?...

                                        SCRAGGY
                                (translating)
                        "Our Lord... Our Master... Sun...
                        Wu... Kung"

        THE SOUND TRACK MUSIC RISES. It is the tomb of the STONE MONKEY KING.
        Clare exchanges an AWE INSPIRED glance with Betsy, then looks to the
        still body of Indiana.

                                        CLARE
                        Damn you, Jones! Why couldn't you be
                        here to share this with me!

        The pygmies begin to LOWER the dead bodies, including Indiana and
        Bohbala, into the ground. Tyki reads from ANCIENT SCRIPTURE. Scraggy
        SOBS on the shoulder of Kezure, who continues to stare in ASTONISHMENT
        at the peach trees.

        Suddenly, there is a RUMBLING SOUND. Followed by a slight, TREMOR. The
        trees begin to SWAY, as a HOWLING WIND rushes through them. The tomb
        of Sun Wu Kung GLOWS with a BRIGHT LIGHT. The glass surrounding the
        tomb suddenly SHATTERS. The skeleton's head TURNS. Its body RATTLES.
        Beginning to MOVE. The skeleton STEPS OUT OF THE TOMB.

        Everyone STARES in awe. TERRIFIED.

        The skeleton takes a FEW STEPS forward, STOPS, and RAISES its arms.
        HIGH in the air. The skeleton OPENS its mouth. Emitting a HIGH PITCHED
        ...UNEARTHLY...SCREECH! An ectoplasmic GREEN SMOKE seeps from the
        skeleton's fingers, slowly TRAVELING over the heads of the humans. The
        ectoplasm separates into several INDIVIDUAL LINES, that touch down
        upon EACH OF THE GORILLAS. The ectoplasm ENCIRCLES each the Gorilla's
        bodies. The Gorillas begin to RISE from the ground. HIGH in the air.
        The ectoplasm appears to be CARRYING them toward Sun Wu Kung. As the
        Gorillas TRAVEL through the air, their bodies begin to SHRINK. Growing
        SMALLER. THINNER.

        The humans stare into the SKY. Watching the AMAZING, MAGICAL
        TRANSFORMATION.

        As the Gorillas get CLOSER to Sun Wu Kung, their bodies have shrunken
        to TINY, HAIR-LIKE substances. When the Gorillas ARRIVE at the
        skeleton, they ATTACH themselves to his body. We see that the shrunken
        Gorillas are actually individual HAIRS on the skeleton's body. As the
        countless hairs CONVERGE, the skeleton begins to take SHAPE...FORM...

        SUN WU KUNG COMES TO LIFE! He is UNLIKE anyone or anything we have
        ever seen. HALF-HUMAN. HALF-HONKEY. His face is covered with WRINKLES.
        His wide eyes are COAL BLACK. PROBING. WARM. When he smiles, it is
        DEVILISH, but incredibly CHARMING. His movements are PERKY. QUICK. An
        extremely ADORABLE little fellow. Instantly LOVABLE. But there is a
        STRONG, POWERFUL presense about him. He is indeed, a HEAVENLY FIGURE.

        Sun Wu Kung LOOKS over the congregation. Everyone FALLS to their
        knees. Clare, Betsy, Scraggy and a RELUCTANT Kezure do the same.

        Sun Wu Kung PACES through the clearing. He LOOKS into the many graves.
        He is DISTRESSED. TROUBLED. His wrinkled face twists into FURIOUS
        expression. He RAISES his golden hooped rod to the sky. He SCREAMS.
        His old voice CREAKS and GROANS.

                                        SUN WU KUNG
                        We cannot bury these men!... This is
                        a garden of life... Not of death!...

        Betsy WHISPERS to Clare.

                                        BETSY
                        Why's he speakin' in English?

                                        CLARE
                        He is a heavenly being. According to
                        legend, when a heavenly being
                        speaks, men of all countries can
                        understand him. We hear him in
                        English...the pygmies hear him in
                        their language.

        Betsy NODS. Sun Wu Kung CONTINUES his heartfelt scream into the
        heavens.

                                        SUN WU KUNG
                        Return their souls!... I demand
                        it!... Return their souls!

        A few MOMENTS pass. Then...a thick, white cloud ECLIPSES the sun. A
        small hole in the cloud, allows one RAY OF SUNLIGHT to shine through.
        The ray shines down upon ONE PARTICULAR PEACH TREE. Sun Wu Kung TURNS
        to that peach tree. He raises the GOLDEN HOOPED ROD toward the tree.
        He begins to SING an unusual hymn. Suddenly, several peaches magically
        FLY from the trees. They congregate ABOVE the golden hooped rod. The
        peaches SPIN in midair. With quick movements of the rod, Sun Wu Kung
        SENDS several peaches flying OFF SCREEN.

        CAMERA FOLLOWS the magical peaches as they SEPARATE and FLY INTO EACH
        GRAVE. Toward the BODIES OF THE DEAD PYGMIES. Each body is HIT with an
        individual peach. When the peaches MAKE CONTACT with the dead bodies,
        there is a small, colorful EXPLOSION. A small FIREWORKS display. The
        bodies erupt with a BRIGHT GOLDEN GLOW. A few moments PASS. One of the
        bodies STIRS. MOVES. The body SITS UP. Gets to its FEET. ANOTHER BODY
        does the same. So does ANOTHER. And ANOTHER. Soon, the various pygmies
        CLIMB out of the graves. Their wounds have DISAPPEARED. Their life has
        been RESTORED.

        Sun Wu Kung flings the remaining TWO PEACHES into the GRAVES of
        Indiana and Bohbala. There is a small EXPLOSION...followed by the WARM
        GLOW of their bodies. The wound in Indy's chest VANISHES. His eyes POP
        OPEN. To the delight of his friends, Indy STANDS. ALIVE. He is
        PUZZLLED by the surrounding grave. Clare, Scraggy and Betsy HELP
        Indiana OUT of the grave. They SHOWER him with EMBRACES and KISSES.
        But Indy remains CONFUSED. PUZZLED.

                                        INDIANA
                        What the hell's goin' on?

        Sun Wu Kung, looking very PLEASED with himself, stands BEHIND Indiana.
        Clare SMILES at Indy.

                                        CLARE
                        I think there is someone you should
                        meet...

        Clare POINTS to behind Indy, who TURNS and sees the smiling SUN WU
        KUNG. Indy is at first SHOCKED... His face breaks into a CHILDLIKE
        SMILE...filled with DELIGHT. He then manages to UTTER...

                                        INDIANA
                        You... You're... Sun Wu Kung?...

        Sun Wu Kung STEPS FORWARD. He nods and ANSWERS.

                                        SUN WU KUNG
                        You are... Indiana Jones?...

                                        INDIANA
                                (taken aback)
                        Huh?... You know me?

                                        SUN WU KUNG
                                (nods)
                        I have watched you for many, many
                        years...from the heavens. I was
                        fascinated by your bravery...your
                        passion...in searching for me.

                                        INDIANA
                        Well, I... Thanks I'm very honored.

                                        SUN WU KUNG
                        The honor is mine, Doctor Jones. You
                        and your friends have saved my city
                        from ruin.
                                (a pause)
                        I would like to return the favor.

        Sun Wu Kung gives Indiana the GOLDEN HOOPED ROD. Indiana takes the
        PRICELESS ARTIFACT. He STARES at the beautiful rod. He is very MOVED.
        SPEECHLESS. Sun Wu Kung EXPLAINS. RAISES an eyebrow.

                                        SUN WU KUNG
                        The Golden Hooped Rod will be a
                        faithful friend. It is capable of
                        one hundred transformations...and
                        will always remain by your side.

        Indy manages a NOD. Sun Wu Kung SIGHS.

                                        SUN WU KUNG
                        I will explore the heavens for
                        another. Surely, my search will be
                        shorter and less hazardous than
                        yours!

        Indiana SMILES.

        Meanwhile, Kezure uses the oppurtunity to SNEAK AWAY. He DISAPPEARS
        into a cluster of PEACH TREES. He CLIMBS the smallest tree. The GREEDY
        Pirate King begins to PICK several peaches. HIDING them in his
        pockets.

        Sun Wu Kung LOOKS OVER the healthy, restored community of pygmies. The
        Monkey King SMILES.

                                        SUN WU KUNG
                        With my city alive again...I will be
                        able to return to the heavens.
                                (warm smile to Indy and
                                the others)
                        Goodbye...my dear friends.

        Sun Wu Kung again RAISES his arms. Green ECOTPLASM again emanates from
        his fingers. The individual strands of HAIR fly from his body. In a
        reversal of what we saw only moments ago, the strands of hair FLY
        through the air. They grow LARGER...LARGER...until they resume the
        shape of the GORILLAS.

        Sun Wu Kung has RETURNED to his skeletal form. He TURNS and WALKS back
        to his resting place. The pieces of broken glass RE-ASSEMBLE. SEALING
        the tomb.

        Kezure, his pockets STUFFED with peaches, hurriedly REJOINS the
        others. Tyki EMBRACES Bohbala, glad to have his Father ALIVE. Bohbala,
        resuming his position as Ruler, LEADS HIS PEOPLE out of the garden.
        Indiana, CLUTCHING his golden hooped prize, EXITS with the others.

                                                                        CUT TO:

        EXT. CITY GATES - THE FOLLOWING MORNING

        Indiana, Clare, Betsy, Scraggy, Kezure, the Pirates and Crew members,
        have GATHERED outside of the city walls for the journey home. They are
        saying "Goodbye" to TYKI, BOHBALA And the other PYGMIES.

        Clare and Tyki exchange a TEARFUL FAREWELL, communicating in hand
        signals. They share a final EMBRACE. Bohbala again THANKS Indiana for
        his help. Betsy says "Goodbye" to the many GORILLAS. Betsy
        COMMUNICATES in Gorilla hand motions and growls.

        Indiana, holding the Golden Hooped Rod, TURNS and moves across the
        drawbridge. The others FOLLOW. The entire city of pygmies and Gorillas
        CHEER for their departing friends. Indy and the others DISAPPEAR into
        the clouds, walking down the MOUNTAIN PATH. The Lost city GLISTENS in
        the background. The drawbridge CLOSES...until the next visitor
        ARRIVES.

                                                                        DISSOLVE T0:

        EXT. MOUNTAIN PATH - A FEW HOURS LATER

        Early AFTERNOON. The sun is HOT. SCORCHING. Indy and his party REST.
        They NAP in a shady section of the path. CAMERA PANS THE SNOOZING
        BODIES of everyone, coming to a STOP at Indiana. The Golden Hooped Rod
        RESTS beside Indy. A HAND COMES INTO FRAME and GRABS the staff. OTHER
        HANDS MOVE INTO FRAME. They STEAL Indy's WHIP and REVOLVER. They TAKE
        all weapons from Scraggy and his crew members.

        Indiana is awakened by a SWORD. At his THROAT. Indy REACHES for his
        gun and whip...GONE. He LOOKS UP. KEZURE stands over him, holding the
        sword in one hand, the GOLDEN ROD in another. Indy TURNS. The other
        Pirates hold SWORDS and DAGGERS at the throats of Clare, Betsy,
        Scraggy and the crew members. Kezure TWIRLS the golden hooped rod in
        front of him. He SMILES at Indiana.

                                        KEZURE
                        She is a wonderful treasure...
                        Eh?...

                                        INDIANA
                        We had a deal.

                                        KEZURE
                                (moves sword closer to
                                Indy's throat)
                        I have no deals with dead men.

                                        INDIANA
                        Son of a bitch.

        Kezure LAUGHS. He has REMOVED a peach from his pocket. He SHINES the
        peach on his cloak, and gives a SHRUG to Indiana.

                                        KEZURE
                                (shrugs, laughs)
                        I am an old Pirate, Doctor Jones. Do
                        you suddenly expect me to treat you
                        with kindness and fairness?... It is
                        not my way of life!

        Indy is DISGUSTED. Kezure TAKES A LARGE BITE from the peach. As he
        chews and swallows, Kezure NODS to his men, motioning toward Indy and
        the others.

                                        KEZURE
                        Kill them...
                                (takes another bite of
                                the peach)
                        But save their hair. I will make a
                        coat out of it.

        The men MOVE to kill Scraggy, Betsy, Clare and the crew members.
        Suddenly, Kezure emits a LOUD SCREAM. He GRABS his stomach in pain. He
        FALLS to his knees. The HALF EATEN PEACH rolls from his hand. Onto the
        GROUND.

        Indy and Clare RUSH TOWARD Kezure. Something very STRANGE is happening
        to the Pirate King... His hair begins to FALL OUT. His teeth ROT. His
        skin SHRIVELS. His body becomes THINNER. SPINDLY. Kezure has begun to
        RAPIDLY AGE. He continues to SCREAM. In horrible PAIN.

        The Pirates STEP AWAY. FRIGHTENED. The others WATCH IN HORROR.

        Kezure's body CONTORTS. His skin WITHERS... FLAKES... It begins to
        PEEL from his bones. His screams FADE... His eyeballs ROLL OUT of
        their sockets. Only his skeleton REMAINS. It turns BLACK and CRUMBLES
        TO DUST. Only his elaborate clothing REMAINS. The many stolen peaches
        ROLL OUT of his cloak, onto the ground.

        The remaining Pirates DROP THEIR WEAPONS. They RUN OFF down the
        mountain. SCARED to death!

        Indiana HOLDS the half eaten peach in his hand. Betsy is PUZZLED.

                                        BETSY
                        I thought the peaches promised
                        immortality...eternal youth?...

                                        INDIANA
                        The garden of immortal peaches
                        promises life only to those who are
                        pure in heart.
                                (pause)
                        Kezure was evil. His heart was
                        filled with greed.

        Indiana DROPS the peach to the ground. He grabs his WHIP, REVOLVER and
        GOLDEN HOOPED ROD. Scraggy and his crew members RETRIEVE their
        weapons. Everyone TURNS, CONTINUING down the mountain path. LEAVING
        Kezure's clothes and the several peaches behind.

                                                                        CUT TO:

        EXT. MOZAMBIQUE - DOCK - A FEW DAYS LATER

        Passengers board a large OCEAN LINER, bound for the United States.
        INDIANA JONES is here. Bags PACKED. He holds a rectangular wooden
        crate, covered with the words "FRAGILE". The Golden Hooped Rod is
        obviously STORED inside. Indy is WAITING for someone. He impatiently
        CHECKS his wristwach. LOOKING around. He GRUMBLES to himself.

                                        INDIANA
                        Where's Betsy?... The boat leaves in
                        five minutes...

        Suddenly, a HORN interrupts. Indy turns to the DIRECTION OF THE SOUND.
        It is SCRAGGY. He is wearing DRIVING GOGGLES. He rides a battered,
        bruised MOTORCYCLE, attached to a ricketty SIDECAR. The word "TAXI" is
        painted on the sidecar's exterior. Scraggy PULLS UP beside Indiana.
        Scraggy JUMPS OFF the motorcycle. Excitedly, he RUNS toward Indy.

                                        SCRAGGY
                        Oh, Indy! Indy! I want to give you
                        something for your journey!

        Scraggy FUMBLES through his pockets. He removes a small bottle of
        PURPLE LIQUID. He HOLDS it out to Indy.

                                        SCRAGGY
                        Take one drink before bed. It keep
                        out all bad spirits.

        Indy DECLINES. He flashes a FLASK OF WHISKEY from inside of his coat
        pocket.

                                        INDIANA
                        Thanks, Scraggy...

        But this'll keep out all the bad spirits. Scraggy SHRUGS. They are
        suddenly INTERRUPTED.

                                        BETSY (O.S.)
                        Indy!...

        Indiana TURNS. BETSY and CLARE walk toward him. Indy LOOKS at Betsy.
        PUZZLED.

                                        INDIANA
                        Where're your bags?

                                        BETSY
                        I'm not leaving.

                                        INDIANA
                        Huh?... But, you... You have to
                        finish school.

                                        BETSY
                        I'm staying on as Clare's assistant.

        Indy shoots a JEALOUS GLANCE to Clare, then back to Betsy.

                                        INDIANA
                        But you're MY assistant.

                                        BETSY
                        Not any more. I'm having my credits
                        transfered.

                                        INDIANA
                        Why?...

                                        BETSY
                        Clare is a brilliant teacher.

                                        INDIANA
                                (jealous)
                        So am I.

                                        CLARE
                        Yes, but I don't offer a course in
                        seduction.

                                        INDIANA
                        You stay out of this.

                                        BETSY
                        Indy... I thought you wanted me out
                        of your life...

                                        INDIANA
                        That was before I realized how
                        gifted...how talented you are... I
                        mean... I could really use you...

                                        CLARE
                        Especially aboard ship for three
                        weeks. It gets terribly lonely.

                                        INDIANA
                        I warned you...

                                        BETSY
                        Indy, I've learned a lot from you.
                        But it's time I started
                        concentrating on a career in
                        anthropology...instead of romance.

                                        INDIANA
                                (sighs, to Betsy)
                        You've certainly developed a mature
                        attitude.

                                        BETSY
                                (hugs him)
                        Thanks to you.
                                (pauses, looking into
                                Indy's eyes)
                        You know... I always thought of you
                        as my knight in shining armor...

                                        INDIANA
                                (flattered)
                        Really?

                                        BETSY
                        But now, I'll think of you as the
                        Father I never had.

                                        INDIANA
                                (rolls his eyes)
                        Terrific.

        Clare WALKS up to him. She EXTENDS her hand.

                                        CLARE
                        Doctor Jones...although your libido
                        is questionable, your bravery and
                        intelligence are exceptional.
                                (a smile)
                        It has been an honor working with
                        you.

                                        INDIANA
                                (taken aback)
                        Why... Thanks.

        Indy LEANS toward Clare, as if he is going to KISS HER. He RAISES an
        eyebrow. SPEAKING in his smoothest...most suave...

                                        INDIANA
                        You know, Clare...there's
                        something...

                                        CLARE
                        Yes...

                                        INDIANA
                                (moving closer)
                        ...something I've been wanting to
                        do...

                                        CLARE
                        Yes...

                                        INDIANA
                                (closer)
                        ...since we first met...

        LEANING forward, Indy closes his eyes to KISS Clare. But Clare MOVES
        AWAY. BONZO THE GORILLA enters the FRAME. BONZO KISSES Indy on the
        lips. Indy OPENS his eyes. He tries to MOVE AWAY. But the Gorilla will
        not move, WRAPPING HER ARMS around Indy. The Gorilla WRESTLES Indy to
        the ground.

        By using Gorilla HAND MOTIONS and GRUNTS, Clare manages to persuade
        BONZO to MOVE AWAY from Indiana. Indy WIPES his mouth. Clare, Betsy
        and Scraggy are LAUGHING. Betsy EXPLAINS to Clare.

                                        BETSY
                        Sorry. Guess I left her cage open...
                        she followed us.

        The ocean liner's horn SOUNDS! It begins to DRIFT away from the dock.
        Indiana TURNS and RUNS up the stairs, leading to the boat. The boat is
        a FEW FEET from the dock. Indy LEAPS onto the boat. He MAKES IT. JUST
        IN TIME.

        Indiana pauses... Suddenly UPSET. He realizes that he's FORGOTTEN the
        Golden Hooped Rod! It SITS on the dock. At Scraggy's FEET. As the
        Ocean Liner PULLS AWAY, Indy is about to SCREAM to his friends... But
        Clare PICKS UP the crate. She SHRUGS to Indy. The ocean liner pulls
        FURTHER...FURTHER...from the dock. Indiana is HELPLESS. He CAN'T GO
        BACK.

                                                                        DISSOLVE TO:

        INT. CLARE'S ROOM - THAT EVENING

        Clare is SOUND ASLEEP in bed. CAMERA PANS TO a corner of the room. The
        wooden crate holding the Golden Hooped Rod RESTS here. Suddenly, the
        box's NAILS begin to TWIST. TURN. As if they were being turned by
        INVISIBLE HANDS. They FALL OUT of the box. DROPPING to the floor. ONE
        by ONE. The box SLOWLY OPENS. The Golden Hooped Rod SHIKMERS in the
        moonlight. Suddenly, the staff begins to MOVE. TWISTING. SHRINKING. It
        CHANGES SHAPE...turning into a GOLDEN EAGLE! The bird slowly FLAPS its
        wings and FLIES OUT of the open window. INTO the night. Clare
        continues to peacefully SLEEP.

                                                                        CUT TO:

        EXT. OCEAN - NIGHT

        The full moon ILLUMINATES the night sky. SHIMMERING across the ocean
        waters. Countless BRIGHT STARS sparkle in the night sky. Indy's OCEAN
        LINER sails across the water. The image of an EAGLE appears in the
        night sky. SILHOUETTED against the moon.

        INT. SHIP CABIN

        Indiana Jones is SOUND ASLEEP in his bed. The room's porthole
        mysteriously SWINGS OPEN. The Golden Eagle FLIES inside. The eagle
        TRANSFORMS back into the Golden Hooped Rod. The rod LEANS AGAINST the
        wall. The moonlight REFLECTS the rod, SHINING into Indiana's eyes.
        Indy WAKES. He SITS UP and sees the Golden Hooped Rod. At first, he is
        SHOCKED. He TOUCHES the rod...then comes upon a REALIZATION. The
        CREAKY VOICE of Sun Wu Kung FILLS the SOUNDTRACK.

                                        SUN WU KUNG (V.O.)
                        The Golden Hooped Rod will be a
                        faithful friend. It is capable of
                        one hundred transformations...and
                        will always remain by your side.

        Indy STANDS. He turns and LOOKS out of the porthole. A DREAMY...
        SATISFIED smile covers Indy's face, as he stares at the stars ABOVE.
        SOUND TRACK MUSIC SOARS. CAMERA PULLS BACK, TO EXTREMELY LONG SHOT of
        the ship SAILING across the ocean.

                                        THE END
